1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:06,920
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,854
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:13,806
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,626
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,055
The bathroom is bigger than my house.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,724
This is cool.

7
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:25,767
What?

8
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,703
- Don't look.
- I won't.

9
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:49,582
You really can't.

10
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,584
I won't, even if you beg me.

11
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,002
What do you take me for?

12
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,649
EPISODE 2

13
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,115
You need to come out.

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,287
I'm sorry but can you please just go?

15
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:29,873
I need my phone.

16
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:32,292
I'll bring it to you.

17
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,043
Open up. I'm busy.

18
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,547
I'm coming in.

19
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,233
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,324
I'm so sorry.

21
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,625
You know me, right?

22
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,419
We've met before, haven't we?

23
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,215
No, I've never seen you.

24
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,091
I'm so sorry.

25
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,676
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,178
This is my room…

27
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,475
Let's speak for a moment.

28
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,144
What's with him? Why is he following me?

29
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:34,479
Stop right there.

30
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,068
Can't you hear me?

31
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:45,949
May I help you, sir?

32
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,867
It's you, right?

33
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,577
The treadmill.

34
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,162
Sorry? The treadmill?

35
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:52,705
You suddenly called me a pervert.

36
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,624
Don't you remember?

37
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,750
A pervert?

38
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:01,881
What a pervert.

39
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,716
Hey--

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,551
If you ever do this again,

41
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,220
I'm going to kill you.

42
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:09,347
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Pervert.

43
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,226
That tiger T-shirt?

44
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,310
Yes.

45
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,312
- Do you finally remember?
- Yes.

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,897
I knew it.

47
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,358
You were staring like a pervert
without turning away.

48
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,527
Aren't you the pervert

49
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,779
for turning the window transparent
while on the toilet?

50
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:28,032
Nothing I do can top you.

51
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:31,286
Apologize.

52
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,830
For both today and that day.

53
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,794
I'm truly sorry for today.

54
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:42,547
However, you were the one at fault
back on that day.

55
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,133
I believe you're the one
who owes me an apology.

56
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:46,217
Why me?

57
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:49,721
If you don't know
why you should apologize,

58
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:51,055
there's no need to go on.

59
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,266
Please excuse me.

60
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,018
Enjoy your stay, sir.

61
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:05,278
Excuse me.

62
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:07,155
Hey!

63
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,368
I wasn't done talking.

64
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,455
I'm sorry, but I have nothing more to say.

65
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,373
And both back then and now,

66
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,542
I don't even have
the fanciest interest in you,

67
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,752
so stop following me.

68
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,587
There's no talking to you.

69
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,422
Nothing you can do will get to me.

70
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,174
Okay.

71
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:29,510
I don't need to show courtesy
to someone who behaves like this.

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,387
This is a warning.

73
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,223
Don't ever let me see you again.

74
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,854
Yes, sir.
That is also precisely what I want.

75
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,731
And stop smiling.

76
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:46,235
All staff of King Hotel serve our guests
with sincere, bright smiles.

77
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,862
If my smile is displeasing to you,

78
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:50,031
please consider staying at another hotel.

79
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:51,115
Excuse me.

80
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,079
Guest first.

81
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,339
That perverted jerk.

82
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:14,388
And it's not "fanciest," but "faintest."

83
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,099
Sorry?

84
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,185
It's not "I don't have
the fanciest interest in you."

85
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,604
It's "I don't have
the faintest interest in you."

86
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,606
That's the correct expression.

87
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,149
In case people make fun of you.

88
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,948
That's one condescending jerk.

89
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:33,783
RESUME
NAME: GU WON

90
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,202
I asked for a resume
and you really brought one.

91
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,496
You must really want to work here.

92
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:39,831
Rules are rules.

93
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:40,957
And your family register?

94
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,251
Come on, we're family.

95
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,710
Rules are rules.

96
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:47,964
If that's too troublesome,
don't work here.

97
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,050
Why go through all this when
you don't even care about the business?

98
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:54,679
I'll submit it.

99
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:56,472
This is fun.

100
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,893
I'll need two copies
of the family register.

101
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,982
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

102
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,276
Thirty minutes.

103
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:13,906
Hello.

104
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:15,908
We meet again.

105
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:19,412
I'm hosting the inaugural ceremony today.

106
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,538
Really?

107
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,291
I dread standing before a crowd,

108
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,544
but my higher-ups say it has to be me.

109
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,296
I understand.

110
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,132
Life can be tiring when you're in demand.

111
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:34,760
- Do you want to have dinner after?
- I'd love to!

112
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,930
- Is that all right?
- Absolutely. I'd love to.

113
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,850
Then I'll meet you tonight for dinner.

114
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,060
Okay, sure.

115
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:45,563
Good luck at the ceremony.

116
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,106
Thank you.

117
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,445
See? It worked.

118
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,572
Great job, Sang-sik. Good one.

119
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,660
- Where are you going?
- To get my family register.

120
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:02,663
Ask the staff to run your errands.
Let's go. Everyone is waiting.

121
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:04,248
For who? Me?

122
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,834
- Why?
- The inaugural ceremony.

123
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,587
After the ceremony,
you have a celebratory dinner

124
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,172
with the board and the VIPs.

125
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,590
No, I'm not going.

126
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,468
The chairman gave
a direct order to the PR team.

127
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:21,641
Why are you so nervous?

128
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,893
The rest of your life
will be like a party.

129
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:25,686
Let's go.

130
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,696
Hello.

131
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,033
I'm Manager Kim Su-mi,
here to host today's ceremony.

132
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,536
Let us begin the inaugural ceremony

133
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:44,163
to welcome the new head manager
of King Hotel.

134
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,874
Please welcome Head Manager Gu Won
with a big round of applause.

135
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:00,304
What's that pervert doing here?

136
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,897
INAUGURAL CEREMONY FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

137
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,277
Continue.

138
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,778
I've never seen…

139
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:17,989
I mean,

140
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,117
Head Manager Gu will share
an inaugural speech.

141
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:23,578
Oh, no.

142
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,938
<i>Don't smile.</i>

143
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:54,400
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

144
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,154
<i>Don't smile.</i>

145
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,450
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

146
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,277
Hello. My name is Gu Won.

147
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,655
I hope to make the best of our time.

148
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,948
- Let's end this.
- Sorry?

149
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:44,533
Yes.

150
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,287
Then let us end the inaugural ceremony.

151
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,998
King Hotel's best talent,
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang,

152
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:53,125
- will welcome the head manager.
- I'm done for.

153
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,460
Bring out the bouquet.

154
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:55,961
Darn it.

155
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:26,826
We…

156
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:28,911
meet again.

157
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,668
Welcome, Head Manager Gu!

158
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:38,671
Really?

159
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,965
Yes, we truly welcome you.

160
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:43,759
- Do you mean it?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:47,388
This is from all of us.

162
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,484
Next week, you'll film a promo video

163
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,945
with the best talent of the year,
our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

164
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,573
The PR team
will send you the script directly.

165
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,325
- That's all?
- That's all.

166
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:20,743
- You may leave.
- Okay.

167
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:23,037
I'll excuse myself as well.

168
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,416
Ms. Best Talent, come here.

169
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,936
I warned you
to never let me see you again.

170
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,438
I'll do my best to avoid you from now on.

171
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,819
- Do you know what hospitality is?
- Yes, I know it very well.

172
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,404
Is avoiding discomfort hospitable?

173
00:11:57,488 --> 00:12:00,115
I'm only meeting your request
to avoid running into you.

174
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:04,870
Anyway,

175
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,288
why am I a pervert?

176
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,792
Not only did you make
awkward moaning sounds

177
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,752
in the gym, which is a public space,

178
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,338
but you also gave me
your room key as a tip

179
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,215
along with a creepy note

180
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:19,218
talking about "my cunning advances"
and "a steamy night together."

181
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:21,929
- Me?
- Back then, I was new.

182
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:23,681
I admit I didn't follow the manual.

183
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:24,598
However,

184
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,934
I do not have a reason
to condone such disrespect

185
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,186
just because I work in hospitality.

186
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:32,022
What are you talking about?
When did I do that?

187
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,692
I've never done anything like that,

188
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:38,779
and you're nowhere near my type,
not even over my dead body.

189
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:42,825
Are you sure I'm him? Are you positive?

190
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,910
You were wearing
a T-shirt with a tiger print.

191
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:45,869
Are you kidding me?

192
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,913
Is everyone who wears that a pervert?

193
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:52,793
I clearly heard that a man
in a tiger print T-shirt gave it to me.

194
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,591
So you're saying

195
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,968
you made an assumption about me

196
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:03,721
just by looking at my T-shirt?

197
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,391
So that wasn't you who did that?

198
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,935
What do you take me for?

199
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,437
Why would I?

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,438
To you, no less?

201
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,690
I told you, didn't I?

202
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,026
Even over my dead body,

203
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,945
you are without a doubt,
absolutely, most definitely

204
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:22,072
not my type.

205
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,452
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,495
You should've told me so.

207
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:29,872
You never gave me a chance.

208
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,294
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:37,671
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,676
Don't smile.

211
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,304
I loathe that fake smile.

212
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,807
I must smile on duty.
Just think of it as part of my uniform.

213
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:49,767
Even so, don't.

214
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,689
- Really?
- If you smile, you're fired.

215
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,404
Thank you.

216
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,950
I wasn't ready to show you
a heartfelt smile.

217
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,452
Thank you for not letting me fake a smile.

218
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:09,495
Also,

219
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,582
I truly apologize
for what I did on that day.

220
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,168
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

221
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:20,798
Take the flowers and leave.

222
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:22,508
Yes, sir.

223
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,772
A pervert?

224
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,697
There's no pervert like me.

225
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,533
Jeez.

226
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:55,207
This way, sir.

227
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:58,085
- Please hang up my coat.
- Of course.

228
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,591
Let me escort you to your seat.

229
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,595
Right over here, sir.

230
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:10,180
Put my suitcase up.

231
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,727
Yes, I'll put it in the overhead bin.

232
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,437
Please enjoy your flight.

233
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:39,835
You might get hurt.

234
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:43,172
Let me handle it.

235
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,176
Hello.

236
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,779
They can just leave the tray as is.

237
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:07,988
Why do people do this?

238
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:09,782
Because they're kind.

239
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:12,409
They think stacking these
will make our lives easier.

240
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,119
That's not kindness. It's excessive.

241
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,038
This is a useless courtesy.

242
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,831
Just accept the gesture.

243
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:20,793
Let's clean up
and get ready for duty-free sales.

244
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:23,712
Ro-un and Eun-ji, clean the restrooms
when the seatbelt sign turns on.

245
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:24,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,510
Who took the coat
from the passenger in 3H?

247
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,428
I did.

248
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,263
It's not in the closet.

249
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:34,431
Where did you leave it?

250
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,141
I threw it out.

251
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:37,684
What?

252
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,394
What are you talking about?

253
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:42,564
He asked me to.

254
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,399
This way, sir.

255
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:46,693
Please hang up my coat.

256
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,612
<i>"Please dump my coat."</i>

257
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:50,614
That's what he said.

258
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,158
Hey!

259
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:06,630
Are you all trying to get me fired?

260
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,465
I told you not to cause trouble!

261
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,758
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:11,510
An apology isn't going to fix this.

263
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,012
He told me to bring it right away!

264
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:15,848
I'll take responsibility.

265
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,100
How dare you say that
when you're a mere rookie?

266
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,769
You aren't in a position to do that.

267
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,398
What will you do now?

268
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,985
What are you all going to do about this?

269
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,406
I'll take responsibility and handle this.

270
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:37,369
Will you?

271
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:39,955
Pyeong-hwa,

272
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:42,791
then make sure it doesn't affect me.

273
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,711
Handle it quietly and efficiently. Okay?

274
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,092
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

275
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:54,344
Forget it. I'll be in the transit lounge,

276
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:56,346
so bring it before my next flight.

277
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,849
If you don't,
I won't let you off for this.

278
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,477
Yes, sir. I'll bring it to you
as soon as possible.

279
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,147
I'm very sorry.

280
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:08,901
I'm sorry. Please help me.

281
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,444
Please help me just this once.

282
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:11,486
I can't.

283
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,655
I'm very behind right now.

284
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,199
I'll pay you twice as much.

285
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,325
It's fine.

286
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:19,119
Three times, four times,
or however much you want.

287
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:21,163
Please help me.

288
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:24,958
Sir, please. I'm begging you.

289
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,678
You'll get hurt if you run like that.

290
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:19,054
Get some rest.

291
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,662
You were a great host
at the ceremony today.

292
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,622
How may I help you?

293
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,708
Do you like snow crab?

294
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,252
How about it for dinner?
I'll be crabby if not.

295
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:51,962
Hey.

296
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,881
Is it fun going around
pretending to be Mr. Gu?

297
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,383
Mr. Gu?

298
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,051
I never said I was him.

299
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,595
I was supposed to eat dinner
with the head manager,

300
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,140
but you're not the head manager.

301
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:05,475
Why should I eat dinner with you?

302
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,061
So you have no business
with the secretary.

303
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,647
Is that what you're saying?

304
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:11,732
Exactly.

305
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:12,733
I totally don't.

306
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,276
You're a total, absolute snob.

307
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,610
I'm like that.

308
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,864
So let's not exchange greetings
ever again.

309
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:22,159
Don't worry.

310
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,202
I don't go anywhere near snobs.

311
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,996
It'll rub off on me.

312
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh, my! It's rubbing off.

313
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,790
What? Rub off on you?

314
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,792
Ms. Sa-rang, you're here. Let's go.

315
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,670
You are to attend
Mr. Gu's welcome dinner as the staff rep.

316
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,838
What? Me?

317
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,465
Wait, why should she go?

318
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,425
I should be the staff representative.

319
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,426
No.

320
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:42,262
A snobby manager
couldn't possibly represent the staff.

321
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:43,472
That's nonsense.

322
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:46,683
The higher-ups do have a discerning eye
when it comes to people.

323
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,185
- What?
- Let's go. We're late.

324
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:49,895
I'll be back.

325
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:51,730
Careful, there's some snobbiness here.

326
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,523
- This way, please.
- Darn it.

327
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:58,904
That crabby-looking man.
Snow crab, my foot.

328
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,410
It's so nice.

329
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:07,037
Is this your first time here?

330
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,039
But you've worked here for so long.

331
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,415
This is King the Land.

332
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,542
Since it's a lounge on the VIP floor,

333
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:14,795
regular staff can't come here
even after 100 years.

334
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,630
And you're finally here.

335
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:18,006
Enjoy the day.

336
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,800
Today, you're a VIP too.

337
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:20,842
Okay.

338
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:13,603
This is fabulous.

339
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,282
You said you'd do your best to avoid me.

340
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,594
Tuna cheek, sir.

341
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:46,595
- Thank you.
- Yes.

342
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:48,096
- Please enjoy.
- Yes.

343
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,729
Was the tuna you caught
500 million won, Chairman Han?

344
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:57,856
500 million?

345
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,482
It was 590 million won.

346
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,484
- Goodness.
- How much was this one?

347
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:02,611
We paid 700 million.

348
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,491
Hwa-ran has such excellent discernment.

349
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:11,620
You'll never see another tuna
as nice as this one.

350
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,663
Do you want to make a bet?

351
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:16,291
What if I find a better tuna than that?

352
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,417
Good grief.

353
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,711
What counts is the heart,
not the price tag.

354
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:23,590
Hwa-ran prepared this to celebrate
her brother's appointment.

355
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:27,761
I always knew you were generous.
Turns out you're kind as well.

356
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,222
Now that he's joined the hotel,

357
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:32,557
he might steal it from you.

358
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:37,312
Will you take charge of King the Land?

359
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,731
It's basically a mandatory course

360
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:42,108
for your business management training.

361
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:44,694
- Stop saying such nonsense.
- What?

362
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:47,656
In a competition,
whoever is better wins it all.

363
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,075
Why would I compete with Won?

364
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:51,701
I should help him.

365
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:53,370
Father, please make a toast.

366
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:54,454
Yes, I will.

367
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:56,915
All right, everyone.

368
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,334
I'd like to thank

369
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:03,588
the chairpersons, executives, and staff
who came here to celebrate

370
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,382
despite your busy schedules.

371
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:08,593
Please show your support
for Head Manager Gu Won

372
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:11,096
in his future endeavors.

373
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,890
Now, let us enjoy.

374
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:15,684
Cheers!

375
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,444
Who are you?

376
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:28,488
Well…

377
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:31,783
I'm Cheon Sa-rang, stationed in the lobby.

378
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:33,743
She's our best talent,

379
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:35,328
here to represent our staff.

380
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:36,538
Really?

381
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:40,333
That must mean you're
the most hospitable staff in our hotel.

382
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,585
Why don't you come out

383
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:43,878
and make a speech for us?

384
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,631
- Me?
- Do you feel uncomfortable?

385
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:49,592
No, sir.

386
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,697
It's a great honor to serve a head manager

387
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,907
of such great character and intellect.

388
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,367
So fake.

389
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:16,077
We truly welcome you.

390
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,581
Enjoy.

391
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,046
I like your outspoken personality.

392
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:27,005
Thank you.

393
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:28,590
Mr. Kim, can you find

394
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:30,592
the most precious part of the tuna

395
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:32,594
and give it to our best talent?

396
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:34,137
Yes, sir.

397
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,723
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

398
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,184
That fake work smile.

399
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:41,394
Won, you should share a word too.

400
00:25:43,104 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm fine.

401
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:46,941
Get up. You're the man of the hour.

402
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,291
Thank you for sparing your precious time.

403
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:19,265
Also,

404
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,726
I'll make King Hotel

405
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:25,563
a place without fake smiles.

406
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,871
How about, "We are the world"?

407
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,124
Cheers.

408
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,502
How amazing.

409
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:50,422
He holds an inaugural ceremony
and a party for his son,

410
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,841
even getting the PR team involved.

411
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:55,176
What's the matter?

412
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:56,511
Are you scared?

413
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,847
Of a boy like you?

414
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:00,932
Let me make this clear.

415
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:03,852
I don't care about management
or taking over the company.

416
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:05,854
So no need to be scared.

417
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:07,397
If you really don't care,

418
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:10,108
why did you bother to finish your MBA?

419
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:12,235
Well, I was good enough to get one.

420
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:15,572
There's no need to hide my competence.

421
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:18,741
Putting it like that
doesn't make you sound cool.

422
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:20,869
I don't care what others think.

423
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:23,496
And I won't work here for long.

424
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:25,039
So…

425
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,542
don't mess with me.

426
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,294
So don't be so cheeky

427
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:31,796
if you want to enjoy this luxury.

428
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:41,556
Here, come meet my children.

429
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:51,858
What's this?

430
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,568
Tuna. A present from the chairman.

431
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:55,737
Thank you.

432
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:58,031
Excuse me.

433
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:02,202
May I be excused?

434
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:03,119
Sure.

435
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:05,330
Should I let the chairman know?

436
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,875
Just go. Nobody cares about you.

437
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:00,969
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

438
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:11,396
Yes, my dear. Are you coming home?

439
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:13,439
I'm not.

440
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,900
Grandma, do you want some tuna?

441
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,527
What? Some pumas?

442
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,488
No, not pumas. Tuna.

443
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:22,532
I'm busy right now.

444
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:24,242
Call me when you come.

445
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:30,248
Gosh, she's always like this.

446
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,792
CONTACTS

447
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,547
Let's have a drink!

448
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:47,473
Hello?

449
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:50,018
The chairman gave me tuna today.
Do you want some?

450
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:51,227
I'm fine. You have it.

451
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,356
It's worth 700 million won,
and he gave me the most expensive part.

452
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,817
I'm in Busan eating tuna right now.

453
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,986
Busan? Why?

454
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,237
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

455
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,989
I came to see a game with the club.

456
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:05,783
I'm going to hang out here for a bit,
then be back by the weekend.

457
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,036
But we were going to Namsan tomorrow.

458
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,454
<i>That was tomorrow?</i>

459
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:13,249
Did I make this plan alone?

460
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,584
<i>This game is important,</i>

461
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,210
so let me off just this once.

462
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:19,047
But let's go next week
to do that lock thing

463
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,381
<i>and whatever else you want.</i>

464
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:22,050
Yu-nam, come here!

465
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,509
I have to go. I'll call you!

466
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:25,762
All right.

467
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:26,804
Hello?

468
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:55,124
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:00,880
It's the head!

470
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:03,549
It's tuna.

471
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,510
I'm sorry.

472
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:07,512
He gave me the head.

473
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,893
What do I do?

474
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:30,660
We made eye contact again!

475
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:31,828
I'm done. You do it.

476
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:33,079
- I can't.
- What now?

477
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:34,330
Look at its eye.

478
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,082
It's looking straight at me.

479
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,293
Hi, guys.

480
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,088
What's going on?

481
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:45,258
What's happening?

482
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:46,426
Da-eul.

483
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:52,140
Gosh, it's tuna!

484
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:06,654
It melts in my mouth.

485
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,574
Da-eul, is there anything you can't do?

486
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:10,658
Tell me about it.

487
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:13,327
Look, she's so good
at making side dishes too.

488
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:15,913
You'll see when you have children.
Mothers are amazing.

489
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:19,042
Why would you eat
raw instant noodles over this?

490
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,585
I hate mushy stuff.

491
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,588
Still, try one. If it's from the chairman,
it must be expensive.

492
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:26,424
It was 700 million won.

493
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:28,301
700 million?

494
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:29,677
Hey, spit it out.

495
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,304
- Why?
- Hey.

496
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:33,556
Most tunas are about five heads long,

497
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:35,516
so the head alone is worth 140 million.

498
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,893
That's worth more than our heads.

499
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:38,394
- Let's sell this.
- Yes, let's.

500
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,313
Hey.

501
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:42,565
Do we know anyone
who'd pay that much for tuna?

502
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:44,192
No.

503
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,027
You could buy a house with that money.

504
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,278
Right, so just eat.

505
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,821
When else would we be able to eat this?

506
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:51,532
If the head is 140 million won,

507
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,286
one piece costs 2.4 million won.

508
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:58,664
And now, 4.8 million.

509
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:01,250
People who gulp these down
must live a happy life.

510
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:03,294
I'm sure.

511
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,421
They must be happy.

512
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,424
- This is crazy.
- That's 12 million.

513
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:10,301
- Okay, let's do it.
- Is it good?

514
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:11,427
Totally.

515
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:16,432
Goodness.

516
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,979
Come sleep at home today.

517
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:24,524
- The hotel is more convenient.
- Come home.

518
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:26,818
Let's have another drink at home.

519
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:40,039
Are you coming home?

520
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:41,749
He told me to, so I should go.

521
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,751
You should live your life as you please.

522
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:47,296
Don't set your foot on rough terrain.

523
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,615
Are you getting in?

524
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,367
The chairman wants you at home.

525
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:18,161
How impudent.

526
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:20,538
You need to open the door for me.

527
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:27,503
You know,

528
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:30,756
people are quick
to catch onto bad behaviors.

529
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,886
Please get in, sir.

530
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:39,599
This is it.

531
00:34:39,682 --> 00:34:40,933
It won't open any further.

532
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:43,895
Go home.

533
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:45,062
What? I can't go home.

534
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:46,939
The chairman told me to bring you home.

535
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:49,108
I can't. Mr. Gu!

536
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,796
HOTEL CONCIERGE CHEON SA-RANG

537
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:17,887
HOTEL CONCIERGE JOB FAIR

538
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:38,241
Sa-rang, what are you drawing?

539
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:40,993
When we played at the beach, Mommy.

540
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:56,592
- Then what's this?
- A hotel.

541
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,927
- A hotel?
- Yes.

542
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,221
- It's a pink hotel.
- Yes.

543
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,935
Mommy, when I grow up,
I'm going to work at a hotel.

544
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,521
- Really?
- Yes.

545
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:10,064
- Mommy.
- Yes?

546
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,065
I love you.

547
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:45,391
HOTEL CONCIERGE CHEON SA-RANG

548
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,693
PREPARING FOR OPENING

549
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:47,328
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

550
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:49,705
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

551
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,416
<i>- Congratulations on your promotion
- Congratulations on your promotion</i>

552
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,170
What's all this? Thank you.

553
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:57,713
Congrats on your promotion, Ms. Gang.

554
00:37:58,255 --> 00:37:59,673
It's an honor, Ms. Gang.

555
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:01,467
Just call me Da-eul.

556
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,219
It's weird to hear you call me Ms. Gang.

557
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:05,471
Thank you.

558
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:09,100
It's great to have you as our manager.

559
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,311
Finally, spring is here for us.

560
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:13,562
Spring.

561
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:18,734
Then let me share a word
as the new manager.

562
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:21,946
From now on, let's each get our own lunch.

563
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:22,863
Okay?

564
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:28,661
And this will be the last day
our junior member prepares snacks for us.

565
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:29,703
What?

566
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:32,790
I understand lunch,
but isn't that going too far?

567
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,959
It's our tradition.

568
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:38,504
If you abolish it now, what will become
of everyone who's upheld it thus far?

569
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:41,715
Do you really think this tradition
is good enough to pass on?

570
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:43,259
No.

571
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:44,343
- No.
- No.

572
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:48,180
We didn't get a job here to serve someone.

573
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:51,225
Let's not fight over a weird tradition
that was made in the past.

574
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:52,351
Okay?

575
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:54,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

576
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:55,688
Thank you.

577
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:58,774
Let's eat up and get ready to open.

578
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:03,571
They look great on you.

579
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,114
Take them off. They're awful.

580
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,368
Let's go. It's almost time.

581
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:10,995
They look fine.

582
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:13,914
Sir, those look great on you.

583
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:15,166
You're like Brad Pitt.

584
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:19,044
I wouldn't go that far.

585
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:22,047
Brad Pitt, my foot.

586
00:39:22,131 --> 00:39:24,341
Hey, take them off. You look like a fly.

587
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,385
Goodness, a fly?

588
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:29,054
Your friend must be jealous
that you look so good.

589
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:32,016
- Me?
- And flies are wonderful, aren't they?

590
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,978
They gleam in rainbow hues
and fly around freely through the sky.

591
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:37,813
Isn't that cool?

592
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:41,567
The moment you walk out with those,
everyone will fall for you.

593
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,860
- Really?
- Hey.

594
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,238
Don't make any impulse buys today
and just go.

595
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:48,365
We have a lot of time before our flight.

596
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:49,408
Right?

597
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:53,704
Sir, these sunglasses are limited edition
and only sold in Korea.

598
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:56,707
Our stocks are low,
so you may not find them next time.

599
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,628
These look like they were
specially made for you.

600
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:02,588
I'm afraid you may regret it later.

601
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:05,424
I'll take them.

602
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:07,468
Let me ring you up. This way, please.

603
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:08,552
Thank you.

604
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,770
Thank you, sir. Please come again.

605
00:40:25,528 --> 00:40:26,862
Hey, when did you get here?

606
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:29,406
"Oh, my, sir. You're like Brad Pitt."

607
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,658
Nonsense.

608
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,993
Hey, it makes total sense.

609
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:35,996
If he'll increase our sales,
he's better than Brad Pitt.

610
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,915
Just stopping by? Or are you shopping?

611
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:40,334
I'm not here to shop,

612
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:44,672
but is there something I can give
as a token of gratitude?

613
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:50,094
Are you sure it's a token of gratitude
and not a gift for a guy you're into?

614
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:52,763
- Forget it. I'm leaving.
- Oh, my.

615
00:40:52,846 --> 00:40:54,848
You can come in as you like,

616
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:57,893
but you can't leave empty-handed.
Buy something.

617
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,478
No, maybe next time.

618
00:40:59,562 --> 00:41:02,523
Please, take a look at our scarves.

619
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:05,651
These are wonderful products
recommended by the national mom.

620
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,783
You have a reservation for a deluxe room

621
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:14,868
- with a city view, right?
- Yes, that's right.

622
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:17,871
Please upgrade the room to a suite.

623
00:41:18,872 --> 00:41:20,249
Shall I cancel the deluxe room

624
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:22,501
and change the reservation to a suite?

625
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:23,586
That's not it.

626
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:25,713
The national mom, Ms. Mo Seong-ae,

627
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,173
is willing to stay here tonight,

628
00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:30,801
so just upgrade the room to a suite.

629
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,344
I'm sorry, sir.

630
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:34,972
Our rules do not allow
an upgrade to a suite.

631
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,390
Move aside.

632
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:39,935
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, hello.

633
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,396
I'll post a review
on social media as a favor.

634
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,522
So get me a suite.

635
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:45,941
Thank you for your special concern.

636
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:49,653
However, our rules do not allow us
to assist you in that way.

637
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,323
If you enjoy wine,
may I offer you a pass for our lounge,

638
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:55,826
where we serve simple snacks
along with wine, cocktails, and beer?

639
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:59,955
Do you know how many followers I have?

640
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,499
One word from me,
and you'll have to shut down.

641
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,002
I'm so sorry.

642
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,755
You really don't get it, do you?

643
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:09,298
Get your manager.

644
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:11,175
I want the desk manager!

645
00:42:12,926 --> 00:42:15,638
Our manager is not here at the moment.

646
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:17,473
What's with these interview questions?

647
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:20,351
- What do you mean?
- Look, they're so juvenile.

648
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,519
I didn't come up with them.

649
00:42:22,603 --> 00:42:24,104
Tell them to redo it.

650
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:27,399
Just go along with it.
Why are you pretending to work?

651
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:28,609
It's unlike you.

652
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,277
I might as well do a good job.

653
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,322
Tell them to give me some real questions.

654
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:34,948
Yes, sir.

655
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:37,701
If your manager isn't here,
bring someone else in charge!

656
00:42:37,785 --> 00:42:40,204
It's not like I'm asking for much.

657
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:41,955
I just want to talk to the manager.

658
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,457
Who are you to stop me?

659
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,542
- That's Mo Seong-ae.
- The manager isn't here.

660
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,378
I'm in charge of check-ins.

661
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:48,671
Feel free to talk to me.

662
00:42:48,754 --> 00:42:50,130
Are you a parrot?

663
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:52,883
You're repeating the same words
over and over again!

664
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:55,010
What's going on?

665
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:58,263
- Nothing, sir.
- Doesn't seem like it.

666
00:42:58,347 --> 00:42:59,640
Are you the desk manager?

667
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:02,184
- No.
- Then why are you butting in?

668
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,727
Why isn't there a manager here?

669
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:09,191
I asked you what was going on.

670
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:12,945
She reserved a deluxe room,

671
00:43:13,028 --> 00:43:14,988
but she wanted an upgrade to a suite.

672
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:16,657
Charge her extra and do it.

673
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:18,492
That's not it.

674
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:23,497
This guest right here
is a famous actress, Mo Seong-ae.

675
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,625
She said she'd give us publicity
if we offered a free upgrade,

676
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,919
so I explained that
our rules did not allow that.

677
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:31,922
Ms. Mo Seong-ae, the national mom.

678
00:43:33,674 --> 00:43:35,509
How long have you worked here?

679
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:36,427
Seven years, sir.

680
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,221
Yet you still can't handle
a rude guest like her?

681
00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:40,723
What? A rude guest?

682
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:42,015
The so-called national mom

683
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,393
made a scene to stay in a nice room
without paying for it.

684
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:46,311
Why not tell her she's being a thief?

685
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:48,188
Get security and kick her out.

686
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:50,232
Hey! Who do you think you are?

687
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:53,444
Save the rest for our security officers.
They'll be here shortly.

688
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:56,864
Hey! You!

689
00:43:56,947 --> 00:43:58,449
Stop right there! Hey, you!

690
00:43:58,532 --> 00:43:59,575
Ms. Mo.

691
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:02,077
- Lots of people are watching.
- So what?

692
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:03,912
I didn't do anything wrong!

693
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:05,497
Let them all come and see!

694
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:09,293
It won't do you any good
if people upload this on the internet.

695
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:10,502
I'm so pissed.

696
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:14,089
That damn internet is everything now.

697
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:18,719
Fine.

698
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:22,681
I normally wouldn't care
if I didn't get that suite upgrade,

699
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:26,059
but I will make sure to get it today.

700
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:28,145
I'm so sorry.

701
00:44:28,228 --> 00:44:29,855
You keep talking about these rules,

702
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:31,857
so what are the rules?

703
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,775
Tell me the article and clause!

704
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:35,152
I'm so sorry.

705
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:38,614
I don't need your apology.
Give me the room!

706
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:41,116
- Ms. Cheon, my office. Now.
- Sorry?

707
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:43,494
Didn't you hear me?

708
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:45,245
Come to my office. Now.

709
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:46,330
Hey!

710
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,624
I'm talking to her right now.

711
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:50,918
Over there. Manager.

712
00:44:54,296 --> 00:44:55,839
Yes, hello, Mr. Gu.

713
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:57,883
It's your duty as the manager
to protect the staff.

714
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,301
What are you doing?

715
00:44:59,384 --> 00:45:01,553
- Call security.
- Yes, sir.

716
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,472
Do your job.

717
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:06,058
What? You're the manager?

718
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,520
You were here all along,

719
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,772
but you were hiding and watching?

720
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:14,316
What's your name?

721
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:17,152
How may I help you?

722
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:19,988
Do you expect me
to repeat everything again?

723
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,365
This is so annoying.

724
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:24,535
It's me, Mo Seong-ae!

725
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:27,996
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

726
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:36,797
If there's nothing else for me to do…

727
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,383
Don't we have a manual
against rude customers?

728
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:41,510
Why do you put up with such nonsense?

729
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:46,431
We must remain hospitable
no matter what the circumstances.

730
00:45:46,515 --> 00:45:48,058
But circumstances do differ.

731
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:50,435
Weren't you the outspoken type
who spoke her mind with a smile?

732
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,895
Even if we aren't at fault,

733
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:54,022
it's in our manual
to apologize to our guests

734
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:56,441
and make sure
they don't leave feeling offended.

735
00:45:56,525 --> 00:45:58,193
What kind of a manual is that?

736
00:45:58,902 --> 00:45:59,987
Who made that?

737
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,613
The higher-ups, I'm sure.

738
00:46:01,697 --> 00:46:02,781
People like you.

739
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:06,326
I'm quite outspoken outside of work.

740
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,705
But at the hotel,
I'm not Cheon Sa-rang, but a concierge.

741
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,456
My job is to stay professional

742
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,293
and resolve complaints from guests
in an amicable way.

743
00:46:23,176 --> 00:46:25,887
If you have nothing more to say,
please excuse me.

744
00:46:28,473 --> 00:46:29,725
Don't ask me anything.

745
00:46:31,852 --> 00:46:35,564
Favorite color. Favorite weather.
Favorite food. Everything.

746
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:36,690
I don't like anything.

747
00:46:37,357 --> 00:46:38,317
I never asked.

748
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,901
- You will.
- I won't.

749
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,987
- What will you ask, then?
- Why should I?

750
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,655
You aren't going to do the interview?

751
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,573
What interview?

752
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:50,704
Mr. No.

753
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:55,876
Why doesn't she know about the interview?

754
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,336
I only gave you the proposal.

755
00:46:57,419 --> 00:46:58,962
What about Ms. Cheon?

756
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:00,464
Only you need to look over it.

757
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:02,424
Employees must do as they're told. Right?

758
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:03,967
I'm done checking.

759
00:47:04,593 --> 00:47:05,677
I won't do it!

760
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:07,512
You must.

761
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:09,014
It's the chairman's order.

762
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:11,350
Why do I have to do that like a clown?

763
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:12,893
The chairman of New World

764
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:14,561
and the daughter of Ttukbaegi

765
00:47:14,645 --> 00:47:17,814
share their everyday lives online,
including how they eat, cook, and shop.

766
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:20,275
In this day and age,
public image is a warzone.

767
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:21,860
This time, you'll go to war

768
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:23,403
on behalf of our group

769
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:25,364
along with our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

770
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:27,282
- "War"?
- Why would I go to war

771
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,533
with a kind person?

772
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:30,285
I need a good fighter!

773
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:32,496
I'm going to war?

774
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:35,874
She looks like a good fighter.

775
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:39,294
Look at that. Did you do taekwondo?

776
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:41,254
- These idiots.
- I've never heard that.

777
00:47:45,634 --> 00:47:48,387
So I have to do
a live promotional show with Mr. Gu,

778
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,930
- and it'll air on CNBS?
- Yes.

779
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:51,848
I told you about the promo video.

780
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:55,185
How is a promo video
the same as a live show on CNBS?

781
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:57,062
In essence, they're all promo videos.

782
00:47:57,145 --> 00:47:58,605
And you won't have to do much.

783
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,148
You'll just read off the script.

784
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:03,360
But still, how could you
not have told me anything?

785
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:05,195
Show me. I need to look over it too.

786
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:06,822
Sa-rang.

787
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,865
We aren't here to look over things.

788
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:10,367
We're here to do as we're told.

789
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:12,703
But…

790
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:15,747
what's with the casual tone?

791
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:17,541
Did I do that?

792
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,126
I did.

793
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:20,335
Is it because I'm older?

794
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:22,879
That must be why.
You can talk casually too.

795
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:23,922
Okay, Sang-sik.

796
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:26,383
Give me the proposal and the script.

797
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,719
I know I should do as I'm told,

798
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:30,971
but I need to know.
I'm a person, not a puppet.

799
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:32,806
It's not that I won't give it to you--

800
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:34,474
Then bring it to the lobby soon.

801
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:35,851
I'm busy, so I have to go.

802
00:48:41,732 --> 00:48:43,525
Please excuse me, sir.

803
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:54,286
How do they pick the best talent?

804
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:55,454
Is that so important?

805
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:57,622
Did you just see that?

806
00:48:57,706 --> 00:48:58,582
What?

807
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,294
We're on a first-name basis
in under five minutes.

808
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:04,880
My skills make my life so difficult.

809
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:06,715
It's killing me.

810
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:10,343
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

811
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:34,367
Babe.

812
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,578
Look behind you. A killer view, right?

813
00:49:37,412 --> 00:49:39,080
Yes, it's killing me.

814
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,084
Why did we get out of the taxi
before we reached the top?

815
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:44,920
I did it for you.

816
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:47,923
You're always standing at the hotel,
so you should work out.

817
00:49:48,006 --> 00:49:49,716
Almost there. Keep it up!

818
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:52,552
This is nice!

819
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:55,472
Darn it.

820
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:06,274
This is nice.

821
00:50:09,152 --> 00:50:10,612
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

822
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:12,989
We first talked about coming here
last winter.

823
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:14,115
Remember?

824
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:16,785
It's me.

825
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:19,371
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

826
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:20,622
Yes.

827
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:22,332
Really? Everyone's there?

828
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,085
Okay, I'll be there soon.

829
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:26,044
Bye.

830
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:29,881
If you're done, let's go.

831
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:32,008
Is this a joke? We just got here.

832
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,552
I forgot that I had a reunion.

833
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,595
They're begging me to come.
You should come too.

834
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,265
No. I feel uncomfortable around strangers.

835
00:50:38,348 --> 00:50:39,975
It's fine. They're all my friends.

836
00:50:40,058 --> 00:50:41,726
Let's hang the lock and go.

837
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,562
No, I…

838
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:46,982
SA-RANG ♡ YU-NAM

839
00:50:52,612 --> 00:50:54,322
Let us love forever!

840
00:51:01,288 --> 00:51:02,497
What did you just throw?

841
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:07,836
As long as we hang something.

842
00:51:09,546 --> 00:51:11,756
You can't just laugh it off right now.

843
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,883
It's still nice.

844
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:14,759
This is the key to our love.

845
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:18,680
Let's go.

846
00:51:18,763 --> 00:51:20,140
No, you can go alone.

847
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:22,809
I'm sorry.

848
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:24,519
Let's leave right after we say hi.

849
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:25,645
Please?

850
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:31,443
We're leaving right away.

851
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:32,986
Sure. It won't even take a minute.

852
00:51:33,069 --> 00:51:34,195
Let's go.

853
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:50,962
Yo!

854
00:51:54,674 --> 00:51:56,176
Did you go to an all-girls high school?

855
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:57,385
Come here.

856
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,013
Say hi to her.

857
00:52:00,096 --> 00:52:01,181
This is my girlfriend.

858
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:03,016
Hello.

859
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:04,935
Be nice to her.

860
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:10,023
Hey Yu-nam, come and have a drink.

861
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:12,150
- Hey, it's you.
- Come on!

862
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:13,276
Be right there.

863
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,570
I'll go say hi to them.
Have fun with the girls.

864
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:16,905
Don't say anything weird.

865
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:17,906
I'm watching you.

866
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:19,407
- Fine.
- Fine.

867
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:21,034
- He's impossible.
- Goodness.

868
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,786
- Have some.
- Okay.

869
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:28,667
- I'm here now!
<i>- Hit it!</i>

870
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:31,086
- You're here.
- It's been so long.

871
00:52:31,169 --> 00:52:33,505
- Three drinks for a latecomer.
- You still do this?

872
00:52:33,588 --> 00:52:35,090
- Chug!
- Chug!

873
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:36,967
- Chug!
- Chug!

874
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:39,469
- Hey!
- Another round!

875
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:40,595
Hurry up.

876
00:53:03,034 --> 00:53:04,327
How long have you two dated?

877
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:05,286
Sorry?

878
00:53:07,872 --> 00:53:09,582
Just over a year now.

879
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:10,750
I can't believe it.

880
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,752
- He's never lasted three months.
- I know, right?

881
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:14,796
Do you always talk like that?

882
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:18,216
- Are you acting cute to seem younger?
- Stop it.

883
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:19,175
What?

884
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:21,302
Right, Seon-mi is getting married.

885
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:22,637
- What? To who?
- Yes.

886
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:24,514
Do you remember Gwang-ho in our class?

887
00:53:24,597 --> 00:53:27,267
- No way. She's marrying him?
- No, his dad!

888
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,060
What? No way!

889
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:35,275
No, you're it!

890
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,988
<i>-Bunny, bunny
-Bunny, bunny</i>

891
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:40,905
You lost!

892
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:47,495
- Chug!
- I had too much to drink!

893
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,164
- Chug!
- Chug!

894
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:50,415
- Chug!
- Chug!

895
00:53:50,498 --> 00:53:52,959
<i>- How long will you make us dance?
- How long will you make us dance?</i>

896
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:54,711
<i>- Look at my shoulder</i>
- Look at my shoulder</i>

897
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:56,254
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

898
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:58,006
- Hey, wait!
- Hey!

899
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,718
Sa-rang.

900
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:06,931
You're leaving?

901
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:09,059
You said we'd just say hi and go.

902
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:10,894
Sorry. Are you sulking?

903
00:54:10,977 --> 00:54:11,895
I'm mad.

904
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:13,980
I'm wondering if I should keep dating you.

905
00:54:14,856 --> 00:54:16,274
I'm sorry. It's just been so long…

906
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:18,860
I'm leaving. We can talk later. Have fun.

907
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:20,779
Wait, let me take you home.

908
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:23,114
I'll say goodbye and come out.

909
00:54:23,198 --> 00:54:24,115
Wait for me.

910
00:54:28,203 --> 00:54:30,163
Hey, I have to go.

911
00:54:30,246 --> 00:54:32,999
- Why?
- Don't go.

912
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,876
- Come on, stay.
- I really have to go.

913
00:54:35,627 --> 00:54:37,378
- No, wait.
- Don't be like that.

914
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:39,214
- Do you need me?
- We do!

915
00:54:39,297 --> 00:54:41,508
Then just one last drink.

916
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:46,763
Wait, I really have to go.

917
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:48,056
- Come on!
- No!

918
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:50,892
- Hey, no.
- Someone grab him.

919

Hello.

934
00:59:01,392 --> 00:59:02,310
Mr. Gu.

935
00:59:02,393 --> 00:59:03,770
Hello.

936
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:04,896
Yes, hello…

937
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:08,691
Look at the time. You're late!

938
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,110
I'm here on time.

939
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:12,904
Hey, our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

940
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:16,199
- You're here on time.
- Hello.

941
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:20,244
- Are you two close?
- We are.

942
00:59:20,328 --> 00:59:21,579
We're on a first-name basis.

943
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:24,332
Don't fool around at work.

944
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:27,001
And enough with this first-name basis.

945
00:59:27,585 --> 00:59:28,503
Why not?

946
00:59:28,586 --> 00:59:29,462
It's not the office.

947
00:59:29,545 --> 00:59:32,006
I don't care where we are. Just stop it!

948
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:34,926
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang, follow me with this.

949
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,839
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang, follow me with this.

950
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:49,985
Ouch.

951
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:53,322
Hey, miss.

952
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,241
Is this yours?

953
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:57,201
No.

954
00:59:57,701 --> 00:59:58,869
That's his.

955
00:59:58,953 --> 01:00:00,120
It's his suitcase.

956
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:01,664
Hey, young man.

957
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:02,623
Come here.

958
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,502
Come over here.

959
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,800
What are you doing?

960
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:15,094
You should take care of your own suitcase.

961
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:18,597
Aren't you supposed to assist me
as my subordinate?

962
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,807
I'm sorry,

963
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,476
but I'm here for the promo video,
not as your porter.

964
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:23,686
Please excuse me.

965
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,438
I hope you two have a great talk.

966
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:28,315
It's him.

967
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:31,735
I'm sorry.

968
01:00:31,819 --> 01:00:33,112
I'm frightened.

969
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:35,990
- No Sang-sik…
- Are you three messing around?

970
01:00:36,073 --> 01:00:39,159
You still haven't apologized
after you hit me.

971
01:00:40,828 --> 01:00:41,870
Hey.

972
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:43,163
Get over here.

973
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:04,184
I apologize.

974
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:07,062
Is this enough?

975
01:01:07,938 --> 01:01:11,358
Do you think money is the answer
to all problems, you young little…

976
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:13,986
ONE MILLION WON

977
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:17,489
- Do you need change?
- No.

978
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,657
No?

979
01:01:19,783 --> 01:01:22,119
Do you need a hand with this?

980
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:23,829
You don't seem very well.

981
01:01:23,912 --> 01:01:25,914
- This is heavy.
- And a no to that too.

982
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:27,958
- Thank you.
- Sure.

983
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:39,970
You two.

984
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:00,991
The car is ready.

985
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,788
Is this our car?

986
01:02:06,497 --> 01:02:07,539
Haven't you seen one before?

987
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,874
No, it's my first time!

988
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:11,418
Then you're in for a surprise.

989
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:15,589
Gosh, it's so loud.

990
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:18,258
It's best to ride it

991
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:23,180
under the scorching sun of Las Vegas
against a rough sandstorm.

992
01:02:23,931 --> 01:02:27,309
This isn't Vegas,
but you're in for a special treat.

993
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:28,477
Watch this.

994
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,819
See? Isn't this something?

995
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:38,654
We're in for a good ride.

996
01:02:38,737 --> 01:02:39,988
This is so cool.

997
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:45,828
Mr. Gu, the door is locked.

998
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:50,666
You two can find
your own way to the hotel.

999
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:02,803
Sa-rang, let's grab a cab.

1000
01:03:02,886 --> 01:03:04,263
I'll get one.

1001
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:05,389
Okay.

1002
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:27,953
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1003
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,879
Sir, please drive slowly.

1004
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:14,917
It's so pretty.

1005
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:30,933
FATHER

1006
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:33,727
Hello?

1007
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:36,897
<i>This is a business channel
that broadcasts worldwide.</i>

1008
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,482
This is not only a promotion,

1009
01:04:39,191 --> 01:04:42,152
but also a symbolic statement
that you'll be joining our group.

1010
01:04:43,153 --> 01:04:44,613
<i>And your performance</i>

1011
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:47,449
will have an effect
on King Group's stock price as well.

1012
01:04:48,575 --> 01:04:49,785
Put on a good show.

1013
01:05:05,676 --> 01:05:06,927
Move that over.

1014
01:05:07,928 --> 01:05:08,929
Everyone, get ready.

1015
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,572

from the PR team?

1018
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,412
Yes, I did.

1019
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:35,539
You should take this instead.

1020
01:05:35,622 --> 01:05:36,999
This is the finalized list.

1021
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,501
It changed? We're about to begin.

1022
01:05:39,585 --> 01:05:41,878
It was just sent
from the managing director's office.

1023
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:44,756
We'll edit all the shots,
so feel free to read off of it.

1024
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,425
Okay.

Oh, so you're good at everything,

I don't want to go with you either.

1040
