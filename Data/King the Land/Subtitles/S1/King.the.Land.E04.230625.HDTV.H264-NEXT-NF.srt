1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:06,920
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,854
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:13,806
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,626
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,431
Are you still mad?

6
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,226
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

7
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,560
Do you know what you did wrong?

8
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,437
Of course I do. I'm really sorry.

9
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,688
What are you sorry for?

10
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:03,731
Everything.

11
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,858
I'm sorry for all of it,
no matter what it is.

12
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:08,986
Forget it.

13
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,656
You're bound to repeat the same mistakes.

14
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,616
I have zero hope in you.

15
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,159
No, I'll never do that again.

16
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,160
I'll be good to you.

17
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,787
Once my schedule slows down,

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,331
we can go on a trip in two or three weeks.

19
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,041
You wanted to go to Gangneung.

20
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,793
No, Sokcho.

21
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,336
Yes, Sokcho.

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,380
You wanted the spicy noodle soup there.

23
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,675
Potato dumpling soup.

24
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,592
Right.

25
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,636
Come with me, okay?

26
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:51,070
Let's go somewhere quiet.
I have something to tell you.

27
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,447
- What is it?
- We'll talk when we get there.

28
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,950
Can't you just tell me now?

29
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,785
Why?

30
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,245
I'm meeting my club members.

31
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,830
It's an important occasion.

32
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,297
So you're here

33
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,965
not to actually apologize to me

34
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,468
but to clear your conscience
before meeting with your friends.

35
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,053
Don't say it like that.

36
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,097
I had to push the time back
to wait for you.

37
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,101
I tried to be understanding
since no one is perfect.

38
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,812
I wanted to try my best
with the person I chose to be with.

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,813
But…

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,818
it's pointless to be considerate
to someone who doesn't value me.

41
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,197
You don't deserve it.

42
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,075
Okay.

43
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,745
I'll tell them I'll be late,
so let's go eat something.

44
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,330
Something simple like <i>gimbap</i>?

45
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,047
Let's go.

46
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,096
What's wrong? Don't you want <i>gimbap</i>?

47
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,270
It's over.

48
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,149
I feel too sorry for myself
to keep seeing you.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,610
All of a sudden?

50
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,528
When one person always humors another,

51
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,572
that person gets ruined.

52
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,409
I think I ruined you.

53
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,703
I came all the way here for you.

54
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,248
I can't believe you're this selfish.

55
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,378
One second.

56
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,799
Hey, is everyone there?

57
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,342
Go ahead and get started.

58
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,221
No, I'm almost done. I'll leave soon.

59
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,724
Something came up.

60
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,313
I'll hang up soon. Hold on.

61
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,149
Order whatever.
We're splitting the bill anyway.

62
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,609
I'll call you back.

63
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:55,528
Sa-rang!

64
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,572
Sa-rang!

65
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,700
Wait!

66
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,345
There's no way

67
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,516
I'm feeling jealous

68
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,768
or something like that.

69
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:30,896
Me?

70
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,276
Me?

71
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,447
I can't believe this.

72
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,475
You just littered.

73
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,726
Driver's license, please.

74
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,649
You just littered.

75
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:15,900
Driver's license, please.

76
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:23,658
Here.

77
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,660
Sir, you have to pick that up.

78
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,344
Please throw this out.

79
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,263
We don't do that.

80
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,934
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,106
Was that for your girlfriend?

82
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,275
No.

83
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,277
You got it as a gift for her,
but you threw it out.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,236
Something happened.

85
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,153
I said no.

86
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,281
Your girlfriend must've had another man.

87
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,450
We can tell right away
when we see a situation.

88
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:07,994
This isn't the first time.

89
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,997
She must be pretty.

90
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,083
Well,

91
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,543
sure.

92
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,129
I'd say she is

93
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,880
quite pretty.

94
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:20,798
And smiles often.

95
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,095
That's a part of her job.

96
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,847
She's pretty and she smiles a lot?

97
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,267
A woman like that will
have you in her grasp before you know it.

98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,519
So don't get played and snap out of it.

99
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,770
Pull yourself together.

100
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,063
She's not like that!

101
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,273
She already has you.

102
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,400
No, forget it.

103
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,443
It's fine.

104
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,986
Here. You can just go.

105
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,362
What do you mean?

106
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,739
Just give me that ticket.

107
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,033
I just feel bad for you.

108
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,744
You saved money today,
so buy yourself a drink and wake up.

109
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,912
- Okay?
- It's not like that!

110
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,498
Why are you such a softie?

111
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,375
I know this because I've been there.

112
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:58,794
Forget it.

113
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,756
Nothing I say will get through to you.

114
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,299
Just go.

115
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,551
Go let her toy with you.

116
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,345
You'll regret it once you're hurt.

117
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,013
Then you'll remember what I said.

118
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:10,806
Go.

119
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,350
Man.

120
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,268
Just go.

121
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,147
Go!

122
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,526
Listen to what I'm about to say, my man.

123
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,570
How many relationships have you had?

124
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:26,947
With friends?

125
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,492
With women.

126
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,119
I'm a busy man.

127
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,663
Okay.

128
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:34,914
Not much dating experience,

129
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,624
but you seem to have some money.

130
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,835
That makes you the perfect prey, right?

131
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,671
And what drives you more insane

132
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:44,131
is that you don't even know
how you really feel.

133
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,176
"Do I really like her?
Am I just curious about her?"

134
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,302
"Am I in love?"

135
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,762
It gets so confusing!

136
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,847
Right?

137
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,891
And how do I know?

138
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,314
My woman was very pretty too.

139
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,859
Her face was the vision of love itself.

140
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,570
- Love?
- By any chance,

141
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,572
do you know that song?

142
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,910
<i>Your eyes, nose, lips</i>

143
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,913
<i>The way you caressed me</i>

144
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,250
<i>Even all those tiniest touches</i>

145
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,711
I can never forget her.

146
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,589
I thought I could die
a hundred times over for her.

147
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
I should've held onto her.

148
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,513
I should've screamed,
"I'm your man, not him!"

149
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,265
After that one moment of hesitation,

150
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,684
after turning away like that…

151
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,479
I've been tormented ever since.

152
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,077
Buck up.

153
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,290
Jeez.

154
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,459
What am I doing in front of a stranger?

155
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,467
Bye!

Of course I had dinner. It's late.

163

What about you?

164
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,183
Can I come over tomorrow?

165
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,521
Yes, it's my day off.

166
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,565
I want to eat your food.

167
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,239
Of course. Your food is the best.

168
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,616
Yes.

169
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,244
Your food is my favorite.

170
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,081
Is there anything you want to eat?

Two bottles of soju, please.

176
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,386
Okay, coming. Two bottles of soju.

177
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,179
Goodness.

178
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,807
They'll be even sweeter
coming from my daughter-in-law.

179
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,975
This is the last round.

180
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,434
You should go home and sleep.

181
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,979
I'll sleep as long as I want
once I'm dead.

182
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,021
That again!

183
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,690
Don't have too much.

184
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,068
My daughter-in-law,
some more radish kimchi.

185
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,403
Okay, radish kimchi!

186

All of you.

188
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,745
Why do you call my granddaughter

189
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,831
"my daughter-in-law"?

190
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,000
I called over my kind daughter-in-law.

191
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,252
What's this mean granny doing here?

192
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,211
Cut your crap!

193
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,921
You two don't even have sons.

194
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,132
Don't let me catch you

195
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,385
calling my granddaughter
your daughter-in-law again.

196
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,970
Got it?

197
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,680
My daughter-in-law.

198
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,473
- A bottle of rice wine, please.
- Why you…

199
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,434
Okay, your daughter-in-law is coming!

200
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,020
Goodness.

201
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,774
Here.

202
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,076
Is something

203
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,579
going on with you?

204
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,080
What do you mean?

205
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,790
I just came to see you.

206
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,003
Your food is the best.

207
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,465
If you're concerned about me,
you should get married soon.

208
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,675
Da-eul already has a big kid.

209
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,093
You always say that.

210
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,970
Is that all you have to say to me?

211
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,431
She got married early.
Pyeong-hwa is single too.

212
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,808
Don't get me started on Pyeong-hwa.

213
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,602
She's impossible.

214
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,896
The thought of marriage
isn't entering your head

215
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,439
because you two stick together.

216
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,607
Kick her out soon.

217
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,777
I should leave before you nag me more.

218
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,778
Wait.

219
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,697
I'll pack some side dishes for you.

220
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,159
Go give some to that guy
Yu-nam or whatever.

221
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,495
Don't.

222
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,412
Why not?

223
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,041
We broke up.

224
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,006
We just did.

225
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,386
Good.

226
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,513
I'm glad.

227
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,639
That rotten jerk.

228
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,683
It's his loss.

229
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,227
You don't even know the reason.

230
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,853
I know you.

231
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,398
I'm sure he's the one at fault.

232
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,150
Forget about money.

233
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,945
You should be with a man
who's good to you.

234
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,531
I'm glad things ended.

235
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:01,949
Yeah.

236
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,368
Me too.

237
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,580
Also,

238
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:12,209
when you feel upset in the future,

239
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,003
don't hold it in and just tell people.

240
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,422
Okay?

241
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,840
Throw a fit if you want to.

242
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,718
If you want to be a crybaby, be one too.

243
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,137
And you can tell me everything.

244
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,139
Okay. I'll do that.

245
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,726
This is so nice.

246
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,395
Grandma, you're the best.

247
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,315
Goodness, my dear little girl.

248
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,776
Great job.

249
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,530
I'm glad you did that.

250
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,289
First Royal Hotel's LVIP Lounge
just became the top of the industry

251
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,876
surpassing King the Land of King Hotel!

252
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,629
Chairman Han, your wish finally came true.

253
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,382
It's been a lifelong dream of yours
to surpass King Hotel.

254
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,469
It's just the lounge.
Don't make such a big fuss.

255
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,637
Do you want to make a bet?

256
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,556
It was just the lounge this time,

257
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,059
but will it end with just that?

258
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,770
You should make a bet
with your hotels at stake.

259
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,938
Our hotels aren't on the same level.

260
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,734
I hear you spent a fortune
to become number one.

261
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,818
Can you handle it?

262
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,196
It's called an investment.

263
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,823
My victory over King Hotel
after years of losses

264
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,701
already gives me
a different outlook on business.

265
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,831
All right.
You can try your best to catch up.

266
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,957
Okay!

267
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,430
What does revenue from the lounge mean
in hotel management?

268
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,849
Since the clientele is mostly VIPs,

269
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,684
the higher the revenue,

270
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,395
the more sophisticated
and classy the hotel is.

271
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,607
That's why competing hotels
compare the lounge revenue,

272
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,067
not the overall sales.

273
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,485
If you knew that,

274
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,737
why did First Royal Hotel
take first place?

275
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,990
I trusted you two
and left you to work together.

276
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,033
What have you done?

277
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,077
They only increased
their short-term revenue

278
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,537
with excessive promotions…

279
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,082
Such complacent thoughts
are the shortcut to rock bottom.

280
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,750
It may be the lounge this time,

281
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,669
but that doesn't mean it'll end there.

282
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,089
Work together and do whatever it takes

283
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,882
to reclaim first place in lounge revenue.

284
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes, Dad.

285
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,302
The same goes for Distribution and Air.

286
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,099
Climb up so high that First Royal Hotel
won't even dream of competing with us.

287
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,767
I'll see what you two can do

288
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,811
and decide if I'll bequeath
the whole group

289
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,229
or split it between you two.

290
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,482
Understood?

291
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,401
Yes.

292
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,410
What's your plan?

293
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,913
He told us to join forces,

294
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,957
but you have no power.

295
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,667
Not yet.

296
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,043
And in the future too.

297
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,754
So don't try to meddle with anything

298
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,214
and sit this one out.

299
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,674
I'll handle this.

300
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,885
So this must be how it feels.

301
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:08,802
What?

302
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:09,970
Getting looked down on.

303
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,016
It's not even news.

304
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,437
Did you think you were a big shot?

305
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,316
Someone said…

306
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,483
All people are the same.

307
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,820
That means
everyone should be treated equally.

308
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,906
…that everyone

309
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,117
should be treated with equal respect.

310
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,493
You're an exception.

311
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,873
You're an upstart nobody.

312
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:41,960
I know.

313
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,880
So don't be scared of me.

314
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,307
Thank you for everything.

315
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,142
I'll head upstairs then.

316
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,356
As you already know…

317
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:04,691
No.

318
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,402
You have no idea
what King the Land is like.

319
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,531
I'm sure the chairman put you there
because he doesn't know any better.

320
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,534
You'll get kicked out soon,
so don't try too hard.

321
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,828
Okay.

322
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,122
It's been a while, Su-mi.

323
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,124
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

324
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,167
Hey.

325
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:23,794
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

326
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,504
Yes.

327
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,548
I'm the manager of King the Land.

328
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,883
I'm here to take you there.

329
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,762
Hello, my name is Cheon Sa-rang.

330
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:34,888
It's nice to meet you.

331
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,473
Nice to meet you.

332
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,933
Let's get along.

333
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,644
Ms. Jeon.

334
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,145
She went to a two-year college.

335
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,357
Okay.

336
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,150
Let's go upstairs.

337
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,193
I'll give you a tour.

338
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,083
Most of our guests here are chairpersons

339
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,836
who are ranked within the top 30
in the business world.

340
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,132
One VVVIP guest often spends

341
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,343
more than the hotel's daily revenue.

342
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,722
That's why we call this place
the hotel's first class.

343
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,892
It's a dream for all concierges
to work up here,

344
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,437
but in reality,
not everyone gets to do that.

345
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:28,483
I never imagined
that I'd get to work on this floor.

346
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,193
It honestly doesn't feel real.

347
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,615
I'll do my best not to become
a nuisance to King the Land.

348
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,537
Any takes on this piece?

349
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,914
I don't know much about art,

350
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,541
but it looks great.

351
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,542
Right?

352
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,879
The chairman got this himself in New York.

353
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,756
He has an eye for art, doesn't he?

354
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,258
Yes, I think so.

355
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,303
He also recruited you here himself.

356
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,847
I'm sure he has a reason.

357
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,516
I trust his judgment.

358
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,189
So don't mind those
who talk behind your back.

359
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,568
You must respect yourself first
before others do.

360
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,865
Okay.

361
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,034
Let's go. Your uniform is ready.

362
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,893
Hello, my name is Cheon Sa-rang.

363
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,119
Have you thought about it?

364
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,162
Yes.

365
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,665
All night.

366
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,083
And even now.

367
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:10,669
What will you do?

368
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,088
I should've held onto her.

369
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,174
I should've screamed,
"I'm your man, not him!"

370
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,928
I'm thinking.

371
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,388
Again?

372
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,640
You're still thinking?

373
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,685
How will that help reclaim
the first in revenue for King the Land?

374
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,187
What?

375
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:30,856
Revenue?

376
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,400
Do you know
how First Royal Hotel took first place?

377
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,278
For months, they followed
some ginseng diggers around

378
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,779
and got a hold of wild ginseng.

379
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,198
They sold that with wine
for 100 million won.

380
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,243
I'm 100% sure that's what Ms. Gu will do.

381
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,202
That's why

382
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,621
- we should do it first.
- And copy them?

383
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,665
No, we're only following the trend.

384
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,167
But money should be earned honestly.

385
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,336
Says who?

386
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,422
Who said that to you?

387
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,257
I doubt they were rich.

388
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,717
That's a classic line from the poor.

389
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,052
Why are you so passionate today?

390
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,679
You be the head manager!

391
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,349
I'll end up as a nobody
if I just trust you and sit around.

392
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,642
You got a full-time job here.

393
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,811
That's all. There's nothing after that.

394
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,896
I must have sided with

395
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,898
the wrong guy.

396
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,900
Go. It's not too late.

397
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,817
Get out of here.

398
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,320
"I'll take King Group for myself!"

399
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,323
Do you not have such manly ambitions?

400
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,450
Why would I?

401
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,079
You don't want anything
and can't be bothered.

402
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,207
Right. You know me.

403
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,918
That's because you have too much,

404
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,669
for insufficiency brings desire.

405
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,756
You can throw out your fortune
and position to me.

406
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,883
I'll gladly become your trash can.

407
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:40,926
Whatever.

408
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,053
I'll be one for you. Here, throw them out.

409
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:44,596
Feel free.

410
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:46,932
Dump them here.

411
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,808
Among the things I have,

412
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,062
the thing I want to dump the most…

413
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,273
is you.

414
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,192
Get out of here.

415
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,318
I don't want to go.

416
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,945
- Not until you dump something.
- Get out.

417
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,571
No way. Give me something.

418
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,739
Get out of…

419
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,822
The new staff of King the Land

420
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,282
is here to greet you.

421
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,409
Hello.

422
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,203
I'm Cheon Sa-rang,
and it's my first day at King the Land.

423
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,038
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang,

424
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,623
you finally got here. Congrats.

425
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,049
I hear King the Land
is staffed with our best employees.

426
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,010
Yes, we all work there with pride.

427
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,512
But she's now a part of your staff?

428
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,556
I know her a little.

429
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,808
You'll need to give
extra attention and training

430
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,768
to enlighten her on the sophistication

431
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,354
and basic manners
befitting King the Land, Ms. Jeon.

432
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,106
Yes, sir.

433
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,983
As per your words,

434
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,319
I'll do my best to be more sophisticated

435
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,863
as I learn basic manners
befitting King the Land.

436
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:25,780
Yes, you will.

437
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,574
- You may go.
- Yes, Mr. Gu.

438
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:28,825
Excuse us.

439
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,203
Yearly business plan.

440
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,956
Our annual revenue last year was…

441
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,262
Why were you like that to her?

442
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,180
What?

443
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,931
As if you like our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

444
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,392
What is it? What's going on?

445
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,435
Like a pathetic little kid.

446
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:56,978
What?

447
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,646
- "Pathetic"?
- Yes.

448
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,939
- "Little kid"?
- Yes.

449
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,317
You like her,

450
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,485
but you can't tell her.

451
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,487
You want to get her attention,

452
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,322
but you have no idea what to do.

453
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,991
That's why you pick on her and act rudely.

454
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,242
That's what kids do.

455
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,535
I don't like her!

456
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,038
She's such a phony.

457
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,582
She's totally not my type.

458
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,460
Why did you get so angry over a joke,

459
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,295
as if I saw right through you?

460
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,672
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

461
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,717
You have no sense of humor,
no consideration, and no popularity.

462
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,677
That's why you're not seeing anyone.

463
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:40,939
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

464
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:47,987
Everyone say hello.

465
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,240
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang
will join us starting today.

466
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,534
Nice to meet you.

467
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,160
We're all like family here,

468
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,370
so you'll fit in soon.

469
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,289
Learn a lot from your experienced seniors,

470
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,291
and tell me if there's trouble.

471
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,252
Yes, I'll do my best.

472
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,920
I'll teach her well.

473
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:05,755
Let her sign the NDA first.

474
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,132
I need to go to the office.

475
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,174
Goodbye.

476
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,977
Ms. Jeon is nice, isn't she?

477
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,479
Yes, she seems wonderful.

478
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,397
You're right.

479
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,024
She's kind to everyone
without any prejudice,

480
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,401
and she's warmhearted too.

481
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,278
But I'm not like her.

482
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,656
I believe distinctions must exist.

483
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,242
We all graduated
from well-known universities in Seoul.

484
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,036
The fact that a two-year college graduate
like you made it here

485
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,914
belittles the time and effort we put in

486
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:40,999
to get to this place.

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,710
If you wish to be accepted,

488
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,837
you must prove you have what it takes

489
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,922
to be here against our tradition.

490
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,008
You can try hard, but it'll be tough.

491
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:51,801
Brace yourself.

492
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,219
Yes.

493
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,846
I'll do my best.

494
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,055
Follow me.

495
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:02,729
Du-ri.

496
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,064
Is this place for anybody now?

497
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,442
Hey, the chairman put her here.

498
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:08,985
I knew it.

499
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,821
I know girls like her very well.

500
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,574
She's the type we don't want on our turf.

501
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:20,830
The guests we receive here
are in the top 0.0001% of the nation.

502
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,334
This says you must not disclose
who you saw here

503
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,753
and the conversations they had.

504
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,963
If you disclose anything about this place,

505
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:32,425
you'll be held liable
and must compensate for any damages.

506
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,468
Sign it.

507
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,385
Okay.

508
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,599
Are you on social media?

509
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,809
- Yes.
- Delete your accounts.

510
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,438
It's a breach of contract
to upload any photos of this place.

511
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,732
Can I just not take photos while up here?

512
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,026
Then you can go back to your old post.

513
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,612
I'll delete them.

514
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,990
SIGNED BY CHEON SA-RANG

515
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,003
KING MALL

516
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,442
Is this store the top in sales?

517
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,860
Yes, ma'am.

518
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,113
Who's in charge?

519
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:36,531
Hello.

520
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,491
I'm the supervisor, Do Ra-hee.

521
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,993
Which stores do you work with?

522
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,580
The airports in Incheon, Gimpo, Jeju,
as well as shops downtown.

523
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:44,872
Work here from tomorrow.

524
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,667
Keep this shop as our main focus

525
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,127
and double the sales.

526
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,545
Can you do that?

527
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,298
Yes, I can.

528
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,601
Ms. Do is going to start working here?

529
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,437
She's the most infamous witch
among the old witches.

530
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,314
What will happen to us now?

531
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,024
She's that bad?

532
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,900
Her name already rhymes with crazy…

533
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,404
Manager Do Ra-hee.

534
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,906
It's okay.
We'll do the actual work anyway.

535
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:20,950
Let's go.

536
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,244
Let's go.

537
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,495
- Yes.
- Exactly.

538
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,205
You couldn't meet their eyes.

539
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,755
- Hello.
- Hello.

540
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,966
Is this the team with the lowest number
for in-flight duty-free sales?

541
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,427
There are three teams in the lowest rank,

542
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,012
and this is one of them.

543
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,931
Purser?

544
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:45,767
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,477
What's your plan?

546
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,228
We'll do our best.

547
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,688
Which you haven't done so far?

548
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,065
No, ma'am.

549
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,900
We'll do our best to bring up the sales.

550
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:54,984
Any specific plans?

551
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,571
We'll push the sales more

552
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,157
so that none of our guests

553
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,867
leave the flight empty-handed.

554
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:06,371
That means you can easily
double the sales compared to now.

555
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,082
We'll do our best.

556
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,333
Don't let me down.

557
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,544
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!

558
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,886
Who is she?

559
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,804
I've never seen--

560
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,598
You must've been shocked.

561
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,434
- The managing director.
- That almost killed me.

562
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,943
You do realize the Chinese restaurant
has the highest sales in every hotel?

563
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,236
Yes, I'm aware of that.

564
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,821
So what's going on here?

565
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,281
I'm going to try the dishes myself,

566
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,325
so change your old recipes

567
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:45,952
and make new dishes by this week.

568
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,745
By this week, ma'am?

569
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,705
You can't?

570
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,124
No, I can do that.

571
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,551
- Get rid of him.
- Yes, ma'am.

572
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,442
Get rid of him.

573
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:18,818
Yes, ma'am.

574
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:25,950
I prepared a meeting with the staff
regarding our revenue.

575
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,036
Why should I go to something you prepared?

576
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,328
Look at Ms. Gu.

577
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:32,415
She visited every single department
and gave them a new sales goal.

578
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,374
Great.

579
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,209
I won't have to do a thing.

580
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,336
She already fired two people today.

581
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,005
"Get rid of him. And him."

582
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,424
She was so scary too.

583
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,594
One of them was too fat,
the other was too messy.

584
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:45,970
The staff?

585
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,889
Of course. Why would she fire the board?

586
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:51,184
What if all of the employees
of King the Land get fired?

587
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,393
And most importantly,

588
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,604
what if I get kicked out?

589
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:56,856
I did nothing wrong.

590
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,901
This may not be a big deal to you,

591
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,320
but a mere employee like me
can get fired over this.

592
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,280
You might work
at daddy's company as a hobby,

593
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,657
but some people work hard
just to make ends meet.

594
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,785
Does this meeting

595
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,746
include the staff
of King the Land as well?

596
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,998
Of course. Especially if you're attending.

597
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:16,834
Let's go.

598
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,838
Mr. Gu is holding a meeting with the staff

599
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,673
regarding the hotel's revenue.

600
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,476
A special promotional event for our VIPs

601
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,314
would be the most effective way
to increase short-term revenue.

602
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,652
Go ahead and do that.

603
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,905
If you don't like that,

604
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:50,993
we can increase the per-transaction sales
by having premium wine

605
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,329
or limited-edition whiskey
as our main liquor.

606
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,330
Okay.

607
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,209
If you don't like any of those methods,

608
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,170
please let me know
the direction you are looking for.

609
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,635
It's not that I don't like them.

610
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,346
As someone on the ground,
you must know better than me,

611
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,723
so I want to follow your suggestions.

612
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,934
What's the most effective method?

613
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,151
To be frank, pushing incentives.

614
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,027
Then let's do that.

615
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:28,823
However, providing just 30,000 won
in incentives like last time

616
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,325
for selling a liquor set
worth 40 million won

617
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,244
won't have a huge impact.

618
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:34,704
What?

619
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,957
You got only 30,000 won in incentives

620
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,043
for selling a product
worth 40 million won?

621
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,628
It's my first time hearing this.

622
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,713
Yes.

623
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:47,008
Make it big enough to have an impact.

624
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,135
Let me know your sales goal.

625
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,262
I'll look over it
and implement it right away.

626
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:54,849
Thank you.

627
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,475
We'll do our best.

628
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,193
That's all for the meeting.

629
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:20,082
PHONY CHEON

630
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:29,967
CALL

631
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,143
MESSAGE

632
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,189
<i>I need to talk to you after work.</i>

633
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,441
Okay.

634
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,344
Is she still at work?

635
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,387
Did she not see it?

636
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,846
How could she not see it?

637
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,266
Is she still working?

638
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,151
Is she working overtime?

639
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,408
Do I not have signal?

640
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,618
Seven. Eight.

641
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,620
Nine.

642
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,664
Ten.

643
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,795
One, two, three…

644
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,472
Just until this hourglass runs out.

645
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:15,698
It hasn't run out yet.

646
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:34,008
PHONY CHEON

647
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,064
MISSED CALL

648
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:51,776
Ms. Gu came by today and it was like war.

649
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,028
She came by Da-eul's store as well.

650
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,031
I heard she did that at the hotel too.

651
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:57,948
No idea.

652
00:35:58,032 --> 00:35:59,533
- You don't know?
- No.

653
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,410
A few of the employees were exiled.

654
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:04,288
Why were they exiled? To where?

655
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,623
How would I know?

656
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,876
I hear your hotel
has a special place for the exiles.

657
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,253
I don't know.

658
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,436
Who is it?

659
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,397
I don't know.

660
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:32,650
Well,

661
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,693
I don't need to know their place of exile

662
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,570
when I'm about to get axed.

663
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,406
Why? Did you do something wrong?

664
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,907
She wants us to double the sales.

665
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,201
If we make low in-flight sales,

666
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,536
we'll become traitors.

667
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:45,621
How can you double them?

668
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,083
If they keep pestering the staff,
we'll somehow bring in sales,

669
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,086
so they'll pester us
until the point of death.

670
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,255
Didn't they discuss sales with you?

671
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,090
We get incentives for pushing sales.

672
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,842
Really?

673
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,386
Your team is the best off.

674
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,555
How much?

675
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:04,348
No idea.

676
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,892
It's not like the incentives
or the lack thereof

677
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,727
will make me work more or less.

678
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,021
I'm just going to do my job.

679
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,942
But I'm not getting anywhere
although I'm doing more than my job.

680
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,944
I'm suffocated in the middle,

681
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,863
pushed around by my seniors and juniors.

682
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,825
If you need help, ask Da-eul for a lesson.

683
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,660
Her shop had the top sales.

684
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,078
I really should.

685
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,249
Good for Da-eul.

686
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,543
She's the manager,
the best salesperson, married,

687
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,170
and has an adorable daughter.

688
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,212
She has it all.

689
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,214
I'm jealous!

690
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,841
I'm jealous!

691
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,263
I'm home.

692
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,890
- Mom's here.
- Hey, Cho-rong.

693
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:47,850
What did you draw?

694
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,393
You're home.

695
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,353
Make dinner. I'm hungry.

696
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,063
Okay.

697
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,483
Look at that.

698
00:37:58,611 --> 00:37:59,862
What's with them?

699
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,005
Mother, I need to go grocery shopping.

700
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,131
There's no food.

701
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,175
Why didn't you go beforehand?

702
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,511
It'll take forever for us to eat.

703
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,140
I made braised short ribs
and pollack soup this morning,

704
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,142
but a thief must've come and eaten it all.

705
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,355
That's why you should make
more than enough when you cook.

706
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,732
Don't be so stingy with food.

707
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,150
Grandma.

708
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,818
Don't be mean to Mom.

709
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:43,864
Aunt, Uncle, and that darned family
came and finished everything.

710
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:47,409
Who taught you such a phrase?

711
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,577
Don't use such words.

712
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,079
While you're at it,

713
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,456
get some oxtail and make a hearty broth.

714
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,084
I must be low on energy.

715
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,835
- I haven't had an appetite.
- Jeez.

716
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,463
You cleared three bowls of rice
without an appetite?

717
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,800
I only had three bowls
because I had no appetite.

718
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,345
What are you waiting for?

719
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,680
Go get the groceries.

720
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,432
Okay, I'll be back soon.

721
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,101
Cho-rong, come with Mom.

722
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,814
Look at that.

723
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,444
Mom, our home isn't a restaurant.

724
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,115
Why does Aunt always come
and eat at our place?

725
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,951
I guess my food is much better.

726
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,787
She always comes and eats for free,

727
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,122
never even does the dishes,

728
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,874
and steals everything good
from our fridge.

729
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,836
Should we report her to the police?

730
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,964
Let's say it's because I'm a good cook
and give her a break.

731
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,970
Cho-rong, do you want a doll?

732
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,523
Hello? Where are you?

733
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,900
Can you come to the grocery store?

734
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,110
I have too much stuff.

735
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:06,196
<i>Sorry, I'm out having dinner
with a client.</i>

736
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,407
Still? Can't you sneak out?

737
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,742
How can I do that?

738
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:10,743
It's a part of work.

739
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:14,038
Okay. Make sure you eat well.

740
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,998
- Don't strain yourself.
<i>- Okay.</i>

741
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:16,999
You too.

742
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,001
Don't strain yourself and get a good rest.

743
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,129
I'll be late tonight,
so you should go to sleep first.

744
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,965
Bye.

745
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:54,203
I need to talk to you.

746
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,465
Would you like to order?

747
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:09,595
I asked to see you yesterday.

748
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,263
What? When?

749
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,347
Didn't you see the text?

750
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,182
I called you too.

751
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,184
- Do you know my number?
- Of course.

752
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:17,686
It's in your personnel record.

753
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,605
Don't you know mine, Phony Cheon?

754
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,690
I have no access to your personnel record.

755
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,197
Here.

756
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,116
That's my number. Save it.

757
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:35,287
So what did you want to say to me?

758
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:38,832
I must

759
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,751
ask you something.

760
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:42,419
Ask away.

761
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,505
Let's talk over dinner after work.

762
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:46,840
Wait.

763
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:48,675
Can't you just tell me now?

764
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,679
You treated me to juice
on Gapado last time.

765
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,515
I'd like to return the favor,
so I'll see you then.

766
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,683
No, it's okay.

767
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:58,518
I'm not okay.

768
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,438
I simply can't stand
owing someone a favor.

769
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,065
But I'm okay with it.

770
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:10,614
Is it too much

771
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:12,658
for you

772
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:15,452
to just say yes this once?

773
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:18,413
Well,

774
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:20,082
isn't it proper manners to check

775
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,668
if I have a prior engagement
before asking me to dinner?

776
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:32,678
Ms. Phony Cheon.

777
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,346
Do you have

778
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,765
plans for dinner

779
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,810
tonight?

780
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,603
No, I don't.

781
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:43,438
In that case,

782
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,733
would you like

783
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,569
to have dinner

784
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:51,113
with me?

785
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:52,948
I don't want to.

786
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:54,741
Why not? Why do you say no to me?

787
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,160
I didn't say no to you.

788
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,370
I said no to dinner.

789
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,833
Then Ms. Phony Cheon,
what do you like other than dinner?

790
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,293
It's just that it'd be so awkward
to eat alone with you.

791
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:08,964
So you won't order?

792
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,091
I won't.

793
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,010
I'm not eating!

794
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,361
What's with him?

795
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:36,324
Next.

796
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:43,832
And next.

797
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:50,297
Next.

798
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:53,925
You must choose a photo today.

799
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,969
They all look the same to me.

800
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:57,846
So much so that it's almost scary.

801
00:43:58,597 --> 00:43:59,973
Please make your call.

802
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:01,433
I've decided.

803
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:03,643
Thank you. Which one?

804
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:06,521
I simply must have
dinner with her tonight.

805
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,649
Make dinner plans
with Ms. Cheon Sa-rang after work.

806
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:12,068
Make sure she comes.

807
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:14,279
Why? Is something going on?

808
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,532
- Tell her it's a welcome dinner.
- A welcome dinner?

809
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:19,993
Where at?

810
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,459
The hotel's

811
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:29,419
Japanese restaurant.

812
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:30,670
After the welcome dinner,

813
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,964
you must choose a photo, okay?

814
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:35,133
You have to. Please?

815
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:46,102
Hello, it's been a while.

816
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:48,063
A strong cup of coffee, please.

817
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:49,856
I'll bring it to the cockpit.

818
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,359
No, I'd like to have it here with you

819
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:54,110
in this cozy galley.

820
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,654
I'll bring it to you.

821
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:58,740
You're still as feisty as ever.

822
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,994
Eat dinner with me after the flight.
It's been a while.

823
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,120
No.

824
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,414
Here's your cozy cup of coffee.

825
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,000
Please excuse me.

826
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:13,588
Don't be so cheeky.

827
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,509
Who do you think will suffer
if I start acting nasty?

828
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,555
Do you still think I'm a joke?

829
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:23,265
No.

830
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,433
I still want you.

831
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,111
Hello.

832
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:37,779
Would you like something?

833
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:39,114
What? No.

834
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:40,407
I already got it.

835
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:42,450
Keep it up.

836
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:56,047
Did something happen?

837
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:57,841
It's not a big deal.

838
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,803
Do you have plans tonight?

839
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:03,597
I'm just going to rest.

840
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:06,433
How about having a beer with me?

841
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:08,476
No, I'm tired. I'm not in the mood.

842
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,272
My mom told me to treat you
and thank you for her scarf.

843
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:14,357
It's okay. I wanted to thank you first.

844
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,067
Well, I'm using her as an excuse.

845
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:18,695
I want to have dinner with you.

846
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,786
Let's get dinner together.

847
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:37,631
This is nice.

848
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:39,758
I think so too.

849
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,510
Don't you love it here?

850
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:45,055
The waves and the wind.

851
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,644
I love seeing you so happy.

852
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,115
Thank you for your help last time.

853
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:08,787
How could I not act

854
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,665
after seeing my senior
run for her life like that?

855
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,668
I was just doing you a favor
to make my life easier at work.

856
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:16,044
You don't have to thank me.

857
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,049
If that's the reason, I'm sorry.

858
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:22,342
Why?

859
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,927
You picked the wrong senior.

860
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:27,263
I'm the only one among my peers
who didn't make assistant purser.

861
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,891
If I don't get promoted next year,

862
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:31,935
people will know that I've been left out.

863
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:34,062
That'll be the end of me.

864
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,399
What about it?

865
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:39,859
What do you mean?

866
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,445
You won't benefit in any way
if you befriend me.

867
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,072
So stay away.

868
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,660
So what if I can't get promoted?

869
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:52,372
It hurts too much to fall from high-up.

870
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,125
I prefer the low and long haul.

871
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:56,876
Sounds great.

872
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,754
I'll have to be
one of your close associates.

873
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:03,883
You'll regret it later.

874
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:06,886
I never will.

875
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:19,733
What do you think about Mi-na?

876
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:21,651
She's a great girl.

877
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:24,696
She's very curious about you.

878
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,489
What about you?

879
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:28,908
What?

880
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,785
I'm very curious about you.

881
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:47,802
This way, please.

882
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,411
- Hello, Mr. Gu.
- Hello, Mr. Gu.

883
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:16,831
- Why?
- What is this?

884
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:17,749
A welcome dinner.

885
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,793
- Why?
- To welcome Ms. Cheon.

886
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:21,795
You told me to put a dinner together.

887
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:23,671
Is this really…

888
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:24,714
You're…

889
00:49:26,674 --> 00:49:28,885
- They can eat and go.
- Don't be so shy.

890
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,220
Please go inside.

891
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,183
- Hello, Mr. Gu.
- Hello, Mr. Gu.

892
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,655
Let's take a group photo before we eat.

893
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:51,074
Okay, Hermès.

894
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:52,408
One, two, three.

895
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:55,370
Thank you.

896
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,622
Look at that. You look great.

897
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:03,378
Cheers. Congrats.

898
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:05,046
Thank you.

899
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:06,589
Mr. Gu.

900
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:09,634
Thank you for sparing your time
for our rookie, sir.

901
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:11,719
Please eat.

902
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:13,847
- Maybe a toast?
- Let's just eat.

903
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:16,307
Thank you.

904
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:18,184
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

905
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:43,710
Ms. Cheon.

906
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:44,878
Is it not to your liking?

907
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:48,006
No, it's good.

908
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:49,841
How would you know without having any?

909
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:51,801
Do you not eat raw fish?

910
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,678
I'm fine.

911
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:56,431
Mr. No, prepare a steak for her.

912
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,683
It's a Japanese restaurant.

913
00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:00,143
I know. I meant next door.

914
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:02,186
No, I'm fine, really.

915
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:05,064
Let me know
if any of you can't eat raw fish.

916
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:07,358
I'm fine. I'm not picky.

917
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,652
Me too. I like raw fish.

918
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:13,406
- Should I go?
- I'll be right back.

919
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,121
I thought that was the door.

920
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:31,007
I'm Edward Jung, the head chef
of King Hotel's Western restaurant.

921
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,009
This is an Angus sirloin steak,

922
00:51:33,092 --> 00:51:34,761
a prime T-bone steak,

923
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,930
and an Australian lamb chop steak.

924
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:37,972
Have a lovely dinner.

925
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,266
Thank you.

926
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:50,693
Eat before it gets cold.

927
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:53,071
Will do.

928
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,325
Where are my manners?

929
00:51:57,408 --> 00:51:58,743
Mr. No, cut it for her.

930
00:51:58,826 --> 00:52:00,078
- Yes, sir.
- No, I can do it!

931
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,584
Can you feed yourself?

932
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,420
- Do you need help?
- No.

933
00:52:09,504 --> 00:52:10,838
I'm fine.

934
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,229
Please eat.

935
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:53,631
Why did you call me out here?

936
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:55,967
Are you trying to put me in a tough spot?

937
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:57,593
Why would I?

938
00:52:57,677 --> 00:52:59,679
I didn't ask for a welcome dinner.

939
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:01,556
And what was that huge steak?

940
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:02,807
Did you want to kill me?

941
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:03,891
I didn't…

942
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,728
This wasn't what I had in mind.

943
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:09,856
I saw that you couldn't eat raw fish,
so I got you steak.

944
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:11,357
Why are you angry over that?

945
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,067
You've never had to mind anyone.

946
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:14,569
Of course not.

947
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:16,821
You probably lived like a king
among servants.

948
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:20,158
I feel like I'm on pins and needles

949
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,702
because of your unnecessary kindness.

950
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,038
I already feel self-conscious enough.

951
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:26,372
Why do you feel self-conscious?

952
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:29,500
I was showing consideration
for this dinner I arranged.

953
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:32,170
That wasn't consideration.
It was more like a bomb.

954
00:53:33,171 --> 00:53:35,381
From now on,
just pretend like you don't know me.

955
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,924
I don't need your consideration.

956
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:38,551
Please.

957
00:53:45,683 --> 00:53:47,268
What went wrong?

958
00:53:55,526 --> 00:53:56,944
GONG YU-NAM

959
00:54:17,882 --> 00:54:19,425
Sa-rang!

960
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:22,053
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday.

961
00:54:22,136 --> 00:54:25,598
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

962
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:28,184
-<i>Happy birthday, dear Sa-rang</i>
-<i>Happy birthday, dear Sa-rang</i>

963
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:29,811
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

964
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:33,481
Am I allowed to be this happy?

965
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,817
No, you should be even happier.
This isn't enough.

966
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,569
Yes, so wish for bigger happiness
as you blow these out.

967
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:44,408
CHEON SA-RANG'S BIRTHDAY

968
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:47,078
Happy birthday!

969
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:51,833
You made all this?

970
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,001
Sure, I'm a seasoned homemaker.

971
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,211
Thank you.

972
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:57,421
I'm a seasoned eater.

973
00:54:58,756 --> 00:54:59,882
Okay.

974
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:02,385
Here, open your present.
We picked it out together.

975
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:04,262
Gosh, thank you.

976
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:07,473
Let's see.

977
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:13,396
- What is this?
- Your birthday is tomorrow.

978
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:15,398
You can hang out with us today,

979
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:17,942
then have a wild night
with your boyfriend tomorrow.

980
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:21,821
He won't forget your birthday, right?

981
00:55:21,904 --> 00:55:22,905
He did last year.

982
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,159
Didn't I tell you?

983
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,203
We broke up a while ago.

984
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:31,956
What? Why haven't you told us until now?

985
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:35,501
Sorry, I forgot.
I've been too busy lately.

986
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:36,961
How can you forget that?

987
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:38,504
Are you all right?

988
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:40,756
Yes, I'm fine.

989
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:42,508
I actually feel relieved,

990
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:45,761
almost to the point
where I wonder if I even had a boyfriend.

991
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:47,680
I guess that was it.

992
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:49,307
Will you get back with him?

993
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,143
Never.

994
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:00,776
I'll get the beer. Turn on the music.

995
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:05,198
This is great. It's a party.

996
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:23,341
Sa-rang, get up.

997
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:25,343
Get up and show us.

998
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:26,719
Get up.

999
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:31,933
Let's go!

1000
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:50,493
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

1001
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,166
Do I seem like a guy

1002
00:56:58,125 --> 00:56:59,669
who hasn't had to consider others

1003
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:02,463
because I was born into the right family?

1004
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,048
A bit.

1005
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:06,259
But who dared to tell you such a fact?

1006
00:57:06,342 --> 00:57:07,468
How brave of them.

1007
00:57:10,596 --> 00:57:12,640
Don't mind it though.

1008
00:57:12,723 --> 00:57:14,058
You were born this way.

1009
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:15,643
I'm only jealous.

1010
00:57:15,726 --> 00:57:17,019
Please go inside, Mr. Gu.

1011
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:18,938
I'll stop by King the Land first.

1012
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:20,606
Why?

1013
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,359
It's our kind Ms. Sa-rang's birthday,

1014
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:26,070
so I got her our buffet voucher.

1015
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:27,989
One of the employee benefits.

1016
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:55,141
Look at you, showing your teeth.

1017
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:57,101
Just leave me alone.

1018
00:57:57,184 --> 00:57:59,520
- You might bite me soon.
- I'm not doing anything

1019
00:58:00,229 --> 00:58:02,690
not because I can't fight,
but because I don't want to.

1020
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:05,443
You say you don't want to fight,

1021
00:58:05,526 --> 00:58:08,237
yet you went behind my back
and had a strategy meeting.

1022
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:09,739
I'm in charge of King the Land.

1023
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:11,407
And you're under my charge at work.

1024
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:13,826
Didn't you know you needed

1025
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:16,537
my permission and approval
no matter what you do?

1026
00:58:17,246 --> 00:58:19,957
I didn't know.
I didn't look at the organizational chart.

1027
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,876
I don't know why you came to work here,

1028
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:23,836
but you'll have to fight me for life.

1029
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,505
If you need money,
I'll give you what you want,

1030
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:27,882
so leave.

1031
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:29,508
I have plenty of money.

1032
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:31,552
I'm telling you for your sake.

1033
00:58:32,136 --> 00:58:33,721
Don't end up like your mom.

1034
00:58:36,432 --> 00:58:37,725
See?

1035
00:58:37,808 --> 00:58:39,560
Nobody remembers her.

1036
00:58:40,353 --> 00:58:42,480
Both you and me.

1037
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,025
That's life for a loser.

1038
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:47,652
Okay?

1039
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:51,405
And throw out that pocket watch.

1040
00:58:52,573 --> 00:58:54,075
How childish of you.

1041
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:12,718
Are you looking for this?

1042
00:59:13,594 --> 00:59:15,304
- Give it back.
- I don't want to.

1043
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:19,892
Give it back. It's mine.

1044
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:21,560
She left because she didn't want you.

1045
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,064
So forget about her.

1046
00:59:27,566 --> 00:59:28,818
No!

1047
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:35,950
No…

1048
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:06,147
I'll be the main server.

1049
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,773
You can stand quietly in the back.

1050
01:00:08,816 --> 01:00:11,152
Don't meddle
and try to sell something expensive.

1051
01:00:12,194 --> 01:00:13,237
Yes, I understand.

1052
01:00:20,202 --> 01:00:21,954
I'd like some wine recommendations.

1053
01:00:22,037 --> 01:00:25,082
We recently got nice vintages
of Charrier Margaux and Zeña.

1054
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:27,126
Which would go better with today's meal?

1055
01:00:27,209 --> 01:00:30,671
Let me get the sommelier
to provide a more detailed suggestion.

1056
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:32,339
We can't wait that long.

1057
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:33,841
Give us a suggestion.

1058
01:00:33,924 --> 01:00:37,636
Any bottle will go nicely
with the meal we have today.

1059
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,141
You're that best talent, right?

1060
01:00:43,434 --> 01:00:44,852
Hello, sir.

1061
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:47,563
She still has a great smile.

1062
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:49,565
In that case,

1063
01:00:49,648 --> 01:00:52,276
let's get a suggestion
from the best talent of King Hotel.

1064
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:59,200
In that case, may I suggest the Zeña?

1065
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:01,494
It's a premium wine from Chile.

1066
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:04,288
The smell of blackcurrant
and blackberries mixes nicely

1067
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:08,125
with the smell of vanilla
from the oak barrel,

1068
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:12,046
and you'll feel the fine-grained tannins
with the elegance of full-bodied wine.

1069
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:15,883
I believe it'll go nicely
with your lamb chop steak.

1070
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:18,719
You're well-versed in wine,

1071
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:20,387
almost like an expert.

1072
01:01:20,471 --> 01:01:22,598
I'm a certified sommelier.

1073
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:26,560
I knew I had a discerning eye for people.

1074
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,438
I really want to recruit her.

1075
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,357
I'll pay you twice as much.

1076
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,566
Come work at my hotel.

1077
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:35,152
I'm flattered, sir.

1078
01:01:35,236 --> 01:01:37,488
My goodness.

1079
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:40,074
Should we get the meal ready?

1080
01:01:40,157 --> 01:01:41,992
Sa-rang, what are you doing?

1081
01:01:42,076 --> 01:01:44,161
There's a single-malt package
worth 40 million.

1082
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:45,621
Why did you recommend wine?

1083
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:48,207
You should've made him order whiskey.

1084
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:51,627
This is why we say
you don't have the basics.

1085
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:55,172
But the chairman asked
for a wine recommendation.

1086
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:57,675
And you suggested wine too.

1087
01:01:58,384 --> 01:01:59,301
Whatever.

1088
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:01,178
Make sure to sell more expensive items.

1089
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:02,429
Try upselling.

1090
01:02:04,223 --> 01:02:05,266
Remember that.

1091
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:06,600
Got it?

1092
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:09,645
Yes, I'll remember that.

1093
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:35,004
PERSONNEL RECORD

1094
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:36,839
Mr. Gu.

1095
01:02:36,922 --> 01:02:39,383
If you tell me who you're looking for,
I'll look it up.

1096
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,553
Can a record be left out of the server?

1097
01:02:42,636 --> 01:02:44,555
No, we typed in everyone since year one

1098
01:02:44,638 --> 01:02:46,432
as we digitized our system.

1099
01:02:47,141 --> 01:02:48,309
So why can't I find it?

1100
01:02:49,518 --> 01:02:50,853
It has to be there.

1101
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:53,355
Our payroll and severance pay
are on our accounting system,

1102
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,024
so nobody can delete the records.

1103
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:00,738
Is that everything from 1989?

1104
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:01,697
Yes.

1105
01:03:02,364 --> 01:03:05,159
Who are you looking for if I may ask?

1106
01:03:06,076 --> 01:03:07,077
Never mind.

1107
01:03:15,586 --> 01:03:17,630
Surprise! Happy birthday.

1108
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:20,925
What are you doing?

1109
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:22,593
Let's go.
I made reservations at a nice spot.

1110
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,600
Are you still sulking?

1111
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:30,893
We broke up.

1112
01:03:31,685 --> 01:03:33,270
I said I never wanted to see you again.

1113
01:03:33,354 --> 01:03:35,064
You weren't sulking over the <i>gimbap</i>?

1114
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:39,443
That's why I made a reservation
at a high-end fine dining restaurant.

1115
01:03:39,526 --> 01:03:41,028
Don't sulk over some food.

1116
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:42,112
Hey.

1117
01:03:42,738 --> 01:03:45,282
Do you think
I broke up with you over that?

1118
01:03:45,366 --> 01:03:48,202
If I had, I would've dumped you
hundreds of times already.

1119
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:51,163
What do you take me for
to take what I said that way?

1120
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,665
I'm sorry.

1121
01:03:52,748 --> 01:03:54,625
I'll be really good from now on.
I'm so sorry.

1122
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:56,460
Stop saying you're sorry!

1123
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,173
If you were really sorry,

1124
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:04,051
you wouldn't have acted this way
to begin with.

1125
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:09,014
I'm sick and tired of you.

1126
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:12,142
Let's end this.

1127
01:04:13,602 --> 01:04:14,895
You're really harsh.

1128
01:04:15,813 --> 01:04:18,232
And you're selfish.
You can't make the call alone.

1129
01:04:18,315 --> 01:04:19,274
I can.

1130
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:22,987
My love is over,
so do whatever you want with yours.

1131
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:26,115
I never want to see you again.

1132
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:28,742
Have you always been this harsh?

1133
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:30,285
Are you the Sa-rang I know?

1134
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,247
Let go of me.

1135
01:04:34,498 --> 01:04:36,041
We're now strangers.

1136
01:06:20,604 --> 01:06:21,980
This is my spot.

1137
01:06:24,024 --> 01:06:25,067
Excuse me?

1138
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,821
This is

1139
01:06:30,405 --> 01:06:31,698
my spot.

1140
01:07:22,124 --> 01:07:25,127
KING THE LAND

<i>Your outfit…</i>

1143
01:08:01,788 --> 01:08:04,041
You two look so good together.

1144
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:05,209
I knew it.

1145
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,335
Who are you to…

1146
01:08:07,836 --> 01:08:09,379
<i>She doesn't want to see you anymore.</i>

1147
01:08:10,714 --> 01:08:12,424
- Why are you here?
- Why didn't you reply?

1148
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,551
- Reply to what?
- My text.

1149
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:16,511
- I did.
- And I replied to your reply.

1150
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:17,429
I'm working right now.

1151
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:22,100
I was just acting startled.

1152
01:08:22,184 --> 01:08:23,602
Look, it's a heart.

1153
01:08:24,102 --> 01:08:24,937
It's good.

1154
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,315
Your favorite food, your favorite weather,
your favorite color.

1155
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:29,942
Tell me everything you like.

1156
01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:32,152
Why do you want to know that?
