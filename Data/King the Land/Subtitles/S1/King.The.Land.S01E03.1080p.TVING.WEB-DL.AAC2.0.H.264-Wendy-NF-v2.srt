EPISODE 3

6
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:55,961
Hello.

7
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:56,879
Hello.

8
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,922
Please take extra care in this shoot.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,226
You still don't have it memorized?

10
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,519
No, it's all in my head.

11
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,191
You seem embarrassingly nervous.

12
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:19,777
I'm not nervous.

13
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,236
As if. You're completely stiff.

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,404
No, I'm not.

15
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,823
Okay. We'll perform a camera test.

16
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:26,700
Interviewer, please look at the camera.

17
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:28,243
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:30,788
You <i>are </i>nervous.

19
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,749
That's rich coming from someone

20
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:37,294
who spruced up from head to toe
for a TV appearance.

21
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,962
With the <i>sohalteun</i> style.

22
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:41,965
Soharten style?

23
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,468
- What is that?
- It's how your hair is done now.

24
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,844
- My hair?
- Yes.

25
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,054
It's…

26
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:49,181
exactly the <i>sohalteun</i> style.

27
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:51,642
Soharten style?

28
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:54,061
What kind of hairstyle is that?

29
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,941
Soharten style.

30
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,610
Soharten style.

31
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:04,154

What? <i>So</i> as in cow?

36
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:13,789
We'll begin shooting now.

37
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:15,082
Act natural.

38
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,584
All right. In five, four,

39
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:20,087
three, two, one.

40
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:24,216
Hello, I'm here on King Hotel's rooftop,

41
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,260
-<i>where we have the best view</i>
-She's so pretty.

42
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,262
<i>of Jeju Island's beautiful sunset.</i>

43
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:30,013
Sa-rang looks so good on camera.

44
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:31,306
As if.

45
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,142
-<i>Today, along with Head Manager Gu,</i>
-It's all makeup.

46
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,894
I'll take you
on a virtual tour of King Hotel.

47
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:36,812
Head Manager Gu,

48
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,606
can you say hello to the viewers?

49
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:43,318
Hello, I am Gu Won.

50
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:45,320
- My gosh.
- He's so handsome.

51
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:48,407
<i>Along with the viewers,</i>

52
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,869
<i>the employees of King Hotel
have a lot of questions for you.</i>

53
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:53,996
<i>Before we introduce the hotel,</i>

54
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,456
may I ask you a few questions?

55
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:56,999
Go ahead.

56
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,083
Okay.

57
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,005
Your mother was a founding member
of the Jeju King Hotel.

58
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:05,215
I'm sure being here
must hit you differently.

59
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:12,764
I hear you bear a resemblance
to your mother.

60
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:14,641
In what way do you most take after her?

61
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:36,955
Mr. Gu.

62
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,918
- What's going on?
- Is he leaving?

63
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,669
- Oh, my.
- What is happening?

64
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:43,837
What's going on?

65
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:48,050
Mr. Gu.

66
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:01,980
It seems an urgent matter
has come up for Head Manager Gu.

67
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:04,233
I don't think he knew
this was a live broadcast.

68
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:08,028
Once he returns, I'll let him know.

69
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,079
Come back home
before your mom's memorial service.

70
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,623
Which mom do you mean?

71
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,043
<i>I don't even know</i>

72
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,754
what my mom looks like
or if she's even alive or not.

73
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:27,172
You take after your mom.

74
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,551
You're reckless just like her.

75
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:57,911
How amusing.

76
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,044
The first question touched on
the topic of mothers.

77
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,630
Being here brings back memories

78
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:07,049
of the first time
I went to a hotel by the beach

79
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,926
- She's a natural.
- <i>with my mom.</i>

80
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,094
She's like a news anchor.

81
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:11,553
- You're right.
- Totally.

82
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,763
- She's so good.
- She's articulate.

83
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:15,182
But where did Mr. Gu go?

84
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,600
- Why isn't he coming back?
- Right?

85
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,645
<i>That day that I spent with my mom
was the happiest day of my life.</i>

86
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,815
<i>I even dreamed of living in a hotel
for the rest of my life.</i>

87
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:26,276
<i>That hotel was this very King Hotel.</i>

88
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,319
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

89
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,363
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

90
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:32,616
King Hotel has always been
my joy and my dream.

91
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,537
And I was lucky enough
to start working here!

92
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,416
Now, I want to gift
all the guests of King Hotel

93
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,710
the same happiness that I felt that day.

94
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,342
- Goodness.
- What a relief.

95
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,510
It's fun now.

96
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:52,719
It's worth watching now.

97
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,556
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HEAD MANAGER GU

98
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,224
<i>Were you able to handle your situation?</i>

99
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:58,600
<i>Yes, thanks to you.</i>

100
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,228
Could I take a look
at the interview questions?

101
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,604
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,025
"What memory comes to mind

103
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,485
when you think of your mom?"

104
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,197
"What is your favorite vacation spot
you visited with your mom?"

105
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,492
"What is your favorite meal
cooked by your mom?"

106
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,707
Skip these childish questions

107
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,042
and ask me things
that you're actually curious about.

108
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,221
Do you like watching the sunset?

109
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:38,432
It's so pretty.

110
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:43,729
So the sun was setting.

111
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,189
This is the best spot to see it, right?

112
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:46,106
Let's go watch it.

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,045
Isn't it so beautiful?

114
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:09,880
The sunset is so pretty.

115
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:36,657
<i>What's your deal?</i>

116
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,033
Did I do something wrong?

117
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:39,159
Do you think it's okay

118
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:41,662
for a mere employee
to question the head manager?

119
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:43,831
This may not be a big deal to you,

120
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:46,583
but a mere employee like me
can get fired over this.

121
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,461
Why push yourself so hard?

122
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,463
There are a lot of other hotels out there.

123
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,133
You might work
at daddy's company as a hobby,

124
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:57,803
but some people work hard
just to make ends meet.

125
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,556
I know work is just a time killer for you,

126
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,057
but don't get in my way.

127
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,476
I don't want to get hit
by any stones you threw for fun.

128
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,699
Do you even know

129
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,994
what kind of stone

130
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,955
you threw in my direction today?

131
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,880
Mr. Gu!

132
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:36,091
This place has become
the hottest place to visit.

133
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,759
It's so hot. Gosh, that's hot!

134
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,803
Do you see the number of likes?

135
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:41,221
You did a wonderful job.

136
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,140
Let's go with this concept tomorrow too.

137
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,684
Two beautiful lovebirds in the sunset.

138
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:46,727
A lovely

139
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:48,812
couple.

140
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:52,816
What's with the vibe?

141
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,151
I said it's trending.

142
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:56,570
Tomorrow's shoot will end in an hour.
One photo per location.

143
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:57,779
That's nonsense.

144
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,907
- The shoot isn't a joke--
- I said what I said.

145
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:02,576
It's out of the question, sir.

146
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:04,786
He's so ill-tempered.

147
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:06,872
Sa-rang, keep it up.

148
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,582
We just need a few shots here and there.

149
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,959
Okay.

150
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:12,878
Mr. Gu.

151
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,420
From now on, I'm going to make sure
you guys are in good health.

152
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,338
I've let you write down your weights,

153
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:40,215
but the numbers don't match what I see.

154
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,550
Any objections?

155
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,398
See?

156
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,568
You said you were 51 kg,
but you're actually 51.9 kg.

157
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,279
I rounded down to make the number simpler.

158
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:05,907
Hey, .9 kg equals 1.5 <i>geun</i> of pork belly.

159
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,701
One penalty point for dishonesty.

160
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:13,749
How are you so good
at maintaining your weight?

161
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,834
I learned it all from you.

162
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,836
As expected from the best of the bunch.

163
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,879
You may sit down.

164
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,507
One moment.

165
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:26,678
One moment, please.

166
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,225
Will that make a difference?

167
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,519
Of course. It's a chunk of metal.

168
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,991
Look at this. You're a total fraud.

169
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:51,244
How could you
misreport your weight by 3 kg?

170
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,040
I was definitely 50 kg
the last time I weighed myself.

171
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,459
My bowel movements
have become less frequent lately.

172
00:12:58,502 --> 00:12:59,920
Three kilograms of poop

173
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:02,798
amounts to this much.

174
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,174
I'm sorry. I'll lose weight.

175
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:06,051
Surely you know
how every additional kilogram

176
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,345
burns up tons of fuel for the company.

177
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,265
Weight management is essential
not only for your own self-esteem

178
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:14,392
but also for cutting company costs.

179
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,394
Your lack of care for the company

180
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,105
is the reason why
you haven't been promoted.

181
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,860
All right. Get off the scale.

182
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,612
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,325
Ro-un!

184
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,785
You're exempt from this.

185
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:33,495
I can just tell by looking at you.

186
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,580
Do you work out?

187
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,290
No, I don't do anything.

188
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,918
You were endowed with a good body.

189
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,545
Sit back down.

190
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,798
That's it for today. Good work, everyone.

191
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:46,383
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

192
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:48,176
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

193
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,761
Aren't you going to weigh in?

194
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:51,680
Me?

195
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,265
Yes.

196
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,724
Me?

197
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:01,356
I'll check your weights
before each flight.

198
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,941
So you guys should stay fit.

199
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,192
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

200
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,580
Don't think of going on a diet.

201
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,790
You're already beautiful.

202
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,544
Thank you for saying that,
even if you don't mean it.

203
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,056
Here.

204
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:38,935
What is this?

205
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,146
It's to thank you for last time.

206
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,272
Give it to your mother.

207
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:44,149
It's a scarf recommended
by the national mom.

208
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,156
I'm the one you want to thank,

209
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,200
but the gift is for my mom.

210
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,828
You should be a good son.

211
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,582
Thank you.
I'll make sure to give it to her.

212
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,257
As you already know,
today's concept is "Smile."

213
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:13,053
We're going to capture
your heartfelt smiles for your guests.

214
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:15,931
Director Gu, you'll be the smile king.

215
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,017
Ms. Cheon, you'll be the smile queen.

216
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:21,811
Can we see your smiles?

217
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,024
Thank you.

218
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,945
Your smile is worth
a hundred million dollars.

219
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:31,071
Don't flatter me.

220
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,782
A hundred million dollars, my foot.

221
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:34,991
So fake.

222
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:38,286
Mr. Gu, can you also smile broadly?

223
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,496
Smile, king.

224
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,338
Let's get started.

225
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,548
Shall we?

226
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:51,633
Sure.

227
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:57,389
I don't think he'll smile.

228
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,599
He will once we start.
It's work, after all.

229
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:01,893
I can hear you.

230
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:05,188
Let's start now.

231
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,608
We'll go with the heart pose first.

232
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,694
Ready? Make a heart!

233
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,697
Wonderful. I only see one heart.

234
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,823
There's only one heart.

235
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,783
Why is that? We need one more heart.

236
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,202
Come on, one more heart.

237
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,538
One more, please.

238
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,456
That's it. A heart.

239
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,458
A heart, not a circle!

240
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,335
We need a heart.

241
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,713
Okay. A big heart now!

242
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:31,715
The sizes of your hearts are different.

243
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,842
- This.
- A big heart.

244
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,343
You have to move your arm up.

245
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,387
That's right. A little bit higher.

246
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,680
Show me your heart.

247
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:41,725
Yes, I see it's coming up.

248
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,769
Please make a heart.
Let's fill the whole world with hearts.

249
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,104
That's it.

250
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,440
Something is…

251
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,276
That's nice,

252
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:53,528
but try to make it smoother.

253
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:54,904
Okay. Now smile!

254
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,573
You're doing great, Ms. Cheon.

255
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:58,241
Amazing!

256
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:01,953
It would be lovely
if Mr. Gu could smile slightly.

257
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:03,872
The smile should be natural.

258
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,959
Okay.

259
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,128
You just need to smile once.

260
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,380
Please. Excuse me?

261
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,382
Thank you.

262
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:17,969
The punk didn't smile once.

263
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,892
I mean,

264
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,227
he's begging you to smile.

265
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,437
Can't you smile just once?

266
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,356
- I don't want to.
- I don't feel like smiling either.

267
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,273
Then don't.

268
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,942
We're in the middle of a shoot.

269
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:35,904
Didn't I tell you not to get in my way?

270
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:38,114
Didn't I tell you not to fake a smile?

271
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,491
I'm working right now.

272
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,702
I know you got the job through nepotism,
but can you not even do this much?

273
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:44,204
It's not that I can't.

274
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:45,205
I'm choosing not to.

275
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,456
Please. I don't think so.

276
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,752
My only flaw is that
there is nothing that I can't do.

277
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:54,297
Oh, so you're good at everything,
but you can't smile.

278
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:55,715
I said I'm choosing not to.

279
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:57,342
I see.

280
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:58,885
Let's get started.

281
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,013
Okay.

282
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:04,140
Remember to smile, okay?

283
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,475
All right.

284
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,936
Ready? Smile!

285
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,491
Mr. Gu?

286
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:23,868
Not a smirk, please.

287
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:33,711
That's enough.

288
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:37,090
The next one is the last, right?
Let's make it quick.

289
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,935
I knew that punk would do this.

290
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,396
What do we do?

291
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,981
- Can't we change the model?
- Sir.

292
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,315
I think this will work.

293
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:56,526
- What do you mean?
- Let's photoshop this.

294
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,071
We can move up the corner of his mouth
and make it look like he's smiling.

295
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,157
You can do that?

296
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,367
You bet.

297
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:10,748
You want me

298
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:13,460
- to get on this boat?
- Yes, sir.

299
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:17,338
You'll be showing people
how fresh King Hotel's ingredients are.

300
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:19,507
Whatever. I detest boats--

301
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,802
I know that, but you just need to
hold a tilefish for a second.

302
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:25,263
The photographer
will take care of the rest.

303
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:29,142
Then what about you?

304
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:30,226
Me?

305
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,312
I'm obviously going to stay here.

306
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,147
I detest boats.

307
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,899
Plus, I'm not a model.

308
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:37,609
Can't you go with us?

309
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,236
I don't want to go with just him.

310
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,489
I don't want to go with you either.

311
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:45,158
I also desperately want to go
with you guys, but I can't.

312
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,327
I have a lot on my plate.

313
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:50,079
Well, it looks like it's going to rain.

314
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:51,664
- Is the weather okay?
- Yes.

315
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,791
I checked the forecast. You'll be fine.

316
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,709
Are you sure?

317
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,920
- Are you making things up?
- No.

318
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:58,171
I'm positive.

319
00:19:58,254 --> 00:19:59,797
- The weather's fine, right?
- Yes.

320
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:00,924
Great.

321
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,175
It's definitely okay.

322
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:04,093
Then be careful out there. Stay safe.

323
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,094
Right, Mr. Gu.

324
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:06,429
Please…

325
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:08,973
- Hermès.
- Why you…

326
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:11,768
Be careful.

327
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:22,946
Mr. Gu,

328
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,532
pick up the biggest and freshest fish.

329
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,700
Ms. Cheon, you just have to face Mr. Gu

330
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:30,203
and smile broadly. Okay?

331
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:32,413
All right.

332
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,831
We're going to start now.

333
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:40,380
Can you give it a shake
to make it look like it's alive?

334
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,756
Good.

335
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,509
- More.
- Yes, more. Nice.

336
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:46,302
Make it look like it's flailing around.

337
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:48,638
A little more, please. More.

338
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:49,931
That's great.

339
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,349
Isn't the tilefish too small?

340
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:52,976
I can enlarge it with Photoshop.

341
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:54,852
- You can do that?
- Sure.

342
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:56,854
Okay. Keep going.

343
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:59,148
Imagine the fish being super large.

344
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,191
It's so heavy.

345
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:02,652
Good job, Ms. Cheon.

346
00:21:02,735 --> 00:21:05,029
Make him carry it with both hands.

347
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,949
Okay. Can you please hold it
with both hands?

348
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,410
It's so heavy.

349
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:12,954
It's so big and heavy.
Remember those two things.

350
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,622
That's right. It's so heavy.

351
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,957
Even more. Great.

352
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,500
Gosh, it's so heavy.

353
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,377
Just a little bit more. That's great--

354
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:26,551
He just set it free.

355
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:30,680
How heavy.

356
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,438
- Let's go home. End the shoot.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,732
We're done shooting.

358
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,692
Good work.

359
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:45,069
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

360
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,885
The boat is acting strange,

361
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:11,220
and the weather doesn't look too good.

362
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:12,972
Should I steer toward Gapado?

363
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:14,098
No, just keep going.

364
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:16,517
I'm telling you,
something's wrong with the boat.

365
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,353
We don't want to get hit by a typhoon.

366
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:20,855
I hate boats, the sea, and typhoons.

367
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:21,773
So let's hurry.

368
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,691
Then you can swim back for all I care.

369
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,026
What nonsense is…

370
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:30,740
Tell him to start the boat.

371
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,910
- Me?
- Your boss just gave you an order.

372
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,162
Go ahead.

373
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:37,080
Yes, sir.

374
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,211
- Excuse me, sir.
- Don't.

375
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:47,256
He said no.

376
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,591
Tell him it's a no for me too.

377
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,095
I can't.

378
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:54,680
He said no

379
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:56,933
and that you can swim back
if you really want to go.

380
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:19,288
Ms. Gang, good morning.

381
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:20,915
You're so full of energy already.

382
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:23,709
It's a must if I want to win
the incentive again this month.

383
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,253
Yes, let's keep our spirits up.

384
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,171
What is all of this?

385
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,800
- Snacks?
- Yes.

386
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:32,927
I specifically told you not to buy any.

387
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:37,265
I was told you didn't actually mean that.

388
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:39,183
What?

389
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,811
What are you bringing tomorrow?

390
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:44,564
Ms. Gang told me not to bring anything.

391
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,899
You're so dense.

392
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:48,401
Did you really believe that?

393
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,652
But Ms. Gang--

394
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:53,030
What she meant was
to cut down on the amount.

395
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,616
You have to take her words
with a grain of salt.

396
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,006
No one is allowed
to take weekends off anymore.

397
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:10,965
Only I'll do that.

398
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:15,094
Didn't you say we could take weekends off?

399
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:17,805
- What happened?
- It's always been like that.

400
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,682
Has anyone besides the manager
gotten weekends off?

401
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,058
No.

402
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:22,727
I heard you made Yu-bin buy snacks again.

403
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,145
Do as you want.

404
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:26,314
I'll also do as the old managers did.

405
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,315
That's our tradition.

406
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,317
- It's not what you think…
- What's wrong?

407
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,277
You have the right
to be treated like seniors,

408
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,987
but the junior member
doesn't deserve the same?

409
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,198
I was shortsighted.

410
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:37,116
Let's go back to our old ways.

411
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,202
Yu-bin will take care of
our food and snacks.

412
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:40,912
And only I get to rest on weekends.

413
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:41,829
Understood?

414
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,665
I'm sorry, ma'am. I had poor judgment.

415
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,043
This is your last chance.

416
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:48,544
I won't let it slide next time.

417
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:51,005
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

418
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:52,840
I hope no one is treated unfairly,

419
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,842
at least for the duration of my tenure.

420
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:58,012
Once I quit,
you guys can do whatever you want.

421
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:03,100
Let's have coffee before we start.
I'll go get it.

422
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:09,106
Then, I would like an iced Americano.

423
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,150
Iced tea for me, please.

424
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:13,903
- All right.
- What about you, Ha-neul?

425
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,865
I want a condensed milk latte
with whipped cream.

426
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:19,534
Not a mocha?

427
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,327
- Get ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

428
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,081
GAPADO

429
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:31,504
If you keep going straight,
you'll see a cottage.

430
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:33,130
You should stay there for tonight.

431
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:36,008
It's the best hotel in Gapado.

432
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:37,134
Make sure you go there.

433
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:38,970
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:50,189
Aren't you coming?

435
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,363
I'm going alone then.

436
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:06,664
There's no service.

437
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,851
Wait.

438
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:44,869
Hold on.

439
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:49,373
It can't be

440
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,417
that house over there, right?

441
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:53,711
Why? Are you scared?

442
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:55,588
No.

443
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,300
That word isn't in my vocabulary.

444
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,218
If I were scared,

445
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:03,179
I would've taken the lead like you,

446
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,431
not guarded the rear like this.

447
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,312
It's just a chicken.

448
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,651
I'm usually not afraid of anything.

449
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:18,986
But I hate birds. That rascal.

450
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,738
- Then do you want to go first?
- No.

451
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:22,990
Just admit that you're scared.

452
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,825
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

453
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,536
I already told you.
It's not because I'm scared.

454
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,246
I'm just trying to cover our backs.

455
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:32,833
Okay.

456
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,252
Follow me. I'll go first.

457
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:36,879
Did I

458
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:38,631
ever tell you

459
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,258
that I box

460
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,386
as a hobby?

461
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:06,826
What was that for?

462
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:29,429
Jeez.

463
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,677
Cheon Sa-rang.

464
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:12,931
Cheon Sa-rang!

465
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:29,739
Cheon Sa-rang.

466
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,085
Why did you come out from there?

467
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:43,503
What?

468
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,297
Oh, my. You're awake?

469
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,674
Look at you.

470
00:29:47,757 --> 00:29:49,134
You're a strapping young lad,

471
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:50,719
yet look at you shaking in your boots.

472
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:51,970
Goodness.

473
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,057
Your wife will have her hands full
because of you.

474
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,267
My wife?

475
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,978
You better carry your wife around a lot.

476
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:01,813
You fainted in the middle of the road,

477
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:04,941
and she carried you
all the way here on her own.

478
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:07,027
Do you even realize
how hard it must've been?

479
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,153
Tell me about it.

480
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:11,489
I've never seen anyone faint
upon seeing someone's face.

481
00:30:16,036 --> 00:30:17,329
Where are we?

482
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:18,663
What do you mean?

483
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:22,083
You're at the most luxurious hotel

484
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:25,170
as well as the best restaurant in Gapado.

485
00:30:25,795 --> 00:30:27,172
Are you on your honeymoon?

486
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:29,090
- No.
- No!

487
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:31,051
Then are you two a fling?

488
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,512
There's nothing between us.
He's just my superior.

489
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:35,472
Goodness.

490
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:38,433
A superior can become a lover,
and a lover can become a father.

491
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:39,893
There's not much to it.

492
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,854
I don't just go around
dating anyone, ma'am.

493
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:44,397
What do you mean by "anyone"?

494
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:45,732
How am I "anyone"?

495
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:48,318
I'm the one who should be saying that.

496
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,986
Yes, sure.

497
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,864
I'm telling you, I'm not just anyone!

498
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:53,823
Right.

499
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,785
I knew it.

500
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:58,703
The face is what completes the look.

501
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:01,581
My clothes have found
their rightful owner.

502
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:04,209
You can continue
your lover's quarrel later.

503
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:05,293
Let's have a drink.

504
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,212
- It's not like that!
- It's not like that!

505
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:18,431
Have you ever heard of
the famous Chinese bushclover wine?

506
00:31:18,932 --> 00:31:21,059
Even if we have important guests,

507
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,687
we don't usually bring this out.

508
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,524
After my old man drank this,

509
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:30,985
I delivered eight babies,
one after the other.

510
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:37,701
Do you like drinking?

511
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,870
He's so frail.
He's probably a lightweight.

512
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:42,497
But I'll take a drink.

513
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,833
What did you say? "Frail"?

514
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,878
I'm going to drink out of this.
Please fill it to the brim.

515
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,046
This is pretty strong.

516
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,172
Will you be okay?

517
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:52,841
If that's the case,

518
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:54,384
I will

519
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:56,052
use this.

520
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,222
Me too.

521
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:01,057
- All right.
- Okay.

522
00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:46,770
Gosh, the liquor is weak.

523
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:48,646
I can chug it down so easily.

524
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,356
This tastes like water.

525
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,399
Give me more, please.

526
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,526
- Fill it to the brim, please.
- Sure.

527
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:55,153
You know your alcohol.

528
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:59,908
Being young is great, isn't it?

529
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:03,495
Here you go.

530
00:33:04,454 --> 00:33:05,705
You gave me a lot.

531
00:33:18,676 --> 00:33:19,719
This is nice.

532
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:25,809
I told you not to smile.

533
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:29,479
I wasn't smiling at you.

534
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:31,564
Don't look at me then.

535
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:34,234
Why are you so irritable?

536
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,903
You're always complaining.
You grumpy pants.

537
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:41,032
It's because nothing works out
whenever I'm with you.

538
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,117
From now on,

539
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:44,077
you better

540
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:46,955
stay out of my sight.

541
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,084
You can't order me around!

542
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,669
We're not at work right now.

543
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:59,092
- Hey!
- What?

544
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:02,804
Did you just

545
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,181
smack me?

546
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:07,267
How dare you?

547
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:09,519
"How dare you," my ass.

548
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:10,728
"My ass"?

549
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:13,481
Don't regret this later.

550
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,817
I won't.

551
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,403
Regretting doesn't change anything.

552
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:19,863
Okay, just you wait.

553
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:22,991
I'm going to really
make you regret what you just did.

554
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:28,329
I'm not someone
who you can just hit and mistreat.

555
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,164
All people are the same.

556
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,834
That means
everyone should be treated equally.

557
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,255
No one should be mistreated!

558
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:40,967
Do you think you're all that
because you're rich?

559
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:43,177
Don't be such a snob.

560
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,307
"Snob"?

561
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,224
Yes.

562
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:51,686
People who take power trips
because they're well-off.

563
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:55,857
It's hard enough having to bow and scrape

564
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,067
to rude guests every day.

565
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:01,571
And now I have to deal with your crap too.

566
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:04,741
On top of that,

567
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,910
you're the king of all snobs.

568
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,536
King.

569
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,496
King Hotel. King.

570
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,081
Snob… Gu.

571
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:13,499
Snobby Gu.

572
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,422
If I'm a snob, let me see…

573
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,174
You are

574
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:23,760
- that.
- What?

575
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,678
Faced. That's it, faced.

576
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,097
Faced. Two-faced.

577
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:29,349
You're so fake.

578
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:30,266
Phony Cheon.

579
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:32,226
Look.

580
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,271
Do you think it's easy to fake a smile?

581
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,774
- Not anyone can do it.
- Look at you.

582
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:40,652
It's a high-level technique.

583
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:44,155
I've developed it
by putting up with all sorts of asses.

584
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:46,240
A certain imperviousness.

585
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:49,702
Sure. What a nice technique.

586
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:51,371
Don't be absurd.

587
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:55,375
Hey, Snobby Gu.

588
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,712
Why don't you just pour me a drink?

589
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:03,216
"Hey"?

590
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:04,759
Hey.

591
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:06,511
Pour me a drink.

592
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:07,971
You must be joking.

593
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,685
Give me some.

594
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:19,440
It's only up to today

595
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:21,985
that I'm letting you off the hook.

596
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,152
Why would you?

597
00:36:23,861 --> 00:36:25,571
Do whatever you want.
You have that freedom.

598
00:36:26,823 --> 00:36:29,909
You can do whatever you want
without caring how others see you.

599
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:31,452
I'm so jealous.

600
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:34,872
You don't know what it's like to be me.
Watch what you say.

601
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,000
Of course I don't.

602
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,128
But you don't have to fake a smile.

603
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:42,839
That in itself is a huge privilege.

604
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:46,801
I'm always smiling.

605
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:51,472
I smile even when I'm hurt or sad.

606
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:56,269
But it's better that I suffer the pain.

607
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:59,605
If someone else suffered because of me,

608
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:03,067
that would make me feel even worse.

609
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,533
But why do you dislike smiling so much?

610
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:23,713
Because everyone wears it as a mask.

611
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:25,840
It's all fake.

612
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:30,720
I'm sure there was
a sincere person among them.

613
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,765
That's pretty sad.

614
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,900
How pretty.

615
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:23,523
Didn't I tell you not to smile?

616
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,735
That wasn't a fake smile.

617
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,362
It was genuine.

618
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:32,406
I don't care.

619
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:34,617
Just don't smile.

620
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:38,287
I'm not even working right now.

621
00:38:38,371 --> 00:38:40,164
Why can't I smile when I feel like it?

622
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:41,916
From now on,

623
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,086
even outside of working hours,

624
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:47,338
smiling…

625
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,383
in front of me…

626
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:55,638
is not permitted.

627
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,850
Why not?

628
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:01,352
No.

629
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,188
I'm not listening to you.

630
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:07,233
No. I'm going to keep smiling.

631
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:10,069
Whatever.

632
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:14,907
Just pour me another drink.

633
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:16,951
Okay?

634
00:40:27,897 --> 00:40:29,398
SUITES

635
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,078
Snobby Gu.

636
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:44,830
Snobby Gu.

637
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,795
It's cold.

638
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,843
Don't smile in front of me.

639
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:29,125
My head.

640
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:49,562
My gosh. I must be crazy.

641
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:51,647
I didn't even take
my socks off last night.

642
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:55,318
Goodness!

643
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:16,088
Phony Cheon.

644
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:20,259
Why don't you get off of me?

645
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:27,516
Why are you sleeping here?

646
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,894
Since this is my room.

647
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:31,312
But this is my room.

648
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:33,814
I clearly heard "two rooms" yesterday,
and there were two doors.

649
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:39,820
ONE ROOM IF USED BY A COUPLE,
TWO ROOMS IF USED BY STRANGERS

650
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:42,823
I thought this was
the best hotel in Gapado.

651
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,769
What are you doing?

652
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:15,207
You have some time
until the boat gets here.

653
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,500
Why don't you take a lap?

654
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,085
I don't like walking.

655
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,296
You can't take in everything on foot.

656
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,173
- You need to be on wheels.
- I see.

657
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,717
I can see everything from here.

658
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,470
The scenery of Gapado
should not just be seen with the eyes.

659
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:29,722
It must be engraved in the heart.

660
00:44:29,805 --> 00:44:31,640
Just go and bike around with your wife.

661
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:42,985
Where did you get that from?

662
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:45,362
It's from the old man.

663
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:47,031
Do you want to hop on?

664
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:51,494
No. We're not close enough
to ride a bike together.

665
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:53,621
Yes, you're so right about that.

666
00:44:56,415 --> 00:44:59,835
But I hear it's impossible to see
even a quarter of the island on foot,

667
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:02,046
so I'm just trying to do you a favor.

668
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:05,382
The view from over there

669
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,510
is apparently very nice.

670
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:13,682
Is there only one bike?

671
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:16,018
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

672
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,863
Can I hop on?

673
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:44,296
Are you tired?

674
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,297
What?

675
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:46,966
You're not tired, are you?

676
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:48,842
This is a cakewalk.

677
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:02,815
It's the sea.

678
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,037
It's so pretty here.

679
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:19,873
Isn't it beautiful?

680
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,584
Not really.

681
00:46:39,393 --> 00:46:40,311
Here.

682
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:44,523
Send me the receipt.

683
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,736
All you have to do is say thank you.

684
00:46:49,987 --> 00:46:51,030
Thanks.

685
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:52,448
Send me the receipt.

686
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:11,383
Sorry? How much?

687
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:14,386
675,000 won.

688
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,304
How?

689
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:18,390
It costs 200,000 won per suite.

690
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:19,808
So it's 400,000 won for 2.

691
00:47:20,392 --> 00:47:23,437
The moonlight dinner was 120,000 won

692
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,315
and the wine wasn't included,
so another 100,000 won.

693
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:28,025
So that's 620,000 won.

694
00:47:28,108 --> 00:47:29,902
And the bike rental costs 55,000 won.

695
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:33,405
So the total comes out to 675,000 won.

696
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:37,201
But we used one room.

697
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:40,204
Did you two sleep together last night?

698
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,455
- No.
- No.

699
00:47:41,538 --> 00:47:43,624
So then you used two separate rooms.

700
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:45,042
We accept credit cards too.

701
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,378
That's ridiculous. You're ripping us off.

702
00:47:47,461 --> 00:47:48,754
It's fine. It's just money.

703
00:47:49,505 --> 00:47:50,839
I didn't bring my wallet.

704
00:47:51,924 --> 00:47:53,509
Can I pay with this?

705
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:56,387
This isn't a pawnshop.

706
00:47:57,012 --> 00:47:58,180
I won't accept that.

707
00:47:58,263 --> 00:48:00,432
I thought you said
you accept credit cards.

708
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:01,600
The card's in here.

709
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:03,143
So I'll pay with this.

710
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:04,978
There's a card in there?

711
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:06,605
Do you expect me to believe that?

712
00:48:06,688 --> 00:48:09,191
Did you think you could fool me,

713
00:48:09,274 --> 00:48:10,734
thinking I'm some old hillbilly?

714
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:12,277
What's gotten you all worked up?

715
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:14,113
- These people…
- Good thing you're here.

716
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:15,280
Something seems fishy.

717
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:18,283
You had a grand old time
eating and drinking here last night.

718
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:20,786
Who are you calling fishy
when you're refusing to pay?

719
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:21,703
What?

720
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:22,955
They didn't pay you, Mom?

721
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:24,373
No.

722
00:48:24,456 --> 00:48:25,916
- Mom?
- Mom?

723
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:27,751
I thought you were a chaebol.

724
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,253
Why the fuss over chump change?

725
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:30,712
That's not it.

726
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:32,172
Take a look at this.

727
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:34,425
I was going to pay

728
00:48:35,426 --> 00:48:37,928
- with this.
- What is that?

729
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:40,305
This isn't a pawnshop.
What the heck is this?

730
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:43,475
Anyway, if you don't pay,
I'm not starting the boat.

731
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:47,646
Then give me your account number.

732
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:49,940
I'll tell my assistant
to wire you the money.

733
00:48:50,482 --> 00:48:51,316
Hold on.

734
00:48:54,194 --> 00:48:56,488
Ma'am, even if the room
we slept in last night

735
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:58,657
is the best suite in Gapado,

736
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,326
compared to King Hotel,
100,000 won will do for one night.

737
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,495
I'll accept 150,000 won,
but no more than that.

738
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:06,874
This may be a tourist spot, but dinner
should cost no more than 50,000 won.

739
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:08,417
Bike rentals are usually
10,000 won per person.

740
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,169
I'll leave the wine price at 100,000 won.

741
00:49:10,252 --> 00:49:11,712
Then the total is 320,000 won,

742
00:49:11,795 --> 00:49:13,422
but including the borrowed clothes,

743
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:15,841
we'll pay you 350,000 won.

744
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:21,263
Why do you need to cut the price in half
when you're a chaebol?

745
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:22,890
Can you rip people off if they're rich?

746
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:24,683
I could report you for price gouging.

747
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:28,020
Gosh, you youngsters are so petty.

748
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:30,898
Just pay the price and leave in peace.

749
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:34,359
By the looks of it, you guys are related.

750
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,321
Was the boat even malfunctioning?

751
00:49:37,404 --> 00:49:38,322
What?

752
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:39,990
Malfunctioning?

753
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:41,617
Yes. Very much so.

754
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:44,995
You're not using Jeju dialect today.

755
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,289
Is that so?

756
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,709
350,000 won.

757
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:52,419
We can wire it right away.

758
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:54,004
Okay. It's a deal.

759
00:49:55,672 --> 00:49:56,715
Deal.

760
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:17,319
Why did you waste your energy
when I could've easily paid for it?

761
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:20,697
You've never had to check
the price of anything, have you?

762
00:50:22,574 --> 00:50:23,700
Why would I?

763
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:25,786
Most people do

764
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:27,996
to make sure that the price is reasonable

765
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,790
and that they can afford it.

766
00:50:30,415 --> 00:50:32,459
My grandma taught me
that money doesn't grow on trees.

767
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:34,753
They were obviously trying to swindle us.

768
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:36,630
It's wrong to deceive others.

769
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:40,175
Money should be earned honestly.

770
00:50:41,635 --> 00:50:42,469
But why?

771
00:50:43,595 --> 00:50:44,805
What do you mean?

772
00:50:44,888 --> 00:50:46,723
To preserve one's integrity.

773
00:50:57,985 --> 00:50:59,027
Also…

774
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:02,990
I'm sorry about the other day.

775
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,409
About what?

776
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,869
The stone that I supposedly threw at you.

777
00:51:08,453 --> 00:51:10,163
I don't know what it was,

778
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:14,501
but the look in your eyes
told me you were hurt by it.

779
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,214
Right. That stone.

780
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:22,426
I forgot about that.

781
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:46,783
This is delicious.

782
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:47,993
It's amazing with beer.

783
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:50,120
Right? I got it at the airport
because I was short on time,

784
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:51,413
but it's pretty good.

785
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:54,499
So did the live broadcast go well?

786
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,835
Yes. Fortunately, people enjoyed it.

787
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:59,046
What is your head manager like?

788
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:02,716
How should I put it?

789
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:04,301
He's

790
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:05,886
a stuck-up jerk.

791
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:07,721
- What about his looks?
- He looks like one too.

792
00:52:07,804 --> 00:52:09,097
He's the heir of King Group.

793
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:11,099
It'd be weirder for him not to be.

794
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,935
Right. Did you give him the scarf?

795
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:15,979
What? Are you seeing someone?

796
00:52:16,855 --> 00:52:18,440
No, he's just a junior.

797
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:22,444
- Isn't it time for Cho-rong to come home?
- Yes.

798
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:24,363
- Let's go. We'll see you off.
- Okay.

799
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,872
How is it that all three of us
still don't own a car?

800
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:35,874
I know, right?

801
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,794
If one of us had a car,
we could go for a drive.

802
00:52:38,877 --> 00:52:41,046
Hey, why don't you buy a car?

803
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:42,589
I don't have the money.

804
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:43,799
Then what about you?

805
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:45,300
I don't have a license.

806
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:48,053
How could you not have a license
at your age?

807
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:49,930
It should be you. You have both.

808
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:50,931
She's right.

809
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:52,766
Let's get one to celebrate your promotion.

810
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:53,684
- Yes.
- Hey.

811
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:55,936
I only get paid
an extra 20,000 won per month.

812
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:56,937
20,000 won?

813
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,189
Yes. 20,000 won, not 20,000 dollars.

814
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,984
I'm so consistent, aren't I?

815
00:53:03,902 --> 00:53:05,404
The bus is here. I'm leaving.

816
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:07,948
Hey, Gang Darong.

817
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:11,618
You're doing great.
You're the best out of us three.

818
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:14,246
Bye!

819
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:16,391
Was that the best you could do?

820
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:19,853
How could you storm off
because of that one question?

821
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:21,438
As a businessman,

822
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:24,524
a lot of things can and will happen.

823
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:27,652
What sort of head manager
behaves worse than a mere employee?

824
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:30,906
We attracted a lot of views
and it was great publicity.

825
00:54:30,989 --> 00:54:32,324
It's the outcome that matters.

826
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:36,036
The methods aren't important.
That's what I learned from you.

827
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,496
Did you raise those views?

828
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,289
Did we gain publicity because of you?

829
00:54:39,372 --> 00:54:41,041
You made a mess,

830
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:43,418
and a mere employee cleaned it up for you!

831
00:54:43,502 --> 00:54:44,377
Aren't you ashamed?

832
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:45,837
But it all turned out well.

833
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:50,175
How long will you fuss over this?

834
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:54,054
You're too old to be looking for your mom!

835
00:54:55,889 --> 00:54:57,307
I'm not looking for her.

836
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:00,977
I just want to know the truth.

837
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:02,938
The only truth you need to know

838
00:55:04,064 --> 00:55:05,565
is the company's profit and stock prices.

839
00:55:06,274 --> 00:55:08,819
The only thing
that can be trusted is money.

840
00:55:09,402 --> 00:55:11,404
Love? Laughter?

841
00:55:11,988 --> 00:55:13,281
Kindness? Respect?

842
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:15,283
It's all a lie!

843
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:18,954
What about Mom?

844
00:55:21,414 --> 00:55:22,707
Was that a lie too?

845
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:29,214
There's no such thing as love

846
00:55:30,465 --> 00:55:31,675
for people in our station.

847
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,019
Then what is there?

848
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,896
Duty.

849
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,150
It is my duty to protect
what my father passed down to me,

850
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:52,320
and it is your duty
to protect what I've accomplished.

851
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:53,822
Love?

852
00:55:53,905 --> 00:55:56,449
Don't be foolish.
Just be good at your job!

853
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:58,910
If you're going to
talk about your mom again, leave.

854
00:55:58,994 --> 00:55:59,953
No.

855
00:56:01,246 --> 00:56:02,998
I still need to know the truth.

856
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,986
Why don't you rest up
since you're finally home?

857
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:36,156
Though it seems like
you'll get kicked out soon.

858
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:39,326
There's no need to be scared of me.

859
00:56:40,452 --> 00:56:41,286
What?

860
00:56:42,287 --> 00:56:44,289
I said I had no interest in the company.

861
00:56:45,206 --> 00:56:47,751
I warned you not to mess with me,
yet look what you did.

862
00:56:48,877 --> 00:56:50,295
In a childish way at that.

863
00:56:50,879 --> 00:56:52,005
Me, scared of you?

864
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:53,506
Don't provoke me.

865
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:57,385
You're just a nobody.
How dare you get smart with me?

866
00:56:59,512 --> 00:57:00,889
You better quit acting up.

867
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:27,624
Sa-rang, I enjoyed the live broadcast.

868
00:57:27,707 --> 00:57:28,708
You did great.

869
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:32,045
You're the star of our hotel now.

870
00:57:32,587 --> 00:57:33,588
You were so cool.

871
00:57:33,672 --> 00:57:35,257
It was nothing, but thank you.

872
00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:37,467
Goodness.

873
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,678
Look at you guys celebrating over nothing.

874
00:57:41,721 --> 00:57:44,975
Do you think you're famous now
after one TV appearance?

875
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:46,559
Anyone could've done as much.

876
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:48,687
Had it been me,
it would've hit 10 million views.

877
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:49,938
You know that, right?

878
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:54,317
Right this way, sir.

879
00:57:55,026 --> 00:57:56,653
Hello.

880
00:57:57,654 --> 00:57:59,239
Thank you all for your hard work.

881
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,954
You must be her. Cheon Sa-rang.

882
00:58:06,538 --> 00:58:07,664
Our best talent.

883
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:09,791
Yes, sir. I'm Cheon Sa-rang.

884
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:11,501
Who hired her?

885
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:12,627
I did.

886
00:58:13,753 --> 00:58:15,797
The broadcast told me everything.

887
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,425
I get why the guests chose you
as the best employee.

888
00:58:19,217 --> 00:58:22,137
You're good at thinking on your feet
and handling crises.

889
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,096
And you're kind-hearted.

890
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:24,973
Thank you, sir.

891
00:58:25,557 --> 00:58:29,269
Being chosen as the best talent
for two years in a row

892
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:31,229
is any concierge's crowning glory.

893
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:34,524
It's an honor for me to have
such an excellent employee at my hotel.

894
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:36,234
Not at all.

895
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:39,195
I am honored
to be able to work at King Hotel.

896
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:42,073
Starting tomorrow,

897
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:44,159
work at King the Land.

898
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:46,202
Pardon?

899
00:58:46,286 --> 00:58:48,204
Didn't you say King Hotel
has been your joy and dream

900
00:58:48,288 --> 00:58:49,622
ever since you were young?

901
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,584
As the employee
who loves our hotel the most,

902
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:55,587
you should be given the opportunity
to rise to its highest point.

903
00:59:18,276 --> 00:59:22,989
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

904
01:00:00,068 --> 01:00:01,069
What are you doing?

905
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:04,322
What's making you smile like that?
Let me see.

906
01:00:08,034 --> 01:00:10,412
This isn't the time for you
to indulge in narcissism.

907
01:00:10,495 --> 01:00:11,663
Did you even knock?

908
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:12,747
Over ten times.

909
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:15,625
You couldn't hear me
because you were so entranced.

910
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:18,753
Also, the PR team
already selected the photos,

911
01:00:18,837 --> 01:00:20,088
so you don't have to look at them.

912
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:22,006
Here. Why don't you review this first?

913
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,884
I put this report together myself.

914
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:27,053
I hear you'll be attending
the board meetings from now on.

915
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:29,180
I compiled profit and loss statements
from the past three years,

916
01:00:29,264 --> 01:00:31,641
a comparative analysis of
major competitors' marketing strategies,

917
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:34,352
this year's business plan,
next year's business goals…

918
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:36,438
You're not listening to me.

919
01:00:36,521 --> 01:00:40,066
So the PR team already chose the photos?

920
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,443
Yes, sir.

921
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:45,113
Why don't I take a look?

922
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:51,494
Is this a tilefish or a whale?

923
01:00:51,578 --> 01:00:52,871
The fish hardly matters.

924
01:00:52,954 --> 01:00:54,581
You should look at your face.

925
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:56,291
The photographer is so kind.

926
01:00:56,374 --> 01:00:58,126
He even photoshopped your face.

927
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,923
- What is this?
- This one was the most natural

928
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:05,383
out of the ones that were photoshopped.

929
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:07,677
That's why you should've smiled
when they asked.

930
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,304
Bring him to me immediately.

931
01:01:10,138 --> 01:01:11,097
The photographer?

932
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,100
- Bring him to me.
- Yes, sir.

933
01:01:48,676 --> 01:01:49,928
What am I even doing?

934
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:59,229
UNBELIEVABLY ACCURATE PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST

935
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:02,899
HOW DO YOU TRULY FEEL ABOUT THEM?

936
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:17,956
"I am always waiting
for that person's text."

937
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:18,915
"Yes."

938
01:02:18,998 --> 01:02:20,917
"Maybe. No."

939
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:23,962
Maybe?

940
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:24,879
MAYBE

941
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,215
"I have set up an appointment

942
01:02:27,298 --> 01:02:29,092
to meet this person in private before."

943
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:30,635
No.

944
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:34,681
"This person's number is saved
in my phone with a nickname."

945
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:37,725
Phony Cheon.

946
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:38,851
Yes.

947
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:40,687
Next…

948
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:46,317
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THEM
EVEN WHEN I TRY NOT TO

949
01:02:49,404 --> 01:02:52,657
"I can't help but think about them

950
01:02:53,992 --> 01:02:55,577
even when I try not to."

951
01:02:57,495 --> 01:03:01,499
YES

952
01:03:07,338 --> 01:03:08,631
NO

953
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,641
YES, NO

954
01:03:18,725 --> 01:03:20,435
YES

955
01:03:22,061 --> 01:03:23,938
"I can't help but smile

956
01:03:26,232 --> 01:03:28,735
when I see this person smile."

957
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:44,417
YES

958
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:48,463
YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON THEM

959
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:53,843
<i>Oh, my.</i>

960
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:56,512
<i>You are dealing with
the pain of unrequited love.</i>

961
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:58,514
<i>Don't keep your feelings bottled up.</i>

962
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:02,101
<i>Go to that person
and ask them how they feel about you.</i>

963
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:05,688
<i>You have already fallen for
that person's irresistible charms.</i>

964
01:04:05,772 --> 01:04:08,441
<i>If you want to develop
your relationship with them,</i>

965
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:11,027
<i>you need to muster up the courage.</i>

966
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:32,006
Thanks for your hard work.

967
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:34,092
Thank you for everything.

968
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:40,556
Good luck.

969
01:05:58,509 --> 01:05:59,510
- Hey…
- Sa-rang.

970
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:15,378
KING THE LAND

971
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:51,330
<i>You have no idea
what King the Land is like.</i>

972
01:07:51,414 --> 01:07:53,791
We call this place
the hotel's first class.

973
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,042
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

974
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:57,587
<i>Let's go. Your uniform is ready.</i>

975
01:07:59,463 --> 01:08:00,631
She must be pretty.

976
01:08:03,676 --> 01:08:05,636
That rotten jerk. Forget about money.

977
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,681
<i>You should be with a man
who's good to you.</i>

978
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:10,391
<i>I asked to see you yesterday.</i>

979
01:08:10,474 --> 01:08:11,809
What? When?

980
01:08:12,518 --> 01:08:14,770
<i>I simply can't stand
owing someone a favor.</i>

981
01:08:14,854 --> 01:08:15,855
But I'm okay with it.

982
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:18,190
I just feel bad for you.

983
01:08:18,858 --> 01:08:20,568
<i>Would you like</i>

984
01:08:20,651 --> 01:08:22,445
to have dinner with me?

985
01:08:22,525 --> 01:08:24,680
