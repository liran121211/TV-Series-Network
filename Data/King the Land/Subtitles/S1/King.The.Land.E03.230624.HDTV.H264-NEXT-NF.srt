EPISODE 3

7
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:15,828
Hello.

8
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:16,746
Hello.

9
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,789
Please take extra care in this shoot.

10
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,093
You still don't have it memorized?

11
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,386
No, it's all in my head.

12
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,058
You seem embarrassingly nervous.

13
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,644
I'm not nervous.

14
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:41,103
As if. You're completely stiff.

15
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:42,271
No, I'm not.

16
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:44,690
Okay. We'll perform a camera test.

17
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,567
Interviewer, please look at the camera.

18
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,110
Yes, sir!

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,655
You <i>are </i>nervous.

20
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,616
That's rich coming from someone

21
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:57,161
who spruced up from head to toe
for a TV appearance.

22
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:58,829
With the <i>sohalteun</i> style.

23
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,832
Soharten style?

24
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,335
- What is that?
- It's how your hair is done now.

25
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:05,711
- My hair?
- Yes.

26
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:06,921
It's…

27
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,048
exactly the <i>sohalteun</i> style.

28
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:11,509
Soharten style?

29
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,928
What kind of hairstyle is that?

30
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,808
Soharten style.

31
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:21,477
Soharten style.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,021
"C…"

36
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,488
What? <i>So</i> as in cow?

37
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,656
We'll begin shooting now.

38
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:34,949
Act natural.

39
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:37,451
All right. In five, four,

40
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,954
three, two, one.

41
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:44,083
Hello, I'm here on King Hotel's rooftop,

42
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,127
-<i>where we have the best view</i>
-She's so pretty.

43
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,129
<i>of Jeju Island's beautiful sunset.</i>

44
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:49,880
Sa-rang looks so good on camera.

45
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:51,173
As if.

46
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,009
-<i>Today, along with Head Manager Gu,</i>
-It's all makeup.

47
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,761
I'll take you
on a virtual tour of King Hotel.

48
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:56,679
Head Manager Gu,

49
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:59,473
can you say hello to the viewers?

50
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,185
Hello, I am Gu Won.

51
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,187
- My gosh.
- He's so handsome.

52
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,274
<i>Along with the viewers,</i>

53
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:11,736
<i>the employees of King Hotel
have a lot of questions for you.</i>

54
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:13,863
<i>Before we introduce the hotel,</i>

55
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,323
may I ask you a few questions?

56
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:16,866
Go ahead.

57
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:17,950
Okay.

58
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:22,872
Your mother was a founding member
of the Jeju King Hotel.

59
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:25,082
I'm sure being here
must hit you differently.

60
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,631
I hear you bear a resemblance
to your mother.

61
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:34,508
In what way do you most take after her?

62
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,822
Mr. Gu.

63
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,785
- What's going on?
- Is he leaving?

64
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,536
- Oh, my.
- What is happening?

65
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,704
What's going on?

66
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,917
Mr. Gu.

67
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:21,847
It seems an urgent matter
has come up for Head Manager Gu.

68
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:24,100
I don't think he knew
this was a live broadcast.

69
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:27,895
Once he returns, I'll let him know.

70
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:36,946
Come back home
before your mom's memorial service.

71
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:39,490
Which mom do you mean?

72
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,910
<i>I don't even know</i>

73
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,621
what my mom looks like
or if she's even alive or not.

74
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,039
You take after your mom.

75
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,418
You're reckless just like her.

76
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:17,778
How amusing.

77
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,930
The first question touched on
the topic of mothers.

78
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,516
Being here brings back memories

79
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,935
of the first time
I went to a hotel by the beach

80
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:28,812
- She's a natural.
- <i>with my mom.</i>

81
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,980
She's like a news anchor.

82
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,439
- You're right.
- Totally.

83
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:32,649
- She's so good.
- She's articulate.

84
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,068
But where did Mr. Gu go?

85
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,486
- Why isn't he coming back?
- Right?

86
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,531
<i>That day that I spent with my mom
was the happiest day of my life.</i>

87
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,701
<i>I even dreamed of living in a hotel
for the rest of my life.</i>

88
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:46,162
<i>That hotel was this very King Hotel.</i>

89
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,205
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

90
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,249
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

91
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,502
King Hotel has always been
my joy and my dream.

92
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,423
And I was lucky enough
to start working here!

93
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,302
Now, I want to gift
all the guests of King Hotel

94
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,596
the same happiness that I felt that day.

95
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,228
- Goodness.
- What a relief.

96
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:11,396
It's fun now.

97
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,605
It's worth watching now.

98
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,442
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HEAD MANAGER GU

99
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,110
<i>Were you able to handle your situation?</i>

100
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:18,486
<i>Yes, thanks to you.</i>

101
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,114
Could I take a look
at the interview questions?

102
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:22,490
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,911
"What memory comes to mind

104
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,371
when you think of your mom?"

105
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,083
"What is your favorite vacation spot
you visited with your mom?"

106
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,378
"What is your favorite meal
cooked by your mom?"

107
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,593
Skip these childish questions

108
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,928
and ask me things
that you're actually curious about.

109
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,107
Do you like watching the sunset?

110
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,318
It's so pretty.

111
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,615
So the sun was setting.

112
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,075
This is the best spot to see it, right?

113
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:05,992
Let's go watch it.

114
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,931
Isn't it so beautiful?

115
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,766
The sunset is so pretty.

116
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,543
<i>What's your deal?</i>

117
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,919
Did I do something wrong?

118
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,045
Do you think it's okay

119
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,548
for a mere employee
to question the head manager?

120
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:03,717
This may not be a big deal to you,

121
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,469
but a mere employee like me
can get fired over this.

122
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,347
Why push yourself so hard?

123
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,349
There are a lot of other hotels out there.

124
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:15,019
You might work
at daddy's company as a hobby,

125
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,689
but some people work hard
just to make ends meet.

126
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,442
I know work is just a time killer for you,

127
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,943
but don't get in my way.

128
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,362
I don't want to get hit
by any stones you threw for fun.

129
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,585
Do you even know

130
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:41,880
what kind of stone

131
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,841
you threw in my direction today?

132
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,766
Mr. Gu!

133
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,977
This place has become
the hottest place to visit.

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,645
It's so hot. Gosh, that's hot!

135
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,689
Do you see the number of likes?

136
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,107
You did a wonderful job.

137
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,026
Let's go with this concept tomorrow too.

138
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,570
Two beautiful lovebirds in the sunset.

139
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:06,613
A lovely

140
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:08,698
couple.

141
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:12,702
What's with the vibe?

142
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,037
I said it's trending.

143
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,456
Tomorrow's shoot will end in an hour.
One photo per location.

144
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:17,665
That's nonsense.

145
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,793
- The shoot isn't a joke--
- I said what I said.

146
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,462
It's out of the question, sir.

147
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:24,672
He's so ill-tempered.

148
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,758
Sa-rang, keep it up.

149
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:28,468
We just need a few shots here and there.

150
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,845
Okay.

151
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:32,764
Mr. Gu.

152
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:56,306
From now on, I'm going to make sure
you guys are in good health.

153
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,224
I've let you write down your weights,

154
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,101
but the numbers don't match what I see.

155
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,436
Any objections?

156
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:16,284
See?

157
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,454
You said you were 51 kg,
but you're actually 51.9 kg.

158
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:22,165
I rounded down to make the number simpler.

159
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,793
Hey, .9 kg equals 1.5 <i>geun</i> of pork belly.

160
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,587
One penalty point for dishonesty.

161
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,635
How are you so good
at maintaining your weight?

162
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,720
I learned it all from you.

163
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,722
As expected from the best of the bunch.

164
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:38,765
You may sit down.

165
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:42,393
One moment.

166
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:46,564
One moment, please.

167
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,111
Will that make a difference?

168
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,405
Of course. It's a chunk of metal.

169
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,877
Look at this. You're a total fraud.

170
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:11,130
How could you
misreport your weight by 3 kg?

171
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,926
I was definitely 50 kg
the last time I weighed myself.

172
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,345
My bowel movements
have become less frequent lately.

173
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,806
Three kilograms of poop

174
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,684
amounts to this much.

175
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,060
I'm sorry. I'll lose weight.

176
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,937
Surely you know
how every additional kilogram

177
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,231
burns up tons of fuel for the company.

178
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,151
Weight management is essential
not only for your own self-esteem

179
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,278
but also for cutting company costs.

180
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:36,280
Your lack of care for the company

181
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,991
is the reason why
you haven't been promoted.

182
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:43,746
All right. Get off the scale.

183
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,498
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,211
Ro-un!

185
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:51,671
You're exempt from this.

186
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,381
I can just tell by looking at you.

187
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,466
Do you work out?

188
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,176
No, I don't do anything.

189
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,804
You were endowed with a good body.

190
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,431
Sit back down.

191
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,684
That's it for today. Good work, everyone.

192
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,269
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

193
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,062
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

194
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,647
Aren't you going to weigh in?

195
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,566
Me?

196
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,151
Yes.

197
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:14,610
Me?

198
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:21,242
I'll check your weights
before each flight.

199
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,827
So you guys should stay fit.

200
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,078
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,466
Don't think of going on a diet.

202
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:38,676
You're already beautiful.

203
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,430
Thank you for saying that,
even if you don't mean it.

204
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:54,942
Here.

205
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,821
What is this?

206
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,032
It's to thank you for last time.

207
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:02,158
Give it to your mother.

208
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,035
It's a scarf recommended
by the national mom.

209
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:11,042
I'm the one you want to thank,

210
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,086
but the gift is for my mom.

211
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:16,714
You should be a good son.

212
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:20,468
Thank you.
I'll make sure to give it to her.

213
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:29,143
As you already know,
today's concept is "Smile."

214
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,939
We're going to capture
your heartfelt smiles for your guests.

215
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,817
Director Gu, you'll be the smile king.

216
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,903
Ms. Cheon, you'll be the smile queen.

217
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,697
Can we see your smiles?

218
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:45,910
Thank you.

219
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,831
Your smile is worth
a hundred million dollars.

220
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:50,957
Don't flatter me.

221
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:53,668
A hundred million dollars, my foot.

222
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,877
So fake.

223
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,172
Mr. Gu, can you also smile broadly?

224
00:14:58,256 --> 00:14:59,382
Smile, king.

225
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,224
Let's get started.

226
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,434
Shall we?

227
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,519
Sure.

228
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,275
I don't think he'll smile.

229
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,485
He will once we start.
It's work, after all.

230
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:21,779
I can hear you.

231
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:25,074
Let's start now.

232
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,494
We'll go with the heart pose first.

233
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,580
Ready? Make a heart!

234
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,583
Wonderful. I only see one heart.

235
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,709
There's only one heart.

236
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,669
Why is that? We need one more heart.

237
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:39,088
Come on, one more heart.

238
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,424
One more, please.

239
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,342
That's it. A heart.

240
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:45,344
A heart, not a circle!

241
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,221
We need a heart.

242
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,599
Okay. A big heart now!

243
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,601
The sizes of your hearts are different.

244
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,728
- This.
- A big heart.

245
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,229
You have to move your arm up.

246
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,273
That's right. A little bit higher.

247
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,566
Show me your heart.

248
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,611
Yes, I see it's coming up.

249
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,655
Please make a heart.
Let's fill the whole world with hearts.

250
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:05,990
That's it.

251
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,326
Something is…

252
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,162
That's nice,

253
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,414
but try to make it smoother.

254
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:14,790
Okay. Now smile!

255
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,459
You're doing great, Ms. Cheon.

256
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,127
Amazing!

257
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,839
It would be lovely
if Mr. Gu could smile slightly.

258
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:23,758
The smile should be natural.

259
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:27,845
Okay.

260
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,014
You just need to smile once.

261
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,266
Please. Excuse me?

262
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,268
Thank you.

263
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:37,855
The punk didn't smile once.

264
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,778
I mean,

265
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,113
he's begging you to smile.

266
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,323
Can't you smile just once?

267
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,242
- I don't want to.
- I don't feel like smiling either.

268
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:50,159
Then don't.

269
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:52,828
We're in the middle of a shoot.

270
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,790
Didn't I tell you not to get in my way?

271
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:58,000
Didn't I tell you not to fake a smile?

272
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,377
I'm working right now.

273
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,588
I know you got the job through nepotism,
but can you not even do this much?

274
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,090
It's not that I can't.

275
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,091
I'm choosing not to.

276
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,342
Please. I don't think so.

277
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,638
My only flaw is that
there is nothing that I can't do.

278
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,183
Oh, so you're good at everything,
but you can't smile.

279
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,601
I said I'm choosing not to.

280
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,228
I see.

281
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:18,771
Let's get started.

282
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,899
Okay.

283
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,026
Remember to smile, okay?

284
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,361
All right.

285
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,822
Ready? Smile!

286
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,377
Mr. Gu?

287
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:43,754
Not a smirk, please.

288
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:53,597
That's enough.

289
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,976
The next one is the last, right?
Let's make it quick.

290
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,821
I knew that punk would do this.

291
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,282
What do we do?

292
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,867
- Can't we change the model?
- Sir.

293
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,201
I think this will work.

294
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,412
- What do you mean?
- Let's photoshop this.

295
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,957
We can move up the corner of his mouth
and make it look like he's smiling.

296
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,043
You can do that?

297
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:24,253
You bet.

298
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,634
You want me

299
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:33,346
- to get on this boat?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,224
You'll be showing people
how fresh King Hotel's ingredients are.

301
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,393
Whatever. I detest boats--

302
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:42,688
I know that, but you just need to
hold a tilefish for a second.

303
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:45,149
The photographer
will take care of the rest.

304
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:49,028
Then what about you?

305
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,112
Me?

306
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,198
I'm obviously going to stay here.

307
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:54,033
I detest boats.

308
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,785
Plus, I'm not a model.

309
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,495
Can't you go with us?

310
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,122
I don't want to go with just him.

311
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,375
I don't want to go with you either.

312
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,044
I also desperately want to go
with you guys, but I can't.

313
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,213
I have a lot on my plate.

314
00:19:07,922 --> 00:19:09,965
Well, it looks like it's going to rain.

315
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,550
- Is the weather okay?
- Yes.

316
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,677
I checked the forecast. You'll be fine.

317
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:14,595
Are you sure?

318
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:16,806
- Are you making things up?
- No.

319
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,057
I'm positive.

320
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,683
- The weather's fine, right?
- Yes.

321
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:20,810
Great.

322
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,061
It's definitely okay.

323
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,979
Then be careful out there. Stay safe.

324
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:24,980
Right, Mr. Gu.

325
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,315
Please…

326
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:28,859
- Hermès.
- Why you…

327
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:31,654
Be careful.

328
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:42,832
Mr. Gu,

329
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,418
pick up the biggest and freshest fish.

330
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,586
Ms. Cheon, you just have to face Mr. Gu

331
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,089
and smile broadly. Okay?

332
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:52,299
All right.

333
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:53,717
We're going to start now.

334
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,266
Can you give it a shake
to make it look like it's alive?

335
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,642
Good.

336
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:04,395
- More.
- Yes, more. Nice.

337
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,188
Make it look like it's flailing around.

338
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,524
A little more, please. More.

339
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,817
That's great.

340
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,235
Isn't the tilefish too small?

341
00:20:11,318 --> 00:20:12,862
I can enlarge it with Photoshop.

342
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:14,738
- You can do that?
- Sure.

343
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,740
Okay. Keep going.

344
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,034
Imagine the fish being super large.

345
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,077
It's so heavy.

346
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:22,538
Good job, Ms. Cheon.

347
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,915
Make him carry it with both hands.

348
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:27,835
Okay. Can you please hold it
with both hands?

349
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:30,296
It's so heavy.

350
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,840
It's so big and heavy.
Remember those two things.

351
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:34,508
That's right. It's so heavy.

352
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:35,843
Even more. Great.

353
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,386
Gosh, it's so heavy.

354
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,263
Just a little bit more. That's great--

355
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,437
He just set it free.

356
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:50,566
How heavy.

357
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,324
- Let's go home. End the shoot.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:00,618
We're done shooting.

359
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:02,578
Good work.

360
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,955
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

361
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:28,771
The boat is acting strange,

362
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,106
and the weather doesn't look too good.

363
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,858
Should I steer toward Gapado?

364
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:33,984
No, just keep going.

365
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:36,403
I'm telling you,
something's wrong with the boat.

366
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,239
We don't want to get hit by a typhoon.

367
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:40,741
I hate boats, the sea, and typhoons.

368
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:41,659
So let's hurry.

369
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:43,577
Then you can swim back for all I care.

370
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:44,912
What nonsense is…

371
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,626
Tell him to start the boat.

372
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,796
- Me?
- Your boss just gave you an order.

373
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,048
Go ahead.

374
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:56,966
Yes, sir.

375
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,097
- Excuse me, sir.
- Don't.

376
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,142
He said no.

377
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,477
Tell him it's a no for me too.

378
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:11,981
I can't.

379
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:14,566
He said no

380
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,819
and that you can swim back
if you really want to go.

381
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,174
Ms. Gang, good morning.

382
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,801
You're so full of energy already.

383
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:43,595
It's a must if I want to win
the incentive again this month.

384
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,139
Yes, let's keep our spirits up.

385
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:47,057
What is all of this?

386
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,686
- Snacks?
- Yes.

387
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,813
I specifically told you not to buy any.

388
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:57,151
I was told you didn't actually mean that.

389
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:59,069
What?

390
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,697
What are you bringing tomorrow?

391
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,450
Ms. Gang told me not to bring anything.

392
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,785
You're so dense.

393
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:08,287
Did you really believe that?

394
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,538
But Ms. Gang--

395
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,916
What she meant was
to cut down on the amount.

396
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,502
You have to take her words
with a grain of salt.

397
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,892
No one is allowed
to take weekends off anymore.

398
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:30,851
Only I'll do that.

399
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,980
Didn't you say we could take weekends off?

400
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:37,691
- What happened?
- It's always been like that.

401
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:39,568
Has anyone besides the manager
gotten weekends off?

402
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,944
No.

403
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,613
I heard you made Yu-bin buy snacks again.

404
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:44,031
Do as you want.

405
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:46,200
I'll also do as the old managers did.

406
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:47,201
That's our tradition.

407
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:49,203
- It's not what you think…
- What's wrong?

408
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:51,163
You have the right
to be treated like seniors,

409
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:52,873
but the junior member
doesn't deserve the same?

410
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,084
I was shortsighted.

411
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,002
Let's go back to our old ways.

412
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:59,088
Yu-bin will take care of
our food and snacks.

413
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,798
And only I get to rest on weekends.

414
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:01,715
Understood?

415
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,551
I'm sorry, ma'am. I had poor judgment.

416
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:06,929
This is your last chance.

417
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,430
I won't let it slide next time.

418
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,891
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

419
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:12,726
I hope no one is treated unfairly,

420
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,728
at least for the duration of my tenure.

421
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,898
Once I quit,
you guys can do whatever you want.

422
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:22,986
Let's have coffee before we start.
I'll go get it.

423
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,992
Then, I would like an iced Americano.

424
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,036
Iced tea for me, please.

425
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:33,789
- All right.
- What about you, Ha-neul?

426
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,751
I want a condensed milk latte
with whipped cream.

427
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:39,420
Not a mocha?

428
00:24:39,503 --> 00:24:41,213
- Get ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

429
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,967
GAPADO

430
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:51,390
If you keep going straight,
you'll see a cottage.

431
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,016
You should stay there for tonight.

432
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,894
It's the best hotel in Gapado.

433
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,020
Make sure you go there.

434
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,856
Okay. Thank you.

435
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,075
Aren't you coming?

436
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,249
I'm going alone then.

437
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,550
There's no service.

438
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:46,737
Wait.

439
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:04,755
Hold on.

440
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,259
It can't be

441
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,303
that house over there, right?

442
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:13,597
Why? Are you scared?

443
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:15,474
No.

444
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:19,186
That word isn't in my vocabulary.

445
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,104
If I were scared,

446
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,065
I would've taken the lead like you,

447
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,317
not guarded the rear like this.

448
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,198
It's just a chicken.

449
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,537
I'm usually not afraid of anything.

450
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,872
But I hate birds. That rascal.

451
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,624
- Then do you want to go first?
- No.

452
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,876
Just admit that you're scared.

453
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,711
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

454
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:47,422
I already told you.
It's not because I'm scared.

455
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,132
I'm just trying to cover our backs.

456
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:52,719
Okay.

457
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,138
Follow me. I'll go first.

458
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:56,765
Did I

459
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:58,517
ever tell you

460
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,144
that I box

461
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,272
as a hobby?

462
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,712
What was that for?

463
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,317
Jeez.

464
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:28,565
Cheon Sa-rang.

465
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,819
Cheon Sa-rang!

466
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,627
Cheon Sa-rang.

467
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:01,973
Why did you come out from there?

468
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:03,391
What?

469
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,185
Oh, my. You're awake?

470
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,562
Look at you.

471
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,022
You're a strapping young lad,

472
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:10,607
yet look at you shaking in your boots.

473
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,858
Goodness.

474
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,945
Your wife will have her hands full
because of you.

475
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:17,155
My wife?

476
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,866
You better carry your wife around a lot.

477
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:21,701
You fainted in the middle of the road,

478
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:24,829
and she carried you
all the way here on her own.

479
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,915
Do you even realize
how hard it must've been?

480
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,041
Tell me about it.

481
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:31,377
I've never seen anyone faint
upon seeing someone's face.

482
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:37,217
Where are we?

483
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,551
What do you mean?

484
00:29:38,635 --> 00:29:41,971
You're at the most luxurious hotel

485
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:45,058
as well as the best restaurant in Gapado.

486
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,060
Are you on your honeymoon?

487
00:29:48,144 --> 00:29:48,978
- No.
- No!

488
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:50,939
Then are you two a fling?

489
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:54,400
There's nothing between us.
He's just my superior.

490
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:55,360
Goodness.

491
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:58,321
A superior can become a lover,
and a lover can become a father.

492
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,781
There's not much to it.

493
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,742
I don't just go around
dating anyone, ma'am.

494
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:04,285
What do you mean by "anyone"?

495
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,620
How am I "anyone"?

496
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,206
I'm the one who should be saying that.

497
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,874
Yes, sure.

498
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:12,752
I'm telling you, I'm not just anyone!

499
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:13,711
Right.

500
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:16,673
I knew it.

501
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:18,591
The face is what completes the look.

502
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,469
My clothes have found
their rightful owner.

503
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:24,097
You can continue
your lover's quarrel later.

504
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,181
Let's have a drink.

505
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:27,100
- It's not like that!
- It's not like that!

506
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:38,319
Have you ever heard of
the famous Chinese bushclover wine?

507
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,947
Even if we have important guests,

508
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,575
we don't usually bring this out.

509
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:47,412
After my old man drank this,

510
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:50,873
I delivered eight babies,
one after the other.

511
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:57,589
Do you like drinking?

512
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,758
He's so frail.
He's probably a lightweight.

513
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,385
But I'll take a drink.

514
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:04,721
What did you say? "Frail"?

515
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:08,766
I'm going to drink out of this.
Please fill it to the brim.

516
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,934
This is pretty strong.

517
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,060
Will you be okay?

518
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:12,729
If that's the case,

519
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,272
I will

520
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:15,940
use this.

521
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,110
Me too.

522
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:20,945
- All right.
- Okay.

523
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:06,658
Gosh, the liquor is weak.

524
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,534
I can chug it down so easily.

525
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:10,244
This tastes like water.

526
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,287
Give me more, please.

527
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,414
- Fill it to the brim, please.
- Sure.

528
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:15,041
You know your alcohol.

529
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:19,796
Being young is great, isn't it?

530
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:23,383
Here you go.

531
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,593
You gave me a lot.

532
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:39,607
This is nice.

533
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:45,697
I told you not to smile.

534
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,367
I wasn't smiling at you.

535
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,452
Don't look at me then.

536
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,122
Why are you so irritable?

537
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,791
You're always complaining.
You grumpy pants.

538
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,920
It's because nothing works out
whenever I'm with you.

539
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,005
From now on,

540
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:03,965
you better

541
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,843
stay out of my sight.

542
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:10,972
You can't order me around!

543
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,557
We're not at work right now.

544
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:18,980
- Hey!
- What?

545
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:22,692
Did you just

546
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,069
smack me?

547
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,155
How dare you?

548
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,407
"How dare you," my ass.

549
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,616
"My ass"?

550
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,369
Don't regret this later.

551
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:35,705
I won't.

552
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:38,291
Regretting doesn't change anything.

553
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:39,751
Okay, just you wait.

554
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,879
I'm going to really
make you regret what you just did.

555
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:48,217
I'm not someone
who you can just hit and mistreat.

556
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,052
All people are the same.

557
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:52,722
That means
everyone should be treated equally.

558
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:57,143
No one should be mistreated!

559
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:00,855
Do you think you're all that
because you're rich?

560
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,065
Don't be such a snob.

561
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,195
"Snob"?

562
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,112
Yes.

563
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:11,574
People who take power trips
because they're well-off.

564
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:15,745
It's hard enough having to bow and scrape

565
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:17,955
to rude guests every day.

566
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,459
And now I have to deal with your crap too.

567
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,629
On top of that,

568
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:26,798
you're the king of all snobs.

569
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:28,424
King.

570
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:30,384
King Hotel. King.

571
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,969
Snob… Gu.

572
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,387
Snobby Gu.

573
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,310
If I'm a snob, let me see…

574
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,062
You are

575
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:43,648
- that.
- What?

576
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,566
Faced. That's it, faced.

577
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,985
Faced. Two-faced.

578
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:49,237
You're so fake.

579
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,154
Phony Cheon.

580
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,114
Look.

581
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:55,159
Do you think it's easy to fake a smile?

582
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:57,662
- Not anyone can do it.
- Look at you.

583
00:34:57,745 --> 00:35:00,540
It's a high-level technique.

584
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,043
I've developed it
by putting up with all sorts of asses.

585
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:06,128
A certain imperviousness.

586
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:09,590
Sure. What a nice technique.

587
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:11,259
Don't be absurd.

588
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:15,263
Hey, Snobby Gu.

589
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:19,600
Why don't you just pour me a drink?

590
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,104
"Hey"?

591
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:24,647
Hey.

592
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:26,399
Pour me a drink.

593
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:27,859
You must be joking.

594
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,573
Give me some.

595
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:39,328
It's only up to today

596
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,873
that I'm letting you off the hook.

597
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:43,040
Why would you?

598
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,459
Do whatever you want.
You have that freedom.

599
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,797
You can do whatever you want
without caring how others see you.

600
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,340
I'm so jealous.

601
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,760
You don't know what it's like to be me.
Watch what you say.

602
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:56,888
Of course I don't.

603
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,016
But you don't have to fake a smile.

604
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,727
That in itself is a huge privilege.

605
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,689
I'm always smiling.

606
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:11,360
I smile even when I'm hurt or sad.

607
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,157
But it's better that I suffer the pain.

608
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:19,493
If someone else suffered because of me,

609
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:22,955
that would make me feel even worse.

610
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:30,421
But why do you dislike smiling so much?

611
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,601
Because everyone wears it as a mask.

612
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:45,728
It's all fake.

613
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,608
I'm sure there was
a sincere person among them.

614
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,653
That's pretty sad.

615
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:03,788
How pretty.

616
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,411
Didn't I tell you not to smile?

617
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,623
That wasn't a fake smile.

618
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,250
It was genuine.

619
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,294
I don't care.

620
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:54,505
Just don't smile.

621
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:58,175
I'm not even working right now.

622
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:00,052
Why can't I smile when I feel like it?

623
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,804
From now on,

624
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:04,974
even outside of working hours,

625
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:07,226
smiling…

626
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:10,271
in front of me…

627
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,526
is not permitted.

628
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:18,738
Why not?

629
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,240
No.

630
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:24,076
I'm not listening to you.

631
00:38:25,077 --> 00:38:27,121
No. I'm going to keep smiling.

632
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:29,957
Whatever.

633
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,795
Just pour me another drink.

634
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:36,839
Okay?

635
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,286
SUITES

636
00:40:00,506 --> 00:40:01,966
Snobby Gu.

637
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:04,718
Snobby Gu.

638
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:10,683
It's cold.

639
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:17,731
Don't smile in front of me.

640
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,013
My head.

641
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,450
My gosh. I must be crazy.

642
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,535
I didn't even take
my socks off last night.

643
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:15,206
Goodness!

644
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,976
Phony Cheon.

645
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,147
Why don't you get off of me?

646
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,404
Why are you sleeping here?

647
00:41:48,113 --> 00:41:49,782
Since this is my room.

648
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,200
But this is my room.

649
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:53,702
I clearly heard "two rooms" yesterday,
and there were two doors.

650
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,708
ONE ROOM IF USED BY A COUPLE,
TWO ROOMS IF USED BY STRANGERS

651
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,711
I thought this was
the best hotel in Gapado.

652
00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:31,657
What are you doing?

653
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,095
You have some time
until the boat gets here.

654
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,388
Why don't you take a lap?

655
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:37,973
I don't like walking.

656
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:40,184
You can't take in everything on foot.

657
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:42,061
- You need to be on wheels.
- I see.

658
00:43:42,978 --> 00:43:44,605
I can see everything from here.

659
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,358
The scenery of Gapado
should not just be seen with the eyes.

660
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:49,610
It must be engraved in the heart.

661
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,528
Just go and bike around with your wife.

662
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,873
Where did you get that from?

663
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,250
It's from the old man.

664
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:06,919
Do you want to hop on?

665
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:11,382
No. We're not close enough
to ride a bike together.

666
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,509
Yes, you're so right about that.

667
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:19,723
But I hear it's impossible to see
even a quarter of the island on foot,

668
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:21,934
so I'm just trying to do you a favor.

669
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:25,270
The view from over there

670
00:44:26,188 --> 00:44:27,398
is apparently very nice.

671
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:33,570
Is there only one bike?

672
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,906
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

673
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:47,751
Can I hop on?

674
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,184
Are you tired?

675
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,185
What?

676
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,854
You're not tired, are you?

677
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,730
This is a cakewalk.

678
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,703
It's the sea.

679
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:36,925
It's so pretty here.

680
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:39,761
Isn't it beautiful?

681
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:42,472
Not really.

682
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:00,199
Here.

683
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:04,411
Send me the receipt.

684
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,624
All you have to do is say thank you.

685
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:10,918
Thanks.

686
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,336
Send me the receipt.

687
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:31,271
Sorry? How much?

688
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,274
675,000 won.

689
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,192
How?

690
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:38,278
It costs 200,000 won per suite.

691
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,696
So it's 400,000 won for 2.

692
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,325
The moonlight dinner was 120,000 won

693
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:46,203
and the wine wasn't included,
so another 100,000 won.

694
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:47,913
So that's 620,000 won.

695
00:46:47,996 --> 00:46:49,790
And the bike rental costs 55,000 won.

696
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,293
So the total comes out to 675,000 won.

697
00:46:55,504 --> 00:46:57,089
But we used one room.

698
00:46:57,172 --> 00:47:00,092
Did you two sleep together last night?

699
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:01,343
- No.
- No.

700
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:03,512
So then you used two separate rooms.

701
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:04,930
We accept credit cards too.

702
00:47:05,013 --> 00:47:07,266
That's ridiculous. You're ripping us off.

703
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:08,642
It's fine. It's just money.

704
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,727
I didn't bring my wallet.

705
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:13,397
Can I pay with this?

706
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,275
This isn't a pawnshop.

707
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,068
I won't accept that.

708
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,320
I thought you said
you accept credit cards.

709
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,488
The card's in here.

710
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:23,031
So I'll pay with this.

711
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:24,866
There's a card in there?

712
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,493
Do you expect me to believe that?

713
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:29,079
Did you think you could fool me,

714
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:30,622
thinking I'm some old hillbilly?

715
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,165
What's gotten you all worked up?

716
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,001
- These people…
- Good thing you're here.

717
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,168
Something seems fishy.

718
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,171
You had a grand old time
eating and drinking here last night.

719
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,674
Who are you calling fishy
when you're refusing to pay?

720
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:41,591
What?

721
00:47:41,675 --> 00:47:42,843
They didn't pay you, Mom?

722
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,261
No.

723
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:45,804
- Mom?
- Mom?

724
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:47,639
I thought you were a chaebol.

725
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:49,141
Why the fuss over chump change?

726
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:50,600
That's not it.

727
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:52,060
Take a look at this.

728
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:54,313
I was going to pay

729
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:57,816
- with this.
- What is that?

730
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:00,193
This isn't a pawnshop.
What the heck is this?

731
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:03,363
Anyway, if you don't pay,
I'm not starting the boat.

732
00:48:05,991 --> 00:48:07,534
Then give me your account number.

733
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:09,828
I'll tell my assistant
to wire you the money.

734
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,204
Hold on.

735
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:16,376
Ma'am, even if the room
we slept in last night

736
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,545
is the best suite in Gapado,

737
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:21,214
compared to King Hotel,
100,000 won will do for one night.

738
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,383
I'll accept 150,000 won,
but no more than that.

739
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,762
This may be a tourist spot, but dinner
should cost no more than 50,000 won.

740
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:28,305
Bike rentals are usually
10,000 won per person.

741
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:30,057
I'll leave the wine price at 100,000 won.

742
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,600
Then the total is 320,000 won,

743
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,310
but including the borrowed clothes,

744
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,729
we'll pay you 350,000 won.

745
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:41,151
Why do you need to cut the price in half
when you're a chaebol?

746
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:42,778
Can you rip people off if they're rich?

747
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:44,571
I could report you for price gouging.

748
00:48:44,654 --> 00:48:47,908
Gosh, you youngsters are so petty.

749
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,786
Just pay the price and leave in peace.

750
00:48:51,745 --> 00:48:54,247
By the looks of it, you guys are related.

751
00:48:55,707 --> 00:48:57,209
Was the boat even malfunctioning?

752
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:58,210
What?

753
00:48:58,877 --> 00:48:59,878
Malfunctioning?

754
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:01,505
Yes. Very much so.

755
00:49:03,215 --> 00:49:04,883
You're not using Jeju dialect today.

756
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:07,177
Is that so?

757
00:49:09,388 --> 00:49:10,597
350,000 won.

758
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,307
We can wire it right away.

759
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:13,892
Okay. It's a deal.

760
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,603
Deal.

761
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:37,207
Why did you waste your energy
when I could've easily paid for it?

762
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,585
You've never had to check
the price of anything, have you?

763
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,588
Why would I?

764
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:45,674
Most people do

765
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:47,884
to make sure that the price is reasonable

766
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:49,678
and that they can afford it.

767
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:52,347
My grandma taught me
that money doesn't grow on trees.

768
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:54,641
They were obviously trying to swindle us.

769
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:56,518
It's wrong to deceive others.

770
00:49:57,185 --> 00:50:00,063
Money should be earned honestly.

771
00:50:01,523 --> 00:50:02,357
But why?

772
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:04,693
What do you mean?

773
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:06,611
To preserve one's integrity.

774
00:50:17,873 --> 00:50:18,915
Also…

775
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,878
I'm sorry about the other day.

776
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:25,297
About what?

777
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:27,757
The stone that I supposedly threw at you.

778
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,051
I don't know what it was,

779
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,389
but the look in your eyes
told me you were hurt by it.

780
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,102
Right. That stone.

781
00:50:41,146 --> 00:50:42,314
I forgot about that.

782
00:51:05,253 --> 00:51:06,671
This is delicious.

783
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:07,881
It's amazing with beer.

784
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,008
Right? I got it at the airport
because I was short on time,

785
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:11,301
but it's pretty good.

786
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,387
So did the live broadcast go well?

787
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,723
Yes. Fortunately, people enjoyed it.

788
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,934
What is your head manager like?

789
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,604
How should I put it?

790
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,189
He's

791
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:25,774
a stuck-up jerk.

792
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:27,609
- What about his looks?
- He looks like one too.

793
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:28,985
He's the heir of King Group.

794
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:30,987
It'd be weirder for him not to be.

795
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,823
Right. Did you give him the scarf?

796
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:35,867
What? Are you seeing someone?

797
00:51:36,743 --> 00:51:38,328
No, he's just a junior.

798
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:42,332
- Isn't it time for Cho-rong to come home?
- Yes.

799
00:51:42,415 --> 00:51:44,251
- Let's go. We'll see you off.
- Okay.

800
00:51:51,383 --> 00:51:53,760
How is it that all three of us
still don't own a car?

801
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:55,762
I know, right?

802
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:58,682
If one of us had a car,
we could go for a drive.

803
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:00,934
Hey, why don't you buy a car?

804
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,477
I don't have the money.

805
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:03,687
Then what about you?

806
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,188
I don't have a license.

807
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:07,941
How could you not have a license
at your age?

808
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,818
It should be you. You have both.

809
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:10,819
She's right.

810
00:52:10,902 --> 00:52:12,654
Let's get one to celebrate your promotion.

811
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:13,572
- Yes.
- Hey.

812
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:15,824
I only get paid
an extra 20,000 won per month.

813
00:52:15,907 --> 00:52:16,825
20,000 won?

814
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:19,077
Yes. 20,000 won, not 20,000 dollars.

815
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:22,872
I'm so consistent, aren't I?

816
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,292
The bus is here. I'm leaving.

817
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:27,836
Hey, Gang Darong.

818
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,506
You're doing great.
You're the best out of us three.

819
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,134
Bye!

820
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:36,279
Was that the best you could do?

821
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:39,741
How could you storm off
because of that one question?

822
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:41,326
As a businessman,

823
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:44,412
a lot of things can and will happen.

824
00:53:44,496 --> 00:53:47,540
What sort of head manager
behaves worse than a mere employee?

825
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,794
We attracted a lot of views
and it was great publicity.

826
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:52,212
It's the outcome that matters.

827
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:55,924
The methods aren't important.
That's what I learned from you.

828
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:57,384
Did you raise those views?

829
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,177
Did we gain publicity because of you?

830
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,929
You made a mess,

831
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:03,306
and a mere employee cleaned it up for you!

832
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,265
Aren't you ashamed?

833
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:05,725
But it all turned out well.

834
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,063
How long will you fuss over this?

835
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:13,942
You're too old to be looking for your mom!

836
00:54:15,777 --> 00:54:17,195
I'm not looking for her.

837
00:54:18,697 --> 00:54:20,865
I just want to know the truth.

838
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,826
The only truth you need to know

839
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:25,453
is the company's profit and stock prices.

840
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,707
The only thing
that can be trusted is money.

841
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:31,292
Love? Laughter?

842
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:33,169
Kindness? Respect?

843
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,171
It's all a lie!

844
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:38,842
What about Mom?

845
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:42,595
Was that a lie too?

846
00:54:47,642 --> 00:54:49,102
There's no such thing as love

847
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,563
for people in our station.

848
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:02,907
Then what is there?

849
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:04,784
Duty.

850
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,038
It is my duty to protect
what my father passed down to me,

851
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:12,208
and it is your duty
to protect what I've accomplished.

852
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:13,710
Love?

853
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:16,337
Don't be foolish.
Just be good at your job!

854
00:55:16,421 --> 00:55:18,798
If you're going to
talk about your mom again, leave.

855
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:19,841
No.

856
00:55:21,134 --> 00:55:22,886
I still need to know the truth.

857
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:52,874
Why don't you rest up
since you're finally home?

858
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:56,044
Though it seems like
you'll get kicked out soon.

859
00:55:57,545 --> 00:55:59,214
There's no need to be scared of me.

860
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,174
What?

861
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,177
I said I had no interest in the company.

862
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:07,639
I warned you not to mess with me,
yet look what you did.

863
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,183
In a childish way at that.

864
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:11,893
Me, scared of you?

865
00:56:11,976 --> 00:56:13,394
Don't provoke me.

866
00:56:14,896 --> 00:56:17,273
You're just a nobody.
How dare you get smart with me?

867
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,777
You better quit acting up.

868
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,512
Sa-rang, I enjoyed the live broadcast.

869
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:48,596
You did great.

870
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:51,933
You're the star of our hotel now.

871
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,476
You were so cool.

872
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,145
It was nothing, but thank you.

873
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,355
Goodness.

874
00:56:57,438 --> 00:56:59,566
Look at you guys celebrating over nothing.

875
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:04,863
Do you think you're famous now
after one TV appearance?

876
00:57:04,946 --> 00:57:06,447
Anyone could've done as much.

877
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:08,575
Had it been me,
it would've hit 10 million views.

878
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,826
You know that, right?

879
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:14,205
Right this way, sir.

880
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,541
Hello.

881
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,127
Thank you all for your hard work.

882
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:25,842
You must be her. Cheon Sa-rang.

883
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:27,552
Our best talent.

884
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:29,679
Yes, sir. I'm Cheon Sa-rang.

885
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:31,389
Who hired her?

886
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:32,515
I did.

887
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,685
The broadcast told me everything.

888
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:38,313
I get why the guests chose you
as the best employee.

889
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:42,025
You're good at thinking on your feet
and handling crises.

890
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:42,984
And you're kind-hearted.

891
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:44,861
Thank you, sir.

892
00:57:45,445 --> 00:57:49,157
Being chosen as the best talent
for two years in a row

893
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,117
is any concierge's crowning glory.

894
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,412
It's an honor for me to have
such an excellent employee at my hotel.

895
00:57:55,163 --> 00:57:56,122
Not at all.

896
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,083
I am honored
to be able to work at King Hotel.

897
00:58:00,919 --> 00:58:01,961
Starting tomorrow,

898
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,047
work at King the Land.

899
00:58:05,173 --> 00:58:06,090
Pardon?

900
00:58:06,174 --> 00:58:08,092
Didn't you say King Hotel
has been your joy and dream

901
00:58:08,176 --> 00:58:09,510
ever since you were young?

902
00:58:10,178 --> 00:58:12,472
As the employee
who loves our hotel the most,

903
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,475
you should be given the opportunity
to rise to its highest point.

904
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:42,877
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

905
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:20,957
What are you doing?

906
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:24,210
What's making you smile like that?
Let me see.

907
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:30,300
This isn't the time for you
to indulge in narcissism.

908
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:31,551
Did you even knock?

909
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:32,635
Over ten times.

910
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,513
You couldn't hear me
because you were so entranced.

911
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,641
Also, the PR team
already selected the photos,

912
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:39,976
so you don't have to look at them.

913
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,894
Here. Why don't you review this first?

914
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,772
I put this report together myself.

915
00:59:44,856 --> 00:59:46,941
I hear you'll be attending
the board meetings from now on.

916
00:59:47,025 --> 00:59:49,068
I compiled profit and loss statements
from the past three years,

917
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,529
a comparative analysis of
major competitors' marketing strategies,

918
00:59:51,612 --> 00:59:54,240
this year's business plan,
next year's business goals…

919
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,326
You're not listening to me.

920
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:59,954
So the PR team already chose the photos?

921
01:00:00,038 --> 01:00:01,331
Yes, sir.

922
01:00:02,915 --> 01:00:05,001
Why don't I take a look?

923
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,382
Is this a tilefish or a whale?

924
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:12,759
The fish hardly matters.

925
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,469
You should look at your face.

926
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:16,179
The photographer is so kind.

927
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:18,014
He even photoshopped your face.

928
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:23,811
- What is this?
- This one was the most natural

929
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:25,271
out of the ones that were photoshopped.

930
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,565
That's why you should've smiled
when they asked.

931
01:00:27,648 --> 01:00:29,192
Bring him to me immediately.

932
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:30,985
The photographer?

933
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:33,988
- Bring him to me.
- Yes, sir.

934
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:09,816
What am I even doing?

935
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:19,117
UNBELIEVABLY ACCURATE PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST

936
01:01:21,285 --> 01:01:22,787
HOW DO YOU TRULY FEEL ABOUT THEM?

937
01:01:34,465 --> 01:01:37,844
"I am always waiting
for that person's text."

938
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:38,803
"Yes."

939
01:01:38,886 --> 01:01:40,805
"Maybe. No."

940
01:01:43,015 --> 01:01:43,850
Maybe?

941
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:44,767
MAYBE

942
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,103
"I have set up an appointment

943
01:01:47,186 --> 01:01:48,980
to meet this person in private before."

944
01:01:49,564 --> 01:01:50,523
No.

945
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:54,569
"This person's number is saved
in my phone with a nickname."

946
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,613
Phony Cheon.

947
01:01:57,697 --> 01:01:58,739
Yes.

948
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:00,575
Next…

949
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,205
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THEM
EVEN WHEN I TRY NOT TO

950
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,545
"I can't help but think about them

951
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,465
even when I try not to."

952
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:21,387
YES

953
01:02:27,226 --> 01:02:28,519
NO

954
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:38,529
YES, NO

955
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:40,323
YES

956
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:43,826
"I can't help but smile

957
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,623
when I see this person smile."

958
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:04,305
YES

959
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:08,351
YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON THEM

960
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:13,731
<i>Oh, my.</i>

961
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:16,400
<i>You are dealing with
the pain of unrequited love.</i>

962
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:18,402
<i>Don't keep your feelings bottled up.</i>

963
01:03:18,486 --> 01:03:21,989
<i>Go to that person
and ask them how they feel about you.</i>

964
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:25,576
<i>You have already fallen for
that person's irresistible charms.</i>

965
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,329
<i>If you want to develop
your relationship with them,</i>

966
01:03:28,412 --> 01:03:30,915
<i>you need to muster up the courage.</i>

967
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:51,894
Thanks for your hard work.

968
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,980
Thank you for everything.

969
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,444
Good luck.

970
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:19,398
- Hey…
- Sa-rang.

971
01:06:32,263 --> 01:06:35,266
KING THE LAND

972
01:06:50,269 --> 01:06:56,883
Subtitle translation by: Stephanie Jung

973
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,218
<i>You have no idea
what King the Land is like.</i>

974
01:07:11,302 --> 01:07:13,679
We call this place
the hotel's first class.

975
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:14,930
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

976
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,475
<i>Let's go. Your uniform is ready.</i>

977
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:20,519
She must be pretty.

978
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:25,524
That rotten jerk. Forget about money.

979
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,569
<i>You should be with a man
who's good to you.</i>

980
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:30,279
<i>I asked to see you yesterday.</i>

981
01:07:30,362 --> 01:07:31,697
What? When?

982
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:34,658
<i>I simply can't stand
owing someone a favor.</i>

983
01:07:34,742 --> 01:07:35,743
But I'm okay with it.

984
01:07:35,826 --> 01:07:38,078
I just feel bad for you.

985
01:07:38,746 --> 01:07:40,456
<i>Would you like</i>

986
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:42,333
to have dinner with me?
