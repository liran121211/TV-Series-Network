DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA

4
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:57,853
Yu-ri.

5
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:59,605
Don't date me.

6
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,023
Date someone who likes you.

7
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,484
Sure.

8
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,528
I'll tell you when I start dating.

9
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:08,990
So you need to tell me first
when you begin to fool around.

10
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,950
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

11
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:14,495
I've already met

12
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:16,706
someone I like.

13
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:45,943
Yo, chicken!

14
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:47,737
{\an8}<i>Look at me, look closely</i>

15
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,363
{\an8}<i>Don't betray my love</i>

16
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,115
{\an8}<i>Come on, come to me</i>

17
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,783
{\an8}<i>This will be the last time</i>

18
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,285
{\an8}<i>Why would you leave?</i>

19
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:55,995
{\an8}<i>Why would you abandon me?</i>

20
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,414
{\an8}<i>Stop nagging and come to me, chicken</i>

21
00:01:58,497 --> 00:01:59,915
{\an8}<i>Come</i>

22
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:25,941
Can we talk for a minute?

23
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:43,042
Mr. Gu.

24
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,127
I thought you wanted chicken.

25
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:48,130
Can you eat this all by yourself?

26
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:51,675
Wait. Why are you here?

27
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:55,805
Let's talk over chicken.

28
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:56,722
Sorry?

29
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:58,432
Where are you going?

30
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:59,683
You can't go inside!

00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,268

EPISODE 7

33
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:19,245
{\an8}You should've told us
you were Sa-rang's coworker.

34
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:21,330
{\an8}I'm sorry for showing up unexpectedly,

35
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:24,750
{\an8}but if you think about it,
you didn't give me a chance to--

36
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,919
{\an8}We're basically family. Go easy on us.

37
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,337
{\an8}We work for King Group too.

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,798
{\an8}- I work at Alanga, King Fashion.
- I work at King Air.

39
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,008
{\an8}- We are all one big family.
- One big family.

40
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:34,718
{\an8}- Hermès.
- Hermès.

41
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,099
Do you work
in the same department as Sa-rang?

42
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,017
No.

43
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,935
He's--

44
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,061
Yes, we do.

45
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,773
It must be tough.

46
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,234
I heard there was
a stuck-up jerk working there.

47
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:52,778
Hey.

48
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,572
No, there isn't.

49
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,574
What are you saying?

50
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:58,200
Right. It was the head manager.

51
00:03:58,284 --> 00:03:59,702
Yes, it was the head manager.

52
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:00,953
What was his name again?

53
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:03,414
His name… Gu Won.

54
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,458
The chairman's son. The nepotism guy.

55
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,834
Right?

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,795
- No.
- Oh, my.

57
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,673
He tortured you that much?
You're tearing up just hearing his name.

58
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,341
It's okay.

59
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,677
I heard he goes to work for fun.

60
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,014
He should have fun
without bothering others.

61
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,891
There's always one in every bunch.

62
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:22,933
Hey…

63
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:24,518
Well…

64
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,061
at first.

65
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,522
At first, he was like that.

66
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,774
Just slightly.
But he's not like that anymore.

67
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:31,817
What do you mean?

68
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,403
You said he has a rotten personality.

69
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:36,739
Did I?

70
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes. You said he was a douchebag.

71
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:39,783
I see. When?

72
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,535
- Yesterday.
- And two days ago.

73
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,496
- Last week too.
- And last month.

74
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:45,623
So I did.

75
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,628
Come to think of it,
we never even introduced ourselves.

76
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,712
What's your name?

77
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:54,465
Guys,

78
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,343
- this is--
- You can call me Manager No.

79
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:00,262
My goodness. You're a manager?

80
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,847
I manage my team as well.

81
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,433
I'm Gang Da-eul. I work at Alanga.

82
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:06,060
Stop by if you ever go overseas.

83
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,811
- I'll give you a big discount.
- Okay.

84
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,939
My name is Oh Pyeong-hwa.

85
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,565
She's almost a purser at King Air.

86
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,275
Give me a call whenever you fly.

87
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,401
Thank you.

88
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,446
Steer clear of them.

89
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,572
By the way, Mr. No.

90
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,786
Why did you come here?

91
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:26,872
Why do you think?

92
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:30,125
It's because he couldn't stop
thinking about her.

93
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,711
Have you two already gone that far?

94
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:35,339
Hey.

95
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:36,966
Eat this and leave.

96
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,509
Why? We're having so much fun.

97
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:41,136
What are you going to do once we leave?

98
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,304
Hey, Gang Da-eul.

99
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:43,430
Do you want to get kicked out?

100
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:45,683
Hey, half of this house belongs to me.

101
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,434
We split the deposit and the rent.

102
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,228
Don't be rude to my guest.

103
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,230
You can stay as long as you want.

104
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:52,690
Thank you, Pyeong-hwa.

105
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:57,695
But what is that?

106
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:58,946
- Is it a gift?
- Oh, this.

107
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,074
Here. It's medicine.

108
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,576
I didn't know your symptoms,
so I got everything.

109
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,078
This is for me?

110
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:07,705
Why do I need medicine?

111
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:11,125
You didn't look so well earlier.
I thought you were sick.

112
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,547
Mr. No, you pass.

113
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,340
I give you my approval as well.

114
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,135
Don't be absurd. That's enough.

115
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,636
What did we do?

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,179
She must be feeling embarrassed.

117
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,390
Let's pretend
we don't know what's going on.

118
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,058
I told you it's nothing like that.

119
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:33,147
If I may,

120
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:38,569
I'd like to talk to her in private.

121
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:43,490
- Right? Okay.
- Go ahead.

122
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:44,825
You must have a lot to talk about.

123
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,577
- We'll give you some privacy.
- Of course.

124
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,203
- Take your time.
- Enjoy your time.

125
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:49,955
You can take as long as you need.

126
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:50,873
Let's go.

127
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:13,931
Drink this.

128
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:15,307
All right. Thanks.

129
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:18,769
I'm sorry.
It was pretty hectic, wasn't it?

130
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:19,937
Well,

131
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,483
I'd say it was a valuable time

132
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,528
for me to learn what you thought of me.

133
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:28,738
A jerk

134
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,322
and a douchebag

135
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:31,282
with a rotten personality.

136
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,579
Don't take those jokes too seriously.

137
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,372
They're such jokesters.

138
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,418
You must be super close.

139
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,212
We're practically family.

140
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,050
You have a great family.

141
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:57,308
But why did you actually come here?

142
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,771
Well, you didn't look too well earlier,

143
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:04,732
so I was worried that something was wrong

144
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,859
or that you might be sick.

145
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:14,909
Even so, you shouldn't have
left your girlfriend to come see me.

146
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,243
On her birthday, no less.

147
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,037
She's not my girlfriend.

148
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,665
- She isn't?
- No, she isn't.

149
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:23,125
Then why did you hug her?

150
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,336
- What?
- Why did you hug her

151
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,087
when she's not even your girlfriend?

152
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,673
Is your chest just open to anyone?

153
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,467
What are you, a public rest area?

154
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:42,520
Don't tell me
you're feeling jealous right now.

155
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,524
Me?

156
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,567
Why would I be jealous? No way.

157
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:49,860
What do you mean?

158
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:52,446
Your eyes are blazing with jealousy.

159
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,408
Nothing's blazing here.

160
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,244
Look.

161
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,120
No matter who you date,

162
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:03,290
I don't care in the slightest.

163
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:05,876
Fine.

164
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:07,962
Since you're so insistent,

165
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,505
I'll make sure

166
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,007
no one ever comes into my arms.

167
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,718
I never asked you to do that.

168
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:15,803
Fine.

169
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:17,847
From now on,

170
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,267
I'll make sure
there are no more uncertainties.

171
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:23,477
So don't worry.

172
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,437
I'm telling you, it's not like that.

173
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:28,732
Are you sure?

174
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:07,938
All right.

175
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,150
I'll play along.

176
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,584
What was that?

177
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,835
Are they dating now?

178
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,212
Must be nice.

179
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,467
- Have a great time.
- Take your time.

180
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:12,628
Shall we go on a date?

181
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,130
Right now?

182
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,216
It's too late.

183
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,178
What about tomorrow morning?

184
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:22,930
We have to go to work.

185
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:26,058
Then what time works for you?

186
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:30,020
The best time to eat,
the best time to drink tea,

187
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:33,607
or the best time to have a drink.

188
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,026
Let me know
what times are convenient for you.

189
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,363
I'll think about it.

190
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,159
Why do you need to think about it?

191
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:45,994
Can't it just be whenever you want?

192
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,081
I need to check my schedule.

193
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:14,648
You should get going.

194
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:15,983
Already?

195
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:18,986
Let's take a few more laps around.

196
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,696
I'll give up my precious time.

197
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,324
I humbly decline your precious time.

198
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,576
Hurry up and go now.

199
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,077
Don't tell me to leave.

200
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:30,914
I'll leave when the time is right.

201
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,169
I think now is the right time.

202
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,214
All right then.

203
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:41,633
After one last lap.

204
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,138
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

205
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,974
I'm just trying to protect you.

206
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,810
Don't get your hopes up
about anything else.

207
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,272
I wasn't expecting anything else.

208
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:59,276
Anyway, people drive
so aggressively around here.

209
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,737
It's too dangerous for you
to walk around alone.

210
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:06,700
I can watch out for any cars if I need to.

211
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,619
So let go of my hand and leave.

212
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:11,079
I think people are sleeping.

213
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,748
Let's be quiet.

214
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,375
Keep it down a bit.

215
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,310
HAWAIIAN SUN, HAWAIIAN HOST

216
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:36,230
DIOR PERFUME 30 ML

217
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,566
Hello.

218
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,112
Do you need something?

219
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,868
You've been coming to work
with a young dude these days.

220
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:51,912
Are you two dating?

221
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:56,416
I'm asking you.

222
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,584
Are you two dating?

223
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:00,504
Let go while I ask nicely.

224
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,969
Does he know about us?

225
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,721
Is it fun messing around
with a younger man?

226
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,225
What's it to you?

227
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:14,810
It's none of your business.

228
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,771
Do you want me to reveal

229
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,148
the skeleton in your closet?

230
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,901
What's wrong?

231
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,987
Are you scared?

232
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,115
That's why you should quit acting up.

233
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,243
You acting like this
makes me want to run my mouth.

234
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,786
Don't you dare say anything.

235
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,456
If you do,
I won't let you get away with it.

236
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,628
I love that fiery glare of yours.

237
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,672
This is why I can't get over you.

238
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,884
Does your wife know you act like this?

239
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,649
Hello, sir.

240
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,567
Hey.

241
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,611
Ro-un,

242
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,988
what do you think
of a woman with a dirty past?

243
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,283
A sly woman

244
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:12,951
who hides her true identity.

245
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:16,705
Why…

246
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,961
are you asking me that all of a sudden?

247
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:25,464
Then again,

248
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,424
why do I bother asking?

249
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,051
No man would like that.

250
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,763
Well then. I'll leave you guys to it.

251
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:50,197
If you ever run into problems
or need any help,

252
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,407
you can tell me everything.

253
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:54,743
All right?

254
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:19,810
Hello, how are you?

255
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:21,436
Not good. Why are you asking?

256
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,689
I'm already so pissed.

257
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,357
Are you making fun of me?

258
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,692
Just get changed.

259
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,111
What is this?

260
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:31,822
I was told to doll you up and escort you.

261
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:35,367
I heard they even sent a helicopter
just to save you.

262
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,369
You're really something.

263
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:39,913
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:42,040
Is that how you should say sorry?

265
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,294
Do you think I'm a joke
because I delivered clothes to you?

266
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,004
Do you think you're all that now?

267
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:47,921
No, ma'am.

268
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,256
What are you doing?

269
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,342
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

270
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,178
I was teaching her basic manners.

271
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:58,640
She lacks basic propriety
but lucked out and rose to the top.

272
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,684
It seems to have gone to her head.

273
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:07,149
Ms. Kim, did you climb up the ladder
because you lucked out?

274
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:08,191
Sorry?

275
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:12,112
I obviously climbed up the ladder
due to my competence alone.

276
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,071
Of course.

277
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:16,033
No one at King Hotel
can climb their way up on luck alone.

278
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:21,204
On top of that, King the Land is only open
to the most competent employees.

279
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:22,622
Am I right?

280
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:24,124
You are. But--

281
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:27,085
Sa-rang was chosen as the best talent
for two consecutive years.

282
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,212
As a result, she got to promote the hotel.

283
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:31,631
Her success is a result
of her own efforts.

284
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:34,468
It's not because she was lucky.

285
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,385
Understood?

286
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:37,095
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,389
If you ever mistreat my concierges again,

288
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,641
I'll have to give you a lesson in manners.

289
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:43,352
Why are you here?

290
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:46,772
Ms. Gu told me
to get her ready for a press conference.

291
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:51,485
She ordered that Ms. Cheon
look elegant from head to toe.

292
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:53,695
I can help her. You may leave.

293
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:54,780
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,645
Just read off the script.

295
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:30,273
All the questions will be directed at me,
so don't worry.

296
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:31,566
Yes, ma'am.

297
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:33,860
PRESS CONFERENCE ANSWER SHEET

298
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,613
This part is slightly unsettling.

299
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:38,323
What?

300
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:41,201
It says I was
in a life-and-death situation,

301
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,286
but it wasn't that serious.

302
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,996
That doesn't matter.

303
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:47,541
People don't care about the facts.

304
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:48,500
They want drama.

305
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:50,919
That is why we need to tell a story.

306
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:53,588
That would be deceiving them.

307
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:59,094
Do you know how much it cost
just to rescue you?

308
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,888
The company paid for it.

309
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,474
Don't you even feel sorry?

310
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,020
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,108
I arranged this event
to help you ease your guilt.

312
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,611
The PR team even created a story for you.

313
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:18,029
How convenient, right?

314
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,698
We're all doing you a favor.

315
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,367
So you should do your best too.

316
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:25,454
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:27,247
Read the last part.

318
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:28,915
Right now?

319
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,250
Yes, right now.

320
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:36,423
{\an8}"I was stranded
in a life-and-death situation

321
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:37,632
due to extreme weather."

322
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:40,343
"I am thankful that King Hotel…"

323
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:43,013
…AND MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

324
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,225
What is it? Is there a problem?

325
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,272
The person who rescued me
was Head Manager Gu.

326
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:54,149
I authorized the helicopter.

327
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,027
He doesn't have that authority.

328
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:00,405
So I'm the only one you need to thank.

329
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:02,532
Read it again.

330
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,669
Best date spots in Seoul.

331
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:25,055
"Sweet and romantic.
Don't worry, we have you covered."

332
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:27,557
- Are you going on a date?
- Nice.

333
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,226
{\an8}What are you doing?

334
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,686
{\an8}HEAD MANAGER GU WON

335
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,771
{\an8}Who's your date?

336
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:33,688
No one.

337
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,065
There's no date.

338
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:36,441
Yes, it is. Look.

339
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,484
Come on.

340
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:43,323
I was just trying to check and see

341
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:46,618
if our hotel was
on the list of date spots.

342
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,122
{\an8}What was that snicker?

343
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:54,709
Do you even know what it's like
to be on a date?

344
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,629
- Of course I do.
- Of course you don't.

345
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:00,924
I have the ultimate skill that can steal
a woman's heart in one minute.

346
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,343
Do you want me to teach you?

347
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:06,721
In one minute?

348
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:07,764
One minute.

349
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,940
You think <i>I</i> would learn

350
00:21:17,732 --> 00:21:18,567
from <i>you</i>?

351
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,531
A date

352
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,701
is like a war in which you must
win a woman's heart.

353
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:31,162
And do you know
the key thing to help you do so?

354
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,164
What is it?

355
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,792
Right. You said you didn't need my help.

356
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,960
Jeez.

357
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:39,087
I'll do you a favor and listen.

358
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:40,797
Okay.

359
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,424
You probably didn't know this,

360
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,968
but you have to get her to notice you.

361
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,137
Stay within her line of sight

362
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,223
and brush past her sometimes
as if it were a chance encounter.

363
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:51,141
Get it?

364
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:52,684
That would be stalking her.

365
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,311
You can't make it obvious.

366
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:56,146
You have to appear,

367
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,440
then disappear.

368
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:00,650
Get close but not too close.

369
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:01,776
You get it?

370
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:03,695
Then she'll think,

371
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,573
"Why do I keep running into him?"

372
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:08,783
"Can it mean something?"

373
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:10,201
Just when you're on her mind,

374
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,703
you have to disappear.

375
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:14,706
Then she'll start missing you
and thinking about you.

376
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:16,458
Then it's game over.

377
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,627
That'll work?

378
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,378
Of course. It definitely will.

379
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:29,596
Goodness.

380
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,847
Where are you going?

381
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,515
I have something to report.

382
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,059
Does it have to do with me?

383
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:38,355
Not really, but you still need to
have an idea of the company's--

384
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:41,733
From now on, if it's unrelated to me,

385
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:43,401
don't report it.

386
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:49,616
How entertaining.

387
00:23:17,685 --> 00:23:19,813
Do you need anything else, sir?

388
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,650
No. I just stopped by as I was passing by.

389
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,026
Don't mind me.

390
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,985
Yes, sir.

391
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:33,076
Are you looking for someone?

392
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:36,454
Did all the employees clock in?

393
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:37,914
Yes, sir.

394
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:40,542
Why don't I see Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

395
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,752
She went to a press conference.

396
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:46,840
A press conference?

397
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:49,926
PRESS CONFERENCE ON KING HOTEL
SUPER FARMER WEEK EMERGENCY RESPONSE

398
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:02,939
You could've just waited
after reporting it to emergency services.

399
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:06,568
Instead, you called all the board members
for an emergency meeting at night.

400
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,485
Is it true?

401
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,404
Yes. An employee was in danger.

402
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:12,323
Was there a reason
for your personal involvement?

403
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:15,493
I received news that the search
was being delayed due to the weather.

404
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,203
She was alone in the mountains.

405
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:18,538
Of course I had to.

406
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:22,292
Dispatching a helicopter
just to save one employee

407
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,752
was probably not an easy decision
for the company.

408
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,087
No. It was easy.

409
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:27,505
Once again,

410
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:29,299
an employee was in danger.

411
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:34,053
I'm sure it was difficult not to consider
the expense of dispatching the helicopter.

412
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:36,389
Don't companies these days,
especially conglomerates,

413
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,641
usually act in their own interests?

414
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,018
That is true.

415
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:41,811
Profit comes first for any company.

416
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:45,231
But the employees
are the ones who generate that profit.

417
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:48,818
That's why we say
that the employees are its true owners.

418
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,113
It sounds like your employees
can really trust the company.

419
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:54,282
It is my responsibility
to make that possible.

420
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,868
I have a question for the employee.

421
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,661
Do you have

422
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,455
any last words for the company?

423
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,290
I was stranded

424
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:47,210
in a life-and-death situation
due to extreme weather.

425
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:49,963
I am thankful that King Hotel

426
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:52,882
and Managing Director Gu Hwa-ran
came to my rescue.

427
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:57,554
Managing Director Gu,
do you have a message for your employees?

428
00:25:58,638 --> 00:25:59,472
Excuse me.

429
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:04,018
Can I say one last thing?

430
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:24,872
There was someone who flew
through the storm in the helicopter.

431
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:32,005
Thank you, Head Manager Gu Won,
from the bottom of my heart.

432
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:49,314
Thank you very much.

433
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,702
Ms. Gu, please look over here.

434
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:36,152
"Third-generation business leaders
are on the rise."

435
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:38,237
They talk as if
that's just gotten started.

436
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:42,283
"When Managing Director Gu Hwa-ran
learned of the plight of her employee,

437
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,118
she held an emergency board meeting

438
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:46,287
and dispatched a helicopter herself to…"

439
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:47,664
She stole your spotlight.

440
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,374
You're the one who dispatched it.

441
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:50,333
This is absurd.

442
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,543
Mr. Gu, you have to learn this from her.

443
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,170
Her self-promotion

444
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:57,465
has the press printing out rumors
that the successor has been chosen.

445
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,426
Are you listening to me? Are you?

446
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,845
The owner of the company is speaking.

447
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,515
I mean…

448
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,518
It says here that the employees
are the owners of the company.

449
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,186
Why didn't you tell me
about the press conference?

450
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:12,939
You told me not to report
anything unrelated to you.

451
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,357
How was this unrelated to me?

452
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,275
A King the Land employee
being dragged away

453
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,528
and manipulated like a puppet
deserves a report.

454
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:19,570
Then make it clear.

455
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,030
How much do you want to know?

456
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:22,156
I'll report everything.

457
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,243
Only things that have to do with me.

458
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:26,202
Exactly.

459
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,620
How involved do you want to get?

460
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:29,288
For example,

461
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:32,291
schemes Ms. Gu employs
to secure her spot as the successor?

462
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,211
I don't need to know that,
nor do I want to.

463
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:37,338
Then what about this?

464
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:41,551
In a few days, a prince named Samir
from the Middle East will visit Korea.

465
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,010
He's the 13th richest man in the world,

466
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:44,762
and his one-night stay
is worth a month's sales.

467
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,306
Every hotel in Korea is at war
to get him to stay at their hotel.

468
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,184
Even Ms. Gu tried, but she failed.

469
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:52,854
You can use this point
to your advantage, sir.

470
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:54,647
That has nothing to do with me.

471
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:56,774
Report about my employees only.

472
00:28:58,151 --> 00:28:59,360
Who?

473
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:01,821
- Should I do a background check?
- No.

474
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:03,740
I want to know who's having a tough time

475
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,075
or being treated unfairly.

476
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:07,744
That's all I need.

477
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:10,705
All employees have it rough
and are treated unfairly.

478
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,665
That comes with the job description.

479
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:13,708
Mr. Gu,

480
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:18,046
if you really want to get involved,
you have to let me brief you.

481
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:20,882
I know you're displeased
with how Ms. Gu is acting.

482
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:22,842
You need to gain power

483
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,678
in order to protect your employees.

484
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,309
Don't stare me down like that.

485
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,437
Gain the power
that's suitable for your position.

486
00:29:57,502 --> 00:29:59,962
You did exceptionally well
at today's press conference.

487
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,715
The successor of a company
isn't just decided internally.

488
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,300
Public opinion matters too.

489
00:30:04,383 --> 00:30:07,595
It reflects who comes to mind
when they think of our group.

490
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:09,138
Are you trying to lecture me?

491
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:11,390
I'm sorry, ma'am.

492
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,977
Are we out of options with Prince Samir?

493
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:19,023
First Royal Hotel is already
in negotiations regarding his stay.

494
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:22,735
We tried everything, but he was obstinate.

495
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:25,988
Is this what I have to hear
after six months of groundwork?

496
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:28,241
I'm sorry, ma'am.

497
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:30,451
But there's nothing we can do.

498
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:36,499
Let's give up then.

499
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,334
From now on,

500
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:41,003
it's none of our business.

501
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:54,350
Was it you?

502
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,979
You had her mention your name?

503
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:02,108
Or was it Sa-rang's own decision?

504
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,112
I made her do it.

505
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,363
I did save her after all.

506
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,657
So you piggybacked off of my plan.

507
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:11,701
Don't you think it's pathetic?

508
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,411
It's better than deceiving others.

509
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,414
I enjoyed the show though.

510
00:31:16,497 --> 00:31:20,501
"The employees
are the true owners of the company."

511
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:24,213
Is that what you really think?

512
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:25,298
Of course.

513
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,383
The owners of the company
are the employees.

514
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:30,678
And I happen to own the employees.

515
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,180
How shameless of you.

516
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,431
I pay them.

517
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:36,309
In any world, the person
who provides the money is the owner.

518
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:38,019
If you really think that way,

519
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,522
you don't deserve to become

520
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:43,816
the owner of the group.

521
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,403
Then do you?

522
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,865
Do you realize
how much damage you've caused?

523
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:53,951
I'm the one who restored what you damaged.

524
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:58,623
Though I'm sure the economic impact
generated by today's articles

525
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,999
will go over your head.

526
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:02,293
Don't calculate someone's worth
with money.

527
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,755
This is why you're not good enough.

528
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:09,300
The head of a company
must maximize its profits,

529
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:11,219
even if it means putting on an act.

530
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:13,346
The company can't exist without me,

531
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,723
and the employees
can't exist without the company.

532
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,774
Well done, Ms. Gu.

533
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:29,153
You demonstrated
how to improve the company's image.

534
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:32,865
Today's articles on the economy
are all about you, Ms. Gu.

535
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:35,952
Your story is continuing to
circulate on social media,

536
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:37,870
and journalists are writing about it.

537
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:39,080
Is that so?

538
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:42,667
I didn't think that far ahead,
but I'm glad we attracted publicity.

539
00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:46,087
What about the Arab prince?

540
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,130
I think he will stay at First Royal Hotel.

541
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:49,966
If it isn't official yet,

542
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,426
do whatever it takes
to bring him to our hotel.

543
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,053
We should,

544
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:56,931
but King the Land is in charge
of inviting and managing our VIP guests.

545
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,934
So it's Head Manager Gu's responsibility.

546
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:04,313
Then you should do whatever it takes
to bring him to our hotel.

547
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:07,400
If they take him,
it won't just be a matter of sales.

548
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:10,528
This could determine
the industry's leading position.

549
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:12,863
It could change the game.

550
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:13,823
Do you understand?

551
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,201
Why aren't you answering?

552
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:18,619
Didn't you make any preparations?

553
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,541
If you're not up for it, tell me.

554
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,794
That way, your sister can take action.

555
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:34,176
I'll do it.

556
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,014
Are you confident?

557
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:41,058
I'll bring the Arab prince to our hotel,

558
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:43,644
even if I have to put on an act.

559
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,063
Good.

560
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,917
You know there was a banquet today, right?

561
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,336
Do you know how busy we were?

562
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:11,297
You're lucky you got to slack off.

563
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,549
The world is so unfair.

564
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,886
I wasn't slacking off.

565
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,513
I was following Ms. Gu's orders
for a scheduled event.

566
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,182
That's not my problem.

567
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:24,643
We served the guests when it was busiest,

568
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:27,438
so you can clean up on your own, right?

569
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:31,275
By myself?

570
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,652
No one was able to rest
because we were so busy.

571
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:35,196
We'll be in the staff lounge.

572
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:36,739
Call us when you're done.

573
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:37,740
Let's go, guys.

574
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:39,992
Good luck.

575
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:06,370
So you wanted to thank me?

576
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,456
Sorry?

577
00:36:09,832 --> 00:36:11,417
I mean…

578
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:14,044
Since you're thankful,
let's have some coffee.

579
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:19,884
I'm extremely busy right now.

580
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,386
I have to rearrange everything
before break time ends.

581
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:26,807
Then I'll help you.

582
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:42,239
Wait. That's not how you do it.

583
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:47,745
Don't I just have to cover it?

584
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:49,872
There are no "justs" in the hotel.

585
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:54,293
The edges of the tablecloth need to
hang evenly at the perfect angle.

586
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:57,880
Is all of that necessary
when they'll only be used once?

587
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:02,051
A lot of people
devote their time and energy

588
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:04,261
to satisfy the guests
that'll be sitting here.

589
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:06,430
And I'm spreading out their devotion.

590
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:08,516
Isn't it fine as long as it's neat?

591
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,226
Do you have to give meaning to it?

592
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,354
If I don't,

593
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:16,440
the things that I do become chores
that can be done by anyone.

594
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:18,317
However,

595
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:21,946
if I give meaning to it, it becomes
something special that only I can do.

596
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:28,452
That also gives meaning
to my career as a hotel concierge.

597
00:37:38,295 --> 00:37:40,214
I'll spread out that devotion with you.

598
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,175
Teach me.
I'll learn how to do it properly.

599
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:50,307
All right.

600
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:54,895
Then try grabbing the edge like this.

601
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:56,397
- The edge?
- Yes.

602
00:37:57,147 --> 00:37:59,149
- And…
- Like this?

603
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,610
No, you can't stretch it out like that.

604
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:03,737
Let's see. This much?

605
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:10,119
- Is this good?
- No.

606
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:13,205
There still needs to be some tightness,

607
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:14,623
so around this much.

608
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,003
So…

609
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,715
if it can't be too tight…

610
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:23,924
Yes.

611
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:25,926
…or too loose,

612
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,053
I can just hold it however I want.

613
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:37,104
Just leave. I can do it by myself.

614
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:39,523
Fine. I'll put in more care and effort.

615
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:42,067
How do I do it? Like this?

616
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,321
Yes.

617
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,699
All right.

618
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:50,868
On the count of three,

619
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:52,328
you're going to gently let go.

620
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:54,830
- Gently?
- One, two, three.

621
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,251
Good.

622
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:12,050
Are we done now?

623
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:20,642
Yes, you did a good job.

624
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:22,853
Well, of course.

625
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:23,979
I'm good at everything.

626
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:25,856
Lucky you.

627
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,860
I just dropped in while I was passing by.

628
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:31,278
I know.

629
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,696
Just in case

630
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:36,992
you were thinking that I came on purpose.

631
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:39,203
I wasn't.

632
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:44,208
Why don't you ever think about me?

633
00:41:46,418 --> 00:41:48,378
All I said was I didn't think
you came on purpose.

634
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,589
I never said I don't think about you.

635
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:59,014
That's true.

636
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,643
There's no way
you wouldn't think about me.

637
00:42:07,147 --> 00:42:09,149
Follow me.
There's still so much left to do.

638
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:19,993
Hurry up.

639
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:29,878
Grab the end and lay it down gently again.

640
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:32,297
One, two, three.

641
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:37,219
{\an8}HEAD MANAGER GU WON

642
00:42:58,073 --> 00:42:59,199
What do you want for dinner?

643
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:01,451
- Anything but short ribs.
- No short ribs.

644
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:06,081
I hope you guys weren't slacking off
while I was away.

645
00:43:07,749 --> 00:43:09,877
If you're that worried,
you can work with us.

646
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,961
Why would I do that?

647
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:13,046
Mark my words.

648
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,966
I'm watching all of you like a hawk.

649
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,384
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,763
I was thinking of having
a team dinner this week.

651
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,932
Let me know when you all are free.

652
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:27,519
For the record, I'm busy every day

653
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:29,062
except for Thursday.

654
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:31,857
Then we can do Thursday.

655
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:34,234
Really?

656
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:36,320
If that's what you want.
What should we eat?

657
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:37,946
Whatever the girls want to eat.

658
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,698
What do you want to eat?

659
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:42,701
- Sashimi. It's been a while.
- You're right.

660
00:43:42,784 --> 00:43:44,745
I went to a sushi buffet
and had my fill yesterday.

661
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:46,955
I'm sick of eating raw fish.

662
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,415
What about grilled beef intestines?

663
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,083
How do you eat that stuff?

664
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:51,376
Then Ms. Do,

665
00:43:52,002 --> 00:43:54,296
what do you think of a family restaurant?

666
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:56,298
Are you a kid?
Should we throw a birthday party?

667
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:58,884
What about pork trotters?
The place next door is good.

668
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,719
How dare you put trotters
on the dining table?

669
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:02,220
They stink.

670
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:04,932
We can go wherever you want.

671
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:06,808
Just decide among yourselves.

672
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:08,602
Must I decide everything for you?

673
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,230
Then we'll let you know
after discussing it.

674
00:44:14,232 --> 00:44:16,234
The place we went to last time…

675
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:17,653
What was it called again?

676
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:19,988
Gosh.

677
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:21,365
They had good short ribs.

678
00:44:23,158 --> 00:44:25,118
You know, I'm just saying.

679
00:44:26,745 --> 00:44:28,330
- Well, then.
- Goodbye.

680
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:30,207
Have a good evening.

681
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,294
Why did she have to say
she wanted short ribs

682
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:35,671
in such a roundabout way?

683
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,340
She was just trying to sugarcoat it.

684
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,051
I'll call them to make a reservation.

685
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:42,010
Yes, ma'am.

686
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:44,721
Five servings of fresh short ribs.

687
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:46,431
Wait. Marinated ribs are best here.

688
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:48,392
- Can you make those marinated?
- Sure.

689
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,353
They like fresh ribs.

690
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:53,230
How much did the revenue increase by?

691
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:55,399
Around 15%.

692
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:58,777
At this rate,
we'll be able to achieve our goal of 20%.

693
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,196
Why don't we increase it by another 10%?

694
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:05,075
That's ridiculous.
We're already overworked as it is.

695
00:45:05,158 --> 00:45:06,868
You'll get an incentive trip.

696
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:09,162
We were already promised one
if we reached 20%.

697
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:11,456
Instead of three days in Jeju,

698
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,875
let's go to Southeast Asia for six days.
How's that?

699
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,461
Bali, Phuket, Cebu, Kota Kinabalu…

700
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,422
Choose wherever you want to go.

701
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:20,215
- Really?
- Of course.

702
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:22,384
If we increase our sales,
we can go anywhere.

703
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:23,885
You can do it, right?

704
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:26,012
But still, 30% is a bit far-fetched.

705
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:28,306
If you think it's impossible, it is.

706
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,934
If you think it's possible,
you can do anything.

707
00:45:31,017 --> 00:45:33,562
It all depends on you, Ms. Gang.

708
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:36,481
Da-eul, let's make it happen.

709
00:45:37,274 --> 00:45:39,985
If we add another 10%,
we won't be able to take any breaks.

710
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:41,278
Are you okay with that?

711
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,155
Yes, we don't need any breaks.

712
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:45,323
Of course.

713
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,868
What could go wrong
when we have you, Ms. Gang?

714
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:49,953
Okay. To our vacation.

715
00:45:50,537 --> 00:45:51,872
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

716
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:04,050
Did you hear the news?

717
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:06,845
The Arab prince is staying at our hotel.

718
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:11,266
He has refined taste
befitting a member of the royal family.

719
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:14,186
He knows for a fact
which hotel is the best in Korea.

720
00:46:14,686 --> 00:46:17,022
We're named First Royal Hotel
for a reason.

721
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:20,400
I heard it was a provisional contract.

722
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:24,112
Goodness. You should know better.

723
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:26,239
He already reserved
a week's worth of meals,

724
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:29,618
and we changed
the curtain colors and toilet.

725
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:31,077
How is that provisional?

726
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:33,747
You never know
until everything's set in stone.

727
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:37,751
Jeez. You two fight like cats and dogs.

728
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:40,045
When will you grow up?

729
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:42,047
Just admit that you're jealous.

730
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,967
Anyway, the tables have turned.

731
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,260
First Royal is number one.

732
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:48,970
King Hotel is number two.

733
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:51,181
That means King the Land is second too.

734
00:46:55,977 --> 00:46:57,813
Our best talent.

735
00:46:57,896 --> 00:46:59,564
How is she <i>your </i>best talent?

736
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:01,149
She's <i>my</i> hotel's best talent.

737
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,071
The Arab prince
will be staying at our hotel.

738
00:47:06,613 --> 00:47:09,449
Come and greet him
as my hotel's employee representative.

739
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:11,785
- Pardon?
- Goodness.

740
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:14,621
Stop bothering my hardworking employee
with your nonsense.

741
00:47:15,205 --> 00:47:18,542
I might be able to give you this hotel,
but I'll never let you have her.

742
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:21,211
Do you want to bet?

743
00:47:21,294 --> 00:47:22,128
Yes.

744
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:23,713
Just make a bet.

745
00:47:23,797 --> 00:47:26,925
Man up and bet your hotels.

746
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:29,928
- Jeez.
- Goodness.

747
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,891
Is that so?

748
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,821
- What?
- I have bad news for you.

749
00:47:47,904 --> 00:47:50,782
The Arab prince is coming to my hotel.

750
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,536
- What?
- My son, Won, got it done.

751
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:57,664
A hotel's history and reputation
are what make it number one.

752
00:47:58,415 --> 00:47:59,499
Hold on.

753
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,876
When the Arab prince comes,

754
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:03,628
you can greet him
as our employee representative.

755
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:04,838
Okay?

756
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,008
Yes, sir. Thank you.

757
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:10,760
Hey, it's me.

758
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:12,804
What happened?

759
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:15,682
What happened with the Arab prince?

760
00:48:16,266 --> 00:48:18,018
We even changed the toilet!

761
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:19,686
Good work.

762
00:48:20,353 --> 00:48:21,855
As expected of my son.

763
00:48:21,938 --> 00:48:23,064
You have tricks up your sleeve.

764
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:25,942
I heard he already made the down payment.

765
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:27,277
Is he really coming to our hotel?

766
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,070
Yes, I called him.

767
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:32,616
The prince changed his mind
after a single call from you?

768
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:36,077
How is that possible?

769
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:38,622
I know, right?

770
00:48:39,998 --> 00:48:41,082
But it was possible.

771
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,044
<i>Hello?</i>

772
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:45,712
Samir?

773
00:48:46,546 --> 00:48:47,589
You know it's me.

774
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:50,133
Of course, it's me. What's up?

775
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:51,801
I heard you're coming to Korea.

776
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:53,845
<i>Why are you digging around me?</i>

777
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:57,807
Come to my hotel.

778
00:48:57,891 --> 00:49:01,144
Oh, I heard your father
runs a hotel business.

779
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:02,896
Is the business not going well?

780
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,815
<i>You want me to spend some money there?</i>

781
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,692
You don't need to spend your money.

782
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:09,277
So, just come.

783
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,738
But you hated me
ever since we were in the same school.

784
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:14,407
Because you believe
that I only care about the money

785
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:16,326
Yes, I still hate you

786
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:19,412
I love your honesty.

787
00:49:19,955 --> 00:49:22,749
But I already decided to stay at
the First Royal Hotel.

788
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:24,709
Why would I switch to your hotel?

789
00:49:26,544 --> 00:49:27,754
I will treat you well.

790
00:49:29,255 --> 00:49:30,548
Treat me well?

791
00:49:31,383 --> 00:49:32,842
Treat me well?

792
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,470
Explain "well" in detail, please?

793
00:49:36,972 --> 00:49:39,015
Tell me everything you want.

794
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:40,517
I will make it happen.

795
00:49:41,685 --> 00:49:42,644
Anything?

796
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:45,689
Anything.

797
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,943
Okay.

798
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:51,486
I'll send you the contract.

799
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:52,737
{\an8}<i>So, sign it.</i>

800
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,324
{\an8}Is he really your friend?

801
00:49:56,408 --> 00:49:58,201
{\an8}Even the legal team
has never seen such a contract.

802
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:01,121
He's not my friend.

803
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:02,706
We're just acquaintances.

804
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:05,959
It'd be better were he a stranger.
Look at the contract.

805
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:08,420
"You will always answer me with 'yes.'"

806
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:10,588
"You will always serve me with a smile."

807
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:11,673
How is that a contract?

808
00:50:11,756 --> 00:50:13,133
He's just looking for a slave.

809
00:50:13,216 --> 00:50:15,135
You can't sign it.

810
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:16,761
Why not?

811
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:17,887
You just can't.

812
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:20,765
He's going to shove you around.

813
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:22,726
What does he take you for?

814
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:25,937
You're a selfish jerk
who doesn't listen to others.

815
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:28,023
You've never smiled at anyone.

816
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:29,399
You'll definitely break the contract.

817
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:31,067
Who's going to deal with it? Me?

818
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:33,611
- I can't.
- Why not?

819
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:35,613
Do you think I'm a douchebag

820
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:37,657
with a rotten personality?

821
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:40,076
 Did someone say that to you?

822
00:50:40,702 --> 00:50:42,078
I don't think you're that bad.

823
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:45,081
I told you not to sign it.

824
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,418
You've never kowtowed to
or served anyone before.

825
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:49,544
I can just half-ass it.

826
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:52,047
No, you can't.

827
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,882
You won't be able to stand him.

828
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:55,050
Do you want to see?

829
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:56,926
- What?
- Here.

830
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:59,054
Imagine I'm Prince Samir.

831
00:51:07,812 --> 00:51:09,230
Hey, Gu Won.

832
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:11,858
Come take my shoes off

833
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:13,443
and bring me some slippers.

834
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:19,699
You have to say "yes" sincerely
with a smile on your face.

835
00:51:19,783 --> 00:51:23,161
Or else I won't pay a single penny
for breach of contract.

836
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,124
Yes.

837
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,042
Great.

838
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:30,752
Good job.

839
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:39,177
Come over here.

840
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,430
I should lift up my right leg.

841
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:45,600
I want you to get down on your knees.

842
00:51:54,943 --> 00:51:55,902
Easy.

843
00:51:58,321 --> 00:51:59,239
Good job.

844
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:00,865
Make sure you polish my shoes.

845
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:03,159
They're very expensive.

846
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,540
What did I tell you? Goodness.

847
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,459
Get

848
00:52:11,543 --> 00:52:12,585
over here!

849
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:19,050
<i>Prince Samir,
the 13th richest person in the world,</i>

850
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:20,552
<i>has arrived in Korea.</i>

851
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:22,512
<i>His trip was announced as leisure travel,</i>

852
00:52:22,595 --> 00:52:26,474
<i>but it seems his purpose is to negotiate
the import of next-generation warplanes.</i>

853
00:52:26,558 --> 00:52:28,476
<i>During his stay, he'll likely meet with</i>

854
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,271
<i>the head of the Defense Acquisition
Program Administration…</i>

855
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:28,995
Get off.

856
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:30,455
Open the door.

857
00:53:49,057 --> 00:53:50,975
Your driving sucks, just like you.

858
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,603
So, make your guard
drive for you, not me.

859
00:53:53,686 --> 00:53:55,438
No, that's no fun.

860
00:53:56,022 --> 00:53:56,940
Hold this.

861
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:05,448
Smile.

862
00:54:05,531 --> 00:54:06,616
Prince Samir,

863
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,243
welcome to King Hotel.

864
00:54:08,326 --> 00:54:10,954
I'm Gu Hwa-ran,
and I'm in charge of this hotel.

865
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:12,872
We did our best to welcome you,

866
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:15,667
and we will provide you
with the best service.

867
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:25,134
I only learned how to greet you in Arabic.

868
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:27,053
Welcome to King Hotel.

869
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:29,430
Are these flowers for me?

870
00:54:31,724 --> 00:54:33,268
You're good at Korean.

871
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,688
Welcome.

872
00:54:39,357 --> 00:54:40,400
How beautiful.

873
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:41,526
Thank you.

874
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,861
On behalf of the hotel,

875
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:46,698
I prepared a small gift from the heart.

876
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:48,533
Can I take a look at it now?

877
00:54:48,616 --> 00:54:49,575
Yes, Your Highness.

878
00:54:50,118 --> 00:54:53,788
You may be disappointed
because it's such a small gift.

879
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:56,749
It's a gift from your heart.
How could I be disappointed?

880
00:54:59,419 --> 00:55:00,295
What is this?

881
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:02,672
It is a traditional Korean knot bracelet.

882
00:55:02,755 --> 00:55:04,299
I had one prepared in green

883
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:07,593
as I heard green is associated
with abundance, sanctity, and paradise

884
00:55:07,677 --> 00:55:09,053
in the Arab world.

885
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:11,222
I have a keen eye.

886
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:13,016
I'm incredible.

887
00:55:14,017 --> 00:55:15,393
- Sorry?
- The moment I saw you,

888
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:18,813
I knew your heart
would be as beautiful as your face.

889
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:21,566
"Sa-rang."

890
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:23,735
Will you put it on for me?

891
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:30,867
Yes, Your Highness.

892
00:55:36,622 --> 00:55:37,790
I'll put it on for you.

893
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,009
There.

894
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:50,345
You're all checked in,
so you can head straight to your room.

895
00:55:51,137 --> 00:55:52,055
Follow me.

896
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:56,726
I received such a precious gift.

897
00:55:57,393 --> 00:55:58,853
I must do something in return.

898
00:55:58,936 --> 00:56:00,021
Have you eaten yet?

899
00:56:01,481 --> 00:56:02,648
Sa-rang?

900
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:04,150
Sorry?

901
00:56:04,233 --> 00:56:05,777
You have to hold it in, sir.

902
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:17,705
Why aren't you eating?

903
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:18,831
Do you want something else?

904
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:20,666
It's okay.

905
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,710
I don't even think
I can finish all of this.

906
00:56:22,794 --> 00:56:24,295
You don't have to.

907
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:25,546
Just eat what's good.

908
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:27,215
Yes, Your Highness.

909
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:30,051
By the way,
I was surprised by your Korean skills.

910
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,138
My first love was Korean.

911
00:56:34,722 --> 00:56:35,765
Really?

912
00:56:35,848 --> 00:56:38,643
I studied hard to tell her how I felt,
but I got rejected.

913
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:40,603
What a horrible woman.

914
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:46,359
Maybe it was to meet you.

915
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:48,486
Like destiny.

916
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:06,212
Do you feel uncomfortable?

917
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:08,423
You look displeased.

918
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,258
Well…

919
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:13,136
This is where I work, actually.

920
00:57:13,219 --> 00:57:18,224
So it's slightly uncomfortable to sit here
while everyone else is working.

921
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:20,435
- Should I tell them to leave?
- No, it's okay.

922
00:57:20,518 --> 00:57:21,936
Please don't.

923
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:24,897
No…

924
00:57:24,981 --> 00:57:26,858
Have you never eaten in places like this?

925
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:31,612
No, this is my first time.

926
00:57:32,196 --> 00:57:35,241
It feels weird to be
sitting at the table that I set.

927
00:57:35,324 --> 00:57:37,493
It seems people always put duty first

928
00:57:37,577 --> 00:57:39,370
and enjoying their rights second.

929
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:41,831
I rented out this whole place for you.

930
00:57:41,914 --> 00:57:43,416
You are the star of the day.

931
00:57:43,499 --> 00:57:45,084
Enjoy it to the fullest.

932
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:48,129
Thank you.

933
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:56,512
How dare you sit down?

934
00:57:57,847 --> 00:57:59,265
I want to enjoy my rights too.

935
00:58:00,016 --> 00:58:01,017
I drove you,

936
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,227
opened the door for you,
and held your luggage.

937
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:05,146
I think I deserve to eat as well.

938
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:07,565
I'll give you food.
Eat over there by yourself.

939
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:08,983
Don't mind me.

940
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:13,070
You're an eyesore.

941
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:16,073
I'd like to say the same thing.

942
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:17,950
Hey,

943
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:20,661
don't you think
you've messed with me enough?

944
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:22,914
You had enough fun.

945
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:26,876
- You should stop now.
- I was already planning on it.

946
00:58:26,959 --> 00:58:28,628
I don't need you anymore. Get going.

947
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:29,879
Okay. Good thinking.

948
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:34,675
I'll have our hotel's best employee
attend to you.

949
00:58:34,759 --> 00:58:37,136
- Let's get up.
- No, you don't need to.

950
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,430
I already chose my attendant.

951
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:40,681
It's Sa-rang.

952
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,600
- Pardon?
- What, punk?

953
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:47,355
Not her.

954
00:58:48,773 --> 00:58:49,607
Why not?

955
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,150
Because I said so.

956
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:52,652
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang is my…

957
00:58:53,653 --> 00:58:54,779
personal assistant.

958
00:58:55,446 --> 00:58:57,240
I am? Since when?

959
00:58:58,407 --> 00:58:59,242
Starting today.

960
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:02,036
Remember the contract?

961
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:04,121
You have to say yes to everything I say.

962
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:19,887
Then I'll stay.

963
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:22,265
No, I don't need you. Get out.

964
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:23,724
Remember the contract?

965
00:59:24,392 --> 00:59:25,393
I have to

966
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:29,522
stay next to you at all times.

967
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,717
The meeting is taking a while.

968
01:00:01,387 --> 01:00:03,014
You don't have to go too far.

969
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:03,973
What do you mean?

970
01:00:04,056 --> 01:00:06,726
I'm saying you don't have to
prepare a heartfelt gift

971
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,895
and serve him with your utmost sincerity.

972
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:11,314
He is an important guest of our hotel.

973
01:00:11,397 --> 01:00:13,399
I should serve him
to the best of my ability.

974
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:17,528
You're being excessive.

975
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,872
King Hotel provides the best service
to all of our guests.

976
01:00:27,955 --> 01:00:29,957
It is what we take pride in.

977
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:31,751
Just a moderate amount of kindness

978
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:35,004
is unacceptable
as an employee of King Hotel.

979
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:43,429
Still, don't give him such a pretty smile.

980
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,308
Do I look pretty when I smile?

981
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:50,770
I thought you hated my smile.

982
01:00:50,853 --> 01:00:53,022
Well, it's not that pretty.

983
01:00:54,857 --> 01:00:57,568
Then how do I have to smile
to not look pretty?

984
01:00:58,235 --> 01:00:59,528
Like this?

985
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:02,740
Like this?

986
01:01:07,244 --> 01:01:08,329
Stop it.

987
01:01:09,914 --> 01:01:11,749
Just do what you've been doing.

988
01:01:11,832 --> 01:01:13,709
You're not even going to listen to me.

989
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:15,378
No, I really don't know what you mean.

990
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,214
Ever since my first day here,

991
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:21,884
I kept smiling from ear to ear every day.

992
01:01:21,968 --> 01:01:24,220
I even practiced smiling in my sleep.

993
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:28,557
I'm sure all of the King Hotel employees

994
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:31,060
have the best smiles in the nation.

995
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:33,771
Why would you practice even in your sleep?

996
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:35,356
Because I wanted to do well.

997
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:43,197
You're sincere about every little thing.

998
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:45,783
So,

999
01:01:45,866 --> 01:01:49,120
you should also try your best
while you're at it.

1000
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:50,705
Me?

1001
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:52,707
Why?

1002
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:56,752
Today, we're representing the hotel
as a team.

1003
01:01:56,836 --> 01:02:00,923
Let's work hard to make Prince Samir
think that he made the right call

1004
01:02:01,007 --> 01:02:02,341
by choosing King Hotel.

1005
01:02:04,427 --> 01:02:05,469
Bump.

1006
01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:07,972
Bump.

1007
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:11,684
Bump.

1008
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:17,898
Fine.

1009
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,320
Teach me what to do

1010
01:02:24,155 --> 01:02:26,282
to be a good representative of the hotel.

1011
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:29,910
All right.

1012
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:32,580
First,

1013
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:35,875
you have to greet the guest
with a bright smile.

1014
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,251
Smile broadly.

1015
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,467
Are you okay?

1016
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:46,385
Whatever. Forget it.

1017
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:50,139
I mean, the heart is first.
The expression is second.

1018
01:02:51,182 --> 01:02:54,101
You're not smiling
because someone asked you to.

1019
01:02:54,185 --> 01:02:56,020
It needs to be sincere.

1020
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:59,231
The guests all know
how you're feeling inside

1021
01:02:59,315 --> 01:03:00,691
through your smile.

1022
01:03:01,275 --> 01:03:03,194
So try thinking in your mind,

1023
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:06,322
"Welcome to our hotel!"

1024
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:09,658
and then lightly smile.

1025
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:23,422
Yes.

1026
01:03:23,506 --> 01:03:24,507
That's good.

1027
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:28,177
Yes. It's a lot better than before.

1028
01:03:29,428 --> 01:03:32,389
See? You need to smile from the heart.

1029
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:34,558
Sincerity is something you can feel.

1030
01:03:37,895 --> 01:03:38,854
So?

1031
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,439
What do you think?

1032
01:03:41,232 --> 01:03:42,316
Sorry?

1033
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:46,487
Can you feel my sincerity?

1034
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:52,535
Can you feel my heart?

1035
01:04:08,634 --> 01:04:09,760
Sa-rang!

1036
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,890
I'm done for the day. Let's go.

1037
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,725
- No more meetings?
- No.

1038
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:18,978
I agreed to buy your country's
fighter jets and ended it quickly.

1039
01:04:19,562 --> 01:04:21,021
Have you been on a jet before?

1040
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:22,314
Why would I?

1041
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:24,650
It's the best hobby.

1042
01:04:24,733 --> 01:04:27,987
They've gotten a lot cheaper,
so they only cost a hundred billion won.

1043
01:04:28,571 --> 01:04:30,281
You should buy one for yourself.

1044
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:34,201
Sa-rang, I'll take you for a ride one day.

1045
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:36,537
Thank you.

1046
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:39,123
Sa-rang,

1047
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:40,624
what's that?

1048
01:04:43,419 --> 01:04:46,547
It's the palace where
the kings of the Joseon Dynasty lived in.

1049
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:47,715
"Palace."

1050
01:04:48,924 --> 01:04:50,301
I want to go there.

1051
01:04:52,052 --> 01:04:53,888
Okay. Let's go.

1052
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:55,014
Let's go.

1053
01:04:55,097 --> 01:04:56,098
I'm excited!

1054
01:04:57,266 --> 01:04:58,184
You can leave.

1055
01:04:58,267 --> 01:04:59,101
No.

1056
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:00,686
I'm going too.

1057
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:03,480
We're going together?

1058
01:05:10,779 --> 01:05:13,949
Joseon kings walked along this path,

1059
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:15,409
and it's called <i>eodo</i>.

1060
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:19,371
Only the king was allowed
to walk down this path.

1061
01:05:22,124 --> 01:05:23,167
Isn't it fascinating?

1062
01:05:41,143 --> 01:05:42,228
How beautiful.

1063
01:05:45,814 --> 01:05:46,732
You've seen everything.

1064
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:47,650
Let's go now.

1065
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:48,692
You go.

1066
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:49,860
I'll go if you go.

1067
01:05:49,944 --> 01:05:51,028
Why you…

1068
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:52,863
Just go and buy some coffee.

1069
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:56,533
Coffee?

1070
01:05:56,617 --> 01:05:58,160
I'm not someone who runs errands.

1071
01:05:58,244 --> 01:06:00,537
Yes, you are. Remember the contract?

1072
01:06:02,414 --> 01:06:03,624
I'll buy the coffee.

1073
01:06:03,707 --> 01:06:04,833
What would you like?

1074
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:05,793
No.

1075
01:06:05,876 --> 01:06:07,711
You are my special guest.

1076
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:09,463
Hurry up.

1077
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:21,308
You dare make me fetch you your coffee?

1078
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:22,893
How impertinent.

1079
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,402
This place seems oddly familiar.

1080
01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:41,370
Korea is such a beautiful country.

1081
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:44,832
Among everything here,
you're still the most beautiful.

1082
01:06:47,084 --> 01:06:48,085
Thank you.

1083
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:50,462
Sa-rang,

1084
01:06:50,546 --> 01:06:52,464
do you have a boyfriend?

1085
01:06:58,012 --> 01:06:59,763
Well, not yet.

1086
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,349
Really? What a blessing.

1087
01:07:02,433 --> 01:07:04,852
I'd like to thank the heavens
for bringing me to you.

1088
01:07:04,935 --> 01:07:06,478
I'm the one you should be thanking.

1089
01:07:07,688 --> 01:07:08,522
Here.

1090
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:09,982
I bought this coffee myself,

1091
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:12,901
so you should enjoy it
with a thankful heart.

1092
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:13,861
Thank you.

1093
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:14,778
Hey.

1094
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:16,697
We were in the middle
of something important.

1095
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,740
Get lost.

1096
01:07:17,823 --> 01:07:20,159
I can't even if I want to
because of the contract.

1097
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:22,870
- Isn't the coffee good?
- Yes.

1098
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:24,621
- Right?
- It's good.

1099
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:28,917
Sa-rang, what is that?

1100
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:34,882
It's a traditional nuptial experience.

1101
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:37,259
- "Nuptial"?
- A wedding.

1102
01:07:37,885 --> 01:07:38,761
I want to try that

1103
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,554
with you.

1104
01:07:41,513 --> 01:07:42,598
With me?

1105
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:44,767
Yes. Is there a problem?

1106
01:07:47,186 --> 01:07:50,022
Well, I know it's just a fake experience,

1107
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:53,067
but it's usually done between couples.

1108
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,276
Don't take it seriously.

1109
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,694
It's just a cultural experience.

1110
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:56,779
Cut the crap.

1111
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,908
If you ever come with your girlfriend,

1112
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:02,493
I'll escort you back here.

1113
01:08:02,576 --> 01:08:06,246
I just simply want to experience
traditional Korean culture.

1114
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:08,457
Traditional culture, my foot.
What a player.

1115
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,917
Am I asking for too much?

1116
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,134
It's a no-brainer.

1117
01:08:19,218 --> 01:08:20,260
Don't do it.

1118
01:08:20,844 --> 01:08:21,804
Remember the contract?

1119
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,305
"Obey no matter what."

1120
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:24,973
No, I didn't forget.

1121
01:08:25,516 --> 01:08:27,351
I'm not saying
I won't stick to the contract.

1122
01:08:27,434 --> 01:08:28,769
I'm going to break it.

1123
01:08:28,852 --> 01:08:30,729
- What?
- I'll find you another hotel.

1124
01:08:30,813 --> 01:08:31,897
Get out of my hotel.

1125
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,273
I paid good money.

1126
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,900
Can a bum like you make up for it?

1127
01:08:36,276 --> 01:08:37,403
I gladly will.

1128
01:08:39,446 --> 01:08:40,572
This contract

1129
01:08:41,365 --> 01:08:42,366
is void.

1130
01:08:43,367 --> 01:08:44,201
You can't.

1131
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,912
- I'll do it.
- Do what?

1132
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,165
That traditional wedding ceremony.

1133
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,793
You don't have to. Don't.

1134
01:08:52,876 --> 01:08:55,170
It's just work.
It's not an actual wedding.

1135
01:08:55,254 --> 01:08:57,464
I'll think of it as a meaningless event.

1136
01:08:57,548 --> 01:09:01,385
So please don't ruin everything
over something like this.

1137
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:04,221
I'll go get prepared.

1138
01:09:05,305 --> 01:09:07,182
Wait. But to me, it's--

1139
01:09:08,642 --> 01:09:09,935
Your employee is better than you.

1140
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:11,770
Wait for me, Sa-rang!

1141
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:13,981
Sa-rang!

1142
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:16,233
A wedding.

1143
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:17,651
Sa-rang!

1144
01:09:17,734 --> 01:09:18,986
It's a wedding.

1145
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:21,697
Sa-rang, wait for me.

1146
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:51,602
The bride's palanquin will enter.

1147
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:15,201
The bride's palanquin will enter.

1148
01:10:55,407 --> 01:11:00,496
Now, the beautiful bride
will step forward.

1149
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:29,775
Groom, take a bow and step forward.

1150
01:12:57,738 --> 01:13:00,741
KING THE LAND

1151
01:13:32,856 --> 01:13:33,732
{\an8}Hey!

1152
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:35,109
{\an8}How dare you deceive me?

1153
01:13:35,818 --> 01:13:37,528
{\an8}<i>You're our VVIP employee.</i>

1154
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:39,113
{\an8}<i>You deserve to stay here tonight.</i>

1155
01:13:39,697 --> 01:13:42,324
{\an8}<i>I knew you'd look great
in an elegant garment like this.</i>

1156
01:13:42,408 --> 01:13:43,409
{\an8}<i>My love.</i>

1157
01:13:43,492 --> 01:13:44,410
{\an8}Cheon Sa-rang.

1158
01:13:44,493 --> 01:13:45,744
{\an8}No. Let go of him.

1159
01:13:45,828 --> 01:13:47,621
{\an8}Wait, are you jealous?

1160
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,833
{\an8}Since when did you care so much
about the company?

1161
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:55,713
{\an8}I'm going to try and protect the people
that you deem as nobodies.

1162
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:59,341
{\an8}<i>If you keep beating around the bush,
you'll end up losing her.</i>

1163
01:13:59,425 --> 01:14:00,676
{\an8}<i>Just ask her out.</i>

1164
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:03,012
{\an8}<i>I want to talk about us.</i>
