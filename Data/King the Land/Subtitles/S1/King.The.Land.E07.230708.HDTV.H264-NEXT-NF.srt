ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:17,685
Yu-ri.

6
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:19,437
Don't date me.

7
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,855
Date someone who likes you.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,316
Sure.

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,360
I'll tell you when I start dating.

10
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,822
So you need to tell me first
when you begin to fool around.

11
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:30,782
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

12
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,327
I've already met

13
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,538
someone I like.

14
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,775
Yo, chicken!

15
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,569
<i>Look at me, look closely</i>

16
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,195
<i>Don't betray my love</i>

17
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,947
<i>Come on, come to me</i>

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,615
<i>This will be the last time</i>

19
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,117
<i>Why would you leave?</i>

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,827
<i>Why would you abandon me?</i>

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,246
<i>Stop nagging and come to me, chicken</i>

22
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,747
<i>Come</i>

23
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:45,773
Can we talk for a minute?

24
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:02,874
Mr. Gu.

25
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,959
I thought you wanted chicken.

26
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,962
Can you eat this all by yourself?

27
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,507
Wait. Why are you here?

28
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,637
Let's talk over chicken.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,554
Sorry?

30
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,264
Where are you going?

31
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,515
You can't go inside!

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,100

EPISODE 7

34
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:39,077
You should've told us
you were Sa-rang's coworker.

35
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,162
I'm sorry for showing up unexpectedly,

36
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,582
but if you think about it,
you didn't give me a chance to--

37
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,751
We're basically family. Go easy on us.

38
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,169
We work for King Group too.

39
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,630
- I work at Alanga, King Fashion.
- I work at King Air.

40
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,840
- We are all one big family.
- One big family.

41
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,550
- Hermès.
- Hermès.

42
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,931
Do you work
in the same department as Sa-rang?

43
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:01,849
No.

44
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:02,767
He's--

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,893
Yes, we do.

46
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,605
It must be tough.

47
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,066
I heard there was
a stuck-up jerk working there.

48
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:12,610
Hey.

49
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,404
No, there isn't.

50
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,406
What are you saying?

51
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,032
Right. It was the head manager.

52
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,534
Yes, it was the head manager.

53
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,785
What was his name again?

54
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,246
His name… Gu Won.

55
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,290
The chairman's son. The nepotism guy.

56
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:26,666
Right?

57
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,627
- No.
- Oh, my.

58
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,505
He tortured you that much?
You're tearing up just hearing his name.

59
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,173
It's okay.

60
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,509
I heard he goes to work for fun.

61
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,846
He should have fun
without bothering others.

62
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,723
There's always one in every bunch.

63
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:42,765
Hey…

64
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,350
Well…

65
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:45,893
at first.

66
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,354
At first, he was like that.

67
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,606
Just slightly.
But he's not like that anymore.

68
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,649
What do you mean?

69
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:54,235
You said he has a rotten personality.

70
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,571
Did I?

71
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,072
Yes. You said he was a douchebag.

72
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,615
I see. When?

73
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,367
- Yesterday.
- And two days ago.

74
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,328
- Last week too.
- And last month.

75
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,455
So I did.

76
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,460
Come to think of it,
we never even introduced ourselves.

77
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:11,544
What's your name?

78
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,297
Guys,

79
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,175
- this is--
- You can call me Manager No.

80
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,094
My goodness. You're a manager?

81
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,679
I manage my team as well.

82
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,265
I'm Gang Da-eul. I work at Alanga.

83
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,892
Stop by if you ever go overseas.

84
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,643
- I'll give you a big discount.
- Okay.

85
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,771
My name is Oh Pyeong-hwa.

86
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,397
She's almost a purser at King Air.

87
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,107
Give me a call whenever you fly.

88
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,233
Thank you.

89
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,278
Steer clear of them.

90
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,404
By the way, Mr. No.

91
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,618
Why did you come here?

92
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,704
Why do you think?

93
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,957
It's because he couldn't stop
thinking about her.

94
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,543
Have you two already gone that far?

95
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,171
Hey.

96
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,798
Eat this and leave.

97
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,341
Why? We're having so much fun.

98
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,968
What are you going to do once we leave?

99
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,136
Hey, Gang Da-eul.

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,262
Do you want to get kicked out?

101
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,515
Hey, half of this house belongs to me.

102
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,266
We split the deposit and the rent.

103
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,060
Don't be rude to my guest.

104
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,062
You can stay as long as you want.

105
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,522
Thank you, Pyeong-hwa.

106
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,527
But what is that?

107
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,778
- Is it a gift?
- Oh, this.

108
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,906
Here. It's medicine.

109
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,408
I didn't know your symptoms,
so I got everything.

110
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:25,910
This is for me?

111
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,537
Why do I need medicine?

112
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,957
You didn't look so well earlier.
I thought you were sick.

113
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,379
Mr. No, you pass.

114
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,172
I give you my approval as well.

115
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,967
Don't be absurd. That's enough.

116
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,468
What did we do?

117
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,011
She must be feeling embarrassed.

118
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,222
Let's pretend
we don't know what's going on.

119
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,890
I told you it's nothing like that.

120
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:52,979
If I may,

121
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:58,401
I'd like to talk to her in private.

122
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,322
- Right? Okay.
- Go ahead.

123
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,657
You must have a lot to talk about.

124
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,409
- We'll give you some privacy.
- Of course.

125
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,035
- Take your time.
- Enjoy your time.

126
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,787
You can take as long as you need.

127
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:10,705
Let's go.

128
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,686
Drink this.

129
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,062
All right. Thanks.

130
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,524
I'm sorry.
It was pretty hectic, wasn't it?

131
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,692
Well,

132
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,238
I'd say it was a valuable time

133
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,283
for me to learn what you thought of me.

134
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,493
A jerk

135
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,077
and a douchebag

136
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,037
with a rotten personality.

137
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,334
Don't take those jokes too seriously.

138
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,127
They're such jokesters.

139
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,173
You must be super close.

140
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,967
We're practically family.

141
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,805
You have a great family.

142
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:17,063
But why did you actually come here?

143
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,526
Well, you didn't look too well earlier,

144
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,487
so I was worried that something was wrong

145
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,614
or that you might be sick.

146
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,664
Even so, you shouldn't have
left your girlfriend to come see me.

147
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:35,998
On her birthday, no less.

148
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,792
She's not my girlfriend.

149
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,420
- She isn't?
- No, she isn't.

150
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,880
Then why did you hug her?

151
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,091
- What?
- Why did you hug her

152
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,842
when she's not even your girlfriend?

153
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,428
Is your chest just open to anyone?

154
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,222
What are you, a public rest area?

155
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,275
Don't tell me
you're feeling jealous right now.

156
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,279
Me?

157
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,322
Why would I be jealous? No way.

158
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,615
What do you mean?

159
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,201
Your eyes are blazing with jealousy.

160
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,163
Nothing's blazing here.

161
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,999
Look.

162
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,875
No matter who you date,

163
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,045
I don't care in the slightest.

164
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,631
Fine.

165
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,717
Since you're so insistent,

166
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,260
I'll make sure

167
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,762
no one ever comes into my arms.

168
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,473
I never asked you to do that.

169
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,558
Fine.

170
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,602
From now on,

171
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,022
I'll make sure
there are no more uncertainties.

172
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,232
So don't worry.

173
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,192
I'm telling you, it's not like that.

174
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,487
Are you sure?

175
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:27,693
All right.

176
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,905
I'll play along.

177
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,339
What was that?

178
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,590
Are they dating now?

179
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,967
Must be nice.

180
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,222
- Have a great time.
- Take your time.

181
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,383
Shall we go on a date?

182
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,885
Right now?

183
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:36,971
It's too late.

184
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:40,933
What about tomorrow morning?

185
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,685
We have to go to work.

186
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,813
Then what time works for you?

187
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,775
The best time to eat,
the best time to drink tea,

188
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,362
or the best time to have a drink.

189
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,781
Let me know
what times are convenient for you.

190
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,118
I'll think about it.

191
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,914
Why do you need to think about it?

192
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,749
Can't it just be whenever you want?

193
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,836
I need to check my schedule.

194
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,403
You should get going.

195
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,738
Already?

196
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,741
Let's take a few more laps around.

197
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:40,451
I'll give up my precious time.

198
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:44,079
I humbly decline your precious time.

199
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,331
Hurry up and go now.

200
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,832
Don't tell me to leave.

201
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,669
I'll leave when the time is right.

202
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,924
I think now is the right time.

203
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:58,969
All right then.

204
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:01,388
After one last lap.

205
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,893
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

206
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,729
I'm just trying to protect you.

207
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,565
Don't get your hopes up
about anything else.

208
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,027
I wasn't expecting anything else.

209
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,031
Anyway, people drive
so aggressively around here.

210
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,492
It's too dangerous for you
to walk around alone.

211
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,455
I can watch out for any cars if I need to.

212
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,374
So let go of my hand and leave.

213
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,834
I think people are sleeping.

214
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,503
Let's be quiet.

215
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,130
Keep it down a bit.

216
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,065
HAWAIIAN SUN, HAWAIIAN HOST

217
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,985
DIOR PERFUME 30 ML

218
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,321
Hello.

219
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:03,867
Do you need something?

220
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:09,623
You've been coming to work
with a young dude these days.

221
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,667
Are you two dating?

222
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,171
I'm asking you.

223
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,339
Are you two dating?

224
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,259
Let go while I ask nicely.

225
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,724
Does he know about us?

226
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,476
Is it fun messing around
with a younger man?

227
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:32,980
What's it to you?

228
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,565
It's none of your business.

229
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,526
Do you want me to reveal

230
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,903
the skeleton in your closet?

231
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,656
What's wrong?

232
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,742
Are you scared?

233
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,870
That's why you should quit acting up.

234
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,998
You acting like this
makes me want to run my mouth.

235
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,541
Don't you dare say anything.

236
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,211
If you do,
I won't let you get away with it.

237
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,383
I love that fiery glare of yours.

238
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,427
This is why I can't get over you.

239
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,639
Does your wife know you act like this?

240
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,404
Hello, sir.

241
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:23,322
Hey.

242
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,366
Ro-un,

243
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,743
what do you think
of a woman with a dirty past?

244
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,038
A sly woman

245
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,706
who hides her true identity.

246
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,460
Why…

247
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,716
are you asking me that all of a sudden?

248
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,219
Then again,

249
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,179
why do I bother asking?

250
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,806
No man would like that.

251
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,518
Well then. I'll leave you guys to it.

252
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,952
If you ever run into problems
or need any help,

253
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,162
you can tell me everything.

254
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,498
All right?

255
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:39,565
Hello, how are you?

256
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,191
Not good. Why are you asking?

257
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,444
I'm already so pissed.

258
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,112
Are you making fun of me?

259
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,447
Just get changed.

260
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,866
What is this?

261
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,577
I was told to doll you up and escort you.

262
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,122
I heard they even sent a helicopter
just to save you.

263
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,124
You're really something.

264
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,668
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,795
Is that how you should say sorry?

266
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,049
Do you think I'm a joke
because I delivered clothes to you?

267
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,759
Do you think you're all that now?

268
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:07,676
No, ma'am.

269
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,011
What are you doing?

270
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,097
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

271
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,933
I was teaching her basic manners.

272
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,395
She lacks basic propriety
but lucked out and rose to the top.

273
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,439
It seems to have gone to her head.

274
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,904
Ms. Kim, did you climb up the ladder
because you lucked out?

275
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:27,946
Sorry?

276
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,867
I obviously climbed up the ladder
due to my competence alone.

277
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,826
Of course.

278
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,788
No one at King Hotel
can climb their way up on luck alone.

279
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:40,959
On top of that, King the Land is only open
to the most competent employees.

280
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,377
Am I right?

281
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,879
You are. But--

282
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,840
Sa-rang was chosen as the best talent
for two consecutive years.

283
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,967
As a result, she got to promote the hotel.

284
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,386
Her success is a result
of her own efforts.

285
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,223
It's not because she was lucky.

286
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,140
Understood?

287
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:56,850
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,144
If you ever mistreat my concierges again,

289
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,396
I'll have to give you a lesson in manners.

290
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,107
Why are you here?

291
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,527
Ms. Gu told me
to get her ready for a press conference.

292
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,240
She ordered that Ms. Cheon
look elegant from head to toe.

293
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,450
I can help her. You may leave.

294
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,535
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,400
Just read off the script.

296
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,028
All the questions will be directed at me,
so don't worry.

297
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,321
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,615
PRESS CONFERENCE ANSWER SHEET

299
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,368
This part is slightly unsettling.

300
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,078
What?

301
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,956
It says I was
in a life-and-death situation,

302
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,041
but it wasn't that serious.

303
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,751
That doesn't matter.

304
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,296
People don't care about the facts.

305
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,255
They want drama.

306
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,674
That is why we need to tell a story.

307
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,343
That would be deceiving them.

308
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,849
Do you know how much it cost
just to rescue you?

309
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,643
The company paid for it.

310
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,229
Don't you even feel sorry?

311
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,775
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,863
I arranged this event
to help you ease your guilt.

313
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,366
The PR team even created a story for you.

314
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,784
How convenient, right?

315
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,453
We're all doing you a favor.

316
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,122
So you should do your best too.

317
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,209
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,002
Read the last part.

319
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,670
Right now?

320
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,005
Yes, right now.

321
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,178
"I was stranded
in a life-and-death situation

322
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,387
due to extreme weather."

323
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,098
"I am thankful that King Hotel…"

324
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,768
…AND MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

325
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,980
What is it? Is there a problem?

326
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,027
The person who rescued me
was Head Manager Gu.

327
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,904
I authorized the helicopter.

328
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,782
He doesn't have that authority.

329
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,160
So I'm the only one you need to thank.

330
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,287
Read it again.

331
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,424
Best date spots in Seoul.

332
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,810
"Sweet and romantic.
Don't worry, we have you covered."

333
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,312
- Are you going on a date?
- Nice.

334
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:48,981
What are you doing?

335
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,441
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

336
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,526
Who's your date?

337
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,443
No one.

338
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:54,820
There's no date.

339
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,196
Yes, it is. Look.

340
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,239
Come on.

341
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:03,078
I was just trying to check and see

342
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,373
if our hotel was
on the list of date spots.

343
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:10,877
What was that snicker?

344
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,464
Do you even know what it's like
to be on a date?

345
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,384
- Of course I do.
- Of course you don't.

346
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,679
I have the ultimate skill that can steal
a woman's heart in one minute.

347
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,098
Do you want me to teach you?

348
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,476
In one minute?

349
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,519
One minute.

350
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,695
You think <i>I</i> would learn

351
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,322
from <i>you</i>?

352
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,286
A date

353
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,456
is like a war in which you must
win a woman's heart.

354
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,917
And do you know
the key thing to help you do so?

355
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:52,919
What is it?

356
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,547
Right. You said you didn't need my help.

357
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,715
Jeez.

358
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,842
I'll do you a favor and listen.

359
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,552
Okay.

360
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,179
You probably didn't know this,

361
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,723
but you have to get her to notice you.

362
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,892
Stay within her line of sight

363
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,978
and brush past her sometimes
as if it were a chance encounter.

364
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:10,896
Get it?

365
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,439
That would be stalking her.

366
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,066
You can't make it obvious.

367
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,901
You have to appear,

368
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,195
then disappear.

369
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,405
Get close but not too close.

370
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:21,531
You get it?

371
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,450
Then she'll think,

372
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,328
"Why do I keep running into him?"

373
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,538
"Can it mean something?"

374
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,956
Just when you're on her mind,

375
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,458
you have to disappear.

376
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,461
Then she'll start missing you
and thinking about you.

377
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,213
Then it's game over.

378
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,382
That'll work?

379
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,133
Of course. It definitely will.

380
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,351
Goodness.

381
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,602
Where are you going?

382
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,270
I have something to report.

383
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,814
Does it have to do with me?

384
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,110
Not really, but you still need to
have an idea of the company's--

385
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,488
From now on, if it's unrelated to me,

386
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,156
don't report it.

387
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,371
How entertaining.

388
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,568
Do you need anything else, sir?

389
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,405
No. I just stopped by as I was passing by.

390
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,781
Don't mind me.

391
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:45,740
Yes, sir.

392
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,831
Are you looking for someone?

393
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,209
Did all the employees clock in?

394
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:57,669
Yes, sir.

395
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,297
Why don't I see Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

396
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,507
She went to a press conference.

397
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,595
A press conference?

398
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,681
PRESS CONFERENCE ON KING HOTEL
SUPER FARMER WEEK EMERGENCY RESPONSE

399
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:22,694
You could've just waited
after reporting it to emergency services.

400
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:26,323
Instead, you called all the board members
for an emergency meeting at night.

401
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,240
Is it true?

402
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,159
Yes. An employee was in danger.

403
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,078
Was there a reason
for your personal involvement?

404
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,248
I received news that the search
was being delayed due to the weather.

405
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,958
She was alone in the mountains.

406
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,293
Of course I had to.

407
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:42,047
Dispatching a helicopter
just to save one employee

408
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,507
was probably not an easy decision
for the company.

409
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,842
No. It was easy.

410
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,260
Once again,

411
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,054
an employee was in danger.

412
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:53,808
I'm sure it was difficult not to consider
the expense of dispatching the helicopter.

413
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:56,144
Don't companies these days,
especially conglomerates,

414
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,396
usually act in their own interests?

415
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,773
That is true.

416
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,566
Profit comes first for any company.

417
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,986
But the employees
are the ones who generate that profit.

418
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:08,573
That's why we say
that the employees are its true owners.

419
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,868
It sounds like your employees
can really trust the company.

420
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,037
It is my responsibility
to make that possible.

421
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,623
I have a question for the employee.

422
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,416
Do you have

423
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,210
any last words for the company?

424
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,045
I was stranded

425
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,965
in a life-and-death situation
due to extreme weather.

426
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,718
I am thankful that King Hotel

427
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,637
and Managing Director Gu Hwa-ran
came to my rescue.

428
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,309
Managing Director Gu,
do you have a message for your employees?

429
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,227
Excuse me.

430
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,773
Can I say one last thing?

431
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,627
There was someone who flew
through the storm in the helicopter.

432
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,760
Thank you, Head Manager Gu Won,
from the bottom of my heart.

433
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,069
Thank you very much.

434
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,457
Ms. Gu, please look over here.

435
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,907
"Third-generation business leaders
are on the rise."

436
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,992
They talk as if
that's just gotten started.

437
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:02,038
"When Managing Director Gu Hwa-ran
learned of the plight of her employee,

438
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,873
she held an emergency board meeting

439
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,042
and dispatched a helicopter herself to…"

440
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,419
She stole your spotlight.

441
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:09,129
You're the one who dispatched it.

442
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:10,088
This is absurd.

443
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,298
Mr. Gu, you have to learn this from her.

444
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,925
Her self-promotion

445
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:17,220
has the press printing out rumors
that the successor has been chosen.

446
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,181
Are you listening to me? Are you?

447
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,600
The owner of the company is speaking.

448
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,270
I mean…

449
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,273
It says here that the employees
are the owners of the company.

450
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,941
Why didn't you tell me
about the press conference?

451
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,694
You told me not to report
anything unrelated to you.

452
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,112
How was this unrelated to me?

453
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,030
A King the Land employee
being dragged away

454
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,283
and manipulated like a puppet
deserves a report.

455
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,325
Then make it clear.

456
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,785
How much do you want to know?

457
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,911
I'll report everything.

458
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,998
Only things that have to do with me.

459
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:45,957
Exactly.

460
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,375
How involved do you want to get?

461
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,043
For example,

462
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,046
schemes Ms. Gu employs
to secure her spot as the successor?

463
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,966
I don't need to know that,
nor do I want to.

464
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,093
Then what about this?

465
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:01,306
In a few days, a prince named Samir
from the Middle East will visit Korea.

466
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,765
He's the 13th richest man in the world,

467
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,517
and his one-night stay
is worth a month's sales.

468
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,061
Every hotel in Korea is at war
to get him to stay at their hotel.

469
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,939
Even Ms. Gu tried, but she failed.

470
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,609
You can use this point
to your advantage, sir.

471
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,402
That has nothing to do with me.

472
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,529
Report about my employees only.

473
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,115
Who?

474
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,576
- Should I do a background check?
- No.

475
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,495
I want to know who's having a tough time

476
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,830
or being treated unfairly.

477
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,499
That's all I need.

478
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,460
All employees have it rough
and are treated unfairly.

479
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,420
That comes with the job description.

480
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,463
Mr. Gu,

481
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,801
if you really want to get involved,
you have to let me brief you.

482
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:40,637
I know you're displeased
with how Ms. Gu is acting.

483
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,597
You need to gain power

484
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,433
in order to protect your employees.

485
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,064
Don't stare me down like that.

486
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,192
Gain the power
that's suitable for your position.

487
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,717
You did exceptionally well
at today's press conference.

488
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,470
The successor of a company
isn't just decided internally.

489
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,055
Public opinion matters too.

490
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,350
It reflects who comes to mind
when they think of our group.

491
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,893
Are you trying to lecture me?

492
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,145
I'm sorry, ma'am.

493
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,732
Are we out of options with Prince Samir?

494
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,778
First Royal Hotel is already
in negotiations regarding his stay.

495
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,490
We tried everything, but he was obstinate.

496
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,743
Is this what I have to hear
after six months of groundwork?

497
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:47,996
I'm sorry, ma'am.

498
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,206
But there's nothing we can do.

499
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,254
Let's give up then.

500
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,089
From now on,

501
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,758
it's none of our business.

502
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,105
Was it you?

503
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,734
You had her mention your name?

504
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,863
Or was it Sa-rang's own decision?

505
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,867
I made her do it.

506
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,118
I did save her after all.

507
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,412
So you piggybacked off of my plan.

508
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,456
Don't you think it's pathetic?

509
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,166
It's better than deceiving others.

510
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,169
I enjoyed the show though.

511
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:40,256
"The employees
are the true owners of the company."

512
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,968
Is that what you really think?

513
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,053
Of course.

514
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,138
The owners of the company
are the employees.

515
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,433
And I happen to own the employees.

516
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,935
How shameless of you.

517
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,186
I pay them.

518
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,064
In any world, the person
who provides the money is the owner.

519
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,774
If you really think that way,

520
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,277
you don't deserve to become

521
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,571
the owner of the group.

522
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,158
Then do you?

523
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,620
Do you realize
how much damage you've caused?

524
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,706
I'm the one who restored what you damaged.

525
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,378
Though I'm sure the economic impact
generated by today's articles

526
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:19,754
will go over your head.

527
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,048
Don't calculate someone's worth
with money.

528
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,510
This is why you're not good enough.

529
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,055
The head of a company
must maximize its profits,

530
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,974
even if it means putting on an act.

531
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,101
The company can't exist without me,

532
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,478
and the employees
can't exist without the company.

533
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,529
Well done, Ms. Gu.

534
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,908
You demonstrated
how to improve the company's image.

535
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,620
Today's articles on the economy
are all about you, Ms. Gu.

536
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,707
Your story is continuing to
circulate on social media,

537
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,625
and journalists are writing about it.

538
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,835
Is that so?

539
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:02,422
I didn't think that far ahead,
but I'm glad we attracted publicity.

540
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,842
What about the Arab prince?

541
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,885
I think he will stay at First Royal Hotel.

542
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,721
If it isn't official yet,

543
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:12,181
do whatever it takes
to bring him to our hotel.

544
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,808
We should,

545
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,686
but King the Land is in charge
of inviting and managing our VIP guests.

546
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,689
So it's Head Manager Gu's responsibility.

547
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,068
Then you should do whatever it takes
to bring him to our hotel.

548
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,155
If they take him,
it won't just be a matter of sales.

549
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:30,283
This could determine
the industry's leading position.

550
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,618
It could change the game.

551
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:33,578
Do you understand?

552
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:36,956
Why aren't you answering?

553
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,374
Didn't you make any preparations?

554
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,296
If you're not up for it, tell me.

555
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,549
That way, your sister can take action.

556
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,931
I'll do it.

557
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,769
Are you confident?

558
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,813
I'll bring the Arab prince to our hotel,

559
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,399
even if I have to put on an act.

560
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:05,818
Good.

561
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,672
You know there was a banquet today, right?

562
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,091
Do you know how busy we were?

563
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:31,052
You're lucky you got to slack off.

564
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:33,304
The world is so unfair.

565
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,641
I wasn't slacking off.

566
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,268
I was following Ms. Gu's orders
for a scheduled event.

567
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,937
That's not my problem.

568
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:44,398
We served the guests when it was busiest,

569
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,193
so you can clean up on your own, right?

570
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,030
By myself?

571
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,407
No one was able to rest
because we were so busy.

572
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:54,951
We'll be in the staff lounge.

573
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,494
Call us when you're done.

574
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,495
Let's go, guys.

575
00:33:58,746 --> 00:33:59,747
Good luck.

576
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,125
So you wanted to thank me?

577
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,211
Sorry?

578
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,172
I mean…

579
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,799
Since you're thankful,
let's have some coffee.

580
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,639
I'm extremely busy right now.

581
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,141
I have to rearrange everything
before break time ends.

582
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,562
Then I'll help you.

583
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:01,994
Wait. That's not how you do it.

584
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,500
Don't I just have to cover it?

585
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,627
There are no "justs" in the hotel.

586
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,048
The edges of the tablecloth need to
hang evenly at the perfect angle.

587
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,635
Is all of that necessary
when they'll only be used once?

588
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,806
A lot of people
devote their time and energy

589
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,016
to satisfy the guests
that'll be sitting here.

590
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,185
And I'm spreading out their devotion.

591
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,271
Isn't it fine as long as it's neat?

592
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,981
Do you have to give meaning to it?

593
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,109
If I don't,

594
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,195
the things that I do become chores
that can be done by anyone.

595
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,072
However,

596
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,701
if I give meaning to it, it becomes
something special that only I can do.

597
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:48,207
That also gives meaning
to my career as a hotel concierge.

598
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,969
I'll spread out that devotion with you.

599
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,930
Teach me.
I'll learn how to do it properly.

600
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,062
All right.

601
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,650
Then try grabbing the edge like this.

602
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,152
- The edge?
- Yes.

603
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,904
- And…
- Like this?

604
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,365
No, you can't stretch it out like that.

605
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:23,492
Let's see. This much?

606
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,874
- Is this good?
- No.

607
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,960
There still needs to be some tightness,

608
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,378
so around this much.

609
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:38,758
So…

610
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,470
if it can't be too tight…

611
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:43,679
Yes.

612
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,681
…or too loose,

613
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,808
I can just hold it however I want.

614
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,859
Just leave. I can do it by myself.

615
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,278
Fine. I'll put in more care and effort.

616
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,822
How do I do it? Like this?

617
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,076
Yes.

618
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,454
All right.

619
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,623
On the count of three,

620
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,083
you're going to gently let go.

621
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,585
- Gently?
- One, two, three.

622
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,006
Good.

623
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:31,805
Are we done now?

624
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:40,397
Yes, you did a good job.

625
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,608
Well, of course.

626
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:43,734
I'm good at everything.

627
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,611
Lucky you.

628
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,615
I just dropped in while I was passing by.

629
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,033
I know.

630
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,451
Just in case

631
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:56,747
you were thinking that I came on purpose.

632
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,958
I wasn't.

633
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,963
Why don't you ever think about me?

634
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,133
All I said was I didn't think
you came on purpose.

635
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,344
I never said I don't think about you.

636
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:18,769
That's true.

637
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,398
There's no way
you wouldn't think about me.

638
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,904
Follow me.
There's still so much left to do.

639
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,748
Hurry up.

640
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:49,633
Grab the end and lay it down gently again.

641
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:52,052
One, two, three.

642
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,974
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

643
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:18,954
What do you want for dinner?

644
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:21,206
- Anything but short ribs.
- No short ribs.

645
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,836
I hope you guys weren't slacking off
while I was away.

646
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,632
If you're that worried,
you can work with us.

647
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:30,716
Why would I do that?

648
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,801
Mark my words.

649
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,721
I'm watching all of you like a hawk.

650
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,139
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,518
I was thinking of having
a team dinner this week.

652
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:43,687
Let me know when you all are free.

653
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:47,274
For the record, I'm busy every day

654
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:48,817
except for Thursday.

655
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,612
Then we can do Thursday.

656
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:53,989
Really?

657
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:56,075
If that's what you want.
What should we eat?

658
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,701
Whatever the girls want to eat.

659
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,453
What do you want to eat?

660
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,456
- Sashimi. It's been a while.
- You're right.

661
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,500
I went to a sushi buffet
and had my fill yesterday.

662
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:06,710
I'm sick of eating raw fish.

663
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:08,170
What about grilled beef intestines?

664
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,838
How do you eat that stuff?

665
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,131
Then Ms. Do,

666
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:14,051
what do you think of a family restaurant?

667
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,053
Are you a kid?
Should we throw a birthday party?

668
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,639
What about pork trotters?
The place next door is good.

669
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:20,474
How dare you put trotters
on the dining table?

670
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,975
They stink.

671
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:24,687
We can go wherever you want.

672
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,563
Just decide among yourselves.

673
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,357
Must I decide everything for you?

674
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,985
Then we'll let you know
after discussing it.

675
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,989
The place we went to last time…

676
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,408
What was it called again?

677
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:39,743
Gosh.

678
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,120
They had good short ribs.

679
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,873
You know, I'm just saying.

680
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,085
- Well, then.
- Goodbye.

681
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:49,962
Have a good evening.

682
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,049
Why did she have to say
she wanted short ribs

683
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,426
in such a roundabout way?

684
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:58,095
She was just trying to sugarcoat it.

685
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:00,806
I'll call them to make a reservation.

686
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:01,765
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:04,476
Five servings of fresh short ribs.

688
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,186
Wait. Marinated ribs are best here.

689
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,147
- Can you make those marinated?
- Sure.

690
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,108
They like fresh ribs.

691
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,985
How much did the revenue increase by?

692
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,154
Around 15%.

693
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,532
At this rate,
we'll be able to achieve our goal of 20%.

694
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,951
Why don't we increase it by another 10%?

695
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,830
That's ridiculous.
We're already overworked as it is.

696
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,623
You'll get an incentive trip.

697
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,917
We were already promised one
if we reached 20%.

698
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:31,211
Instead of three days in Jeju,

699
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:33,630
let's go to Southeast Asia for six days.
How's that?

700
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,216
Bali, Phuket, Cebu, Kota Kinabalu…

701
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,177
Choose wherever you want to go.

702
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,970
- Really?
- Of course.

703
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,139
If we increase our sales,
we can go anywhere.

704
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:43,640
You can do it, right?

705
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:45,767
But still, 30% is a bit far-fetched.

706
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,061
If you think it's impossible, it is.

707
00:44:48,145 --> 00:44:50,689
If you think it's possible,
you can do anything.

708
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,317
It all depends on you, Ms. Gang.

709
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,236
Da-eul, let's make it happen.

710
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:59,740
If we add another 10%,
we won't be able to take any breaks.

711
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,033
Are you okay with that?

712
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,910
Yes, we don't need any breaks.

713
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,078
Of course.

714
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,623
What could go wrong
when we have you, Ms. Gang?

715
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,708
Okay. To our vacation.

716
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,627
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

717
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:23,805
Did you hear the news?

718
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:26,600
The Arab prince is staying at our hotel.

719
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:31,021
He has refined taste
befitting a member of the royal family.

720
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,941
He knows for a fact
which hotel is the best in Korea.

721
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,777
We're named First Royal Hotel
for a reason.

722
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,155
I heard it was a provisional contract.

723
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,867
Goodness. You should know better.

724
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:45,994
He already reserved
a week's worth of meals,

725
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:49,373
and we changed
the curtain colors and toilet.

726
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,832
How is that provisional?

727
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,502
You never know
until everything's set in stone.

728
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:57,506
Jeez. You two fight like cats and dogs.

729
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,800
When will you grow up?

730
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,802
Just admit that you're jealous.

731
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:05,722
Anyway, the tables have turned.

732
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,015
First Royal is number one.

733
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,725
King Hotel is number two.

734
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,936
That means King the Land is second too.

735
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,568
Our best talent.

736
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,319
How is she <i>your </i>best talent?

737
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:20,904
She's <i>my</i> hotel's best talent.

738
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:25,826
The Arab prince
will be staying at our hotel.

739
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:29,204
Come and greet him
as my hotel's employee representative.

740
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:31,540
- Pardon?
- Goodness.

741
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,376
Stop bothering my hardworking employee
with your nonsense.

742
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,297
I might be able to give you this hotel,
but I'll never let you have her.

743
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:40,966
Do you want to bet?

744
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:41,883
Yes.

745
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:43,468
Just make a bet.

746
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:46,680
Man up and bet your hotels.

747
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,683
- Jeez.
- Goodness.

748
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:54,646
Is that so?

749
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,576
- What?
- I have bad news for you.

750
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,537
The Arab prince is coming to my hotel.

751
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:14,291
- What?
- My son, Won, got it done.

752
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:17,419
A hotel's history and reputation
are what make it number one.

753
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,254
Hold on.

754
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:20,631
When the Arab prince comes,

755
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:23,383
you can greet him
as our employee representative.

756
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:24,593
Okay?

757
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:27,763
Yes, sir. Thank you.

758
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:30,515
Hey, it's me.

759
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:32,559
What happened?

760
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:35,437
What happened with the Arab prince?

761
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,773
We even changed the toilet!

762
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:39,441
Good work.

763
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,610
As expected of my son.

764
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:42,819
You have tricks up your sleeve.

765
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,697
I heard he already made the down payment.

766
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,032
Is he really coming to our hotel?

767
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,825
Yes, I called him.

768
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:52,371
The prince changed his mind
after a single call from you?

769
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:55,832
How is that possible?

770
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,377
I know, right?

771
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:00,837
But it was possible.

772
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:03,799
<i>Hello?</i>

773
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:05,467
Samir?

774
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,344
You know it's me.

775
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:09,888
Of course, it's me. What's up?

776
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,556
I heard you're coming to Korea.

777
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,600
<i>Why are you digging around me?</i>

778
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:17,562
Come to my hotel.

779
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:20,899
Oh, I heard your father
runs a hotel business.

780
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,651
Is the business not going well?

781
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:25,570
<i>You want me to spend some money there?</i>

782
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,447
You don't need to spend your money.

783
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:29,032
So, just come.

784
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,493
But you hated me
ever since we were in the same school.

785
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:34,162
Because you believe
that I only care about the money

786
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,081
Yes, I still hate you

787
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,167
I love your honesty.

788
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,504
But I already decided to stay at
the First Royal Hotel.

789
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,464
Why would I switch to your hotel?

790
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:47,509
I will treat you well.

791
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,303
Treat me well?

792
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:52,597
Treat me well?

793
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:55,225
Explain "well" in detail, please?

794
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:58,770
Tell me everything you want.

795
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:00,272
I will make it happen.

796
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,399
Anything?

797
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:05,444
Anything.

798
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:09,698
Okay.

799
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,241
I'll send you the contract.

800
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:12,492
<i>So, sign it.</i>

801
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,079
Is he really your friend?

802
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,956
Even the legal team
has never seen such a contract.

803
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,876
He's not my friend.

804
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,461
We're just acquaintances.

805
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,714
It'd be better were he a stranger.
Look at the contract.

806
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:28,175
"You will always answer me with 'yes.'"

807
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:30,343
"You will always serve me with a smile."

808
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:31,428
How is that a contract?

809
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:32,888
He's just looking for a slave.

810
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,890
You can't sign it.

811
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:36,516
Why not?

812
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,642
You just can't.

813
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,520
He's going to shove you around.

814
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:42,481
What does he take you for?

815
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,692
You're a selfish jerk
who doesn't listen to others.

816
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:47,778
You've never smiled at anyone.

817
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,154
You'll definitely break the contract.

818
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:50,822
Who's going to deal with it? Me?

819
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,366
- I can't.
- Why not?

820
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,368
Do you think I'm a douchebag

821
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,412
with a rotten personality?

822
00:49:58,413 --> 00:49:59,831
 Did someone say that to you?

823
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:01,833
I don't think you're that bad.

824
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,836
I told you not to sign it.

825
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:08,173
You've never kowtowed to
or served anyone before.

826
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,299
I can just half-ass it.

827
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:11,802
No, you can't.

828
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:13,637
You won't be able to stand him.

829
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,805
Do you want to see?

830
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,681
- What?
- Here.

831
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:18,809
Imagine I'm Prince Samir.

832
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:28,985
Hey, Gu Won.

833
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,613
Come take my shoes off

834
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,198
and bring me some slippers.

835
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:39,454
You have to say "yes" sincerely
with a smile on your face.

836
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:42,916
Or else I won't pay a single penny
for breach of contract.

837
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:47,879
Yes.

838
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:48,797
Great.

839
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,507
Good job.

840
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:58,932
Come over here.

841
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,185
I should lift up my right leg.

842
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:05,355
I want you to get down on your knees.

843
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:15,657
Easy.

844
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:18,994
Good job.

845
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,620
Make sure you polish my shoes.

846
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,914
They're very expensive.

847
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,295
What did I tell you? Goodness.

848
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,214
Get

849
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,340
over here!

850
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,805
<i>Prince Samir,
the 13th richest person in the world,</i>

851
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:40,307
<i>has arrived in Korea.</i>

852
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,267
<i>His trip was announced as leisure travel,</i>

853
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,229
<i>but it seems his purpose is to negotiate
the import of next-generation warplanes.</i>

854
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:48,231
<i>During his stay, he'll likely meet with</i>

855
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:51,026
<i>the head of the Defense Acquisition
Program Administration…</i>

856
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:48,750
Get off.

857
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,210
Open the door.

858
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:10,730
Your driving sucks, just like you.

859
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:13,358
So, make your guard
drive for you, not me.

860
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,193
No, that's no fun.

861
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:16,695
Hold this.

862
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:25,203
Smile.

863
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,371
Prince Samir,

864
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,998
welcome to King Hotel.

865
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:30,709
I'm Gu Hwa-ran,
and I'm in charge of this hotel.

866
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,627
We did our best to welcome you,

867
00:53:32,711 --> 00:53:35,422
and we will provide you
with the best service.

868
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:44,889
I only learned how to greet you in Arabic.

869
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:46,808
Welcome to King Hotel.

870
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,185
Are these flowers for me?

871
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,023
You're good at Korean.

872
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,443
Welcome.

873
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:00,155
How beautiful.

874
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:01,281
Thank you.

875
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,616
On behalf of the hotel,

876
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,453
I prepared a small gift from the heart.

877
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,288
Can I take a look at it now?

878
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,330
Yes, Your Highness.

879
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:13,543
You may be disappointed
because it's such a small gift.

880
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,504
It's a gift from your heart.
How could I be disappointed?

881
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:20,050
What is this?

882
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:22,427
It is a traditional Korean knot bracelet.

883
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,054
I had one prepared in green

884
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:27,348
as I heard green is associated
with abundance, sanctity, and paradise

885
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:28,808
in the Arab world.

886
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:30,977
I have a keen eye.

887
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:32,771
I'm incredible.

888
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,148
- Sorry?
- The moment I saw you,

889
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:38,568
I knew your heart
would be as beautiful as your face.

890
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,321
"Sa-rang."

891
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:43,490
Will you put it on for me?

892
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:50,622
Yes, Your Highness.

893
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,545
I'll put it on for you.

894
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:07,764
There.

895
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:10,100
You're all checked in,
so you can head straight to your room.

896
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:11,810
Follow me.

897
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:16,481
I received such a precious gift.

898
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,608
I must do something in return.

899
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:19,776
Have you eaten yet?

900
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:22,403
Sa-rang?

901
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:23,905
Sorry?

902
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,532
You have to hold it in, sir.

903
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,460
Why aren't you eating?

904
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:38,586
Do you want something else?

905
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:40,421
It's okay.

906
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:42,465
I don't even think
I can finish all of this.

907
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,050
You don't have to.

908
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:45,301
Just eat what's good.

909
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:46,970
Yes, Your Highness.

910
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,806
By the way,
I was surprised by your Korean skills.

911
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:53,893
My first love was Korean.

912
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:55,520
Really?

913
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,398
I studied hard to tell her how I felt,
but I got rejected.

914
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:00,358
What a horrible woman.

915
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,114
Maybe it was to meet you.

916
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:08,241
Like destiny.

917
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,967
Do you feel uncomfortable?

918
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:28,178
You look displeased.

919
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,013
Well…

920
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,891
This is where I work, actually.

921
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:37,979
So it's slightly uncomfortable to sit here
while everyone else is working.

922
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,190
- Should I tell them to leave?
- No, it's okay.

923
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:41,691
Please don't.

924
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,652
No…

925
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:46,613
Have you never eaten in places like this?

926
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,367
No, this is my first time.

927
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:54,996
It feels weird to be
sitting at the table that I set.

928
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,248
It seems people always put duty first

929
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:59,125
and enjoying their rights second.

930
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:01,586
I rented out this whole place for you.

931
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,171
You are the star of the day.

932
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,839
Enjoy it to the fullest.

933
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:07,884
Thank you.

934
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:16,267
How dare you sit down?

935
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:19,020
I want to enjoy my rights too.

936
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,772
I drove you,

937
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,982
opened the door for you,
and held your luggage.

938
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:24,901
I think I deserve to eat as well.

939
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:27,320
I'll give you food.
Eat over there by yourself.

940
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,738
Don't mind me.

941
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:32,825
You're an eyesore.

942
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:35,828
I'd like to say the same thing.

943
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:37,705
Hey,

944
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:40,416
don't you think
you've messed with me enough?

945
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:42,669
You had enough fun.

946
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,631
- You should stop now.
- I was already planning on it.

947
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,383
I don't need you anymore. Get going.

948
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:49,634
Okay. Good thinking.

949
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,430
I'll have our hotel's best employee
attend to you.

950
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:56,891
- Let's get up.
- No, you don't need to.

951
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,185
I already chose my attendant.

952
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:00,436
It's Sa-rang.

953
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,355
- Pardon?
- What, punk?

954
00:58:06,276 --> 00:58:07,110
Not her.

955
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,362
Why not?

956
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:10,905
Because I said so.

957
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,407
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang is my…

958
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:14,534
personal assistant.

959
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,995
I am? Since when?

960
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:18,997
Starting today.

961
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:21,791
Remember the contract?

962
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,876
You have to say yes to everything I say.

963
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:39,642
Then I'll stay.

964
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:42,020
No, I don't need you. Get out.

965
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:43,479
Remember the contract?

966
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,148
I have to

967
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:49,277
stay next to you at all times.

968
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:17,472
The meeting is taking a while.

969
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:22,769
You don't have to go too far.

970
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:23,728
What do you mean?

971
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,481
I'm saying you don't have to
prepare a heartfelt gift

972
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:28,650
and serve him with your utmost sincerity.

973
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:31,069
He is an important guest of our hotel.

974
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:33,154
I should serve him
to the best of my ability.

975
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,283
You're being excessive.

976
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:47,627
King Hotel provides the best service
to all of our guests.

977
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,712
It is what we take pride in.

978
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:51,506
Just a moderate amount of kindness

979
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,759
is unacceptable
as an employee of King Hotel.

980
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:03,184
Still, don't give him such a pretty smile.

981
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,063
Do I look pretty when I smile?

982
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,525
I thought you hated my smile.

983
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,777
Well, it's not that pretty.

984
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,323
Then how do I have to smile
to not look pretty?

985
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,283
Like this?

986
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:22,495
Like this?

987
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:28,084
Stop it.

988
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:31,504
Just do what you've been doing.

989
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:33,464
You're not even going to listen to me.

990
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,133
No, I really don't know what you mean.

991
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:37,969
Ever since my first day here,

992
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:41,639
I kept smiling from ear to ear every day.

993
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:43,975
I even practiced smiling in my sleep.

994
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:48,312
I'm sure all of the King Hotel employees

995
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,815
have the best smiles in the nation.

996
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,526
Why would you practice even in your sleep?

997
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,111
Because I wanted to do well.

998
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:02,952
You're sincere about every little thing.

999
01:01:04,412 --> 01:01:05,538
So,

1000
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:08,875
you should also try your best
while you're at it.

1001
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:10,460
Me?

1002
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:12,462
Why?

1003
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:16,507
Today, we're representing the hotel
as a team.

1004
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:20,678
Let's work hard to make Prince Samir
think that he made the right call

1005
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:22,096
by choosing King Hotel.

1006
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:25,224
Bump.

1007
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:27,727
Bump.

1008
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:31,439
Bump.

1009
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:37,653
Fine.

1010
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,075
Teach me what to do

1011
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,037
to be a good representative of the hotel.

1012
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:49,665
All right.

1013
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,335
First,

1014
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:55,630
you have to greet the guest
with a bright smile.

1015
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,006
Smile broadly.

1016
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:04,222
Are you okay?

1017
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:06,140
Whatever. Forget it.

1018
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:09,894
I mean, the heart is first.
The expression is second.

1019
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:13,856
You're not smiling
because someone asked you to.

1020
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,775
It needs to be sincere.

1021
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,986
The guests all know
how you're feeling inside

1022
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,446
through your smile.

1023
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,949
So try thinking in your mind,

1024
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:26,077
"Welcome to our hotel!"

1025
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,413
and then lightly smile.

1026
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,177
Yes.

1027
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,262
That's good.

1028
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,932
Yes. It's a lot better than before.

1029
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:52,144
See? You need to smile from the heart.

1030
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,313
Sincerity is something you can feel.

1031
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,609
So?

1032
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:00,194
What do you think?

1033
01:03:00,987 --> 01:03:02,071
Sorry?

1034
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:06,242
Can you feel my sincerity?

1035
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:12,290
Can you feel my heart?

1036
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:29,515
Sa-rang!

1037
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:34,645
I'm done for the day. Let's go.

1038
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,480
- No more meetings?
- No.

1039
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,733
I agreed to buy your country's
fighter jets and ended it quickly.

1040
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:40,776
Have you been on a jet before?

1041
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,069
Why would I?

1042
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,405
It's the best hobby.

1043
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,742
They've gotten a lot cheaper,
so they only cost a hundred billion won.

1044
01:03:48,326 --> 01:03:50,036
You should buy one for yourself.

1045
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,956
Sa-rang, I'll take you for a ride one day.

1046
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,292
Thank you.

1047
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:58,878
Sa-rang,

1048
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:00,379
what's that?

1049
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:06,302
It's the palace where
the kings of the Joseon Dynasty lived in.

1050
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,470
"Palace."

1051
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,056
I want to go there.

1052
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,643
Okay. Let's go.

1053
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:14,769
Let's go.

1054
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:15,853
I'm excited!

1055
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:17,939
You can leave.

1056
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:18,856
No.

1057
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,441
I'm going too.

1058
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,235
We're going together?

1059
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,704
Joseon kings walked along this path,

1060
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:35,164
and it's called <i>eodo</i>.

1061
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:39,126
Only the king was allowed
to walk down this path.

1062
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:42,922
Isn't it fascinating?

1063
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:01,983
How beautiful.

1064
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:06,487
You've seen everything.

1065
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,405
Let's go now.

1066
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:08,447
You go.

1067
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:09,615
I'll go if you go.

1068
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:10,783
Why you…

1069
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:12,618
Just go and buy some coffee.

1070
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:16,288
Coffee?

1071
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:17,915
I'm not someone who runs errands.

1072
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,292
Yes, you are. Remember the contract?

1073
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,379
I'll buy the coffee.

1074
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:24,588
What would you like?

1075
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:25,548
No.

1076
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,466
You are my special guest.

1077
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:29,218
Hurry up.

1078
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:41,063
You dare make me fetch you your coffee?

1079
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:42,648
How impertinent.

1080
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:51,157
This place seems oddly familiar.

1081
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:01,125
Korea is such a beautiful country.

1082
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,587
Among everything here,
you're still the most beautiful.

1083
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:07,840
Thank you.

1084
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:10,217
Sa-rang,

1085
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,219
do you have a boyfriend?

1086
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:19,518
Well, not yet.

1087
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:22,104
Really? What a blessing.

1088
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:24,607
I'd like to thank the heavens
for bringing me to you.

1089
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,233
I'm the one you should be thanking.

1090
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,277
Here.

1091
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,737
I bought this coffee myself,

1092
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,656
so you should enjoy it
with a thankful heart.

1093
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,616
Thank you.

1094
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:34,533
Hey.

1095
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:36,452
We were in the middle
of something important.

1096
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:37,495
Get lost.

1097
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:39,914
I can't even if I want to
because of the contract.

1098
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,625
- Isn't the coffee good?
- Yes.

1099
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,376
- Right?
- It's good.

1100
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:48,672
Sa-rang, what is that?

1101
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:54,637
It's a traditional nuptial experience.

1102
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,014
- "Nuptial"?
- A wedding.

1103
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,516
I want to try that

1104
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:00,309
with you.

1105
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,353
With me?

1106
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:04,522
Yes. Is there a problem?

1107
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:09,777
Well, I know it's just a fake experience,

1108
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,822
but it's usually done between couples.

1109
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:14,031
Don't take it seriously.

1110
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:15,449
It's just a cultural experience.

1111
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:16,534
Cut the crap.

1112
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,663
If you ever come with your girlfriend,

1113
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:22,248
I'll escort you back here.

1114
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:26,001
I just simply want to experience
traditional Korean culture.

1115
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:28,212
Traditional culture, my foot.
What a player.

1116
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:29,672
Am I asking for too much?

1117
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:38,889
It's a no-brainer.

1118
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:40,015
Don't do it.

1119
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,559
Remember the contract?

1120
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:43,060
"Obey no matter what."

1121
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:44,728
No, I didn't forget.

1122
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,106
I'm not saying
I won't stick to the contract.

1123
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,524
I'm going to break it.

1124
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,484
- What?
- I'll find you another hotel.

1125
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:51,652
Get out of my hotel.

1126
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,028
I paid good money.

1127
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:54,655
Can a bum like you make up for it?

1128
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,158
I gladly will.

1129
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,327
This contract

1130
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,121
is void.

1131
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:03,956
You can't.

1132
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:06,667
- I'll do it.
- Do what?

1133
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,920
That traditional wedding ceremony.

1134
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:12,548
You don't have to. Don't.

1135
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:14,925
It's just work.
It's not an actual wedding.

1136
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:17,219
I'll think of it as a meaningless event.

1137
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:21,140
So please don't ruin everything
over something like this.

1138
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:23,976
I'll go get prepared.

1139
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,937
Wait. But to me, it's--

1140
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:29,690
Your employee is better than you.

1141
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:31,525
Wait for me, Sa-rang!

1142
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:33,736
Sa-rang!

1143
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:35,988
A wedding.

1144
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,406
Sa-rang!

1145
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:38,741
It's a wedding.

1146
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,452
Sa-rang, wait for me.

1147
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:11,357
The bride's palanquin will enter.

1148
01:09:31,554 --> 01:09:34,974
The bride's palanquin will enter.

1149
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:20,269
Now, the beautiful bride
will step forward.

1150
01:10:45,377 --> 01:10:49,548
Groom, take a bow and step forward.

1151
01:12:17,511 --> 01:12:20,514
KING THE LAND

1153
01:12:52,629 --> 01:12:53,505
Hey!

1154
01:12:53,589 --> 01:12:54,882
How dare you deceive me?

1155
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:57,301
<i>You're our VVIP employee.</i>

1156
01:12:57,384 --> 01:12:58,886
<i>You deserve to stay here tonight.</i>

1157
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:02,097
<i>I knew you'd look great
in an elegant garment like this.</i>

1158
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:03,182
<i>My love.</i>

1159
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:04,183
Cheon Sa-rang.

1160
01:13:04,266 --> 01:13:05,517
No. Let go of him.

1161
01:13:05,601 --> 01:13:07,394
Wait, are you jealous?

1162
01:13:08,353 --> 01:13:10,606
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

1163
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:15,486
I'm going to try and protect the people
that you deem as nobodies.

1164
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:19,114
<i>If you keep beating around the bush,
you'll end up losing her.</i>

1165
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:20,449
<i>Just ask her out.</i>

1166
01:13:20,532 --> 01:13:22,785
<i>I want to talk about us.</i>
