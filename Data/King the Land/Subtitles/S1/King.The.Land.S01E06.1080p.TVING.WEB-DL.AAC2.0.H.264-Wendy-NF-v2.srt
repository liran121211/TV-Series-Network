1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,003
What happened?

5
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:05,755
There's nothing they can do
in this bad weather.

6
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,174
They'll resume the search when it clears…

7
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:09,425
No, it'll be too late.

8
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:10,885
They already pulled out.

9
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:11,928
You should wait.

10
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,555
Get the helicopter.

11
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:16,140
The helicopter?

12
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:17,225
What helicopter?

13
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:18,768
How am I going to do that?

14
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,561
And what will you do with it?

15
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:21,479
I should go.

16
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:23,523
You can't fly there in this lousy weather.

17
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:26,484
And you can't use it
without Ms. Gu's permission.

18
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,032
Are you saying there's a risk?

19
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:37,203
At first, it may look like
the revenues are going up,

20
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:38,705
but it's only an illusion.

21
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:41,249
In the long run,
the net profit is bound to drop--

22
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:43,376
Are you saying I'm wrong?

23
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,254
Oh, no.

24
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,965
Do I lack long-term perspective
on our business?

25
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:50,925
No, ma'am.

26
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,302
Which means
what I've done so far is right.

27
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:54,804
Yes, ma'am.

28
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:58,683
If I'm right and all of you are wrong,

29
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:01,394
why are you all sitting here?

30
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:08,067
Retailing is a tug-of-war
between stability and venture.

31
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:10,737
In order to prove our investment in Alanga

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,573
hasn't just been a venturous move…

33
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:18,661
What do you want?

34
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:19,912
I need a helicopter.

35
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,039
I'm in a meeting.

36
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,206
One of our staff is missing.

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,125
- I received the report.
- Then what?

38
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,836
This meeting isn't for that matter.

39
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,879
So?

40
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:30,089
I need the helicopter.

41
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:31,341
I hear I need your permission.

42
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:38,765
Mr. Gu.

43
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:42,560
Is there anybody here
who holds a position lower than you?

44
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:46,564
You've acted cheeky enough
as the chairman's son today.

45
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:50,151
If you need my approval,
stick to the formal procedures.

46
00:02:57,784 --> 00:02:59,327
I apologize for my intrusion.

47
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,371
One of our staff
is stranded in the mountains.

48
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:04,874
She isn't answering her phone,
but her location can be tracked.

49
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,543
The search was suspended
due to the weather.

50
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:08,461
That's why I need

51
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,421
the company's helicopter.

52
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:11,839
Okay. We'll talk later.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,092
- Ms.Gu.
- Get out.

54
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,260
- I have no time for that.
- Nobody here does.

55
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:19,388
Don't you see that
we're in a meeting right now?

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,483
Please.

57
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:35,196
No company would use its helicopter
to find a mere employee.

58
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:38,616
Do you know how much
a helicopter flight costs?

59
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,992
Come to your senses.

60
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:42,912
Hwa-ran.

61
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:46,290
You're the one who sent them.

62
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,545
If you were going to be so anxious,
you shouldn't have sent them.

63
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:54,048
Let's continue.

64
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:55,758
Where were we?

65
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,886
That our investment in Alanga
wasn't just a venturous move.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,849
I always wanted to turn Alanga
into a world-famous luxury brand.

67
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:05,017
- To do that--
- It's all a dream.

68
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,896
A company that's too busy making money

69
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,774
to care about the safety of its employee

70
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,818
can't possibly turn into a luxury brand.

71
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,863
It's nothing but a vain dream.

72
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,906
Such big words from a guy without one.

73
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,991
Right?

74
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:22,285
I'll get the helicopter running.

75
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,829
I'll show you how cheeky I can get.

76
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,750
Make a fortune, everyone.

77
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:36,299
Get the helicopter running now.

78
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:38,926
I know Ms. Gu Hwa-ran hasn't approved.

79
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,596
I'm Gu Won.

80
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:43,389
I'll take responsibility.

81
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:46,559
You had to fight her someday,
so great job.

82
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,228
Ms. Gu won't boss you around
after you put your foot down.

83
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:52,064
You've put up a good fight
in your first power game.

84
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,566
This is about saving a life.

85
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,609
It's not about power.

86
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:56,986
You need power to save people.

87
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,071
You should go home.

88
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,531
I'll update you on her rescue.

89
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,241
I'm not going home.

90
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,202
There's nothing more you can do here.

91
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,536
I'll stay.

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,288
I'm going.

93
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,001
Are you insane? In this weather?

94
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:13,294
I know you're blinded by love,

95
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:14,795
- but this is wrong!
- Let go.

96
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,882
What will become of me
if something happens to you?

97
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,676
You're my only connection at work!

98
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,929
As I said, you picked the wrong man.

99
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,514
Let go of that connection and me.

100
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,807
Over my dead body!

101
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,394
If you must go,
you'll have to step over me!

102
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,521
Lie down!

103
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,482
What? I can't hear you!

104
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:35,775
Quickly! There's no time!

105
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,154
Then enjoy your flight!

106
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:41,447
This way, please!

107
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,993
You must come back alive!

108
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,339
You have to fly safely!

109
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,591
Be careful!

110
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:11,852
EPISODE 6

111
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:17,441
What was that?

112
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:19,485
I'm scared.

113
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:22,154
Am I going to die?

114
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:25,574
I'm scared, Grandma.

115
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:25,134
What are you doing?

116
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:26,844
- Go away!
- It's me!

117
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:28,596
- Get off of me!
- It's me!

118
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:33,643
Mr. Gu?

119
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:34,560
Yes.

120
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,187
It's me.

121
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,481
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

122
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:45,279
Are you a human? Not a ghost?

123
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,697
Yes, it's me.

124
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:58,459
I was so scared that I'd die here.

125
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,964
- You're fine.
- Thank you.

126
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,132
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,093
I'm here now.

128
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,223
I thought I was going to die.

129
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,060
Target rescued.

130
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:18,020
She looks fine.

131
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:19,563
I must turn due to strong winds.

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,818
How did you get here?

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,946
- On a helicopter.
- You even borrowed a helicopter?

134
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,656
I had one at home.

135
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:30,991
Why do you have a helicopter…

136
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,247
You probably do.

137
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,918
Anyway, how are we going to get back up?

138
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:45,423
We should get back up.

139
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,386
You didn't come alone, right?

140
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:52,096
They'll throw a rope down, right?

141
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:56,600
Wait.

142
00:08:57,393 --> 00:08:59,270
Did you come alone without a plan?

143
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:04,191
It's better than being here by yourself.

144
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,862
Well, I guess so.

145
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:08,779
But still…

146
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,073
When I came to my senses,
I was already in the helicopter.

147
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,327
I didn't have a moment to think.

148
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:19,999
All I knew was I had to come and save you.

149
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:23,878
Why?

150
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:27,631
I wonder.

151
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:33,554
Why did I do that?

152
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,031
So what are we going to do now?

153
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:58,412
Don't worry.

154
00:09:58,496 --> 00:09:59,497
I'm here.

155
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,383
Hello? It's me, Gu Won.

156
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:15,429
Help.

157
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,233
Why are you laughing?

158
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,361
No reason.

159
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:33,405
"Help."

160
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,326
They'll send a rescue team in the morning.

161
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:39,912
So hang in there until then.

162
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:43,707
What a relief.

163
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,626
I'll protect you.

164
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,014
My gosh.

165
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:02,768
What was that?

166
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,187
I heard something. Something must be here.

167
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,357
You said you'd protect me.

168
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,947
I wasn't hiding. I was guarding your back.

169
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,991
Okay? I always say this.

170
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:21,287
Enemies always come from behind.

171
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,204
So--

172
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,249
My gosh! You surprised me.

173
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:28,294
Jeez.

174
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:34,008
You're scared so easily.

175
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,260
No, I'm not.

176
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:09,004
Have a hearty bite.

177
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:12,174
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

178
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:20,641
I've never seen such a cowardly guy.

179
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:24,061
Whether it's a ghost or a boar,
you should knock it out like a man.

180
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,022
Good grief. I still remember your shriek.

181
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,065
I agree.

182
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:29,942
Wait, what?

183
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:33,195
It wasn't a shriek. It was a battle cry.

184
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,447
Like a roar.

185
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,364
Bam!

186
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:37,533
Something like that.

187
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:39,744
So you're from King Hotel?

188
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,997
Yes. I apologize for causing you trouble.

189
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,584
I heard a lady who went to look for me
hadn't returned, so I went to find you.

190
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,669
Why weren't you careful in this weather?

191
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,004
Are you brave or just reckless?

192
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,005
She's thoughtless.

193
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,174
Who cares if your company
made you do this?

194
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:55,634
Your company means nothing
once you're dead.

195
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,386
Don't put out your life for work.

196
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,180
There's nothing as foolish as that.

197
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,097
You're right.

198
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:03,350
I wanted to ignore the order,
but someone high up made me do it.

199
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,436
Someone high up? Who?

200
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:07,062
This man.

201
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,947
This is so tasty. Thank you.

202
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:18,073
Eat up.

203
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,706
You should get a checkup

204
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,625
at the nearest hospital in the morning.

205
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,961
No, I have no time for that.

206
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,089
I have to go to work right away
for a night shift.

207
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,467
Who cares about work?

208
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,302
Do as someone high up tells you.

209
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,639
And in the future,

210
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:43,891
don't put your life on the line
for the company.

211
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:47,144
I don't want to do that either,
but it keeps happening.

212
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:48,729
Just say no.

213
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,861
There's no choice
for a mere employee like me.

214
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,748
I promise.

215
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,669
Something like this

216
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,130
will never happen again.

217
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,700
What are you doing this early?

218
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,537
I wanted to sweep the yard
before he woke up.

219
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:31,207
Would he care that you did this for him?

220
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,876
I came to give him a hand,
so I should work.

221
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,425
Give it to me. I got it.

222
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,843
No, I'll do it.

223
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,554
- No, I'll have it.
- No, it's fine.

224
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:47,765
You don't seem like a good sweeper.

225
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,058
I got it. Give it here.

226
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,142
It's okay. Move aside.

227
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,143
- Let go.
- I got this.

228
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:52,311
- Move.
- You aren't so good.

229
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,395
- Please move.
- Give it.

230
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,480
Good grief!

231
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:56,815
Why do you keep getting in my way?

232
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:02,488
Mr. Gu.

233
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,448
I've never been hit before.

234
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,991
Are you all right?

235
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:07,993
- I'm fine.
- Goodness.

236
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:11,538
Give it to me.

237
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,790
- I'll do it.
- No.

238
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,541
- I got this.
- I'll do it.

239
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,542
- Let go.
- I'm sorry.

240
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,253
No, it's okay. Let go of this.

241
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:18,796
I'll do it.

242
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,258
That's not how you sweep. Look.

243
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:23,217
Like this.

244
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:25,761
This.

245
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:27,763
This.

246
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,431
And this.

247
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,892
- This is how it's done.
- Hold on.

248
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:36,397
Hey.

249
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,523
I…

250
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,858
Are you okay?

251
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:42,778
You hit exactly
where I got injured yesterday.

252
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:43,696
Wait, I…

253
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:46,073
That stone.

254
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,283
Sit down.

255
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,122
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

256
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,458
Could…

257
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,603
It hurts more than it did yesterday.

258
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,023
I'm in so much pain.

259
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:27,906
It hurts so bad.

260
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:29,825
It must hurt a lot.

261
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,078
I'll clean up, so sit right there.

262
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:33,996
Don't move.

263
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,581
I'll do everything.

264
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,253
It seemed like
you didn't know how to sweep.

265
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:44,590
I've never seen
a broom like this before, but look.

266
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,931
- Right here too.
- Okay.

267
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,773
- I'm good, aren't I?
- You're so good!

268
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:21,627
These are our hotel's cake and cookies.

269
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,088
I heard you like these,
so I had them made specially.

270
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,964
It's a little dirty.

271
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,466
Thanks. I'll enjoy these.

272
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:30,469
Please work with us in the future

273
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,970
and send us some good ginseng.

274
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:35,057
I only work with First Royal Hotel,

275
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,017
so save yourself the trouble and go home.

276
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,645
Let me know if you need any help.

277
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:41,063
I'll help you before I go.

278
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,357
We said we were fine. You don't have to.

279
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,316
There's no need.

280
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,318
Go home and look after yourself.

281
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,820
Anything is fine.

282
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,530
I can clean and do the laundry too.

283
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:51,365
Did the man high up make you do this?

284
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,242
I didn't, sir.

285
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,618
Yes, it was you.

286
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,829
There's no need, so go home.

287
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:59,373
You already swept my yard
early this morning.

288
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,416
That was me.

289
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,087
If you get sick of your work,
quit and come here.

290
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,173
You're good enough at hiking
to be a ginseng digger.

291
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,217
Right, the ginseng!

292
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,718
One second.

293
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:12,845
What?

294
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,770
Sir, please take a look.

295
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:24,940
I dug this up yesterday on the mountain.

296
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:26,692
By any chance,

297
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,485
is this ginseng?

298
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,656
You think anyone can dig up ginseng?

299
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,058
It's not ginseng, is it?

300
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:01,935
It must be bellflower root.

301
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:05,355
You don't have to ask.
It's obviously bellflower root.

302
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:08,567
It's ginseng.

303
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,027
- What?
- Really?

304
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,236
Wild ginseng at that.

305
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,323
This is such a rarity.

306
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,408
Not anyone can dig this.

307
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:19,536
We say it requires three generations
of good deeds to find one.

308
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,164
You dug up this rare thing
even I've only found once.

309
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,665
Miss.

310
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:25,250
You must have lived a good life.

311
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:28,086
Gosh, I kind of did.

312
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,551
Do you want to come and work with me?

313
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:37,054
Mount Jiri has approved of you.

314
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,015
Sir.

315
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:42,976
Goodness.

316
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,144
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:46,271
I will not allow that.

318
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:48,857
She's a valuable member of our company.

319
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:50,859
All of a sudden?

320
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,278
She's the best talent at our hotel,

321
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:56,114
and she secured that position
two years in a row.

322
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,242
- Yes.
- Two years.

323
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,243
Sure.

324
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,619
Please let go of me.

325
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:02,746
What was that?

326
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,791
Thank you for saving me, sir.

327
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:06,959
I saved you.

328
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,085
You can have this.

329
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,128
If you hadn't saved me last night,

330
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,130
I would've died in the woods.

331
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:13,590
No, I saved you.

332
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,259
You should repay me instead.

333
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,969
- I'll take it.
- Hey!

334
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:20,389
I can't take this.

335
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:21,890
It's too valuable.

336
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:23,308
No, please take it.

337
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:25,936
I can't take something
that the heavens gave you.

338
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,688
You should give it to your father.

339
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:30,440
I don't have one.

340
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,401
Then your mother.

341
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,861
I don't have a mother either.

342
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,446
What? Then…

343
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:39,032
Then what will you do with this?

344
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,702
I'll give it to my grandma.
She'll be thrilled.

345
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:44,246
Yes, give it to your grandmother.

346
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,082
Hold on. I'll pack it up for you.

347
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,509
Something this precious

348
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:59,886
deserves careful treatment.

349
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:02,764
Thank you.

350
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,434
So please consider our hotel too.

351
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:09,146
I received great energy today
thanks to you.

352
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:11,732
When I come across the best wild ginseng,

353
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,400
I'll send it to King Hotel immediately.

354
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,736
Don't worry and go home.

355
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:16,903
Really?

356
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:18,655
Are you serious?

357
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,741
It's a promise.
You can't change your mind.

358
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:21,783
All right.

359
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,494
If you change your mind,
join me right away.

360
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:25,412
You are

361
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:27,497
a natural-born ginseng digger!

362
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:31,710
You're right. I found ginseng!

363
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:34,463
I found ginseng!

364
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:41,636
<i>I'll send you ginseng</i>

365
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,680
as I find them in the future,

366
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,599
so stop sending your employees here.

367
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:48,310
You shouldn't do that to them.

368
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,104
I used to take advantage of
those hotel employees

369
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:53,273
whenever they came out here.

370
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,943
But I came to my senses thanks to her.

371
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:01,698
She could've gotten into serious trouble.

372
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:10,916
I wasn't the one who sent her…

373
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,542
I did.

374
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,672
Thank you for your help.

375
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:39,986
It's fine.

376
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:42,781
I'm fine, really.

377
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,909
Just say thanks.

378
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:48,412
Thank you, sir.

379
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,207
No, not like that.

380
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:02,426
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart, Mr. Gu.

381
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,559
I mean, do you and I have to be
so formal just to say thanks?

382
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:14,479
It'd be mutiny if I skipped the formality.

383
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:17,357
Forget it.

384
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,067
Why do I bother?

385
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:27,659
You should've returned with the helicopter
and not stayed here.

386
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,494
I had to drive five hours for you.

387
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:32,038
- Sa-rang, are you okay?
- Yes.

388
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,291
Take this.

389
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,585
I didn't ask you to come.

390
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:38,503
You made a big scene at work

391
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:40,422
trying to help one of your employees.

392
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:41,882
The chairman wants to see you.

393
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,426
Are you hurt?

394
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,178
I'm fine.

395
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,806
What about work?
Did something happen there?

396
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:53,185
He barged into Ms. Gu's meeting
to get the helicopter--

397
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:56,688
Hey, that's enough. Let's go.

398
00:24:57,647 --> 00:24:58,732
He had a go at her.

399
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:02,360
- Please get in.
- Hop in.

400
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,447
Let's go.

401
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:14,498
Hey, you can…

402
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:20,545
Okay.

403
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:24,758
Yes?

404
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,885
Back here.

405
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,139
Okay.

406
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:42,025
I'll close the door, sir.

407
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,952
He could've closed it himself.

408
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,287
He's so high maintenance.

409
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,540
- Try to understand.
- Okay.

410
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,000
I can hear you.

411
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:00,418
I'll start driving, sir.

412
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,132
Are you sure you're okay?

413
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:08,635
I almost died.

414
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:11,137
Exactly. I was so worried

415
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,223
that I drove over without sleeping.

416
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,307
Thank you.

417
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:15,433
My leg was in pain,

418
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,477
so I was dreading the bus ride home.

419
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:18,979
You're thankful, aren't you?

420
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,314
Then you can treat me to a meal.

421
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,857
Sure.

422
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:23,900
Really?

423
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,111
What should we eat?

424
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:27,445
What do you like?

425
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,699
You should decide, Mr. No. It's my treat.

426
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:31,783
"Mr. No"?

427
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,743
I'm shocked at the formality.

428
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:34,661
Call me Sang-sik.

429
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:37,080
You did that last time.

430
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,291
I'll really do that if you keep saying it.

431
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:41,126
Of course you should.

432
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:43,587
It was me!

433
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:47,382
- What was?
- I saved her!

434
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:49,634
Why should you two eat when I saved her?

435
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:52,137
This is illogical and inconsiderate.

436
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,430
What are you two doing?

437
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,600
I'll stop by the service area, sir.

438
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,312
- Rain check on the meal.
- Your meal is off!

439
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,022
Don't eat with her!

440
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,987
Sa-rang, eat up. It's my treat.

441
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:10,488
- Thank you.
- Sure.

442
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:13,575
The signature snack here is the sausage.

443
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:14,534
This is mine.

444
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:18,038
He's such an eyesore today.

445
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,081
Pick anything you like
but the sausage, sir.

446
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:22,125
- I don't want anything.
- Why not?

447
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,044
The key. I'll drive. Sit in the back.

448
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,837
I'd be grateful.

449
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,425
- And pull this out.
- What?

450
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:41,061
See?

451
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:43,772
This is how you succeed in life.
Learn from me.

452
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:46,650
He treats me like this
because I'm that essential.

453
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,151
Right?

454
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:50,111
You must be happy.

455
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,780
Let's go quietly.

456
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:53,698
You'll get treated as you do,

457
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,617
- so just follow my example.
- Okay.

458
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,329
Mr. Gu, do you want to try one?

459
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:00,455
Forget it.

460
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:02,582
Try one. It's really good.

461
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:13,718
No, he doesn't want any.

462
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,637
He'll get sick if he's forced to eat.

463
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,389
I'll eat it.

464
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,974
I'll put it on this stick.

465
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:22,477
Isn't it good?

466
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,438
Walnut cakes from rest stops
always taste great.

467
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:26,731
It's delicious.

468
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,776
- You can have more.
- No, you go ahead.

469
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,362
Walnut cakes are best with coffee.

470
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,575
I need to go to the restroom.

471
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:39,828
I think a little came out.

472
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:54,009
He must have a bad stomachache.

473
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:55,635
That's what he gets for binge eating.

474
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,761
Will he be okay?

475
00:28:58,555 --> 00:28:59,681
No way.

476
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:01,433
Are you worried?

477
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:02,642
Of course I am.

478
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:06,229
What about me?

479
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,441
- Sorry?
- Why don't you worry about me?

480
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:11,317
I'm the one who saved you,

481
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:15,238
but the ginseng, the meal, and your worry
are always for someone else.

482
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:19,701
Well,

483
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:22,162
I can worry about you too.
Tell me what about.

484
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:24,289
Forget it.

485
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,964
Hey, are you okay?
Are you in a lot of pain?

486
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,383
No.

487
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,469
I must have a stomachache.

488
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:40,180
Take the week off as sick leave.

489
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:42,390
Use the corporate card
to eat, sleep, and play.

490
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:43,767
<i>Really?</i>

491
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:45,393
Thank you.

492
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:47,395
Don't thank me. I'm abandoning you here.

493
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:50,023
<i>With such terms,
feel free to abandon me at any time.</i>

494
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:51,191
Keep abandoning me.

495
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:53,943
Drive carefully.

496
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:57,739
Have fun on your date.

497
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,949
Hello?

498
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,495
He hung up. I was talking to myself.

499
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:06,372
I almost died.

500
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:23,389


501
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:27,769
Where is it?

502
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:30,814
- Pardon?
- Your grandmother's place.

503
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,774
Let's give her the ginseng.

504
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:35,360
But the chairman called you.

505
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,195
It's fine. Tell me.

506
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:39,447
I'm okay, really. I'll go alone later.

507
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:40,573
Tell me.

508
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:46,996
It's really okay.

509
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:55,839
JOAS

510
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:58,258
Miss?

511
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,178
How may I help you?

512
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:04,931
How much do you get
for selling one of these?

513
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,767
- Sorry?
- Your incentives. I'm sure you get some.

514
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,186
We do not get incentives.

515
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,313
What an awful company.

516
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:16,234
Our company, Joas, gives huge incentives
for the sale of even a single item.

517
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:19,737
I'm in the diamond tier,
and I make 40 million won a month.

518
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:21,072
Fate must've led me to you.

519
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:23,825
I'll let you join us under me.
What do you think?

520
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:24,742
Excuse me, miss.

521
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:27,745
Please excuse me.

522
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:31,916
How may I help you?

523
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,959
I heard everything,

524
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,002
so fill this out.

525
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,004
It's the membership application for Joas.

526
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:37,922
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:40,800
- We aren't allowed--
- Your company doesn't give you a dime.

528
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:43,052
You'll easily make
50 to 60 million a month with me.

529
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,137
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,264
Company policy doesn't allow me to do so.

531
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:48,057
You don't have to do anything.
Just fill it out.

532
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:50,602
Your name, phone number,
and resident ID number.

533
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:51,895
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:54,022
Everything is possible in this country.

535
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:56,024
- Where are your manners?
- What?

536
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,026
She was going to join under my name.

537
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:00,403
How dare you rain on my parade?

538
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,321
Me?

539
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:03,448
Whoever gives her
the application first wins.

540
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,616
Miss, fill it out.

541
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,451
How dare you pull this kind of crap?

542
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:08,912
You already stole
one of my members last time!

543
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,496
- You punk!
- What's with you, old lady?

544
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,706
- Please calm down.
- Old lady?

545
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,416
- Yes!
- Old lady?

546
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:14,959
I'm going to kill you.

547
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,127
Come here!

548
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:17,420
- You!
- What's with you?

549
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:18,922
- Sir, calm down.
- You trashy lady!

550
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,882
- Trashy? You little…
- Please calm down.

551
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:30,934
Have you lost your mind?

552
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:32,769
- You!
- Yes, I've lost my mind!

553
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,605
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we're experiencing turbulence.</i>

554
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,065
<i>For your safety,</i>

555
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:39,984
<i>please make sure
your seatbelt is fastened.</i>

556
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:41,444
<i>Ladies and gentlemen…</i>

557
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:45,865
That almost killed me.

558
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:49,994
Have some water.

559
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:51,621
Thanks.

560
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,377
Pyeong-hwa.

561
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,295
Where's your shoe?

562
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:06,135
Let's organize the cart and go out.

563
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,720
You're going back out

564
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:09,764
without your shoe?

565
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:11,975
Is this improper?

566
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,142
Yes.

567
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:16,187
We have time until we land,
so we have to sell more.

568
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:19,357
Where did it go?

569
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,566
Looking for this?

570
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,830
- Should I put it on for you?
- No.

571
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:35,790
I can do it.

572
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:40,086
Thanks.

573
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:41,879
I'll look after my stuff from now on.

574
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:45,717
Even if you lose it again,
I'll find it for you.

575
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:07,613
This is it.

576
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:10,992
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

577
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:12,410
"Cow's head <i>gukbap</i>"?

578
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:15,288
Is the soup made with a cow's whole head?

579
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,499
No, not the head, but head meat.

580
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,043
Do you want to try it?

581
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,044
No, I'm fine.

582
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:22,920
You should go inside.

583
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:26,382
Thank you for the ride.
Please get back safely.

584
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:28,843
I'll wait.

585
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:32,388
No, I'll be a while. You should go.

586
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:33,348
Goodbye.

587
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:43,316
Right, where is that…

588
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:46,277
Grandma, I'm here.

589
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:47,362
What?

590
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:48,696
How come you're here?

591
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,614
What about work?

592
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:52,116
Look, wild ginseng.
I brought this for you.

593
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,243
Sure. Put the apron on.

594
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,662
This is wild ginseng I dug up myself.

595
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:58,414
- Look.
- I get it.

596
00:34:58,498 --> 00:34:59,665
So start serving these.

597
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,584
Don't forget those too. Hurry.

598
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:30,405
- A bottle of rice wine, please.
- How is it?

599
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,537
- My daughter-in-law!
- Yes?

600
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,830
Another bowl of rice.

601
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,641
- Hey!
- My goodness!

602
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:03,396
Who are you with?

603
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,232
- Sorry?
- Who are you

604
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:09,861
to peek at a woman
through a tiny little crack in the window?

605
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:13,072
Peeking? I was just looking.

606
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:14,615
Exactly.

607
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,287
Why were you looking at my Sa-rang
with those leering eyes?

608
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,913
Leering?

609
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:24,667
She wouldn't come out,
so I was wondering what she was doing.

610
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,295
"My Sa-rang"?
Are you Ms. Cheon's grandmother?

611
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,631
Are you her colleague?

612
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:33,551
Yes.

613
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:36,304
You should've said so from the get-go.

614
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:37,430
Okay.

615
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:40,683
Pick these up and follow me.

616
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:43,102
What do you mean?

617
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,244
Sit.

618
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:01,370
Pardon?

619
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:02,413
Sit down.

620
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:09,545
Take this.

621
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,297
Sit down.

622
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:13,132
Okay.

623
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,222
You've peeled onions before, right?

624
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,181
No.

625
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:21,224
What?

626
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:24,060
How dare you lie to me?

627
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:26,979
I really haven't.

628
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:28,814
So? You can't do this?

629
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:31,442
- No.
- Don't be a wimp and do as I say!

630
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:34,070
Grandma, orders are piling up.

631
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:36,781
- Why aren't you here?
- Tell them to go if they won't wait.

632
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:38,282
They can eat somewhere else.

633
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:42,453
Now, look.

634
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:45,581
Cut off this part first.

635
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,918
Then cut off the other part.

636
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,921
Once you peel off this part,

637
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:53,464
you'll see this.

638
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,259
This is your job.

639
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:57,802
Me?

640
00:37:58,469 --> 00:37:59,303
Why?

641
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:01,222
Just do as I say.

642
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:02,723
You'll be blessed.

643
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,725
Grandma, orders are piling up!

644
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:07,562
- Ms. Cheon…
- Okay, I'm coming.

645
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:09,105
Good grief, those punks.

646
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,147
Peel them.

647
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:15,653
What's with them?

648
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:26,831
From this

649
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:28,332
to this.

650
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,542
Okay.

651
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,007
Let's see.

652
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:21,761
What?

653
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:22,887
My goodness.

654
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,097
You ruined these perfectly good onions.

655
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,058
What should I do now?

656
00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:29,769
Did you cut these with your foot?

657
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,479
Goodness.

658
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,940
I'm the one who's at fault
for leaving you with this job.

659
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:36,317
Good grief!

660
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,195
I can't deal with this. Goodness.

661
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:41,072
I can't believe it.

662
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,532
Why am I in tears?

663
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:55,169
My gosh!

664
00:39:57,838 --> 00:39:59,131
What are you doing there?

665
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:02,426
I mean…

666
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:04,720
Where did you get this apron?

667
00:40:04,804 --> 00:40:06,055
Your grandmother gave it to me.

668
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:08,391
Did you meet her?

669
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:10,267
You shouldn't let her catch you.

670
00:40:10,351 --> 00:40:11,268
She already did.

671
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:14,814
And I think she got the best of me…

672
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,400
- Come in.
- Yes, ma'am.

673
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,578
Good work. Drink up.

674
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:32,707
- What's this?
- It's good for you.

675
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:34,458
Bottoms up.

676
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:36,711
Thank you.

677
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:47,972
What's this?

678
00:40:48,556 --> 00:40:50,599
It's great for men.

679
00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:53,144
A mix of loach extract

680
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:55,146
and a touch of larvae.

681
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:01,026
Goodness.

682
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,738
A man with such a weak stomach
is good for nothing.

683
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:06,157
He holds a very high position at work.

684
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,033
Why did you make him peel onions?

685
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:10,578
High or not, they're all the same.

686
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,288
It's not like he's the chairman's son.

687
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:15,458
Hey, you need to go get some tofu.

688
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:18,252
Okay.

689
00:41:25,426 --> 00:41:26,635
Do you feel better?

690
00:41:27,178 --> 00:41:31,223
How can people eat loach and larvae?

691
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:33,309
I told you to go home first.

692
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:37,897
I'm that loyal.

693
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,233
Us? There's loyalty between us?

694
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:42,318
Of course there is.

695
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:43,819
We both almost died together.

696
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,447
Then again, I saved you.

697
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:52,286
In that case, do you want something sweet?

698
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:55,331
No, I hate sweets.

699
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:56,457
Just try some.

700
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,793
Try some out of loyalty.

701
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:23,567
You're drinking more broth?

702
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:24,819
This is excellent.

703
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:26,320
What do we owe you?

704
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:28,781
Six fish cake sticks
and four sweet pancakes.

705
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,950
They're 3,000 won and 2,000 won,
so 5,000 won.

706
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:34,328
I had four cups of this too.
Please add that to the total.

707
00:42:34,411 --> 00:42:35,913
The broth is free.

708
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:41,752
But this is so good.

709
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,256
You'll be blessed.

710
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,218
My wallet.

711
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,594
Here.

712
00:42:51,971 --> 00:42:52,888
I'll pay you back.

713
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:55,641
It's all right.
You came to my town, so it's my treat.

714
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:00,312
Then may I have one more?

715
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:04,191
- As many as you want.
- One more, please.

716
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:07,069
Here. This is on the house.

717
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:11,240
Then I'll take another one.

718
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:14,577
Here. Eat up.

719
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,453
KING CARP GAME

720
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,622
That's still a thing?
I did it a lot as a kid.

721
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:21,542
What is it?

722
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,586
KING CARP

723
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,215
And pick one.

724
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:41,645
- I got number 18.
- Did you lose again?

725
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:43,606
You lost ten times in a row.

726
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:44,732
That's a talent.

727
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:47,026
Sir, are you sure I can win this game?

728
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:48,527
Of course.

729
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:49,904
One more round.

730
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:51,697
May I borrow 1,000 won?

731
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:54,158
No, you need to stop.

732
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:57,119
I'll play one last round,
so let me borrow just 1,000 won.

733
00:43:57,828 --> 00:44:00,122
You've already said that many times.

734
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:01,707
Look at these.

735
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,208
So this is the last time.

736
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:05,377
I'll play one more round.

737
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,755
Just 1,000 won.

738
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:10,591
This is turning into gambling.

739
00:44:10,674 --> 00:44:12,718
How is this gambling? It's a battle.

740
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,136
I'm paying for this myself.

741
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,055
Well technically, it's your money.

742
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,682
Yes, and that's gambling.

743
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:20,017
Anyway, a no is no.

744
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,436
And I'm out of cash anyway.

745
00:44:24,104 --> 00:44:25,397
Let's take this and go.

746
00:44:34,198 --> 00:44:35,240
Just 1,000 won.

747
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:37,701
Please?

748
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:39,662
I'll play just one more round.

749
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:42,206
Just 1,000 won.

750
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:45,834
Just

751
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:47,628
one more round.

752
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,010
Are you seriously
trying to act cute right now?

753
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:57,513
Yes, so let me borrow 1,000 won.

754
00:44:57,596 --> 00:44:59,390
You can't win this game that easily.

755
00:44:59,473 --> 00:45:02,184
I've played this a lot,
and I've never won the big prize.

756
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,144
I'll show you.

757
00:45:04,228 --> 00:45:06,021
So please, just 1,000 won.

758
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:08,732
Are you dying to play?

759
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,321
Another round?

760
00:45:14,947 --> 00:45:15,823
Here.

761
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:18,492
This is the last time.

762
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:20,744
- You said you had no cash.
- Forget it, then.

763
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:28,794
One more round.

764
00:45:33,424 --> 00:45:34,842
This time, you're playing too.

765
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,928
Say when.

766
00:45:48,063 --> 00:45:49,189
Stop.

767
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:53,652
Stop.

768
00:45:57,114 --> 00:45:58,198
Stop.

769
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,072
Please.

770
00:46:42,576 --> 00:46:43,660
Please.

771
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,547
No way.

772
00:46:55,631 --> 00:46:57,257
Number 39. The king carp!

773
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:01,011
- We drew this! The carp!
- How did you do this?

774
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:03,013
We won! No way!

775
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:04,681
We won!

776
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:06,725
- No way! That one!
- I can't believe it!

777
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:09,019
- What did you do?
- This is awesome!

778
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:11,188
Goodness, the king carp.

779
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:12,606
This is awesome.

780
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:14,983
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

781
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:18,111
Jeez.

782
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:24,576
- I won.
- That was crazy.

783
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,706
Goodness.

784
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:32,417
Are you that happy?

785
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,294
Yes.

786
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,632
I don't think I've ever wanted anything
this badly in my life.

787
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:40,467
Small things can give you joy.

788
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,680
A small thing? This is a king carp.

789
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:46,932
And you used 10,000 won to get it.

790
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:48,642
Nothing's free in this world.

791
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:51,311
I must make an investment
to win something precious.

792
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:57,484
Anyway, I've played this a lot
since when I was a kid,

793
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:01,864
and I've never seen anyone
who won the king carp until now.

794
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:05,284
So you were kind of cool.

795
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:09,288
See? This doesn't happen for just anybody.

796
00:48:09,872 --> 00:48:11,790
It's me. Because it's me.

797
00:48:11,874 --> 00:48:15,002
Only I can do something like this.

798
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:18,422
Yes, sure. Of course.

799
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:19,923
I'll pay you back though.

800
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:21,925
Forget it.

801
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:53,874
Are you okay?

802
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,751
Are you hurt?

803
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:58,128
What are you doing?

804
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:00,422
I said I'd protect you.

805
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:17,981
Rice puffs.

806
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:28,325
- He's making rice puffs.
- Rice puffs?

807
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:29,826
- Oh, rice puffs.
- Yes.

808
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,495
It sounded like a bomb.

809
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:32,955
I was so surprised.

810
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:45,467
My carp.

811
00:49:46,259 --> 00:49:47,344
This is my…

812
00:49:58,105 --> 00:49:59,106
Grandma.

813
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:01,108
It took so long for a block of tofu.

814
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:02,985
Did you make one yourself or something?

815
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:04,111
Right, the tofu!

816
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:05,570
- I'll go get one.
- Hey!

817
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,155
You're so out of it.

818
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,449
Never mind. It'll take you too long.

819
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,410
Sorry.

820
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:14,037
I was giving him
a tour of the marketplace.

821
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:17,708
It's such an everyday place.
There's nothing to see there.

822
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:20,877
Please take this.

823
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:23,005
What's this?

824
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,132
It was a sudden visit,
so I came empty-handed.

825
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:26,675
Please take this.

826
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,344
Goodness. Are you made of money?

827
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:31,847
You can't even eat this.

828
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,433
When will you buy a house,
wasting all this money?

829
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,478
Grandma, you don't have to worry.

830
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:40,772
Why? Is his dad rich?

831
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:42,399
What does he do?

832
00:50:44,276 --> 00:50:47,738
He owns a few small businesses.

833
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:51,742
You're too old
to be living off your father.

834
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:54,036
You look perfectly fine
on the outside too.

835
00:50:55,537 --> 00:50:56,872
Do you have
a housing subscription account?

836
00:50:57,539 --> 00:50:58,540
Not yet.

837
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,043
If you have money to buy flowers,

838
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:02,753
you should open a savings account.

839
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:05,338
No matter how rich your family is,

840
00:51:05,422 --> 00:51:07,466
you must make a living for yourself.

841
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:08,383
Absolutely.

842
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:09,885
Come and eat before you go.

843
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:17,142
Does she like them?

844
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:21,855
Goodness.

845
00:51:22,856 --> 00:51:25,984
Eat up before it gets cold.

846
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:30,989
Thank you.

847
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:39,039
What's wrong? You can't eat this?

848
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:42,793
No, it's just that…

849
00:51:44,544 --> 00:51:46,296
I've never had it before.

850
00:51:46,379 --> 00:51:47,380
What?

851
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:50,050
All right.

852
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:52,385
Okay. Scoop some rice.

853
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:53,512
Rice?

854
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:56,181
Yes, dip it in the soup.

855
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:58,809
- The soup.
- Good.

856
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:01,478
It'll taste pretty nice
if you try it like that.

857
00:52:08,985 --> 00:52:12,114
If you really can't eat it,
I'll make something else.

858
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:13,156
Try it.

859
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,616
Her <i>gukbap</i> is really good.

860
00:52:15,742 --> 00:52:16,868
Okay.

861
00:52:17,577 --> 00:52:18,745
Thank you.

862
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:29,965
How is it?

863
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,680
Good, isn't it?

864
00:52:37,973 --> 00:52:39,558
Yes, it's really good.

865
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,269
See?

866
00:52:42,352 --> 00:52:45,730
I've been doing this for 30 years.

867
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:46,857
Eat some more.

868
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:51,069
- May I have some kimchi?
- Put this on there and keep eating.

869
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:52,237
- Yes.
- Good.

870
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:00,829
Thank you. So I dip the rice first.

871
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:02,622
- You seem to love it.
- And add kimchi.

872
00:53:09,963 --> 00:53:11,673
Hey, over here.

873
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:12,757
Here.

874
00:53:14,009 --> 00:53:16,595
I packed some <i>gukbap</i> and kimchi.

875
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:17,762
You can take these.

876
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,389
Thank you for the food.

877
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:20,390
Sure.

878
00:53:22,225 --> 00:53:23,435
Also,

879
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,770
this is your daily wage.

880
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:28,064
It's all right. Please don't do this.

881
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:31,234
I'm paying you minimum wage.

882
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:33,278
Thanks for peeling the onions.

883
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:34,321
Take it.

884
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:36,072
Take it!

885
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,366
Then I'll accept it thankfully.

886
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:41,328
- And this is yours.
- I'm fine.

887
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:42,329
It's for the ginseng.

888
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:44,414
My precious granddaughter

889
00:53:44,497 --> 00:53:46,416
brought me such precious wild ginseng.

890
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:48,627
I'm such a lucky woman.

891
00:53:49,502 --> 00:53:50,921
I'll get more if it's effective.

892
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,298
Don't you dare go back there.

893
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:56,676
Do you know how dangerous
the mountains are?

894
00:53:57,344 --> 00:54:01,181
What kind of a jerk made
my precious kid wander the mountains?

895
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:02,682
Once I find them,

896
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,768
I'll make sure I wring their neck.

897
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:08,104
I won't go back. Don't worry.

898
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:09,147
Go on.

899
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:11,816
And drive safely.

900
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,193
Yes, we'll get going.

901
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,197
I'll be back.

902
00:54:18,406 --> 00:54:19,574
Why would you come back?

903
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,743
Right.

904
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,412
Come back and peel some more onions.

905
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:26,957
Yes.

906
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,458
- Go now.
- Goodbye.

907
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,001
- Go.
- Bye.

908
00:54:31,211 --> 00:54:32,462
Go inside.

909
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,435
Look at him.

910
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,902
Goodness. He's very polite.

911
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:09,124
That punk.

912
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,751
He has good manners after all.

913
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:33,940
Thank you.

914
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:38,903
For coming to save me
and taking me to Grandma's.

915
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:40,405
Thank you for everything.

916
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:43,116
Now you're making sense.

917
00:55:44,492 --> 00:55:45,702
If you're thankful,

918
00:55:46,286 --> 00:55:47,537
treat me to a meal.

919
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:49,706
I will.

920
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:51,333
Let me know when you're free.

921
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:52,250
Okay.

922
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:53,918
I'll let you take me.

923
00:55:54,544 --> 00:55:55,545
Take you where?

924
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:56,921
On a date.

925
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:01,718
A date?

926
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:03,011
You wanted to eat.

927
00:56:06,348 --> 00:56:07,932
It's a date.

928
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:50,558
Get some rest.

929
00:57:43,403 --> 00:57:44,654
What's that?

930
00:57:46,614 --> 00:57:47,782
<i>Gukbap</i>.

931
00:57:49,993 --> 00:57:51,119
Do you want some?

932
00:57:56,249 --> 00:57:57,584
This is nice.

933
00:57:58,168 --> 00:58:00,253
It's tough to find a good <i>gukbap</i> place.

934
00:58:01,171 --> 00:58:02,797
She's done this for 30 years.

935
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:05,675
I'm craving a drink now.

936
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:07,927
I'd like a drink.

937
00:58:09,304 --> 00:58:10,805
What should I bring?

938
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:12,390
Whiskey, cognac, or wine?

939
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,852
I just want a glass of soju.

940
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,228
I'll get some right away.

941
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:23,443
This is great.

942
00:58:35,997 --> 00:58:37,874
So you went your way with the helicopter?

943
00:58:39,876 --> 00:58:40,710
Yes.

944
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:43,213
You may be the chairman's son,

945
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:46,382
but you shouldn't ignore procedures
with your unruly behavior.

946
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:48,384
I'm sorry.

947
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:53,014
Why did you take things that far?

948
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:57,519
Because it was our employee.

949
00:58:59,479 --> 00:59:01,523
You did all that to save just one person?

950
00:59:04,526 --> 00:59:05,693
Have you…

951
00:59:09,072 --> 00:59:10,198
ever saved…

952
00:59:13,368 --> 00:59:14,577
even one person?

953
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:41,271
The toughest thing in the world

954
00:59:42,564 --> 00:59:44,566
is saving just one person.

955
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:49,153
You begin to wonder if it'll be worth it.

956
00:59:50,947 --> 00:59:52,490
The world has become a place

957
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:55,076
where things are valued
more than a person's life.

958
00:59:58,454 --> 01:00:00,498
It was a tough decision to make. Good job.

959
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,668
Even though it did cost us a little.

960
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:09,966
And thanks for this <i>gukbap</i>.

961
01:00:11,885 --> 01:00:13,219
Bring it again next time.

962
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,014
Let's enjoy it together.

963
01:00:59,557 --> 01:01:00,767
PUMPKIN TAFFY

964
01:01:40,723 --> 01:01:42,684
- What do you want?
- Something good.

965
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:45,937
- Should I get juice?
- What's the sweetest?

966
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,730
- What about you?
- I don't know.

967
01:01:47,814 --> 01:01:48,731
I don't want anything.

968
01:01:49,399 --> 01:01:50,900
You can order whatever you want.

969
01:01:53,194 --> 01:01:54,195
What are you getting?

970
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:57,657
I need to report on our sales
compared to last year,

971
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,450
so please put the data together, Ms. Gang.

972
01:02:00,535 --> 01:02:02,620
But the sales report is your duty.

973
01:02:02,704 --> 01:02:04,789
Why should I write it
when I'm the one reporting it?

974
01:02:05,415 --> 01:02:07,125
I have to do it tomorrow morning,

975
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,418
so send it over by tonight.

976
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:11,546
I'm sorry, but I have to go home
right away because of my kid.

977
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:12,505
Ms. Gang.

978
01:02:12,588 --> 01:02:15,550
Do you not know how to keep
your work and personal life separate?

979
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:18,261
If you're at work, do your job.

980
01:02:18,344 --> 01:02:22,015
If you're the store manager,
you should set an example.

981
01:02:22,598 --> 01:02:25,018
Send me the report
before you go home today.

982
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:26,561
Let me have a sip.

983
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:41,826
This is so sweet.

984
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:44,495
And whipped cream makes you really fat.

985
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:46,873
How can you drink this with that tummy?

986
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:51,210
Give me a sip.

987
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,804
Why is this so cold?

988
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:04,182
It's iced. Of course it's cold.

989
01:03:04,265 --> 01:03:06,434
But this is too cold.

990
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:08,561
I'll order you one next time.

991
01:03:08,644 --> 01:03:10,521
You look like you could chug
a whole bowlful.

992
01:03:10,605 --> 01:03:12,148
You know I don't drink coffee.

993
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:14,692
Anyway, I have to go out to work.

994
01:03:14,776 --> 01:03:15,777
Keep it up.

995
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:23,242
She finished it.

996
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:26,496
She's always the same.

997
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,456
She eats as soon as she gets to work,

998
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:30,541
steals other people's coffee,

999
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:32,502
then works offsite.

1000
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:34,670
She doesn't work offsite.
She just goes home.

1001
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:35,671
Can she do that?

1002
01:03:35,755 --> 01:03:38,382
She's the management,
whereas we're outsourced contractors.

1003
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,885
There's no use in complaining.

1004
01:03:40,968 --> 01:03:42,011
Let's go.

1005
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,895
MONTHLY SALES REPORT

1006
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:04,200
- Hey honey.
- <i>Honey.</i>

1007
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:06,786
Something came up at work,
so can you pick up Cho-rong?

1008
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:07,745
<i>No.</i>

1009
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:11,082
You were supposed to pick her up today.

1010
01:04:11,165 --> 01:04:13,000
I suddenly have to write up a report.

1011
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:15,211
I'm in a meeting with a client.
I can't go.

1012
01:04:15,294 --> 01:04:16,254
Ask Mom.

1013
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:18,548
Okay.

1014
01:04:19,048 --> 01:04:20,842
<i>Sorry. I love you.</i>

1015
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:31,644
You have to turn the lower body.

1016
01:04:36,899 --> 01:04:38,985
We aren't taking any regular guests today.

1017
01:04:39,068 --> 01:04:40,945
- Check the list carefully.
- Yes.

1018
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:43,948
But what's the occasion? It's so grand.

1019
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,742
A birthday party for the youngest girl
of First Royal Hotel.

1020
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:50,246
Why is she having it here
and not at her hotel?

1021
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:51,455
Tell me about it.

1022
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:54,333
- Anyway, don't make a mistake.
- Okay.

1023
01:04:57,795 --> 01:05:01,174
<i>Everyone, it's my birthday!</i>

1024
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,593
Hi, everyone!

1025
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:05,428
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1026
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:06,512
Happy birthday.

1027
01:05:13,352 --> 01:05:14,687
Happy birthday.

1028
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,189
Hey!

1029
01:05:16,272 --> 01:05:17,481
Thank you.

1030
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:19,233
You become prettier by the day.

1031
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:22,236
You're now old enough to marry me.

1032
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,198
Sorry. I have high standards.

1033
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:27,575
But still, I'll hang with you briefly.

1034
01:05:28,743 --> 01:05:30,203
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1035
01:05:30,703 --> 01:05:31,829
What's that?

1036
01:05:32,538 --> 01:05:33,831
Varignon P2, ma'am.

1037
01:05:33,915 --> 01:05:35,499
You'll enjoy its creamy texture.

1038
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,883
This is way too fancy that it's tacky.

1039
01:05:43,966 --> 01:05:46,219
She's still a kid.
She probably wants to show off.

1040
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:15,790
Sa-rang, one sec. Sorry.

1041
01:06:15,873 --> 01:06:17,333
Please hold this. I got a call.

1042
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,835
I'm sorry. You can follow him.

1043
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:21,379
- Sorry, I have to take this.
- Sure.

1044
01:06:22,755 --> 01:06:24,298
- Hello?
- These are my friends.

1045
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:27,885
Won!

1046
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:33,599
Won, have you been well? Did you miss me?

1047
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:36,519
You've been well, right?

1048
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:39,355
How can I do well without you?

1049
01:06:39,438 --> 01:06:43,025
You seem to enjoy your life,
drinking and partying every night.

1050
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:46,237
Paparazzi are a huge problem these days.

1051
01:06:46,988 --> 01:06:47,905
Happy birthday.

1052
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:50,825
Just words?

1053
01:06:50,908 --> 01:06:52,326
No, one moment.

1054
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:56,515
Happy birthday.

1055
01:06:58,183 --> 01:06:59,435
Just words?

1056
01:06:59,518 --> 01:07:00,936
No, one moment.

1057
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,043
Where's Mr. No?

1058
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:11,545
He's taking a phone call.

1059
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:15,216
Is something wrong?

1060
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:19,428
No.

1061
01:07:20,096 --> 01:07:22,139
- Something seems wrong.
- Won.

1062
01:07:22,932 --> 01:07:24,100
What are you doing?

1063
01:07:29,272 --> 01:07:31,857
Oh my god! This is huge!

1064
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:33,067
What is this?

1065
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:35,236
Can I open this now?

1066
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:37,196
Sure.

1067
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,407
Give me a hand. How do I open this?

1068
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:44,704
It's so pretty!

1069
01:07:44,787 --> 01:07:48,791
How did you know? I really wanted this!

1070
01:07:48,874 --> 01:07:50,418
You asked me for it.

1071
01:07:50,918 --> 01:07:52,461
You're so considerate.

1072
01:07:53,754 --> 01:07:55,423
This party is getting annoying.

1073
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:58,134
- Should we leave and hang out alone?
- No.

1074
01:07:58,217 --> 01:07:59,510
Hang out with your friends.

1075
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:04,265
What are you looking at?
Concentrate on me.

1076
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:05,683
Excuse me!

1077
01:08:06,225 --> 01:08:07,226
Yes.

1078
01:08:07,727 --> 01:08:09,478
Please keep this for me.

1079
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:11,105
Yes, of course.

1080
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:13,232
- It's heavy. I'll pick it up later.
- No, sir.

1081
01:08:13,316 --> 01:08:14,608
I'll do it.

1082
01:08:14,692 --> 01:08:15,943
This is my job.

1083
01:08:34,754 --> 01:08:36,339
- Won.
- Yes?

1084
01:08:37,089 --> 01:08:39,258
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1085
01:08:40,843 --> 01:08:42,970
- Is the chairman well?
- Yes.

1086
01:08:43,054 --> 01:08:45,097
- What about Hwa-ran?
- She's doing well.

1087
01:08:45,181 --> 01:08:46,057
What about you?

1088
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,267
Are you receiving
business management training?

1089
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:49,769
I'm just working.

1090
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:52,396
You can't just work.

1091
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,065
You need to be named as the heir.

1092
01:08:55,941 --> 01:08:59,195
It's impossible for me
with three brothers and two sisters.

1093
01:08:59,278 --> 01:09:01,614
So you take over King Group
and give it to me.

1094
01:09:01,697 --> 01:09:02,740
What do you mean?

1095
01:09:02,823 --> 01:09:04,700
We're going to get married anyway.

1096
01:09:05,284 --> 01:09:07,745
Our dads are done talking.

1097
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:10,498
Then our dads can get married.

1098
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:12,917
Don't be like that.

1099
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,001
Yu-ri.

1100
01:09:15,086 --> 01:09:16,504
Don't date me.

1101
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:17,963
Date someone who likes you.

1102
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,549
Sure.

1103
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,093
I'll tell you when I start dating.

1104
01:09:22,176 --> 01:09:26,097
So you need to tell me first
when you begin to fool around.

1105
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,182
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

1106
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:29,809
Sa-rang.

1107
01:09:30,684 --> 01:09:32,186
- Yes?
- You should go home.

1108
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:33,896
You haven't eaten, and it's late.

1109
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,649
- I'm fine.
- Thank you for your help.

1110
01:09:36,732 --> 01:09:38,442
You'll get lots of overtime pay.

1111
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:40,653
Thank you.

1112
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:54,792
Sa-rang.

1113
01:09:55,626 --> 01:09:56,460
Going home?

1114
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,796
Yes.

1115
01:09:58,879 --> 01:10:01,090
Then will it be a date night?

1116
01:10:03,634 --> 01:10:05,177
Why would I go on a date with you?

1117
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,138
Me?

1118
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,057
Why are men like this?

1119
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:14,145
Don't talk about dates
unless you really like someone!

1120
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:21,777
I was asking if she was
going on a date with someone.

1121
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:25,781
She got mad at me.

1122
01:10:27,783 --> 01:10:29,034
Why did she get mad?

1123
01:10:47,845 --> 01:10:49,013
Ta-da.

1124
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:51,015
Sweets are best for the blues.

1125
01:10:51,098 --> 01:10:53,100
What? I'm not feeling blue.

1126
01:10:53,184 --> 01:10:54,435
You are.

1127
01:10:54,518 --> 01:10:56,896
You look like you could cry any minute.

1128
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,782
This is so good.

1129
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,868
Premium cookies.

1130
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:13,496
Everyone said they were good,
so I got some for you two.

1131
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,709
It's so good.

1132
01:11:19,627 --> 01:11:21,420
Get another one on your next flight.

1133
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:23,214
- Cho-rong would love these.
- Yes.

1134
01:11:23,297 --> 01:11:24,548
I'm here.

1135
01:11:25,925 --> 01:11:27,468
What? Is this your payday?

1136
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:29,178
Cho-rong is with my mom.

1137
01:11:29,261 --> 01:11:31,764
Everything is on me tonight.
Order whatever you want!

1138
01:11:45,444 --> 01:11:46,529
What's wrong?

1139
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:47,863
I'm just thirsty.

1140
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:49,615
Tell us what it is.

1141
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:55,079
It's the word "date."

1142
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:57,915
Do men say that to just anybody?

1143
01:11:57,998 --> 01:11:59,375
A guest hit on you, right?

1144
01:12:00,543 --> 01:12:02,253
They just want to have one fun night.

1145
01:12:02,336 --> 01:12:04,505
I meet lots of men like that
on my flights.

1146
01:12:05,172 --> 01:12:07,925
And most guys who say that
usually have a girlfriend already.

1147
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:11,845
He gave me his number
while his girlfriend went to the toilet.

1148
01:12:12,471 --> 01:12:14,348
Yes, I think he has a girl.

1149
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,684
The ones who are dating
do that more often.

1150
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:18,185
What's more depressing

1151
01:12:18,269 --> 01:12:21,855
is that all I can do on the job
is smile and ignore them.

1152
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:24,483
If I say something,
he'll lodge a complaint against me.

1153
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:28,362
They do as they like
because they know we can't do a thing.

1154
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:31,490
When I smile,
they fuss about my smile being fake.

1155
01:12:31,574 --> 01:12:34,159
But if I stop,
they complain and say I look displeased.

1156
01:12:34,243 --> 01:12:36,745
Darn it. It's so easy to pick on us.

1157
01:12:37,371 --> 01:12:40,207
You're ruining my beer.
Let's stop talking about this.

1158
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,292
Okay.

1159
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:57,141
The silence makes me feel more down.

1160
01:13:01,353 --> 01:13:02,813
Let's listen to music.

1161
01:13:03,897 --> 01:13:05,774
"WA" BY LEE JUNG-HYUN

1162
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:38,766
"WA" BY LEE JUNG-HYUN

1163
01:13:41,393 --> 01:13:44,146
<i>I didn't want to believe it</i>

1164
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:46,815
<i>I didn't want to lose you</i>

1165
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:51,195
<i>What if our love takes a wrong turn</i>

1166
01:13:51,278 --> 01:13:53,864
<i>And ends here?</i>

1167
01:13:55,991 --> 01:14:00,120
<i>I was heartbroken, but I must play dumb</i>

1168
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:06,460
<i>- Because that will hurt less than goodbye
- Because that will hurt less than goodbye</i>

1169
01:14:26,313 --> 01:14:28,107
The door is open!

1170
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,820
Hey, pizza! Coming!

1171
01:14:35,823 --> 01:14:37,241
Pizza.

1172
01:14:41,662 --> 01:14:43,247
Hey, it's the pork trotters!

1173
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:44,707
Pork trotters!

1174
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,292
Pork trotters.

1175
01:14:47,376 --> 01:14:48,752
- Pork trotters!
- Pork trotters!

1176
01:14:53,757 --> 01:14:55,467
Yo, chicken!

1177
01:14:55,551 --> 01:14:57,219
<i>Look at me, look closely</i>

1178
01:14:57,302 --> 01:14:58,929
<i>Don't betray my love</i>

1179
01:14:59,012 --> 01:15:00,723
<i>Come on, come to me</i>

1180
01:15:00,806 --> 01:15:02,224
<i>This is the last time</i>

1181
01:15:02,307 --> 01:15:03,809
<i>Why would you leave?</i>

1182
01:15:03,892 --> 01:15:05,436
<i>Why would you abandon me?</i>

1183
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:07,938
<i>Stop nagging and come to me, chicken</i>

1184
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:09,565
<i>Come</i>

1185
01:15:30,919 --> 01:15:33,922
KING THE LAND

1186
01:16:07,498 --> 01:16:09,041
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Then why did you hug her?

1187
01:16:09,124 --> 01:16:11,376
Why did you hug her
when she's not even your girlfriend?

1188
01:16:13,879 --> 01:16:16,924
<i>You need to gain power
in order to protect your employees.</i>

1189
01:16:17,716 --> 01:16:18,550
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1190
01:16:19,384 --> 01:16:21,345
I'll bring the Arab prince to our hotel.

1191
01:16:22,304 --> 01:16:23,180
<i>Welcome.</i>

1192
01:16:24,807 --> 01:16:26,642
Why don't you ever think about me?

1193
01:16:28,727 --> 01:16:30,854
<i>I never said I don't think about you.</i>

1194
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:33,982
<i>So?</i>

1195
01:16:36,944 --> 01:16:38,987
Can you feel my sincerity?

1196
