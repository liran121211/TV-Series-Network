00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:57,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,891
Goodbye.

6
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,393
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

7
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,895
- Is this enough beer?
- I think so.

8
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,106
We can always get more. We make money.

9
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:07,900
Hello, sir.

10
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm sorry we're late, Mr. Yoo.

11
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,488
- Hello, Ms. Gang.
- Hello.

12
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,490
Thank you for coming at such short notice.

13
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:15,574
You're still in uniform.

14
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,119
We got your call at the airport
and came straight here.

15
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,203
Where's Sa-rang?

16
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,413
She won't pick up.

17
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:21,706
What about Mr. No?

18
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,999
He won't pick up either.

19
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,375
Let's call them in the car.

20
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,876
- Okay.
- Are we taking this?

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,795
- Let's go.
- You can sit in front.

22
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:29,755
- Goodness.
- I'll take that.

23
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,132
Thank you.

24
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,508
MR. NO

25
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,514
{\an8}<i>The person you have called is unavailable…</i>

26
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,641
{\an8}Mr. No is free today,
but he won't pick up.

27
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,768
{\an8}It'll be the four of us today.

28
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,687
{\an8}The Bangkok crew will get together soon.

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,188
{\an8}- Okay.
- Okay.

30
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:50,484
{\an8}But why won't the two of them pick up?

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,863
{\an8}Maybe they're hanging out
behind our backs.

32
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,741
{\an8}Have they finally become an item?

33
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:58,743
{\an8}Really?

34
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:00,995
{\an8}Gosh, he's amazing.

35
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:02,246
{\an8}I knew he had it in him.

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,956
{\an8}Have what? He's got nothing.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,750
{\an8}You say you're friends,
but you don't know anything.

38
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,834
{\an8}What do you mean?

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,295
{\an8}Things are already over between them.

40
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,629
What? Since when?

41
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,548
Were they ever together?

42
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,091
It ended before it began.

43
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,927
They went out by themselves
in Thailand, remember?

44
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,014
He asked her out on that day,
but I think he was turned down.

45
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:21,724
Really?

46
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:22,933
Did he tell you that?

47
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,686
How could I ask him?
It would only hurt him.

48
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,105
Yeah, it didn't seem like
things worked out.

49
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,649
I knew it would never work out.

50
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,151
I know Mr. Gu…

51
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,070
I mean, Mr. No very well.

52
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,906
It's not in him to date anyone.

53
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,950
I'd give him one-on-one lessons
on the best tips for dating,

54
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,327
but he couldn't keep up.

55
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,704
Basic skills are everything for dating.

56
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,165
Were you in lots of relationships?

57
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,083
Me?

58
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,087
Well, many women were into me.

59
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,089
But nobody ever asked me out.

60
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,965
I'm not that hard to figure out,

61
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,093
but they all feel like
I'm too good for them.

62
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,805
So are you saying
you've never dated anyone?

63
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,724
I'm telling you. I'm very popular.

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,019
But nobody can find a way to ask me out.

65
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:12,024
You can ask them out first.

66
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,526
No. Ladies first.

67
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,236
A gentleman's duty. Don't you know?

68
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,904
That's why you have no girlfriend.

69
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,240
May I have some snacks? That one.

70
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,283
- Here.
- Thanks a lot. Thank you.

71
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:25,037
Anyway, he must be heartbroken

72
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,039
to be turned down before they got to date.

73
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,583
I should grab a drink with him later.

74
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,210
Have some snacks too.

75
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,630
- Thank you.
- Do you want to see something funny?

76
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:36,799
Magic!

77
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,260
You're hilarious. I want one too.

78
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,469
Thank you.

79
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,729
- Did you paint the stairs yourselves?
- How did you know?

80
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,106
It didn't look professional.

81
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,150
Come on in.

82
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,484
- Okay.
- Welcome.

83
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,319
- What are these?
- What?

84
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,071
Why are there men's shoes?

85
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,578
EPISODE 12

86
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:51,665
What's going on, you two?

87
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,292
Since when?

88
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,544
It hasn't been that long.

89
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,047
You insisted that you two weren't dating.

90
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,006
Sorry.

91
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,592
Well, things happened.

92
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,093
Why weren't you honest with us?

93
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,470
Why did you fool us?

94
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:05,638
We weren't fooling you.

95
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,848
We just chose not to tell.

96
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,350
That's fooling us.

97
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:11,519
What's with the mood?

98
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,479
We should celebrate
instead of getting mad.

99
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,814
We're not mad. We're just in shock.

100
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,901
We used to share everything
without keeping any secrets.

101
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,778
That's why I'm telling you now.

102
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,073
Please go easy on us.

103
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,742
Put your cutesy act away.

104
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,619
How dare you try to get away with this?

105
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,164
Congratulations.
You two make a great couple.

106
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,207
Thank you.

107
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,416
You have great judgment.

108
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,836
Anyway, is there anything else
you've lied about?

109
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,381
We weren't trying to hide anything.

110
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,384
If you fool us once again,
the six of us will disband.

111
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,845
Even if you tell us later that you're
an illegitimate son of the chairman,

112
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,472
we aren't going to excuse you.

113
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,646
No.

114
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,985
I'll tell you everything honestly.

115
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,530
I'm actually not an illegitimate son
of the chairman.

116
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,200
Of course you aren't.

117
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,286
It was just an example.

118
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,328
I'm just a son.

119
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,830
I know. We're just daughters.

120
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,669
- Whose son?
- He's right.

121
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,880
He's the chairman's son.

122
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,601
Come on. That scared us.

123
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,228
How can you make up such a lie?

124
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,856
Our chairman's last name is Gu,
and yours is No.

125
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,733
You're right. Come on.

126
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,609
I almost fell for that.

127
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,237
Yes, the chairman's son
is the head manager, right?

128
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,739
I hear he's a jerk

129
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,407
who has a rotten personality.

130
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,075
That rude nepotism guy

131
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,162
and our Mr. No here
are on a completely different level.

132
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,164
I'm that rude, rotten nepotism guy.

133
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,667
I'm sorry for accidentally deceiving you.

134
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,628
I'm Gu Won, the head manager.

135
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,673
The guy who's staring at the wall
isn't Department Manager Yoo.

136
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,300
He's Manager No Sang-sik.

137
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,385
Sa-rang, is this true?

138
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,721
Let me make a formal introduction.

139
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:14,183
He's Head Manager Gu Won,

140
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,394
and that's Manager No Sang-sik.

141
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,523
I'm Manager No Sang-sik.

142
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Nice to meet you.

143
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,117
Are you serious? Wait.

144
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,453
Really? That's crazy.

145
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,501
Do you think that went all right?

146
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,128
Sure, I think so.

147
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,213
What a relief.

148
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,257
Mr. Gu.

149
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,093
The floor is quite cold.
Please sit on this.

150
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,387
- No, it's warm here.
- Please sit comfortably.

151
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,721
I'm very comfortable.

152
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,224
We don't have much to serve here.

153
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,309
A sitting cushion? Escort him to the sofa.

154
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,936
- Mr. Gu, please sit here.
- No.

155
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,021
I'm really comfortable here.

156
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,272
- I'm fine.
- Sit up here.

157
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,274
You're making us feel awkward.

158
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,943
That's enough.

159
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,195
We kept it a secret
because you'd feel awkward.

160
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,408
Of course it feels awkward.
He's the chairman's son.

161
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,992
It'd be weird if we were at ease.

162
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,369
This is even more awkward.

163
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,287
Please sit comfortably.

164
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,837
Why are you kneeling?

165
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,547
- Sit at ease.
- Please.

166
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,680
Well, Mr. Gu.

167
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,600
If I misbehaved in any way,

168
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,353
please show me your mercy.

169
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,397
No, you didn't misbehave in any way.

170
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,234
Da-eul, please treat me
as recklessly as you did before.

171
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,445
- It's easier for me.
- Oh my.

172
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,530
- Did I treat you recklessly?
- Yes.

173
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,824
No way, I wouldn't do that.

174
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:56,452
You did. You were absolutely reckless.

175
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,954
You tried to put him in his place
in Bangkok,

176
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,748
and even threatened him once.

177
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,958
I did? When did I do that?

178
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,126
"Mr. Exclamation Mark!"

179
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,879
"Back there."
Don't you remember saying that?

180
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,213
It's okay, really.

181
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,384
I know you were looking out for someone
just starting his career.

182
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,343
It's all right.

183
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,637
I'm so sorry.

184
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,514
I deserve to die.

185
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,683
I deserve to die!

186
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,143
I'm so sorry.

187
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,270
- I'm so sorry.
- What's with you?

188
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,730
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

189
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,190
You're going overboard.

190
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:28,901
Well,

191
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,986
Mr. Gu.

192
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:35,365
I'm so sorry,
but please excuse me for a moment.

193
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,742
- Where are you going?
- Me?

194
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,411
Over there.

195
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,498
Sure.

196
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,634
We need to talk.

197
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,594
We can talk here in peace.

198
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,763
Come on out.

199
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:58,806
Okay.

200
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,728
I mean,

201
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,690
why did you have to take things that far?

202
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,317
Why would you do that to your colleagues?

203
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,110
It's not like I have any power.

204
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,321
I also had to do as I was told.

205
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,200
Even so, you should've tipped us off.

206
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,536
How could you do that as a peer?

207
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,496
You know what it's like to be powerless.

208
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,250
And consider how I felt
when I couldn't call him Mr. Gu.

209
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,212
At the airport,
I was going to explain that I was Mr. No,

210
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,380
then I…

211
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,132
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:43,851
Here you go, sir.

213
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,729
You treated me like a friend
up until five minutes ago.

214
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,398
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:50,732
Why are you sorry?

216
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:56,196
I don't have any brothers
or close male friends,

217
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,950
so I'm not sure
if I'll make a good friend,

218
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,327
but I'll do my best.

219
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,412
Let's be good friends.

220
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:05,956
Okay, Won.

221
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,209
Pyeong-hwa, please treat me like a friend.

222
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,752
Please sit comfortably.

223
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,298
Yes, of course, Mr. Gu.

224
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,341
Would you like more beverages?

225
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,676
Please don't do this.

226
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,969
I'm not the head manager.

227
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,513
I'm Sa-rang's boyfriend.

228
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:26,727
Yes, Mr. Sa-rang's Boyfriend.

229
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,646
If I can help you in any way,

230
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,023
I'll help you no matter…

231
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,400
Would he ever need my help?

232
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,611
Staying quiet would help.

233
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,820
Stop blabbering.

234
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:39,615
Okay.

235
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,368
Anyway, let's overcome
this state of affairs wisely…

236
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,203
- What am I saying?
- Pyeong-hwa.

237
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:46,663
Yes.

238
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,875
Anyway, I'll go get Da-eul.

239
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,668
You can stay. I'll go.

240
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,836
Wait.

241
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,506
I'll take responsibility
for this state of affairs and bring her.

242
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,467
- Please sit.
- But still…

243
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,052
- I'll go.
- Please sit.

244
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,054
- Please sit comfortably.
- But…

245
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,432
Yes, Mr. Sa-rang's Boyfriend.

246
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,452
What are you doing?

247
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,874
How could this happen?

248
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,584
What do you mean?

249
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,294
You were never as popular as me.

250
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,962
How could you start dating first?

251
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,673
How does this make any sense?

252
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,550
I have

253
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,386
absolutely no idea.

254
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:43,929
No idea about what?

255
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,722
About what makes you think that.

256
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,434
And why didn't you tell me
you two were dating?

257
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,688
How could you hide it from me?

258
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,897
Goodness.

259
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,401
My gosh.

260
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,735
When did it start?

261
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,986
- No Sang-sik.
- Yes?

262
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,281
- You can cry.
- Okay.

263
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,742
You can cry. Was she really mad?

264
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,285
- Yes.
- You can cry.

265
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,414
Goodness.

266
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm sad we're not going to Dubai.

267
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:14,886
It's empty.

268
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,430
I'm sad it's empty.

269
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,435
What are you two talking about?

270
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,314
Are you mad because I didn't tell you?

271
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,275
No, we get it.

272
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,860
We can understand that much.

273
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:34,239
Then what? Are you worried about me?

274
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:35,573
That I might get hurt?

275
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,951
Why would you get hurt?

276
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,202
Is Mr. No that bad?

277
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,328
Mr. Gu.

278
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:43,706
Yes, right. Mr. Gu.

279
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,250
Is he the bad boy type?

280
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,043
No, he's far from it.

281
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,796
I wouldn't be dating him if he were.

282
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,090
Then why? Why would you get hurt?

283
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:55,760
Well, you know.

284
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:59,639
I thought you two might be worried
about the difference in status.

285
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:01,182
Hey.

286
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:02,559
People are all the same.

287
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,060
Difference in status? As if.

288
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,270
She's right.

289
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:07,105
There may be a difference,

290
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:08,773
but it's nothing before love.

291
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,943
Then what were you two
discussing so seriously?

292
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,823
We were having a serious discussion

293
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,992
that you may have made a rash decision.

294
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,079
It wasn't a rash decision.

295
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,373
I thought about it for a while.

296
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,542
He's a great guy.

297
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,506
What do you like about him?

298
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,512
He's someone I dreamed of.

299
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:44,142
He doesn't make me anxious
or disappointed.

300
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,312
And he's always by my side
when I need him.

301
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:51,441
He really showed up almost magically
whenever I was in trouble.

302
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,819
Mr. No is more lovey-dovey than he seems.

303
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:56,821
Mr. Gu.

304
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,157
Whatever. "Mr. No" has already stuck.

305
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,618
Anyway, he seems like a great guy.

306
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,369
Congrats.

307
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:07,790
I hope our Sa-rang will be
dearly loved in this relationship.

308
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:10,919
Thanks, guys.

309
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:14,589
Now, we have a reason

310
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,884
to party hard all night!

311
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,178
Sounds great!

312
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,305
Weren't we partying this whole time?

313
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,389
- No.
- What?

314
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:24,933
We haven't even gotten started.

315
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:27,435
- Let's party.
- All right. Time to get started.

316
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,857
<i>It's time to begin</i>

317
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,693
My gosh.

318
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,618
"King Hotel became the first Korean hotel
to win the World of Best Talent,

319
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,454
surpassing many major global hotels."

320
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:48,873
"King Hotel gave all the credit

321
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,167
to its staff
for 100 years of its history."

322
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,797
"They showcased the class
of the best hotel in Korea to the world."

323
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,633
The class of our hotel skyrocketed

324
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:01,010
because I stepped up
as our representative.

325
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,305
You represented us?

326
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,850
- Since when?
- I welcomed the guests.

327
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,604
The first person to greet people
is the representative of the hotel.

328
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:14,357
And I carried out that difficult task.

329
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,111
You're right.

330
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,698
You successfully carried out
such a difficult task.

331
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,367
Great job.

332
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,160
You're the best.

333
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:29,038
You say that with such a mad face.

334
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,666
You've done well too.

335
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,167
If you keep this up,

336
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:34,460
you'll be in charge soon.

337
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:36,087
Stop talking nonsense.

338
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,797
The situation has already turned.

339
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,675
Slowly take over the Hotel,
Air, and Distribution.

340
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:43,052
The world is now yours, Mr. Gu.

341
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,805
It doesn't matter
who the world belongs to.

342
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,682
Let's wonder if it's worth living in.

343
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,643
It'll be worth living in
if you take over the group.

344
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,981
I'll cover every step of your journey
with flowers from now on.

345
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,651
Put your trust in me.

346
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,917
Seriously.

347
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,378
That event was quite touching.

348
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,631
I began to think of our old days.
I almost choked up.

349
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,800
I got to see Mr. Gu in a different light.

350
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:28,181
I honestly thought he'd ruin this event,
but it was a great success.

351
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,267
We just saved a fortune on marketing.

352
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:35,730
Other global hotel chains
have requested the video of the event.

353
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:39,150
And <i>World Luxury Travel Guide</i>
also asked us for an interview.

354
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,528
You all sound very satisfied.

355
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:45,656
Yes, our staff is satisfied,
and their spirits have gone up too.

356
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:50,578
I must have overestimated all of you.

357
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,957
I can't believe you shed tears
at that overly sentimental show.

358
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,129
Who should I put my trust in

359
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,507
as I lead this company?

360
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,970
Preying on people's sentiments
can win praise easily.

361
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,765
But will it bring us any money?

362
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:15,728
How does this help us
overcome the management crisis

363
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:17,605
faced by the group?

364
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,359
Is now the time to manage
with our emotions?

365
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,946
Other groups are discussing
going into survival mode,

366
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,906
not just contingency plans.

367
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:28,991
I also spoke

368
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,577
to the chairman a few days ago.

369
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,913
That I cannot trust him.

370
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:37,750
Don't make me lose my trust in you too.

371
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,210
I won't drag this out.

372
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:43,881
Only those who will follow me
are to attend the meeting today.

373
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:54,016
I'd like to commend you
for the 100th-anniversary event.

374
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,603
Anniversaries were usually excuses
to invite people who could be useful to us

375
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:58,813
and to treat them.

376
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,857
But this time, it was truly our occasion.

377
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,775
Head Manager Gu, great work.

378
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:04,944
Don't mention it, sir.

379
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,404
It's all thanks to our staff.

380
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:09,282
Well, the event may have ended well,

381
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,492
but it's too early
to open the champagne, sir.

382
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:12,618
What do you mean?

383
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:13,911
As a group,

384
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:16,038
our sales, profits, and stock price

385
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,415
are stagnant.

386
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,502
Don't you think we're doing well
in this time of recession?

387
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:24,672
If you consider inflation
and the increase in interest rates,

388
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:28,551
I wouldn't say we're stagnant,
but retrogressing.

389
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,596
What do you think, Ms. Gu?

390
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,139
I agree.

391
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:35,600
Six groups among the top ten corporations

392
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,435
have entered contingency management.

393
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:40,396
We must declare the same
before it's too late

394
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,899
and restructure our group.

395
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,152
What about others?

396
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,866
It looks like you're all on the same page.

397
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,796
You came thoroughly prepared.

398
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,507
At least I should keep it together.

399
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,176
We're already late.

400
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,803
I don't think now's the time to do that.

401
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:17,517
Contingency management is all a show.

402
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,604
It's an official threat to the staff
that they must tighten their belts

403
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,481
because we're in a crisis.

404
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,733
Don't you know cutting costs
is the most effective way

405
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:28,069
to increase short-term profits?

406
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:28,986
I do.

407
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,947
And that it's a move we always use

408
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,657
to pile up money in our company account.

409
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,743
Do you all agree with Ms. Gu?

410
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:38,371
Is this normal?

411
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,458
Mr. Gu, as you already know,

412
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:46,587
cutting costs isn't the biggest issue
just for us, but for all corporations.

413
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:49,632
You all wish to make King Group
into a world-renowned company,

414
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,259
yet all you can talk about

415
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:53,177
is extorting our employees.

416
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:55,555
Luxury brands exist

417
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,391
because history lies within their value.

418
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,518
If we wish to become
a world-renowned company,

419
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:03,187
I believe we must be equipped
with a worthwhile history.

420
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:04,188
So…

421
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,524
do you wish to write the story

422
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,943
of chasing after short-time profits

423
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:10,778
by extorting the staff?

424
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,322
If we want to make history,
we must survive first.

425
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,241
The dead don't get to tell a story.

426
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:16,867
How will we live?

427
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,829
That's more important
than survival itself.

428
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,997
It's concerning

429
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,709
that you're in management
with that attitude.

430
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,086
Father.

431
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:28,796
If you can't decide, I will.

432
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,594
Is cutting costs the only way
of improving our business?

433
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,220
Yes.

434
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:42,518
Are you confident that we can do better
without cutting costs?

435
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,021
Yes, I am.

436
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,981
This is great news.

437
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,275
This means we're going to do well

438
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,527
whether we cut costs or not.

439
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:56,574
At the next meeting,

440
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:01,120
bring me reports on what you'll do
for the future of King Group.

441
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:03,205
You.

442
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:06,125
And you. Both of you.

443
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,211
Yes, sir.

444
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,648
The war has finally begun.

445
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,608
She has a million people on her side,

446
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:31,817
whereas you

447
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,361
only have me.

448
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:34,528
It's not just you.

449
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:36,405
It's you and me both.

450
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,409
Yes, you're right.

451
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,162
It's always been the two of us.

452
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,372
You're right.

453
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:45,998
What's with you?

454
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,666
Come on.

455
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,712
Mr. Gu,

456
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,923
please remember this.

457
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,509
That I'll always be by your side.

458
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,303
Even if we must face a million
or ten million foes, we'll be fine.

459
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:00,388
Because we are…

460
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,516
one.

461
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,144
I'd be better off alone.

462
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:10,106
You liar.

463
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,152
Today is my last flight.

464
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:17,696
I'll be working at headquarters
starting tomorrow.

465
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,157
I'll always remember
these beautiful flights

466
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:23,452
I shared with all of you.

467
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:26,539
Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Yoo.

468
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,919
I prepared this for you.

469
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:35,047
Gosh, you didn't have to.

470
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,968
Mi-na, you're the best.

471
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:45,391
Please take good care of our team,
Purser Hwang Mi-na.

472
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:48,185
I'll do my best, just as you taught me.

473
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:51,897
Thank you for your hard work.

474
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,191
Thank you so much for your service.

475
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:56,652
Thank you, everyone.

476
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:02,908
Hello?

477
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,120
Hey, did you see how my team
topped in-flight sales?

478
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,498
Yes, isn't it amazing?

479
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,710
I got promoted and got moved
to headquarters thanks to that.

480
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:13,836
Really?

481
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:17,756
Hey, one sec. I'll call you back.

482
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,052
What? Do you have something to say?

483
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:25,473
Don't you?

484
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:26,390
No.

485
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:28,642
At the very least,

486
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:32,813
you should have said sorry.

487
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,107
Why should I?

488
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,692
Do you even have to ask?

489
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,528
You weren't going to promote me
to purser anyway.

490
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:42,323
You took advantage of me
to increase sales.

491
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,992
You've been working long enough

492
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,328
to increase sales
without promotion at stake.

493
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:51,624
And you already know
it'll be tough for you to become a purser.

494
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,042
What?

495
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:59,340
Did you think
I didn't know about your divorce?

496
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:06,514
Everyone worries that divorce
could affect their performance reviews,

497
00:25:06,597 --> 00:25:07,681
so they hide it.

498
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:09,642
Sure, that's fine.

499
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,227
However,

500
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,021
at the very least,
you should know your place.

501
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,317
The only reason I'm not blowing this up
is because we're friends.

502
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,237
I hope you do well.

503
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,030
Good luck.

504
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,340
{\an8}REQUEST BY: OH PYEONG-HWA

505
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:43,425
{\an8}MARRIAGE CANCELLATION APPLICATION

506
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,468
{\an8}It's impossible.

507
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:46,011
Come on.

508
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:49,181
Her ex registered the marriage in secret
when she broke up with him.

509
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:51,934
But I can't help you
since it has been registered.

510
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,853
Why can't you help her?
This is total fraud!

511
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:55,854
That's the law.

512
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:58,399
You filled out the marriage form yourself.

513
00:25:58,482 --> 00:26:00,818
Well, he wanted to write it up as a joke

514
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,528
for our 100th-day anniversary.

515
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:05,364
You shouldn't have signed
such an important form.

516
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,909
Anyway, your marriage registration
cannot be canceled.

517
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,953
Then what am I going to do?

518
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,164
Well, you can file for annulment,

519
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:15,791
but that's basically impossible.

520
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,668
All you can do is file for divorce.

521
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,253
- Divorce?
- What?

522
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,297
They weren't even married.
What do you mean?

523
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,007
Please cancel this registration.

524
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,842
Please cancel it.

525
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,802
There's nothing more I can do for you.

526
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,179
You should go find an attorney.

527
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:33,976
What am I going to do?

528
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,730
Please help her this once.

529
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,189
- Just once.
- Please look over it.

530
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:41,025
She's too young to get a divorce.

531
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:43,068
- Come on.
- Please help me.

532
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,362
What am I going to do?

533
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:46,780
You'll now become a divorcée

534
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:48,574
because you weren't careful enough!

535
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,337
You were the one who invited me.

536
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,963
And it wasn't just an invitation.

537
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:06,216
I came by because
you begged me to make a speech.

538
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,135
But to be humiliated like that?

539
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:10,638
I didn't know things
would play out that way.

540
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,807
Who could have known if you didn't?

541
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:18,062
I couldn't face my subordinates
after the humiliation that day.

542
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,857
You never mind
what your subordinates think anyway.

543
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,361
I'll continue to make it up to you
for the mistake that day,

544
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:26,862
so please don't be upset.

545
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:35,788
This is the finest premium
<i>Jamón</i> 100% <i>Ibérico de Bellota</i>,

546
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,790
made from the top 5% of pigs in the world.

547
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:39,583
Hey.

548
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,629
Why do you keep serving food
on this side and that side?

549
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:46,090
It's very distracting
as you go back and forth.

550
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:48,926
I'm sorry, sir.

551
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,886
Which side would you prefer?

552
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,056
I just asked why you distracted me
by going back and forth.

553
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,266
How is an apology your answer?

554
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,310
Are you deaf?

555
00:27:58,394 --> 00:27:59,853
Don't you get it?

556
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:05,109
The serving ritual here at King the Land
follows the European royal families.

557
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:08,570
We serve wine and beverages on the right
and other dishes on the left.

558
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:10,989
If you find this inconvenient,

559
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:13,742
allow me to serve
from the side of your choice.

560
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:14,868
Oh my.

561
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:16,453
You really are something.

562
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:17,663
Very high and mighty.

563
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:21,750
All you had to say was sorry!

564
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,669
Are you trying to educate me?

565
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:25,379
Was that a lecture?

566
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,590
No, sir. I'm sorry.

567
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,467
Saying sorry won't cut it!

568
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:33,846
Ms. Gu, how come
your employees aren't trained?

569
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:38,016
Wasn't it enough
that I was humiliated by you?

570
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,185
Now I have to be belittled
by the likes of her?

571
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,522
Fire her!

572
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:47,609
If you don't, I'll never see you again.

573
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:53,282
Yes, ma'am?

574
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,743
Make sure everyone here is retrained.

575
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:56,744
And get rid of her.

576
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,747
- Sorry?
- Get rid of her.

577
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,875
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:06,336
Get rid of what?

579
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,838
Our staff aren't objects.

580
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:09,631
This isn't for you to meddle with.

581
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,133
I think it is.

582
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:13,594
Hello.

583
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,846
My name is Gu Won, head of King the Land.

584
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,890
Yes, and?

585
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:20,017
Sir.

586
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,770
Dining etiquette was formed

587
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:25,355
in the 19th century,
during Queen Victoria's reign.

588
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:27,816
It's what we usually call table manners.

589
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,695
A knife is a miniature version
of a dueling sword,

590
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,989
so the blade should be held

591
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,116
away from others.

592
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:41,413
Throwing a handkerchief means
you wish to fight the other.

593
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:44,291
So the napkin,
used here in place of a handkerchief,

594
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,126
should not be thrown.

595
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:50,172
Manners are unlike the law,
so it isn't compulsory to abide by them,

596
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,800
but it does display a person's worth.

597
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:56,595
Mr. Park, please show manners

598
00:29:57,387 --> 00:29:58,889
appropriate for your position.

599
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,105
You aren't a man who's built for business.

600
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,274
King Hotel

601
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:12,402
has made many grave mistakes against me.

602
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:14,696
Let's meet again another time.

603
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,408
This is too humiliating
before my subordinates!

604
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:19,368
Too humiliating!

605
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,288
Mr. Park.

606
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:27,543
How dare you do this to me
to protect a mere employee?

607
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,546
Don't you realize how important
Assemblyman Park is to us?

608
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,381
She's not a mere employee!
She's a valued member.

609
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:36,426
I'll protect my own people

610
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:39,138
as long as I'm in charge here.

611
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,644
Is she just an employee?

612
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,229
Not something more?

613
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:49,940
What do you mean?

614
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:52,192
Blood never lies, so just in case.

615
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,946
You deployed the helicopter to save her.

616
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:12,963
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

617
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,176
No, you've done well.

618
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,846
If something similar happens,

619
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:22,306
protect our staff first.

620
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,600
That's your duty as the manager.

621
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,517
Yes, sir.

622
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,144
Do that in every situation.

623
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,229
I'll take responsibility.

624
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,496
It was such a tough day.

625
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,208
Yes, let's wrap up and go home.

626
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,417
It wasn't easy.

627
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm sorry.

628
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:59,134
It wasn't your fault.

629
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,221
You can't deal with someone
who's trying to pick a fight.

630
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,431
Assemblyman Park is the worst.

631
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,808
He took it out on you
after Ms. Gu ticked him off.

632
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,436
But we were all saved thanks to Mr. Gu.

633
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,731
Remember how Mr. Park got drunk
and made a scene last time?

634
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,399
How could I forget?

635
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,401
We were all told to line up,

636
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:19,279
and he droned on for over an hour
about staff discipline.

637
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:21,907
It's that easy to pick on us.

638
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,533
Anyway, he's such an eyesore.

639
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:26,203
Don't even bring it up.
I don't even want to remember.

640
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:27,871
Hey, let's just call it a bad day

641
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,623
- and go out for a beer.
- Okay.

642
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:31,959
It was a bad day,
so let's chug it away with beer.

643
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,962
I'll wrap up here, so you can all go.

644
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:36,380
Aren't you coming?

645
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:39,675
I'm invited?

646
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,301
You're a part of our team.

647
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:42,886
Let's wrap up together and leave.

648
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,181
- Okay.
- Okay.

649
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,780
Sa-rang.

650
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:03,782
That Thai medicine you got me was great.

651
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:05,492
I've been in less pain.

652
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:07,452
I'm glad it was effective.

653
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:09,246
You're too nice.

654
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:11,623
If it were me,
I wouldn't have bought gifts.

655
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:12,582
Exactly.

656
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,209
We were quite mean to her.

657
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,587
Hey, it wasn't us. It was especially you.

658
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,298
What? So you're feigning innocence?

659
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:21,216
- You did it too.
- You were mean to her.

660
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,343
- That's enough.
- Seriously…

661
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:26,722
To be frank, I didn't like you.

662
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:30,434
We worked very hard to get here,

663
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:33,812
but you were promoted immediately
with one word from Chairman Gu.

664
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,106
But after spending time with you,

665
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:39,276
I realized you deserved to work here.

666
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,446
Thank you for being a competent worker.

667
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:45,866
Don't mention it.

668
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,244
You've always had a certain set of rules,

669
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:52,414
so I understood how odd it must've been
for me to suddenly join you.

670
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,417
That's why I worked very hard

671
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,586
to be worthy of this position.

672
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,213
You've done more than enough.
You're doing great.

673
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,215
Thank you.

674
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,884
Raise your glasses.

675
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,344
Okay.

676
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:08,096
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

677
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:18,774
Anyway, wasn't Mr. Gu
really amazing back then?

678
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:22,235
I never imagined
an executive would take our side.

679
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:23,236
Right?

680
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,865
We've always been told to beg
for forgiveness when guests got mad.

681
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,492
I was honestly surprised.

682
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:31,453
I can see something
like sincerity in Mr. Gu.

683
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,121
Did you check your bank accounts?

684
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,248
No, why?

685
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:38,543
We got a bonus for our 100th anniversary.
A million won each.

686
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,131
But we normally get vouchers
for the hotel or the buffet.

687
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,299
That was the norm,

688
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:48,678
but Mr. Gu sent out a survey
to see what we actually wanted.

689
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,722
Cash was the overwhelming first place,

690
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:52,933
so he gave it to us.

691
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:55,852
The hotel never gave us
something we really wanted.

692
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,689
I thought the survey was a show
just as it always had been.

693
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:00,607
Right?

694
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:04,528
The world changes
now that we have a new boss.

695
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:06,363
Let's all make a toast.

696
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,824
For Head Manager Gu Won!

697
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,076
- For Mr. Gu!
- For Mr. Gu!

698
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:16,039
Gosh, that's nice.

699
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,381
- It's pouring.
- It really is.

700
00:35:24,464 --> 00:35:25,590
Oh no.

701
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:26,967
There's the taxi.

702
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,343
- Bye, Sa-rang.
- Bye, Sa-rang.

703
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,678
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

704
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,763
I'm this way. See you tomorrow.

705
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:33,223
- Bye, Sa-rang.
- Goodbye.

706
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:34,307
How will you get home?

707
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,601
I'll take the bus.

708
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:37,686
We'll go too.

709
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,104
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

710
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,066
How did you find me?

711
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,776
It began to rain,

712
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,403
and I heard you were still here.

713
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,780
You should've called.

714
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:33,700
I couldn't ruin your fun
just for my own happiness.

715
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:36,161
Did you have fun?

716
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:38,205
Yes.

717
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,750
It felt like I was finally
accepted into the team.

718
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:42,751
It was great.

719
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,753
I'm sure they already accepted you.

720
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,255
It just took more time to break the wall

721
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,132
even after they decided to take you in.

722
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:51,009
I was grateful to everyone.

723
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,554
And I think they organized this dinner
because of me.

724
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,099
Anyway, are you okay?

725
00:36:59,226 --> 00:37:01,478
Ms. Gu looked really angry.

726
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,521
So what?

727
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:06,066
If the customer is king,
he should act like one too.

728
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:10,070
Our hotel is way too classy

729
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:13,323
to show courtesy
to someone as rude as him.

730
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:16,826
Shall we?

731
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:21,957
Here.

732
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,726
Did you see how quick I was?

733
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,698
Oh no.

734
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:07,752
What? What is it?

735
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:09,629
What is it? What's going on?

736
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:10,672
What? What now?

737
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,424
What? Why?

738
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:13,883
- What's going on?
- What?

739
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:17,012
I was just startled while watching TV.

740
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,934
Right.

741
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:31,359
So why did you come out half-dressed?

742
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,694
You surprised me.

743
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,072
Well, I thought…

744
00:38:36,906 --> 00:38:40,076
I heard you scream, so I rushed out.

745
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:44,789
I'll make tea.

746
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:46,833
You should dry yourself off first.

747
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:15,111
Buttons.

748
00:39:18,948 --> 00:39:20,033
Shirt off?

749
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:23,244
Fasten them.

750
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:28,375
You already saw everything.
Why are you acting so shy?

751
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:32,253
I didn't even see anything.

752
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,007
Go dry off. You'll catch a cold.

753
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:39,469
Why are you being so shy?

754
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:41,805
You're too cute.

755
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:45,433
I'm not.

756
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:49,896
I can't leave you alone

757
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,732
if you're this endearing.

758
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:57,570
It's your fault.

759
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,241
- Please relax and have some.
- Yes, ma'am.

760
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,242
Thank you.

761
00:40:46,536 --> 00:40:47,537
You must be wondering

762
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:50,081
why I called you.

763
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:52,292
Yes.

764
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,586
May I ask why?

765
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:56,337
I hear you're an ambitious man.

766
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:59,466
Career-wise? Yes, very much so.

767
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,010
That's why I work for Mr. Gu.

768
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,929
And I'm the only one
who can deal with that personality of his.

769
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:10,310
Mr. No, you're with me from now on.

770
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:16,733
Make sure you report
everything related to Mr. Gu to me.

771
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:23,114
Then…

772
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,950
what do you mean by everything?

773
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:26,910
Everything.

774
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:30,288
From his professional life
to his personal life.

775
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,792
Report everything back to me.
Do not leave anything out.

776
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,423
Let me have another sip of coffee.

777
00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:48,181
In that case,

778
00:41:49,057 --> 00:41:50,725
how high can I go

779
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:53,019
by helping you?

780
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:05,990
Hello.

781
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:21,965
- What are you doing?
- My gosh.

782
00:42:22,048 --> 00:42:23,967
Make some noise when you come in!

783
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:27,470
I have to go to a reunion,

784
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:30,306
so I came to find something I could wear.

785
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:32,851
What do you do with your paycheck?

786
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:36,271
Don't be so cheap and buy some clothes.

787
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,147
These are ancient. My gosh.

788
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:40,567
Why are you going through my closet?

789
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,111
Family is supposed to share.

790
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:45,405
Family is supposed to have some privacy.

791
00:42:45,488 --> 00:42:47,115
Mom, I'm hungry.

792
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,867
Auntie Da-eul will make something.

793
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,703
Da-eul, please make a snack for Tae-ri.

794
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:53,872
What?

795
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,128
- Here.
- You work at a duty-free shop.

796
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,463
They don't have to be name-brand,

797
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:05,008
but none of these are good enough.

798
00:43:07,093 --> 00:43:08,344
I'll just wear these.

799
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,847
- Bye Da-eul.
- What?

800
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,015
Hey, wait.

801
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:14,017
What about Tae-ri?
Aren't you going to take him?

802
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,435
You're here. Why should I?

803
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:18,229
I'll be late.
Don't wait, and put him to sleep.

804
00:43:18,313 --> 00:43:20,189
What? Bo-mi!

805
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:31,075
You're going to wake Tae-ri.

806
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,704
Bo-mi went too far this time.

807
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,290
You need to talk to her.

808
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:39,292
She snuck in here quietly

809
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,419
and took my clothes, shoes, and bag.

810
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,005
And the room was a mess too.

811
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,090
Hey, family is supposed to share.

812
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:47,592
Just share with her.

813
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,886
There are manners
between family members too.

814
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:52,221
Don't be so cold-hearted.

815
00:43:52,305 --> 00:43:53,681
It'll all come back to you.

816
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:54,724
"Cold-hearted"?

817
00:43:56,476 --> 00:43:58,478
Has she ever babysat Cho-rong before?

818
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:00,939
Or has she ever even bought her a toy?

819
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:04,442
Your parents never gave her
pocket money or bought clothes for her.

820
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,402
Why do you want so much from people?

821
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:08,863
You'll be punished.

822
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,115
Punished, my foot.

823
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,409
Tell her to do as much as I do.

824
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:15,161
"Tell her to do as much as I do."

825
00:44:15,244 --> 00:44:16,204
I want dinner.

826
00:44:17,372 --> 00:44:18,873
Do I owe you dinner?

827
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,959
You can cook for yourself.

828
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,506
Goodness.

829
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,466
My son, I'm home.

830
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:29,592
You're home.

831
00:44:29,676 --> 00:44:31,719
- Grandma!
- Hey.

832
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:33,179
Start cooking. I'm hungry.

833
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:35,807
We have beef, right?

834
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,933
Grill some of that.

835
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,936
And if we have mackerel,
grill some of that too.

836
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:42,480
I don't have an appetite these days.

837
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,234
Make some spicy soybean paste stew too.

838
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:49,362
Okay, coming right up.

839
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:50,697
Have you had dinner?

840
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:52,490
I'm starving.

841
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,584
Oh dear.

842
00:45:04,627 --> 00:45:06,754
Go lay in bed. The floor is cold.

843
00:45:07,547 --> 00:45:09,298
I can't be bothered.

844
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,676
I don't want to move an inch.

845
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:15,346
Don't you ever get married.

846
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,266
You always nagged me to get married.

847
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:21,436
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

848
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,855
Just date and enjoy your life.

849
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:26,482
You have no idea how precious it is

850
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:28,401
to have the freedom

851
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:32,029
to eat when you want,
to lie down when you want,

852
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,157
and to do nothing at all.

853
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:36,242
What's wrong?

854
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:45,585
I went and checked myself,

855
00:45:45,668 --> 00:45:47,295
but it wasn't in the room.

856
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:50,089
Could you please check one last time?

857
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,426
My daughter can't sleep without that doll.

858
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,011
I'm so sorry.

859
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:56,804
If we do end up finding it,

860
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:58,890
we'll call you immediately.

861
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:05,271
If it's all right with you,
may I look one more time?

862
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:08,941
If the room inspection team says
it's not there, then it's not there.

863
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:11,652
It could've been tucked away
in the sheets,

864
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,070
so I'll visit the linen room.

865
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:15,198
Will you really do that?

866
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:17,992
Yes, but it might take some time.

867
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,410
Is that all right?

868
00:46:19,494 --> 00:46:22,163
Yes, it's fine. We can wait.

869
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,917
What does the doll look like?

870
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,918
She's Jenny.

871
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:28,961
She's my friend.

872
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:30,922
Please find her for me.

873
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:32,590
She's a stuffed rabbit.

874
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:35,510
Yes, I'll try to find it
as quickly as possible.

875
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:11,420
Who's she?

876
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,923
She's from King the Land.

877
00:47:14,006 --> 00:47:16,676
She's looking for a doll
a girl lost in one of the rooms.

878
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:18,010
What about room inspection?

879
00:47:18,094 --> 00:47:19,804
They said they didn't see it,

880
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:22,390
but she's been at it for half an hour
trying to find it.

881
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,735
Excuse me.

882
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:40,658
Hello.

883
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,160
I was wondering who you were.

884
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:45,454
How are you going to find that here?

885
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:47,540
Room inspection searched for it,

886
00:47:47,623 --> 00:47:50,001
so tell her you'll call
if we find it later.

887
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:52,128
She said the doll is her dear friend.

888
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,046
Please let me look just once more.

889
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:05,975
Ms. Kim.

890
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,353
There was a question I wanted to ask.

891
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:13,107
Could you grant me your time
whenever you're free?

892
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:21,490
Sure.

893
00:48:22,617 --> 00:48:23,659
Thank you.

894
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,429
- Jenny!
- Ta-da.

895
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:52,063
Thank you.

896
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:53,064
Sure.

897
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:00,029
You must know that
you shouldn't make promises to guests.

898
00:49:00,112 --> 00:49:02,281
What if you can't find it
after saying you will?

899
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:03,824
How will you deal with that?

900
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,080
It seemed weirder to avoid looking at all.

901
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:11,499
I wasn't saying you were wrong.

902
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,418
It's just that I see hard workers

903
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:17,046
get in trouble more often than others.

904
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,425
It's not like anybody appreciates it.

905
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,053
But I know

906
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,722
if I gave my best or not.

907
00:49:29,558 --> 00:49:31,560
What did you want to ask me?

908
00:49:31,644 --> 00:49:32,603
Right.

909
00:49:33,896 --> 00:49:37,566
There's a staff member
who worked here a long time ago,

910
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:41,153
but her personnel record is gone,
and nobody seems to know her.

911
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:46,909
Her name is Han Mi-so.

912
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:54,959
You know her, right?

913
00:50:00,673 --> 00:50:02,842
She was my closest friend.

914
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:08,389
What was she like?

915
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,478
She was braver than anyone.

916
00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:16,731
Such a beautiful woman.

917
00:50:17,857 --> 00:50:19,608
She was a great person.

918
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:24,572
What a relief.

919
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:26,949
Did you hope she would be a great person?

920
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:30,786
Yes.

921
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,627
You seem like a great person too,
Ms. Cheon.

922
00:50:41,047 --> 00:50:42,131
Thank you.

923
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:03,402
My gosh.

924
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:04,612
Did I keep you waiting?

925
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,238
No.

926
00:51:07,907 --> 00:51:09,742
Did you run here? Where's your car?

927
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:12,536
There was too much traffic, so I ran.

928
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:14,288
You must be tired.

929
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,252
Is something going on? You look happy.

930
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:22,004
Of course I'm happy.

931
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:25,758
It's the first time you asked me out
and waited for me.

932
00:51:27,093 --> 00:51:28,636
- Is that so?
- That is so.

933
00:51:29,345 --> 00:51:31,305
I always waited for you.

934
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:35,059
I asked you out to dinner first

935
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:39,730
and suggested we go somewhere first.

936
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:44,568
That's why I'll ask you today.

937
00:51:45,194 --> 00:51:46,403
I want to go somewhere.

938
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,532
- Let's go.
- You won't ask where it is?

939
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:51,575
It doesn't matter where.

940
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,452
Where are you going?

941
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:56,205
To get my car.

942
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:58,374
I'll go with you.

943
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:11,470
Should I step on it?

944
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:13,097
Sounds great.

945
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,604
Did you want to see the sea?

946
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:03,314
No.

947
00:53:03,939 --> 00:53:05,399
I wanted to see my mom.

948
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,403
I came to the sea with Grandma

949
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,447
whenever I missed her.

950
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:16,785
It felt like my mom was there
at the end of the horizon.

951
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:21,457
It breaks my heart to think…

952
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:25,669
you came here with that heart.

953
00:53:26,879 --> 00:53:28,380
It's all in the past.

954
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:34,386
One day, that wind turbine
was suddenly installed there.

955
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:39,058
I was a young girl then,
so it looked like a huge pinwheel.

956
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:41,727
I thought it'd be big enough

957
00:53:42,603 --> 00:53:46,065
to fly me to where my mom was.

958
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:50,486
But it wasn't like
I could walk on the sea.

959
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:52,488
So I was about to turn around.

960
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:57,159
Then suddenly,
a trail appeared between the sea,

961
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,078
just like now.

962
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,001
It felt like my wish came true.

963
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,506
I couldn't actually meet my mom,

964
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,509
but after that day,

965
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:17,388
this trail forever became
the trail that leads to her.

966
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:23,602
Will you come with me?

967
00:54:28,649 --> 00:54:29,650
Yes.

968
00:54:54,675 --> 00:54:56,385
They say you can go anywhere

969
00:54:57,344 --> 00:54:58,846
if there's a trail in your heart.

970
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,759
Ms. Kim Ok-ja

971
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:39,470
who works in the linen room

972
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:41,555
was her old friend, and she gave it to me.

973
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:48,228
I heard she was a brave, beautiful woman.

974
00:55:50,439 --> 00:55:52,066
And she was a great person.

975
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:58,197
You should meet Ms. Kim
once we get back to Seoul.

976
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:07,206
I don't want you
to have any regrets like I do.

977
00:57:17,132 --> 00:57:19,093
{\an8}INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS

978
00:57:19,176 --> 00:57:21,929
UNCONTESTED DIVORCE FORM

979
00:57:22,012 --> 00:57:23,597
SIGNED: YOON SEONG-HUN

980
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:25,391
I told you to stop.

981
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:27,184
Avoiding it won't make it go away.

982
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,144
I never avoided it.

983
00:57:29,228 --> 00:57:30,813
It's just not worth my while.

984
00:57:32,189 --> 00:57:33,274
Go now.

985
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:34,441
I'm busy.

986
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:36,652
Let's not turn this into a lawsuit.

987
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,196
The news won't do us good.

988
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,282
I said not now.

989
00:57:41,365 --> 00:57:42,783
Well, it has to be now for me.

990
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:44,410
Do you have to do this?

991
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:45,452
Please sign it.

992
00:57:55,379 --> 00:57:57,256
JI-HU

993
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:00,759
Mom's busy right now.

994
00:58:00,843 --> 00:58:02,094
I'll call you back.

995
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:04,388
What?

996
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:10,019
- Ji-hu.
- Mom!

997
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:11,729
Why did you come?

998
00:58:12,313 --> 00:58:13,939
Because I missed you so much.

999
00:58:14,857 --> 00:58:16,066
This is an important time.

1000
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,068
Why are you adding to this too?

1001
00:58:18,903 --> 00:58:21,280
At the very least,
can't you not worry me either?

1002
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:22,781
Is that so difficult?

1003
00:58:24,158 --> 00:58:25,200
I'm sorry.

1004
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:35,586
If you're sorry, go back.

1005
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,213
Go back and live your life.

1006
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:40,299
That's what you can do for me.

1007
00:58:40,966 --> 00:58:42,009
Okay.

1008
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,441
These look great.

1009
00:58:58,025 --> 00:59:00,653
My friend got these on her flight,
and they were delicious.

1010
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:02,863
I asked her for another one to share here.

1011
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:03,864
Try some.

1012
00:59:03,948 --> 00:59:06,075
You're so considerate. Thank you.

1013
00:59:10,537 --> 00:59:11,622
It's good.

1014
00:59:11,705 --> 00:59:14,333
Yes, it's not too sweet.
It should be perfect with coffee.

1015
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,626
Right?

1016
00:59:18,462 --> 00:59:19,672
Take a seat.

1017
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:23,133
Sa-rang.

1018
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:25,636
Have you heard of the Dream Team?

1019
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,471
No, I've never heard of it.

1020
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,183
What's the highest position
a concierge can hold here

1021
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:32,559
that you know of?

1022
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:34,812
Us, King the Land.

1023
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:37,564
The Dream Team is above that.

1024
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:41,443
Really? What does that team do?

1025
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:43,904
That team carries out
Chairman Gu's personal events.

1026
00:59:43,988 --> 00:59:46,824
It's basically a fancy catering service
at his command.

1027
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:49,994
How do you always phrase it
to sound more vulgar?

1028
00:59:50,077 --> 00:59:52,121
Why? I'm right.

1029
00:59:52,204 --> 00:59:54,832
Only the best among the best are chosen.

1030
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,209
While most don't know such a team exists,

1031
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:59,837
for those in the know,
it's a dream to join.

1032
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,130
Hence, the Dream Team.

1033
01:00:02,464 --> 01:00:04,466
He has an event this weekend,

1034
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,260
and his secretary called

1035
01:00:06,343 --> 01:00:07,469
asking you to join.

1036
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:10,639
Hey, Sa-rang.

1037
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:12,516
It's your debut in the Dream Team.

1038
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:15,019
You're a big shot now, Sa-rang. Congrats.

1039
01:00:15,728 --> 01:00:16,812
Thank you.

1040
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:19,982
I'm still not sure what this is,

1041
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:21,984
but I'll do my best not to be a nuisance.

1042
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:24,194
- Congrats.
- I'm happy for you.

1043
01:00:40,544 --> 01:00:42,129
Where are we going?

1044
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:45,215
Are you Cheon Sa-rang?

1045
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:46,341
Your first time?

1046
01:00:46,925 --> 01:00:47,801
Yes, ma'am.

1047
01:00:48,552 --> 01:00:51,388
I'm with the secretary's office,
the manager of the Dream Team.

1048
01:00:52,097 --> 01:00:53,724
You must abide by your NDA.

1049
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:56,685
Don't ask questions or get curious.

1050
01:00:57,311 --> 01:00:58,437
Let's keep it classy.

1051
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:00,731
Yes, ma'am.

1052
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:14,078
The aprons look insane, right?

1053
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,039
I'm afraid I might get
a kimchi stain on it.

1054
01:01:17,915 --> 01:01:20,000
I'd be grateful if it got splashed on me.

1055
01:01:20,084 --> 01:01:22,086
What if it splashed to the chairman?

1056
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:24,505
The thought alone is terrifying.

1057
01:01:27,674 --> 01:01:29,551
It does look quite classy,

1058
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,680
but it somehow reminds me
of a maid's attire.

1059
01:01:34,473 --> 01:01:36,517
Dresses won't turn us into princesses.

1060
01:01:37,351 --> 01:01:40,395
Let's be grateful
that we get to put on expensive aprons.

1061
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:01,542
Do you know why we're the Dream Team?

1062
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:02,751
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1063
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:07,339
The Dream Team
has never made a mistake in our service.

1064
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:09,758
And of course,
that will also be the case today.

1065
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:11,385
Keep your faces classy

1066
01:02:11,468 --> 01:02:12,970
and your acts elegant.

1067
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:15,806
We create our own dignity.

1068
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:18,725
Now, let us get started.

1069
01:02:19,476 --> 01:02:20,602
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1070
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:29,736
We're in a war,
so you either eat or get eaten.

1071
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,280
We have no time to look away.

1072
01:02:31,363 --> 01:02:33,031
Stop talking nonsense.

1073
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:34,950
Do you want to make a bet

1074
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:36,952
and see if this is nonsense or not?

1075
01:02:37,035 --> 01:02:38,203
Goodness.

1076
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,163
Dad.

1077
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:44,710
Oh.

1078
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:48,714
Let us serve the meal.

1079
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:49,923
Yes, sure.

1080
01:03:20,162 --> 01:03:21,914
It's Ms. Best Talent.

1081
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:23,207
It's been a while.

1082
01:03:26,084 --> 01:03:28,545
Hello, have you been well, sir?

1083
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,965
If she's titled the Best Talent,

1084
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:34,134
she must be very talented.

1085
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:37,804
Not at all.

1086
01:03:38,388 --> 01:03:39,973
He's just being generous.

1087
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:43,560
Then let us serve the soup first.

1088
01:03:43,644 --> 01:03:44,686
Yes.

1089
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,731
It's already been decided,
so there's no need to drag this out.

1090
01:03:47,814 --> 01:03:49,399
Won, now that your position is settled,

1091
01:03:49,483 --> 01:03:51,818
marry Yu-ri within the year
before it's too late.

1092
01:04:18,428 --> 01:04:21,431
KING THE LAND

1093
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:57,259
{\an8}<i>The person you have called is unavailable…</i>

1094
01:04:57,759 --> 01:04:59,845
{\an8}I'll keep this short. End it.

1095
01:04:59,928 --> 01:05:01,722
{\an8}<i>It's going to be a head-to-head battle.</i>

1096
01:05:01,805 --> 01:05:04,433
{\an8}<i>Is there a reason
why you can't give up on the hotel?</i>

1097
01:05:06,727 --> 01:05:08,770
{\an8}<i>You will be on special duty.</i>

1098
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:11,481
{\an8}<i>You won't be working
in King the Land for the time being.</i>

1099
01:05:12,316 --> 01:05:14,693
{\an8}<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

1100
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:15,986
{\an8}<i>It's my problem.</i>

1101
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:17,988
{\an8}It's up to me to decide my future.
