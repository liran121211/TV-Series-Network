KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,235
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

5
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,052
Sir,

6
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:28,554
is there something wrong?

7
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:52,995
It's been a while,

8
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,205
hasn't it?

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,418
How have you been?

10
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,712
I don't think that's
an appropriate question

11
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:07,051
coming from someone
who knows full well how I was banished.

12
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,970
Don't tell me

13
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:11,430
you expected me to be happy

14
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,433
after losing my son

15
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,061
and vanishing without a trace?

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,481
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,860
I had no power back then.

18
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:25,903
No.

19
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:28,072
Even if it were now,

20
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,575
you would've chosen the company.

21
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,119
That…

22
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,207
is who you are.

23
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:46,590
It must be a family tradition.

24
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,218
You got rid of her

25
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,179
while Won was on a business trip.

26
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,390
Like me.

27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,227
If only you hadn't formed a union,

28
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,854
that wouldn't have happened.

29
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:03,107
The president's wife

30
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,235
incited the employees
to rebel against the company.

31
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,612
How was my father supposed to accept you?

32
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,906
It was you who broke our promise.

33
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,577
You cowardly turned your back
on everything we dreamed of together.

34
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,954
It was to protect everyone.

35
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,544
You chose the easiest thing to abandon,

36
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,130
and that was me.

37
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,803
There was only one reason why

38
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,305
I left quietly.

39
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,432
It was for Won.

40
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:42,062
Your father took that young child hostage

41
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,981
to threaten me.

42
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,607
He said he'd protect Won

43
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,902
if I disappeared.

44
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:53,490
That is why I lived as if I didn't exist.

45
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,702
Like I was never even born
in the first place.

46
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,622
I've…

47
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:03,876
always felt sorry about that.

48
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,545
I'm not here to receive an apology.

49
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,215
I'm here to warn you.

50
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:16,763
Don't drive Won into a corner anymore.

51
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,475
If you continue to do so,

52
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:21,935
I'll no longer sit back and watch.

53
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:26,064
I…

54
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:33,197
never got to live my own life.

55
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,826
Did you…

56
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:43,916
get to live your own life?

57
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:57,596
Please let Won live his life
the way he wants to.

58
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,141
Let him live for himself

59
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:04,853
rather than for the company or the family.

60
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,816
That's what you should do as his parent.

61
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,116
Leading him in the right direction
is also what I should do.

62
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,080
Although he'll make his own decisions.

63
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,125
It's a relief

64
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,712
to hear that you'll let him decide.

65
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,382
I'll be leaving.

66
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:39,263
You're not going to show up
in front of Won, are you?

67
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,183
That's up to me.

68
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,143
He's doing fine right now.

69
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,479
Don't confuse him.

70
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,818
Those threats don't work on me now.

71
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:20,012
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

72
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,442
Won.

73
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:28,747
Won.

74
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,932
<i>I'll do it for you.</i>

75
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:48,850
This…

76
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,019
is a pocket watch.

77
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,938
Don't lose it no matter what.

78
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:54,523
Okay.

79
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,058
Won.

80
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,103
It's me, Mom.

81
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,231
Do you…

82
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,651
remember me?

83
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,114
What brings you here?

84
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,705
I came to apologize.

85
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,290
For what?

86
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,504
I was always afraid…

87
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,341
that I wouldn't be able to protect you.

88
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:46,927
This may sound like an excuse,

89
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,262
but I thought leaving

90
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,390
was the only way to protect you.

91
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,395
I heard about why you left.

92
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,232
Or sent away, to be exact.

93
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,402
The people of King Group

94
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:09,699
were too powerful for me to fight against.

95
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,662
I thought living
like I didn't exist in this world

96
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,958
would be what's best for you.

97
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,335
But…

98
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:23,213
I was wrong.

99
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:27,050
You grew up to be a wonderful person

100
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,553
even without

101
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,806
anyone's protection.

102
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:37,435
Back then,

103
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:42,399
you were but the same age as me.

104
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:47,237
It's an age in which
you're not quite an adult yet.

105
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,908
That's why I thought
you could've been scared.

106
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,620
I understand you a bit now.

107
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:56,788
So

108
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,457
don't feel guilty and be at ease.

109
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,300
You're even considerate enough

110
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,511
to say things that will ease my guilt.

111
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,181
You're all grown up.

112
00:11:16,224 --> 00:11:18,727
I'm not making things up
to put you at ease.

113
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,689
And I'm not trying hard to understand you.

114
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,317
It's just…

115
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:30,655
I now know how it feels
to want to protect…

116
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:34,409
something precious to you.

117
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,833
So from now on,
you should live for yourself.

118
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,753
Don't try to protect anyone

119
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,380
or hide because of me.

120
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,175
Live for yourself.

121
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,015
Don't…

122
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:00,810
forgive me.

123
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:03,647
Whatever the reason,

124
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,274
I left you alone

125
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:08,985
and…

126
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,531
made you suffer.

127
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:15,909
I never once resented you.

128
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,954
Although I don't have
many memories of you…

129
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,584
I could still feel

130
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,922
how much you loved me.

131
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:33,802
"She's not someone who would abandon me."

132
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:36,596
"She just had no other choice,

133
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,015
so she left momentarily."

134
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:43,269
That's the thought I held onto

135
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,106
to make it through those long years.

136
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,154
Thank you for not letting me down.

137
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,740
That's all I needed.

138
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:02,956
I'm sorry that all I have to say

139
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,458
is that…

140
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,838
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,053
Please excuse me.

142
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,639
Be well.

143
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:08,099
Mom, I love you.

144
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,476
Me too.

145
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,010
EPISODE 15

146
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,186
You've still got it.

147
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,398
Cotton pads and swabs
should always be filled to only 90%.

148
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,567
I still remember your instructions.

149
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,361
You're so smart.

150
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,531
I need to sit for a bit.

151
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,827
I didn't know
I would be working in a sauna.

152
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,580
This place is so tough.

153
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,082
It's a place of exile.

154
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,501
They sent us
because it's so understaffed here.

155
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,878
Ever since I first got here,

156
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:21,381
they didn't hire anyone
saying it'd close down soon,

157
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:23,174
but that was already five years ago.

158
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,009
Is this place closing down?

159
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:28,012
We keep losing guests,
and sales figures aren't that great.

160
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,848
The hotel is holding out
thanks to weddings,

161
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:33,101
1st-birthday parties,
and 70th-birthday parties,

162
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:34,435
but that's not enough.

163
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:40,358
If this place closes down,
us exiles won't have anywhere to go.

164
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:43,236
Everyone treats each other
like family here.

165
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,531
It would be a shame
if this place were to disappear.

166
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,200
That's why everyone is holding out.

167
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,411
They want to save the hotel.

168
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,292
Let's keep our heads up.

169
00:17:58,376 --> 00:17:59,419
We got this!

170
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,096
By the way,

171
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,849
how is everything going with Mr. Gu?

172
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,978
What do you mean?

173
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,730
Are you two still going strong?

174
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:21,858
You've been here for a while,
but he's never visited you.

175
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,695
That's why everyone keeps saying
you already broke up with each other.

176
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,907
He's just so busy.

177
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,629
Hello, Mr. Wang.

178
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,302
Why were you waiting for me?

179
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:51,304
Go ahead and eat.

180
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,598
Enjoy your meal, sir.

181
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:55,975
I already ate. It's way past lunchtime.

182
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:59,312
The reason why I asked
all of you to gather is…

183
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,777
Why don't you guys use your vacation days?

184
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,571
I told you I can't make payouts
even if you don't use them.

185
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:12,950
Make sure to use them all
by the end of June, okay?

186
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:15,078
It's not like we don't want to.

187
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,580
How are we supposed to rest
when we're so short-staffed?

188
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:19,957
I told you not to work hard.

189
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,294
If you have that much energy,
just find another job

190
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:26,047
because this hotel will be sold soon.

191
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:28,132
Has it been confirmed?

192
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,301
I'll be hearing good news soon.

193
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,930
So stop wasting your time

194
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:36,933
and just work on filling up your résumés.

195
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:43,773
Mr. Wang,

196
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,566
I know I may be out of line here,

197
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,404
but why don't we work together
to look for ways to save this hotel?

198
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:57,995
Why are you all so passionate
about this hotel that's about to go bust?

199
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,581
Everyone's sacrificing themselves

200
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,834
and doing their best
to protect this hotel.

201
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:04,544
If we all just--

202
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:07,130
You were kicked out of King Hotel, right?

203
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,509
I was reappointed here.

204
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:14,011
Reappointed, my foot.

205
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,014
You must be acting up
counting on a certain someone.

206
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,392
Get your act together.

207
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:22,520
Can you still not understand
after being banished?

208
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,148
Don't you understand it's over?

209
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:28,484
You should be embarrassed
and keep your head down.

210
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,613
It's not because I'm counting on anyone.

211
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,032
As an employee of King Tourist Hotel--

212
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,659
That's exactly my point.

213
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:39,120
You're an employee, so act like one.

214
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:42,290
How dare you talk back
to the head of the hotel?

215
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,127
I run this place.

216
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,754
I make the decisions. Got it?

217
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,102
How pretty.

218
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:31,107
<i>Sa-rang.</i>

219
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:36,904
<i>Can you check the outdoor speaker
to see if the music can be heard?</i>

220
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,198
All right.

221
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:49,458
TRUE RELAXATION BEGINS
WITH YOUR STAY AT KING TOURIST HOTEL

222
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:01,887
<i>Sa-rang, did you check?</i>

223
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:03,889
I can't hear anything.

224
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:41,654
I'm here to pick you up.

225
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:50,996
Did you have a good trip?

226
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:53,749
Yes.

227
00:24:57,002 --> 00:24:58,295
I'm sorry I'm late.

228
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:02,133
It was hard on your own, right?

229
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:12,143
What about work?

230
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,437
Did everything go well?

231
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:18,232
Yes, it did.

232
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:22,570
Let's go back now.

233
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:30,411
I work here now.

234
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:32,496
It doesn't matter.

235
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:34,957
You're mine.

236
00:25:44,216 --> 00:25:45,050
Hang on.

237
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,304
Yes, this is Cheon Sa-rang.

238
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:51,474
Right now?

239
00:25:58,689 --> 00:25:59,773
All right.

240
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:07,239
What now?

241
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:09,867
Go ahead.

242
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,784
I'll wait.

243
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:33,349
Do you want to go with me?

244
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,146
Anywhere with you.

245
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:48,531
Here.

246
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,036
- You know how to do it, right?
- Did you forget?

247
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,622
I never forget anything once I learn it.

248
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:57,706
Of course.

249
00:26:58,457 --> 00:27:01,377
Then can you set all the tables
starting from there?

250
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,420
I need to go to the kitchen.

251
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:06,882
My rate is expensive.

252
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:09,009
Will you be able to handle it?

253
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:17,351
After work, I'll recharge you
for the amount of time we were apart.

254
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,269
What do you think?

255
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:22,815
I'll get it done quickly.

256
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,362
Thanks.

257
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:37,663
Here we go.

258
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:47,214
Hey, you.

259
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,299
Over there.

260
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:51,343
Hey, tablecloth guy.

261
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:53,596
Come over here and grab this.

262
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:56,140
Yes, I'm talking to you.

263
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,142
Let's move quickly.

264
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,560
We're so busy right now.

265
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:01,979
Grab that end and align it with this end.

266
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:03,939
- Make it parallel.
- Me?

267
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:05,024
Then should I?

268
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:07,192
Quickly.

269
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,819
Stretch it out more.

270
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:10,279
Yes. Good.

271
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:12,573
Okay.

272
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,120
I did a good job.

273
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,291
But are the employees
in charge of this kind of stuff too?

274
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:24,001
Don't we usually hire agencies?

275
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,795
Doing this stuff on our own

276
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,756
gives us a competitive edge.

277
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,176
By the way,

278
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:34,094
have we met before?

279
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:36,889
No, it's my first time meeting you.

280
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,769
Then why do you look so familiar?

281
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:00,621
By any chance,

282
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,791
you're not Sa-rang's boyfriend
from King Hotel, are you?

283
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:10,923
What makes you think I'm not?

284
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:13,550
I am Sa-rang's boyfriend.

285
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:18,097
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a one-day part-timer.

286
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,099
I have committed a grave sin.

287
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:24,770
May I just ask you to do one thing?

288
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,814
Of course. It can be multiple things.

289
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:30,567
You spoke informally to me

290
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,195
from the get-go, right?

291
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:36,156
Even if someone works here for a day,

292
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,741
we're all colleagues.

293
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:39,868
Please respect everyone.

294
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,662
I couldn't agree with you more.

295
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:44,289
I will make sure
to keep that in mind, sir.

296
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:45,666
All right, then.

297
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:47,543
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

298
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:48,711
It's okay.

299
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:52,715
Sa-rang!

300
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:20,367
You're very experienced.

301
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,036
This is nothing.

302
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:24,455
Sit down. I'll do it.

303
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:26,665
No, I don't have time to rest.

304
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:29,334
After this, I have to put up signs
all over the hotel.

305
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:32,004
You just had to come on the busiest day.

306
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:34,965
It's a good thing
that I came on the busiest day

307
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:36,842
since I can be of help.

308
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:39,803
You're so reliable.

309
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,723
Okay. One, two, three.

310
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,299
Thank you.

311
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:22,721
It's so warm.

312
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:34,983
I met my mom.

313
00:31:38,737 --> 00:31:39,696
Really?

314
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:42,282
When? How did you meet her?

315
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:46,328
She came to me.

316
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:50,874
She seemed like a good person.

317
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,544
She was warm-hearted.

318
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:58,507
That's good to hear.

319
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:02,177
I knew she would be a good person.

320
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,602
To be honest,

321
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:13,105
I thought I had forgotten about her.

322
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,358
I thought I didn't miss her

323
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:20,154
and that I didn't need her anymore.

324
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:24,283
But after meeting her, I realized…

325
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:27,661
that I had never once…

326
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,415
forgotten about her.

327
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,398
I'm really sorry

328
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:58,233
that you had to come here.

329
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,955
It's been a while
since I greeted guests in the lobby

330
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:15,292
and worked in the sauna,
banquet hall, and linen room.

331
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:18,003
I've been super busy,

332
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:19,963
but I like it here.

333
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:23,634
It reminded me of the start of my career.

334
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,514
I really do like it here.

335
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,393
I don't see anything good
about this place.

336
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,020
Well,

337
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,356
that's what everyone says.

338
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,400
But they're just not looking hard enough.

339
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,404
There's a small forest behind the hotel.

340
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:46,865
It's been left in its natural state,

341
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:49,451
so it's beautiful and mysterious.

342
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:52,955
Just looking at it

343
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,208
makes me feel healed.

344
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:14,935
Hello.

345
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,353
- Were you exercising?
- Yes.

346
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:17,354
- I see.
- Goodbye.

347
00:34:17,437 --> 00:34:18,814
Be careful.

348
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:23,860
<i>I thought I needed to know the area well
in order to guide the guests,</i>

349
00:34:23,944 --> 00:34:25,612
<i>so I looked around on my day off.</i>

350
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,613
Thank you.

351
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:30,325
<i>And there were
a lot of hidden gem restaurants.</i>

352
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:33,370
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

353
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:37,040
<i>I only ordered one thing,</i>

354
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:39,459
<i>but they gave me
a bunch of other stuff to try.</i>

355
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,211
<i>I thought I was at a buffet.</i>

356
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:46,216
I FOUND A GREAT RESTAURANT!

357
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,635
LET'S COME HERE TOGETHER SOMETIME

358
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:00,981
Excuse me, Miss. Have a yogurt drink.

359
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:02,733
Thank you.

360
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:05,736
<i>The people here are so generous too.</i>

361
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:09,072
<i>A lot of them are family members
of the hotel staff,</i>

362
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:11,783
<i>so they give me drinks and ice cream</i>

363
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:13,243
<i>whenever they see me.</i>

364
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:16,079
- Don't flatter me.
- You should marry my grandson.

365
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:19,124
And especially

366
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,001
this spot.

367
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:31,428
Doesn't it look like
all the stars in the galaxy are here?

368
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:33,430
It's beautiful.

369
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:45,525
You're right.

370
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,987
So beautiful.

371
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,533
Right? They're different
from the stars in Seoul.

372
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,996
If you just pay a little attention,
you can see everything.

373
00:35:58,747 --> 00:35:59,998
It's such a shame.

374
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:06,463
But still, you should be in King the Land.

375
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:08,965
Let's go back now.

376
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:15,097
I'm sorry,

377
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,392
but I can't follow
the orders of my ex-boss.

378
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:21,144
What do you mean by ex-boss? That's harsh.

379
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,855
I came here as soon as I arrived in Korea.

380
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:25,774
It's my affiliation.

381
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:30,028
This is an official reappointment.

382
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,034
Let's go.

383
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:43,208
There are three banquets next week.

384
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:46,962
Let me finish those before I go back.

385
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:48,755
Why do you want to do that?

386
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:51,133
Because it's my responsibility.

387
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,218
I want to see to it myself.

388
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,139
Also, all the employees here

389
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,101
are working hard to protect this hotel.

390
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:04,688
I don't want to turn a blind eye
and run away by myself.

391
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:09,776
The employees are protecting the hotel?

392
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:15,031
I think this hotel
is going to be sold soon.

393
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:17,492
That's why everyone is troubled.

394
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:38,763
I hear your divorce story is out.

395
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:41,266
Let's go for a consolation drink.

396
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,685
Go away or I'll beat you up.

397
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:45,896
Your old feistiness is showing.

398
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:49,316
You know, your brusqueness is your charm.

399
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:52,777
Just swallow your worthless pride

400
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:53,904
and follow me.

401
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:57,199
Hey.

402
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:13,423
Why do I have to suffer
when you registered our marriage?

403
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:16,009
Live the rest of your life
in atonement, got it?

404
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:18,762
Try hitting on me one more time.

405
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:19,930
I'll tell your wife

406
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:23,350
how the father of her children
keeps begging me to get a drink with him.

407
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,983
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay, Mr. No?

408
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,068
Why you…

409
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,903
Has she gone mad?

410
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,533
Why would I hit on
a divorced woman like her?

411
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,034
Right?

412
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:42,827
Don't you agree?

413
00:38:44,663 --> 00:38:45,997
Captain No Byeong-gu.

414
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,170
I like Pyeong-hwa a lot.

415
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:54,798
So what?

416
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:57,008
So I'm telling you

417
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,886
to watch out.

418
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:03,014
If you ever mess with her again,

419
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:06,935
I will no longer sit back.

420
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,739
- Does it not hurt?
- Are you okay?

421
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,372
Pyeong-hwa.

422
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,050
Why do you keep avoiding me?

423
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,595
Can you just leave me alone?

424
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:44,889
I want to disappear
to a place no one else exists.

425
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:46,808
That's why I can't.

426
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,436
It feels like if I do,

427
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:52,772
you'll really fly somewhere far away.

428
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:56,568
Let's go.

429
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,742
Why aren't you asking me anything?

430
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:52,457
Do I have to?

431
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,669
Everyone's curious.

432
00:40:57,295 --> 00:40:58,630
It's in the past.

433
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:02,300
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested
in the Pyeong-hwa of the past.

434
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:05,136
I like who you are right now.

435
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,892
I have no hope.

436
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:14,145
I deceived everyone.

437
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:15,563
You didn't deceive us.

438
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,941
You just didn't reveal a painful memory.

439
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,735
Everyone has a side of themselves

440
00:41:21,444 --> 00:41:23,238
that they don't want others to see.

441
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,708
Rain falls on everyone.

442
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,710
It's just that some
get wetter than others.

443
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:42,465
But eventually, the rain stops.

444
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:54,310
I'll be your umbrella.

445
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:01,461
- It looks good.
- Right? It was really good.

446
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:04,923
When I came by myself,
there was a huge line out there.

447
00:43:05,006 --> 00:43:06,508
Here's the potato pancake.

448
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:08,468
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

449
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:11,346
- Thank you.
- I sent you a picture last time.

450
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:12,639
This place is good,

451
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:15,016
and there are
many other good restaurants here.

452
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,227
Let's go somewhere else next time.

453
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,443
- Hello.
- What a lovely couple.

454
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:29,322
She came here by herself last time.

455
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:30,615
But she's not alone today.

456
00:43:30,698 --> 00:43:32,534
- I'm her boyfriend.
- I see.

457
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:34,744
I couldn't let her be by herself.

458
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:37,121
You two are a perfect match.

459
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:38,331
Don't we look good together?

460
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,916
Yes, you both have clear skin.

461
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,125
You…

462
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,776
This is how much I respect you.
Please enjoy.

463
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,152
I could've gotten my own food.

464
00:44:23,236 --> 00:44:25,947
I wish you all the best
from the bottom of my heart.

465
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,826
I'll be fine thanks to your wishes.
Please sit.

466
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,035
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

467
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:34,706
Help yourselves. Thank you.

468
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:35,957
Thank you.

469
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,208
Thank you.

470
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,626
By the way,

471
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,630
may I ask if you're here because of <i>that</i>?

472
00:44:44,173 --> 00:44:45,008
What do you mean?

473
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:46,801
Goodness, Mr. Gu!

474
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,263
Salute.

475
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,099
I heard you were here,

476
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,351
but I thought you would've already left.

477
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,855
You must like fishing.

478
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:01,274
Well of course.

479
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:04,027
Anglers like me
even only watch fishing shows.

480
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,446
You went fishing during working hours.

481
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:09,449
Because it's part of my job.

482
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:12,577
I went with the city's head
of urban planning development.

483
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:15,538
We discussed
whether we could use this land

484
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:18,708
for the city's cultural center
after demolishing the hotel.

485
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:24,797
So you went to a fishery
to sell the hotel?

486
00:45:24,881 --> 00:45:26,758
You think that's all?

487
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:29,761
I also go to golf courses, saunas,

488
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:32,221
restaurants, and whatever else
you can think of.

489
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:37,101
Rather than trying to sell the hotel,

490
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:40,313
do you do anything to improve the hotel?

491
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,068
I don't think you understand
the situation here, sir.

492
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:47,612
This neighborhood is dead.

493
00:45:47,695 --> 00:45:49,530
The tourist attractions closed ages ago.

494
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:51,866
There's no hope left for this place.

495
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,536
It's better to just sell the hotel
before its value drops even more.

496
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:57,538
But in the countryside,

497
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,916
only city hall can handle
land of this size.

498
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:03,169
That is why I'm working so hard.

499
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:04,879
I see.

500
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:07,256
Disposal is probably the easiest option.

501
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,884
But the head of the hotel
shouldn't do that.

502
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,845
You're not only responsible for the hotel

503
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:15,932
but also the future of your employees.

504
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:18,643
Jeez.

505
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:20,853
Okay.

506
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,648
Let's say I'm doing something wrong.

507
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:27,777
Even so, I don't think
you have any right to get involved.

508
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,447
This place is a subsidiary
of King Distribution, not King Hotel.

509
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,617
Ms. Gu ordered me to sell the hotel,

510
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,828
and I'm just working toward that goal.

511
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:38,621
You're right.

512
00:46:39,247 --> 00:46:41,707
They're separate companies,
so I can't tell you what to do.

513
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:43,709
I mean,

514
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:45,294
since you're the chairman's son,

515
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:47,588
I guess you can boss me around…

516
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:54,762
but I'm just saying
I have no reason to follow your orders.

517
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,607
I'll buy this hotel.

518
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:10,361
- Sorry?
- You said you were selling it.

519
00:47:11,404 --> 00:47:15,783
I will buy King Tourist Hotel
at your desired price.

520
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:19,579
Are…

521
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:22,540
Are you being serious?

522
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,585
I made this decision
after careful consideration.

523
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:30,464
Although I wasn't here for long,
I took a tour around this whole village.

524
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,008
Behind the hotel,

525
00:47:32,091 --> 00:47:34,844
there is a dense forest
that has been left untouched.

526
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:38,681
The sun, the wind,
and the smell of the forest.

527
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,183
You can become one with nature.

528
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:44,353
<i>Mountain fog fills the air at dawn,</i>

529
00:47:44,937 --> 00:47:47,398
<i>and countless stars
light up the sky at night.</i>

530
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,865
<i>I can make this a hotel that people visit</i>

531
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:59,911
to escape from their busy lives
and find perfect rest.

532
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,290
I mean…

533
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:09,587
This all may look special to you
because you're from Seoul.

534
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,714
But there's nothing special
about this area.

535
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:13,841
All you see are mountains and fields.

536
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,969
- This hotel has no competitive edge!
- Exactly.

537
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:20,181
We need to create it.

538
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,184
I'm thinking of starting
a forest therapy program

539
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,561
that includes yoga,
tea ceremonies, and meditation.

540
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:27,104
The rooms will be remodeled too.

541
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:29,565
We'll have rooms with floor heating,

542
00:48:29,649 --> 00:48:31,233
red clay rooms, and cypress rooms.

543
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:33,444
The annex that's in disuse

544
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:36,072
will be turned into a lounge
filled with music and books.

545
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:39,116
I am also thinking of creating a program

546
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,410
in which the village elders
can teach the guests

547
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:43,746
how to make traditional liquor
and crackers of this town.

548
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:44,747
If that happens,

549
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,209
our hotel itself
will become the best tourist attraction.

550
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:49,669
Well…

551
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:54,256
It could yield
a low or negative return on investment.

552
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,175
Didn't I tell you?

553
00:48:56,258 --> 00:48:57,969
Disposal is the easiest option.

554
00:48:58,594 --> 00:49:01,097
But since I've made the decision
to protect the hotel,

555
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,683
I'm not going to hold back
for fear of suffering a loss.

556
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,606
Congratulations on the sale.

557
00:49:11,524 --> 00:49:13,234
Since you've achieved your goal,

558
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,819
you may leave now.

559
00:49:21,242 --> 00:49:22,159
Eat.

560
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:23,911
Let's eat.

561
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:37,967
How tasty.

562
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,389
Thank you.

563
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:45,933
Everyone's so happy
because there's hope now.

564
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,019
You all deserve to have hope.

565
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:49,937
So does this hotel.

566
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:53,941
I…

567
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,152
want to create my own story.

568
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:58,529
I want to tell people

569
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:02,408
that I protected everything I wanted to
until the end.

570
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,790
I want to be as cool as you.

571
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,543
You're already so cool.

572
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:14,587
I wanted to be like you.

573
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:17,173
You rubbed off on me.

574
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:21,844
I was tinged with the most
magnificent color called Cheon Sa-rang.

575
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:30,227
Please excuse me for a moment.

576
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,939
Thank you.

577
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,112
Mr. Gu, thank you so much.

578
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:41,822
All of us will work really hard.

579
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:43,866
I look forward to working with you.

580
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:44,867
Me too.

581
00:50:46,786 --> 00:50:48,829
Speaking of which,

582
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:51,457
you're not going to
take Sa-rang back to Seoul, are you?

583
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,463
Of course I am.

584
00:50:58,047 --> 00:50:59,006
No, you can't.

585
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,301
You can't take our best employee away
while promising to revive the hotel!

586
00:51:02,384 --> 00:51:03,260
Respectfully,

587
00:51:03,803 --> 00:51:05,387
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang is mine.

588
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:07,848
Sa-rang was mine from the very beginning.

589
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,684
I was the first person
to show her the ropes and…

590
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,354
Tell him.

591
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,190
I'm the first person you met at the hotel.

592
00:51:17,483 --> 00:51:22,154
I can grant you everything else but this.

593
00:51:22,738 --> 00:51:25,950
The reason I even came here
was to take Sa-rang back with me.

594
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:27,993
I'm not going back on my own.

595
00:51:29,537 --> 00:51:30,371
Mr. Gu,

596
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:33,624
I think it's because
you're in your honeymoon phase,

597
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:36,961
but if you're always with each other,
you'll get sick of each other.

598
00:51:37,044 --> 00:51:40,339
In the long run,
long-distance relationships are the best.

599
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:41,924
You'll value each other more.

600
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:45,553
We value each other greatly
even though we see each other every day.

601
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,518
Sa-rang, why don't you decide?

602
00:51:52,601 --> 00:51:54,854
Are you going with him or staying here?

603
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:57,022
Why would you ask her that?

604
00:51:57,606 --> 00:51:59,233
She obviously wants to go with me.

605
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,651
Nothing is certain.

606
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:04,113
The choice is hers.

607
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,166
Fine.

608
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:18,502
I'll tell you.

609
00:52:28,262 --> 00:52:31,557
KING TOURIST HOTEL

610
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,600
Sang-sik,

611
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,602
shouldn't we let her know now?

612
00:52:35,561 --> 00:52:37,062
A surprise visit is the best.

613
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:38,606
We need to appear

614
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,567
out of nowhere
for her to be emotionally moved.

615
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,362
You're so clueless, Ro-un.
That's why you're not in a relationship.

616
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:46,947
Sorry?

617
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,449
But I <i>am</i> in a relationship.

618
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:50,492
You are? All of a sudden?

619
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,287
What a funny joke.

620
00:52:53,787 --> 00:52:54,747
I'm being serious.

621
00:52:55,664 --> 00:52:56,790
Congratulate me.

622
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,335
Really? Who are you dating?

623
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:03,130
An amazing woman.

624
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,634
- What? Who won you over?
- Really?

625
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:08,677
I wanted you to be Pyeong-hwa's boyfriend.

626
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:12,181
I know, right?

627
00:53:15,768 --> 00:53:16,769
What?

628
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:20,272
It just happened.

629
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:22,024
Oh my.

630
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:23,359
What in the world?

631
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:25,277
Congratulations! What a surprise.

632
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:27,071
Thank you.

633
00:53:27,613 --> 00:53:28,948
Really? This isn't a prank?

634
00:53:29,531 --> 00:53:30,783
You two are dating?

635
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:32,618
Is love that easy for you?

636
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:34,870
I thought you were popular.

637
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,081
I <i>am</i> popular.

638
00:53:37,164 --> 00:53:38,958
But nobody's bold enough to ask me out.

639
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,793
Are you sure you're popular?

640
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:43,879
Forget it. Let's go look for Sa-rang.

641
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:55,683
<i>Ms. Cheon Sa-rang works here, right?</i>

642
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,142
Can you call her for us?

643
00:53:57,226 --> 00:53:58,477
We're her friends.

644
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,062
- Well, the thing is--
- Wait!

645
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:02,982
Don't tell her we came. It's a surprise.

646
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,818
I'm sorry, but she's not here.

647
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:07,236
Where did she go?

648
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,571
She went to Seoul a few moments ago.

649
00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:10,698
Why?

650
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,658
For love, I suppose.

651
00:54:13,534 --> 00:54:16,328
But we came all the way here for <i>her.</i>

652
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:18,580
Is she really not here?

653
00:54:18,664 --> 00:54:19,873
No, she's not.

654
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:21,125
She really left?

655
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,918
We need to talk.

656
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:24,712
Really?

657
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:25,838
Thank you.

658
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:28,340
- Follow me.
- Have a great day.

659
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,056
This is why I said
we should've called her.

660
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,266
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

661
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:40,853
We all agreed to surprise her.
Isn't that right?

662
00:54:40,936 --> 00:54:42,104
- No.
- No.

663
00:54:42,187 --> 00:54:45,399
Who's the one who said
we were clueless about relationships

664
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,859
when we suggested we call her?

665
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,403
It was you.

666
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,613
Hey, Ro-un! How could you say that?

667
00:54:51,697 --> 00:54:53,365
We talked on the phone about how--

668
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:54,325
Whatever.

669
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:57,244
From now on, you have no say.

670
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,997
I'm going to be the leader
of the six siblings.

671
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,666
- I approve.
- Me too. I approve no matter what.

672
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:08,255
I approve as well.

673
00:55:12,426 --> 00:55:13,969
Since we came all the way here,

674
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:15,512
why don't we grab a bite to eat?

675
00:55:15,596 --> 00:55:18,140
The meal will be on you, Mr. No.

676
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:21,935
Me? But we pooled our money.

677
00:55:26,982 --> 00:55:28,817
I think I should pay. Yes, I want to.

678
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:32,154
Right! There's a cafeteria nearby.

679
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:34,239
They sell amazing stir-fried pork.

680
00:55:34,323 --> 00:55:36,033
What do you think of stir-fried pork?

681
00:55:36,742 --> 00:55:38,243
I'm the leader here.

682
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:40,037
All right, let's go.

683
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,414
We're going to get short ribs!

684
00:55:42,498 --> 00:55:44,166
- Short ribs?
- Let's get short ribs!

685
00:55:44,249 --> 00:55:45,959
- Short ribs.
- Short ribs.

686
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:48,670
We're getting short ribs.

687
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,306
- Hello, sir.
- Hello. Long time no see.

688
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,928
Congratulations on your inauguration, sir.

689
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,681
You don't need to do this from now on.

690
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,808
The chairman is waiting.

691
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:54,403
You want to take over King Tourist Hotel?

692
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,321
Yes.

693
00:56:57,364 --> 00:56:58,282
Are you confident?

694
00:56:58,365 --> 00:57:01,785
King Hotel is going to
rapidly rise as a global chain.

695
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:06,582
For that to happen,
we should have a strong domestic base.

696
00:57:06,665 --> 00:57:08,709
I'm not doing this because I'm confident.

697
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,544
I'm doing it because I have to.

698
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:14,047
You're the president of King Hotel now.

699
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,924
Give it your best shot.

700
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:18,385
Yes, sir.

701
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,152
Where are your questions?

702
00:57:35,235 --> 00:57:37,029
You probably have a lot to say.

703
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,201
Will anything change if I ask?

704
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:48,582
I don't care

705
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:50,793
what you think.

706
00:57:51,543 --> 00:57:53,545
Because that's what you want.

707
00:57:53,629 --> 00:57:54,588
And…

708
00:57:56,632 --> 00:57:58,383
I'm going to do what I want.

709
00:57:58,467 --> 00:57:59,468
Very well.

710
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,304
I did everything I could.

711
00:58:03,222 --> 00:58:04,848
The rest is up to you.

712
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:07,976
But remember, whether you succeed or fail,

713
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,604
you have to deal with it.

714
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:17,194
Okay.

715
00:58:21,573 --> 00:58:22,574
President Gu?

716
00:58:36,171 --> 00:58:38,090
Don't think it's all over.

717
00:58:38,173 --> 00:58:39,550
This is just the start.

718
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,719
I won't let you

719
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:45,264
take away a single thing.

720
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:46,431
I wasn't thinking of

721
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:49,351
taking anything from you.

722
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:50,894
Father wasn't either.

723
00:58:50,978 --> 00:58:52,896
It's not that you didn't think of it.

724
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,315
It's that you never dared to.

725
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:56,525
Get your facts straight.

726
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:59,027
I'm just trying to say
that I don't want us to fight.

727
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:02,656
We're family.

728
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:06,577
"Family"?

729
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:12,332
You and I are family?

730
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:15,002
I've never thought that.

731
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:17,838
Not even once.

732
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:54,207
What did you do?

733
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:56,209
It was you, right?

734
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,753
No one else could've done it.

735
00:59:59,755 --> 01:00:01,006
I gave her money

736
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:03,800
and she left on her own.

737
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,428
What you called love

738
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:08,805
was nothing much.

739
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:10,515
All it took

740
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:13,393
was some chump change.

741
01:00:19,024 --> 01:00:20,108
What cheap love.

742
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:28,909
That's why I warned you.

743
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:31,745
I told you I'd divorce you
at the right time

744
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:33,914
and that you should stay put.

745
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,625
This is why you can't be loved.

746
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:39,628
You act like you're distinguished,

747
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:42,255
but you're just a poor soul
who's hungry for love.

748
01:00:43,924 --> 01:00:45,175
So are you.

749
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:49,304
All the people you "loved" left you.

750
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,516
They're all fake.

751
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,019
If you still don't get it, keep trying.

752
01:00:56,979 --> 01:01:00,023
Try finding out
if love even exists in this world.

753
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:04,820
I feel…

754
01:01:07,114 --> 01:01:08,532
so bad for you.

755
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:47,070
Mom, don't cry.

756
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:49,656
I'll leave.

757
01:01:50,657 --> 01:01:53,118
I'll go back to the US, so stop crying.

758
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,413
I'm sorry.

759
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,970
I'll be the one to do as you say.

760
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:15,432
Don't cry, Mom.

761
01:02:46,088 --> 01:02:47,839
- Hello, Ms. Do.
- Hi.

762
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:49,633
Continue working.

763
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:55,138
After this month, fire the junior member.

764
01:02:55,222 --> 01:02:56,181
Sorry?

765
01:02:56,765 --> 01:02:58,809
You told us to reach the target
to maintain our staff,

766
01:02:58,892 --> 01:02:59,726
so we did.

767
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,145
The higher-ups want me
to give someone the boot.

768
01:03:02,229 --> 01:03:03,563
I have no choice.

769
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,945
- Does it only need to be one person?
- Yes.

770
01:03:10,028 --> 01:03:11,863
It's good that it's not two people.

771
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,366
Then…

772
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:18,495
may I pick out someone
who is truly unnecessary?

773
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:19,663
Of course.

774
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:21,623
Now you're talking.

775
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:23,625
In my opinion,

776
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:28,839
I think Alanga will thrive
as long as we don't have you.

777
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,259
- What?
- I saw your social media posts.

778
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,427
You enjoyed beef omakase with your family,

779
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,263
but you reported it as a team dinner.

780
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:39,349
Wait.

781
01:03:39,933 --> 01:03:42,519
Why do you have this?

782
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:44,938
You left it on top of the fax machine.

783
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,817
What's more,
you paid for a café date with your friends

784
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,569
with a corporate credit card.

785
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:52,154
The dates here match your posts.

786
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:54,489
That's wrong. Give it to me.

787
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,951
You even requested overtime pay.

788
01:03:59,286 --> 01:04:03,415
I was the one who worked overtime
inspecting the goods in the warehouse.

789
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:06,710
Why do I see your name
when you didn't even show up?

790
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:10,589
That's just because
I got the dates mixed up.

791
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:12,507
Everyone makes mistakes.

792
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:14,843
Do you have to nitpick?

793
01:04:14,926 --> 01:04:17,137
Don't try to just gloss over this.

794
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:20,849
You misappropriated company funds
for personal use,

795
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:22,642
regularly snuck out of work,

796
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,519
and even forged private documents.

797
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,606
These are serious offenses.

798
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:31,443
So please leave willingly.

799
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:37,866
How dare you threaten me
when you're just a contract worker?

800
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:41,912
I'm the one who reports
everything that happens here.

801
01:04:41,995 --> 01:04:43,538
Who will you report this to?

802
01:04:43,622 --> 01:04:45,665
Do you know someone at headquarters?

803
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:51,213
I wasn't going to say this,

804
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,382
but I'm friends with a director there.

805
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:56,426
We're super close.

806
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,679
People side with friends, not strangers.

807
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:02,140
Do whatever you want.

808
01:05:06,394 --> 01:05:07,354
Ms. Gang. Look.

809
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,361
Hello, I'm Do Ra-hee of King Distribution.

810
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:16,988
- It is an honor to meet you.
- Yes. Thank you.

811
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,033
What brings you here?

812
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,868
I had a meeting here, so I stopped by.

813
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,287
I heard about your wasted trip
to King Tourist Hotel.

814
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:25,205
Yes.

815
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,374
- Because of someone.
- I know.

816
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,792
Why did you trust him?

817
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:32,921
I also heard you earned the highest sales
in the country this month.

818
01:05:33,004 --> 01:05:34,673
You heard about that?

819
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:36,007
I told him.

820
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:38,677
Since you are the proud leader
of the six siblings.

821
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,886
"Six siblings"?

822
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,471
Yes, six siblings.

823
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:44,182
Mr. Gu, Ms. Gang,

824
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:47,310
me, and three other people

825
01:05:47,394 --> 01:05:50,146
are the six siblings
that are closer than family.

826
01:05:51,356 --> 01:05:52,440
"Family"?

827
01:05:58,363 --> 01:06:00,115
Could you please take these?

828
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:03,368
Mr. Gu bought these
for you to enjoy together.

829
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:06,496
Please take good care of Ms. Gang.

830
01:06:06,579 --> 01:06:08,456
Let me know if you need anything,

831
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,917
and call me right away
if there are any problems.

832
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,086
- Yes, I will.
- Keep up the good work.

833
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,212
See you next time.

834
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:15,630
Goodbye.

835
01:06:15,714 --> 01:06:16,756
You got this.

836
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,258
"Do you know someone?"

837
01:06:27,976 --> 01:06:28,810
He left.

838
01:06:28,893 --> 01:06:29,769
Did he?

839
01:06:36,276 --> 01:06:37,444
Ms. Gang.

840
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:40,405
I'm sorry for everything.

841
01:06:40,488 --> 01:06:43,241
If you had sincerely apologized even once,

842
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:44,993
I would've given you a chance.

843
01:06:45,076 --> 01:06:47,954
I'm going to make an official report.
Just follow HQ's decision.

844
01:06:49,748 --> 01:06:51,791
Welcome to Alanga!

845
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:54,210
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

846
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:57,047
What's wrong?

847
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:01,426
It's nothing.

848
01:07:01,509 --> 01:07:03,595
I told you I'm just here
because I missed you.

849
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:05,805
Did you two argue?

850
01:07:06,598 --> 01:07:07,891
There's no reason for us to.

851
01:07:08,475 --> 01:07:10,602
Then what's the matter?

852
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:12,103
Tell me.

853
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,022
Say something.

854
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,317
- Why you…
- Gosh! I'm sorry.

855
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,486
- What are you doing?
- Goodness.

856
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,489
That's why I told you to stay still!

857
01:07:23,448 --> 01:07:24,908
Are you not going to tell me?

858
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:27,786
Do you want to see me die of frustration?

859
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,387
Can I see something more special?

860
01:07:46,554 --> 01:07:48,765
All the items I've shown you
are limited editions

861
01:07:48,848 --> 01:07:52,143
crafted specially
by the brand's head designers.

862
01:07:55,688 --> 01:07:59,234
My girlfriend has a pretty smile.

863
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:05,740
I want her to smile brightly
when I present her with the ring.

864
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:07,283
Is there something that special?

865
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,537
Just one moment, please.

866
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,420
What do you think?

867
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:22,132
It is a design
that symbolizes unchanging love.

868
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:24,968
It is a symbol of eternal love

869
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:29,013
and also signifies
a celebration of a special moment.

870
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,519
"Eternal love"?

871
01:08:34,602 --> 01:08:35,562
Yes, sir.

872
01:08:40,275 --> 01:08:41,443
I'll go with this one.

873
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:38,750
Okay.

874
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:43,170
Isn't this the restaurant from back then?

875
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:45,631
That's right.

876
01:09:46,507 --> 01:09:48,592
We had our first meal together here.

877
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:50,886
Do you remember?

878
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:53,389
Of course. It was my birthday.

879
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,894
People will think we're a couple.

880
01:09:58,978 --> 01:10:00,396
No one will think that.

881
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:02,064
I could do so much better.

882
01:10:06,026 --> 01:10:07,278
Back then,

883
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:10,864
I never imagined
that we would end up like this.

884
01:10:13,784 --> 01:10:14,868
Did you?

885
01:10:14,952 --> 01:10:15,786
No.

886
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:17,538
Did you?

887
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:20,958
No comment.

888
01:10:24,878 --> 01:10:26,797
But we're the only ones here again.

889
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,717
Yes, you're right.

890
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,511
Anyway,

891
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,763
I'm glad we're here again.

892
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:36,599
Right?

893
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:38,642
Yes.

894
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,355
- Your food is ready.
- Okay.

895
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:46,984
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

896
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:08,380
Why do you keep checking your phone?
Is there a problem?

897
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:09,715
What?

898
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,342
No, there isn't.

899
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,052
Then what's wrong?

900
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:15,179
You look so anxious.

901
01:11:15,262 --> 01:11:16,555
What are you talking about?

902
01:11:17,389 --> 01:11:19,850
I don't know
the first thing about feeling anxious.

903
01:11:33,572 --> 01:11:35,908
<i>It'll start in three minutes.
Please get ready.</i>

904
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:38,369
DRONE OPERATOR

905
01:12:00,474 --> 01:12:01,308
Actually,

906
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:03,852
I have

907
01:12:05,062 --> 01:12:06,730
something important to say.

908
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:13,445
I also have something I want to say today.

909
01:12:14,405 --> 01:12:15,322
What is it?

910
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,951
- You can go first.
- No, go ahead.

911
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,036
What I want to say

912
01:12:22,454 --> 01:12:24,039
is really important.

913
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:53,610
I want to call it quits.

914
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:15,924
What do you mean?

915
01:13:20,554 --> 01:13:24,433
No matter how hard I think about it,
I just think this isn't it.

916
01:13:26,518 --> 01:13:28,604
I feel out of place.

917
01:13:40,324 --> 01:13:43,035
THE SHOW WILL BEGIN. YOU MAY NOW PROPOSE.

918
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,549
I'm done.

919
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,219
I want to leave.

920
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:54,898
KING THE LAND
