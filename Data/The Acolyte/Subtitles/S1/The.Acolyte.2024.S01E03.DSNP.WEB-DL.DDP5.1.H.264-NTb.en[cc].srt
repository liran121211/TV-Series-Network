00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:04,584
- Correct.
- That wasn't a...

365
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,543
Did someone tell you to fail this test?

366
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:16,251
Your family doesn't want
to be separated from you.

367
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:20,501
What do you want, Osha?

368
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:34,251
I was younger than you are
when the Jedi tested me.

369
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,876
I was only four.

370
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,793
- Really?
- [Sol] Yes.

371
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:44,459
But I knew I was different from my family.

372
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:48,293
The Jedi saw how special I was.

373
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,793
And I can see that in you, Osha.

374
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:58,543
I was very scared to leave my family.

375
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:01,751
But when I joined the Jedi,

376
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:06,168
I found out there were
many other children like me.

377
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:09,334
There are other children there?

378
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,251
Thousands like us.

379
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:19,668
But you must have the courage
to say what you want.

380
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,584
I want to be a Jedi.

381
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:38,251
Then you must have the courage
to tell the truth.

382
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,418
We should continue the test.

Mama, she promised she would fail
and she broke her promise.

388
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,084
I told the truth.

389
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:28,668
It was the right thing to do.

390
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:30,834
If only things were so simple, Osha.

391
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,418
I didn't want to lie.

392
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,334
You lied to me.

393
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,334
That man used his Jedi mind tricks on her.

394
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:37,626
No, he didn't.

395
00:29:38,418 --> 00:29:40,543
I told him I wanted to be a Jedi
because I do.

396
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:42,459
- You don't mean that.
- [young Osha] I do.

397
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,459
I want my own life.

398
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:46,793
I don't want to share with Mae.

Take a walk with Mother Koril. Now!

Listen to me.

Destiny is not decided for you
by an anonymous Force.

411
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:34,376
You get to make a choice, Osha.

If you want to pull the Thread,
then pull it.

I'll never see you again?

You won't.

415
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,209
Fear should not make this decision, Osha.

416
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:57,084
You should.

417
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,293
I want to be a Jedi, Mama.
