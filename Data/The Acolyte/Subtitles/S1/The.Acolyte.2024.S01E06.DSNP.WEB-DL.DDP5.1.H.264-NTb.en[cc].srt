They must have survived somehow.

367
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,833
What happened here?

368
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,792
What do you see?

369
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:52,917
An explosion.

370
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,250
Then, a battle.

371
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,583
One versus many. His power, extraordinary.

372
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,333
His skills, erratic.

373
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:04,375
-His sole aim was to leave no survivors.
-[wings rustling]

374
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,625
[lightsaber ignites]

375
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
[lightsaber retracts]

376
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:16,292
They were all killed by a lightsaber.
What does that tell you?

377
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,750
A powerful Jedi has fallen.

378
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:24,750
You don't think Master Sol
was responsible?

379
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,708
That is quite the accusation.

380
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,250
Who else would possess the power
to slay such a strong group?

381
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,750
Something to tip the scales.

382
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,542
But if he did this,
why would he send us a distress signal?

383
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,875
It's time to get back to the ship.

384
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,375
We should prepare these bodies for burial.

385
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,583
[breathes deeply]

386
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,292
[breathes heavily]

387
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,000
I have no intention of harming you, Mae.

388
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,417
Then let me go.

389
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,375
I will.

390
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,917
Believe me.

391
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,417
We have a lot to do.

392
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:40,000
We need to find your Master.

393
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,417
We need to save Osha.

394
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:48,667
But first, you and I are going to talk.

395
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,958
I've had sixteen years

396
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:59,292
to think about what I would say to you
if I ever got the opportunity.

397
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,167
So you're going to listen.

398
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,958
[♪ mysterious music playing]

399
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,083
[♪ foreboding music playing]

400
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,458
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

401
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,583
[Osha breathing heavily]
