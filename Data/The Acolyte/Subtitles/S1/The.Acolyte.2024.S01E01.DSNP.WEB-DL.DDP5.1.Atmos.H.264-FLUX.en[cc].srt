So how long have you been a meknek?

160
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,750
Since I left the Order. So... six years.

161
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,208
Dangerous job.

162
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,041
Mmm. It has its perks.

163
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,166
Look. I was trained to be a Jedi.

164
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:09,083
When that didn't pan out, those skills
aren't exactly, uh, transferable.

165
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,625
I needed a paycheck.

166
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,166
When did you join the Order?

167
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,791
When I was eight. Yord knows all of this.

168
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,916
A major concern about admitting you
to the Order was your age.

169
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,666
And the fact that you were mourning.

170
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,000
My circumstances were unique,
but the Jedi Council made their decision.

171
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,750
You lost your entire family.

172
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,250
Your mothers, your sister.

173
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,333
Your village, all died in the fire

174
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,125
before Master Sol
brought you into the Jedi.

175
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,041
Your training was difficult,
to say the least.

176
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:48,125
Attachments to those we have lost
are the most difficult to let go.

177
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,958
So, why are you here?

178
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,708
Last night, a Jedi was murdered on Ueda.

179
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,791
Who?

180
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,625
Master Indara.

181
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,541

182
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,625
You think that I killed her?

183
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,375
Where were you last night?

184
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,958
On this freighter. In this room.

185
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,125
Why... Why would I kill Indara?

186
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:17,208
If I recall correctly,
Master Indara advised the Jedi Council

187
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,125
to discontinue your training
when you were...

188
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,666
Leaving the Jedi was the hardest thing
that I've ever done,

189
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,041
but it was my decision.

190
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,916
No one else's.

191
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,375
You really think I'm capable
of betraying the Order,

192
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,458
overpowering a Jedi Master,
and murdering her?

193
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,041
- [door opens]
- [barkeep] I'll know her when I see her.

194
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,333
That's her.

195
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,750
She killed the Jedi! And ruined my bar!

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,750
It doesn't matter what I think.

197
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,791
[Pip beeping]

198
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,875
Now that you've been identified,

199
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,625
a prison transport
will take you back to Coruscant.

200
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,000
You're making a mistake.

201
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,166
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

202
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,291
[ship roars]

203
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,833
[Jedi] Close your eyes.

204
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,583
Your eyes can deceive you.

205
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,333
We must not trust them.

206
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,416
Connect to the Force.

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,250
Have faith.

208
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,750
Think of diving into a great ocean.

209
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,041
Give yourselves over to its weight,

210
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:13,166
its stillness, its uncertainty.

211
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,291
- And tell me what comes into your mind.
- [door beeping]

212
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,000
[youngling] Balance.

213
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,375
Good.

214
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,708
Life.

215
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,166
[Jedi] Excellent.

216
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,666
I see fire.

217
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,333
It grows larger.

218
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,083
It consumes anything
that tries to stop it.

219
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,333
The Force is powerful.

220
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,250
Like fire or the ocean.

221
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,625
It is a power we must respect.

222
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,291
But that is a lesson for another day.

223
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,666
Time for lunch.

224
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,750
Master Vernestra.

225
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,375
Sol, my dear friend,

226
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,833
how lucky these younglings are
to have such a compassionate teacher.

227
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,958
I am the fortunate one.
To be taught by them.

228
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,375
I remember when you were that small.
You were so shy.

229
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,666
How can I be of service?

230
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,666
I come with news.

231
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,000
You and Master Indara were friends?

232
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,083
[Sol] Yes.

233
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,166
I was sad to hear
she came to a violent death.

234
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,291
We have a suspect in custody.

235
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:42,000
An old Padawan of yours... Osha Aniseya.

236
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,041
I see I have underestimated
your attachment to her.

237
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,083
Osha was...

238
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,541
She was a devoted Padawan.

239
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,250
I see no reason for her to kill Indara.

240
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,750
The evidence against her is strong.

241
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,333
Indara and I saved her
from a terrible fire on Brendok.

242
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,500
I remember.

243
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,416
She saw us as her protectors.

244
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,750
There must be some mistake.

245
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,416
If it were to become public

246
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,333
that a former Jedi
killed one of our own...

247
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,416
Our political enemies
could use it against us.

248
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,375
Discretion is important.

249
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,958
- Our justice swift. An example made.
- [Sol sighs]

250
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,916
Despite your feelings for this girl,
do I have your support in this endeavor?

251
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,833
Of course, Master Vernestra.

252
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,875

Is it hurting him?

262
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,833
No way! He's having a great time.

263
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,875
It does weird stuff to your brain.

264

Mm.

265
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,416
Is it true you killed a Jedi?

266
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,875
No.

Okay, uh, I applaud
everyone's enthusiasm here,

273
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,416
but that could kill us!

274
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,750
So you'd rather
leave your fate to the Jedi.

275
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,458
Yes, I have faith in the Jedi.

She is alive. I can feel it.

I'm afraid I cannot afford to lose you
to a field mission, Sol.

You're far too valuable here.

If she is guilty, it is my failure.

Let me take accountability.

367
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,583
A small team. Be discreet.

Thank you for allowing me

It's not what I would've planned
for your first mission.

I'm ready.

That may be so, but we need backup.

Sixteen years ago,

438
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,625
I was posted on her home planet, Brendok.

439
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,958
I was there when her sister started a fire

Yes. She had a twin.
