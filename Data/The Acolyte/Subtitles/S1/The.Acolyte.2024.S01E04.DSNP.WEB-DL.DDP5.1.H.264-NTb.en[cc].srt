00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:09,501
She was presumed dead 16 years ago.

She wants to kill four Jedi.

[Sol] Brendok.

00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:26,168
I was there when her sister started a fire

10
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:28,293
that killed her entire family.

11
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:29,459
I will stop them.

[Jecki] Osha.

You're not staying?

[Osha] I've done what I needed to do.

00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:21,751
- Thank you.
- For what?

41
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:25,959
For helping me find my sister.
Prove my innocence. Clear my name.

42
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,501
I was just doing my duty.

43

I may never have known for certain
Mae was alive.

44
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,501
And thanks to you,
I've seen her with my own eyes.

00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:36,918
Even if I failed to stop her.

46
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,584
I figured you'd stay
until we apprehended her.

47
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,668
I mean, you must be curious,
after all this time.

48
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,668
Mae is the Jedi's problem now.

49
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,209
And I'm not a Jedi.

50
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:52,876
Don't tell me you'll miss me.

You care about Mae.

You mourn the years lost
between the two of you.

54

No. I risked my life to help you.

Admit it. You need me.

You know, your sister being alive
doesn't change anything.

You need to kill the Wookiee.
You made a deal.

[Jedi 2] No idea.

[Holden] She is fast, but weak.

- Yet there is skill there.
- [Sol] Yes.

85
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,126
Someone has trained her.

86
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,209
But who?

87
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:29,459
She doesn't know her Master's identity.

88
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,251
But she fears him.

89
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,626
An apprentice
who doesn't know their Master?

90
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:36,043
It's absurd.

91
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,209
Could this be a splinter Order?

92
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:40,668
Or something worse?

This girl could become a major threat.

95
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,834
She is not disciplined.

96
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,751
Yet, she eluded you.

97
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,001
And she killed two Jedi Masters.

00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,751
[holoprojector beeping]

99
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,084
Yes, but Mae targeted these three...

00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:04,543
Four. Including you, Sol.

101
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:09,709
The four Jedi stationed on her home planet
when she was a child.

102
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,126
How odd.

103
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:16,543
She turns up all these years later,
trained by one of our own.

104
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:18,126
You think a Jedi taught her?

105
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,709
Even a hologram can tell me that.

106
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,668
We must alert the High Council.

107
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:25,001
The High Council would be obliged
to inform the Senate.

108
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:28,501
A scandal like this
would inspire fear and mistrust.

109
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,793
We should handle this ourselves.

110
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,918
We must learn who trained her.

111
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,751
Master Holden, extract Kelnacca
from his post on Khofar and intercept Mae.

112
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,959
[Holden] And if she doesn't
come peacefully?

113
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,918
[Vernestra] I'm not expecting it
to come to that.

[inhales sharply] Why didn't you
tell me about this?

118
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,668
- I did! As soon as I knew...
- No, Sol.

119
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:02,626
Sixteen years ago,

120
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,543
why didn't you tell me there was a chance
this poor girl survived?

121
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:09,126
If I thought there was,
of course I would have.

122
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,001
But I saw her fall.

123
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,668
No one could've survived that.

124
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,418
Let me be the one to bring her in.

125
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,376
Your personal connection with her
and her sister is not a benefit here.

126
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:27,459
Mae's objective is not solely her own.

127
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,543
You must know that.

128
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,918
I fear Mae is only a small part
of her Master's larger plan.

129
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,959
A plan that is difficult to see.

130
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,751
Some sort of shift.

131
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,501
Something to tip the scales.

132
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:50,168
If she resists arrest
and Holden neutralizes her...

133
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,376
It won't come to that.

134
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:54,376
Then her Master will truly be lost to us.

135
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:59,001
She will not surrender
without getting something in return.

136
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,084
Do we have something she wants?

137
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,834
[Qimir] How do you kill a Jedi
without a weapon?

138
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,501
It has to be some sort of test, right?

139
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:22,834
You engage unarmed, but can you
use their saber if you disarm them?

140
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:25,876
Or is that cheating?

141
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:29,918
I'm just curious how you're gonna
do it this time. You've failed so much.

142
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:33,418
I didn't fail.
I killed Indara and I killed Torbin.

143
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:35,709
But you killed them "your way."

144
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,293
You have to kill the Wookiee
without a weapon.

145
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,293
- Your Master wants you to...
- What kind of deal did you make with him?

146
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:43,543
I didn't. Uh, we didn't exactly.

147
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,876
I... I just owe him.

148
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,501
You know how he is, he collects people.

149
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,834
I've never seen his face. Have you?

150
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,334
You know I haven't.

151
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:57,251
Oh, look, there it is. The perimeter.

152
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,293
I can't believe my sister's Jedi scum.

153
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:06,459
What was she like when you spoke to her?

154
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:12,543
She seemed in over her head, honestly.

155
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:15,001
She seemed really fond
of that one Jedi Master.

156
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,959
What was his name again? Sol?

157
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,209
Anyways, let's get going.

00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,751
Yeah, I would do that
if I had the tools, Pip.

Sol.

165
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:54,126
I went to find you
and Jecki said you already left.

166
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,126
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye.

167
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,084
I need your help.

168
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:01,876
I need you
to come with me on this mission.

169
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,209
You want me to rejoin the Jedi?

170
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,126
Well, not officially.

171
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,751
Oh.

172
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:12,293
You need me, so you can get to her.

173
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:17,293
Sol, I can't.

174
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:23,168
When I told Mae you were alive,
her eyes softened.

175
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,751
She became a different person.

176
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:31,501

00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:31,709
The Jedi will put you in prison.

355
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,668
Not after I tell them who I know.

356
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,668
He'll kill you.

357
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,334
He'd have to find me first.

358
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:44,751
And I don't know if even he could make it
all the way over here without a guide.

359
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,168
I'll have to admit it.

360
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,043
I did need you.

361
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:50,709
[Qimir grunts]

362
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,251
Mae! Mae!

363
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,418
[♪ mysterious music playing]

364
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:03,876
She couldn't have gone far.
Where could she be?

365
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,043
I don't know.

366
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,959
- Where is Bazil?
- I don't know, Padawan.

367
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,709
[♪ mysterious music continues]

368
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,543
What is it?

369
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:25,001
[panting] It's nothing.

370
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:30,001
You wouldn't let me confront Mae on Olega?

371
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,584
You weren't ready.

372
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,168
But I'm ready now?

373
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,543
This is different.

374
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:40,334
I feel different.

375
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:44,209
I sense things again in a way
that gives me the courage to face her.

376
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:46,876
You're not going to face her.

377
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:50,418
You're going to face your past.

378
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:52,793
[Sol breathes heavily]

379
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,293
Both of us will.

380
00:24:56,709 --> 00:25:02,459
Once we get Mae safely to the ship,
I'll explain everything.

381
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,709
I promise.

382
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:09,043

[Bazil sniffing]

386
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,168
Hey, little buddy.

387
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:36,543
[Bazil roars]

388
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:37,834
[Bazil calls out]

389
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,376
He's found Mae.

390
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:42,126
[calls out, roars]

391
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:44,543
[calling out]

392
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,168
[Jecki] Go, go, go!
[Yord] Osha.

393
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,251
- Stay behind us.
- [Jedi] This way.

[Bazil calling out]

396
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:57,751
[Jedi] Through here. Quickly.

397
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,793
[panting] Master Kelnacca!

398

[♪ uneasy music playing]

399
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,793
He's here.

400
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,876
[breathing shakily]

401
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:41,293
[Jedi] Over there!

402
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:43,001
[Jecki] Master Kelnacca!

403

[♪ tense music playing]

404
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,876
[Jedi] In the name
of the Galactic Republic,

405
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,084
and the Order of the Jedi,

406
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:57,168
anyone inside that domicile

407
00:26:57,168 --> 00:27:00,751
should come out with your hands
where we can see them.

408
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,876
That means you, Mae Aniseya.

409

What is that?

412
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,334
Identify yourself.

413
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:00,626
Stand down.

414
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:05,126
