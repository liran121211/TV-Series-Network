Mae burned down the witches' fortress

I fear Mae is only a small part

But first, you and I are going to talk.

18

Mae. I saw Mae.

41
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,668
She had her hand outstretched.

42
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,001
She was killing Sol.

Where is she?

44
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,001
She had a saber in her hand.

But she didn't use it.

This is the future you saw.

47
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,918
She can kill with no weapon.

48
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,001
But the future isn't fixed.

49
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,626
I can still stop her.

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,334
With what ship? I'm taking mine.

51
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,293
And going where, exactly?

52
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,501
I've seen where they are.

53
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,584
So we go together.

54
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,084
And see who gets to her first.

00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:28,668
[Mae] Where are we?

There is a vergence on this planet.

Now that you and Osha are both alive,

63
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:53,709
I can prove it.

64
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,501
Prove it?

65
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,418
Prove what?

66
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:00,751
That murdering our mother was justified?

67
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,376
What happened to you,

- If it was an accident...

Why did you lie to her?

73
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,626
Why did you blame it on me?

74
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:23,668
You started that fire.

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,209
You locked everyone in.

76
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,376

My biggest regret

You and Osha are not twins.

00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,918
It's my head, actually. And I'm fine.

This must be urgent to wait for me here.

144

I've heard some disturbing things.

145
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,376
What have you heard?

146
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:51,334
That you are running
a murder investigation

147
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,334
without reporting it to the Senate.

148
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,751
I'm keeping this internal for the moment.

149
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,876
I have the authority
to take independent action

150
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,168
if there's no larger threat.

151
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,668
How can you know
there is no larger threat?

152
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,126
[Vernestra] All the victims were Jedi.

153
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,793
There are multiple victims?

154
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,293
I am very close
to apprehending the suspect.

155
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:11,043

You don't like me.

159
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,668
You think my campaign

160
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,626
for an external review of the Jedi
is a personal vendetta.

161
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,959
If you want my honest opinion, yes.

162
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,668
Good. Here's mine.

163
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:34,043
I think the Jedi are a massive system
of unchecked power, posing as a religion,

164
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:38,126
a delusional cult that claims
to control the uncontrollable.

165
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,584
- We don't control the Force.
- [Rayencourt] Not the Force.

166
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:43,001
Your emotions.

167
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,084
You project an image
of goodness and restraint,

168
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,876
but it's only a matter of time
before one of you snaps.

169
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:53,209
And when, not "if", that happens,
who will be strong enough to stop him?

170
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,376
That's certainly an opinion

171
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:58,043
and not one shared
by the rest of the Senate.

172
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:01,626
The majority of my colleagues
can't imagine a galaxy without the Jedi.

173
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,501
And I can understand why.

174

When you're looking up to heroes,

175
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,334
you don't have to face
what's right in front of you.

176
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,209
Is that all, Senator?

177
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,543
I have reported your lack of transparency
to Chancellor Drellik.

178
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:24,543
He may invite you
to a Senate tribunal for an update.

179
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:28,334
I hope, for your sake,
you have this suspect in custody by then.

Good luck.

181
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,626

00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:35,918

Is that true?

371
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:07,834
I was protecting you.

372
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,459
It was the right thing to do.

373
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,334
If it was the right thing to do,
why didn't you tell the Jedi?

374
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:20,376
Without Mae, there was no proof
you were created in this way.

375
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,293
Why didn't you tell me?

376
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,001
They would have sent you away.

377
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:31,626
You were too old to train.

378
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:34,918
They never
would have let you become a Jedi.

379
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:38,668
I did what I thought was best for you.

380
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:45,459
Of course, I wanted to tell you
so many times, but I couldn't.

Stop talking.

382
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:49,626
I kept this from you

383
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:53,126
so you could have the life
you'd always dreamed of.

That man who killed your mother

There they discovered
a Force cult of witches.

it was the work of one flawed man.

544
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:43,751
And where is Master Sol now?

545
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,293
He was found dead on Brendok.

546
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,959
