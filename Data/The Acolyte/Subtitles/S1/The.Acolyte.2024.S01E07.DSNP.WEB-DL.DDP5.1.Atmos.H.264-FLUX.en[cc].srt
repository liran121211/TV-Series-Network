A hundred years ago,
this planet was catalogued as lifeless

I can help you.

[Indara] Osha. May we meet your sister?

[Mother Aniseya] You wish
to return to Coruscant.

Go on.

Mother Aniseya,

you cannot deny that Jedi have the right
to test potential Padawans.

[Indara] That was clever.
Suggesting we test the girls.

to ask the Council for guidance.

223
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,500
Indara, I feel a connection to Osha.

224
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,500
Sol, testing the twins
is not something we can take seriously.

225
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,750
Osha's too old to join the Order.

226
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,500
I feel she is meant to be my Padawan.

227

Her coven will never let her leave.

- They are so insular... So strange.

They marked her sister with dark magic.

Ceremonial markings are customary
in many cultures in the galaxy.

But Osha did not have one.

- I worry she's not safe.
- That's true.

233

She may have resisted being marked.
There's no way to know.

234
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,791
Then who is protecting this child
if not the Jedi?

what was everyone doing in the courtyard?

Is your marking a part of Ascension?

Do you like it?

It's very beautiful.

263
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,875
Ascension must be very important
to include a marking like that.

264
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,541
Mama says "Ascension"
means Osha and I will lead the coven.

265
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,416
That's why I have a marking like Mama.

266

But you're children.
How can you become the leaders?

Then stop her.

[Rane] She is a child.

371
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,041
The girl has yet to discover
the power she holds.

372
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,541
It's not her decision to make.

373
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,625
But is it ours?

374
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,375
You cannot allow Osha to go.

375
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,875
She has chosen it.

It's what she wants.

377
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,958
You would sacrifice our future
for the wish of a child?

378
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:16,291
My children are our future.
Her wish must be considered.

379
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:19,875
You may be their mother,
but you are also our leader.

380
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,625
Right now I choose mother.

No. Mae.

00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,750
[Indara] There's no way
that we can land the ship there.

403

- do you think you can make the jump?

ask yourself why you made this choice.
