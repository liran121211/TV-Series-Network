Like everywhere else, evolution has over millions of years produced several amazing adaptations to even the most extreme conditions, here especially to the lack of sunlight, with its problems for procreation, searching food and fleeing hunters, such as photophore cells which produce specific light types, mimic rare light penetrating from above, etcetera.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0846339", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 950, "number_of_episodes": 8}
