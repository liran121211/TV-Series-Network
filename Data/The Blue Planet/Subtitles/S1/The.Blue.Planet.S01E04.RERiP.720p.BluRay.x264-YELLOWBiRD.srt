1
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,385
The frozen seas
are worlds unto themselves.

2
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:54,224
Beneath their ceiling of ice,

3
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,511
they have an eerie,
almost magical stillness,

4
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:00,723
cut off from the storms
that rage above.

5
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:09,364
in the winter, the feeble slanting
rays of the sun bring little warmth

6
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:14,196
and the temperature seldom rises
above minus 50 degrees Centigrade.

7
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:16,449
(H0WLiNG, WHiSTLiNG WiND )

8
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:32,172
For much of the year,
it is dark and cripplingly cold.

9
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:35,768
Yet, there iS life here
at B0TH ends of the earth -

10
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,391
the Arctic and the Antarctic.

11
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:53,074
For most animals, whether
they live in or out of water,

12
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,206
the winters,
when much of the sea is frozen,

13
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,337
bring the greatest challenge.

14
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,380
The northern hemisphere.

15
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,099
it's February,

16
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:08,592
and as the earth tilts on its axis,

17
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,391
the sun's rays
creep slowly northwards

18
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,601
and the Arctic emerges
from its harsh winter.

19
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:22,155
The Arctic is a frozen ocean
surrounded by continents,

20
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,743
and when the surface of the sea
between the continents

21
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:27,742
freezes from shore to shore,

22
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,408
land predators walk out onto it

23
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,081
to hunt.

24
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,755
it's early March,

25
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,553
and the sea is still covered
with ice...

26
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:46,347
But there are patches
of open water - polynyas -

27
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,230
that never freeze over.

28
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:52,813
Here, where tidal currents
are squeezed between islands,

29
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:56,821
the water movement is so strong
that ice cannot form.

30
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,411
Walruses spend the winter
in polynyas.

31
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:09,375
Here they have permanent access
to the air,

32
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,630
but they can also retreat
to the sea to shelter, to hunt.

33
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:31,532
0ther sea mammals overwinter
in polynyas as well - in this one,

34
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,776
a young bowhead whale.

35
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,956
Here, the current is really fast

36
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:48,210
and the shifting ice is dangerous.

37
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,969
This whale became trapped

38
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,850
when ice encircled it last autumn.

39
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:08,150
There is no food here,

40
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,652
but a whale must breathe,

41
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,907
and the only place it can do so
for miles around is in this tiny hole.

42
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:22,168
it's living entirely
on its reserves of fat,

43
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:24,834
but now, they're dangerously low.

44
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:28,133
it will be some months yet
before it can escape.

45
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,652
Elsewhere, other whales
have also been trapped.

46
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,620
These are belugas.

47
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,865
Their tiny hole in the ice

48
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,367
has been kept open not by currents,

49
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:55,380
but by the belugas'
continuous movements

50
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:57,340
as they rise to breathe.

51
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,308
0pen water is now
some 20 miles away.

52
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:10,104
it will be two months yet
before the ice melts.

53
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,905
The belugas are extremely thin

54
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,788
and most of them
are horribly scarred.

55
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,473
But their wounds
were not inflicted by the ice.

56
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,778
A whale would be a huge prize
for any meat-eating hunter,

57
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,620
and these belugas,
trapped by the ice,

58
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,910
are within reach of polar bears.

59
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,595
Well aware of the danger,

60
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:18,218
the belugas stay submerged
as long as they can,

61
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:22,144
but they can only hold their breath
for about 20 minutes.

62
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:45,630
Catching a four-metre-long whale
that weighs one tonne

63
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:47,380
is no easy task,

64
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:51,387
even if that whale
is weakened by starvation.

65
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:06,650
But a beluga
is well worth waiting for.

66
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:32,977
Day by day,
as the hole gets bigger,

67
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:37,397
it becomes increasingly difficult
for the bear to land a whale.

68
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:44,694
Keeping its fur in good condition
and free from salt

69
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:46,746
is important for warmth,

70
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,000
and the bear uses snow
like blotting paper.

71
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,893
These belugas have been attacked
by many bears

72
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,722
over the last six months,

73
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:08,974
and some have been caught.

74
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,565
it may have taken a long time
and a lot of patience,

75
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,526
but a catch when it's made
brings abundant rewards

76
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,496
of energy-rich blubber.

77
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:36,218
Gulls rely on bear kills
at this time of the year,

78
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,012
and the colour of blood
staining the ice

79
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,511
attracts them from a long way away.

80
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,564
The remaining belugas
still have a long wait

81
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,609
before they're released
from their prison

82
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,741
and the threat of slaughter.

83
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:25,238
Arctic foxes
also rely on the polar bears

84
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,399
to hunt on their behalf.

85
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,948
They're the jackals of the north,

86
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,620
and scavenge from bear kills
whenever they can.

87
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:44,210
in winter and early spring,

88
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:47,092
they're wholly dependent on bears.

89
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:50,052
0nly in the summer,
when the sea ice melts,

90
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:53,430
will they regularly catch prey
for themselves.

91
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:03,990
They're not strong enough
to tackle adult seals,

92
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,825
but can certainly take
new-born pups or birds.

93
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,555
This canny individual

94
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,801
is going to bury its prize.

95
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:29,181
it may need it
during the uncertain times ahead.

96
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,687
The presence of bears

97
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:39,442
affects the behaviour of almost all
the animals here, big and small.

98
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:43,070
The bears tend to avoid
the fringe of fragmented ice

99
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,039
bordering open water

100
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,913
where travelling
can be very laborious,

101
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:51,290
but that very fact
makes this area - the pack ice -

102
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,423
a particularly good place

103
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,502
for seals to pup.

104
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,938
Harp seals breed here.

105
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,515
Their pups are born with white coats

106
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:12,609
which camouflage them
very effectively against the snow.

107
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:17,739
Harp seals have
a very short nursing period -

108
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,665
a necessity
on this unstable pack ice -

109
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,704
but suckling is intensive.

110
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,714
The pup feeds for just 12 days

111
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:29,124
on milk that is 45 per cent fat.

112
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:31,923
Then it's abandoned

113
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:34,172
and has to fend for itself.

114
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,145
A male hooded seal.

115
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:46,103
This impressive nasal display

116
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,364
is used to warn away other males...

117
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,500
and to win a mate.

118
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,952
Hooded seals also breed
on pack ice.

119
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,705
Their pups suckle
for only four days,

120
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:07,253
the shortest nursing period
known for any mammal,

121
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,929
and all because
the threat of polar bears

122
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,137
caused them to breed
on the unstable ice.

123
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:34,584
Another Arctic seal opts
for the solid ice further north.

124
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,209
Because it's easy for bears
to hunt here,

125
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,752
these ringed seals
must be particularly vigilant

126
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,004
and have to hide their pups.

127
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,640
Ringed seals
are comparatively small,

128
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,139
so they can give birth
to their pups

129
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,938
in little caves or lairs
under the snow.

130
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:58,689
Here, a pup is out of sight

131
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:01,023
and protected from bad weather.

132
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,699
in late March and into April,

133
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,920
female bears emerge from
winter dens with their new cubs.

134
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:17,378
The mother has not eaten
for at least five months

135
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,760
and she's hungry - very hungry.

136
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:31,849
if she doesn't succeed in catching
a regular supply of seals,

137
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,487
her milk will fail

138
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:35,447
and her cub will die.

139
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:45,622
Bears have an extraordinarily
sensitive sense of smell

140
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:48,712
and can detect seal pups
hidden in the snow

141
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,839
from two kilometres away.

142
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,601
But a female ringed seal
uses several lairs

143
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:09,482
and a bear will have
to break into a number

144
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:12,823
before it finds one
that is occupied.

145
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,663
This is a crucial time for the cub.

146
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,916
By watching its mother hunt

147
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:31,672
and by copying her actions, it's
beginning to acquire the rudiments

148
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:33,925
of its own hunting skills.

149
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:41,393
Play is also important
for developing muscles

150
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,561
and improving co-ordination.

151
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,470
As the days go by,

152
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,719
the sun rises higher and remains
above the horizon even at night.

153
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,858
The female bear continues to hunt

154
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:25,117
until her cub is too tired
and can't keep up.

155
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,875
She's smelt something.

156
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,776
The pup escapes
through a hole in its lair

157
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,028
that leads to the sea below.

158
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,103
0nly one in 20 hunts is successful,

159
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:32,024
but this mother
must find a seal pup soon

160
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,819
if her cub is not
to starve to death.

161
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,425
As spring turns into summer, the sun's
heat begins to melt the sea ice.

162
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,773
Now, the ocean is accessible

163
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:07,028
and the Arctic's summer visitors
return.

164
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:08,691
Migrating birds

165
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:10,443
arrive from the south

166
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:14,319
to nest and feed on the seafood
now within their reach.

167
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:16,122
Brunnich's guillemots

168
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,078
are the northern equivalent
of penguins,

169
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:22,040
but they have retained
the power of flight

170
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,884
for they need to reach cliff ledges

171
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:29,215
where their nests will be safe
from predatory bears and foxes.

172
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:50,407
Nonetheless, they are as at home
in the water as in the air.

173
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,126
They dive down
to a depth of 50 metres or more

174
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:56,789
to catch fish.

175
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,971
in june, the ice begins to fracture.

176
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,221
The cracks - or leads -

177
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:13,805
form useful corridors of open water

178
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:16,060
for air-breathing animals.

179
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,403
Belugas, migrating
to their feeding grounds,

180
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:27,742
use these leads to penetrate
the ice-covered seas and reach areas

181
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:32,081
where their preferred food,
Arctic cod, has spent the winter.

182
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:44,008
The males regularly dive
to about 500 metres to find fish.

183
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:47,894
The females and young,
which have smaller lungs,

184
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,687
only go to about 350.

185
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,832
in late june and july,
narwhals arrive.

186
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:11,424
The females,
who usually lack tusks,

187
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,835
come first with their new calves.

188
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:16,135
The males follow a little later.

189
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,403
They also move up the leads

190
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:34,984
in search of fresh feeding grounds.

191
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:49,501
Bowheads. Up to 18 metres long

192
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,719
and weighing 100 tonnes.

193
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,717
These are the only large whales

194
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,432
that stay in the Arctic
all year round.

195
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,791
They are not after fish.

196
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,368
They're seeking smaller prey.

197
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:23,463
Despite having the largest mouths
in the animal kingdom -

198
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:25,712
the size of a small garage -

199
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:28,426
they eat tiny crustaceans -
copepods -

200
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:31,051
straining them from the water

201
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:34,015
with the four-metre-long strips
of baleen

202
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,348
that hang from their upper jaws.

203
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,574
in the summer,
they store enough energy

204
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,535
to last them
through the following winter

205
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,867
when food will be less abundant.

206
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,172
As the ice melts away,

207
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,213
the polar bears are forced
to head for land.

208
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,841
They are excellent swimmers,

209
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:09,347
and can cover 100 miles
of continuous open water if need be.

210
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:48,767
0ff east Greenland,

211
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:52,645
there is little ice left by August,
so walruses haul out

212
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:54,615
to rest on land.

213
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:57,275
At this time of year,
they are moulting,

214
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:01,534
getting rid of their old,
scarred, parasite-ridden skin.

215
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:16,558
A bathe in cold water brings
some relief from the itching...

216
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,616
but even there,

217
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,462
the odd scratch is irresistible.

218
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:03,610
They make daily excursions
out to deeper water.

219
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:15,746
Down at 20 metres,

220
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,163
they root around in the sediment,

221
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,499
using their sensitive bristles

222
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:23,002
to search out soft-shelled clams.

223
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:44,659
0nce they find a clam,

224
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:47,072
they suck its flesh from the shell

225
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,871
with their powerful,
muscular mouths.

226
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:56,756
Walruses can feed for
about five minutes at this depth

227
00:23:56,927 --> 00:24:00,462
before they have to return
to the surface to breathe.

228
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:12,603
Elsewhere in the Arctic, belugas are
gathering in their thousands.

229
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:16,480
They congregate
in just a few large estuaries.

230
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:22,407
Belugas of all ages and sizes
come here.

231
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,074
There are even young calves.

232
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:38,969
Some are so young -

233
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:41,219
born only a week or so ago -

234
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,056
that they need help.

235
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,473
They swim on their mothers' backs

236
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,142
so that they can breathe
more easily.

237
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,617
As the tide moves up the estuary,

238
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:03,372
the belugas follow,

239
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:06,501
swimming into surprisingly
shallow water.

240
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,518
Like walruses,

241
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,643
they also need to moult.

242
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,357
A combination of warm fresh water

243
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:32,485
and vigorous rubbing
against the gravel does the trick.

244
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:46,010
They remain here for days

245
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,722
or even weeks,

246
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,382
so it's likely that socialising

247
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,683
is also important to them.

248
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:02,646
After moulting,
they head back out to sea to feed.

249
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,367
it's now autumn,

250
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:13,709
and the sea begins
to freeze over once again.

251
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:22,209
Thin sheets of ice form
at the surface

252
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,346
and pile up, layer upon layer,

253
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,637
gradually creating
an impenetrable barrier.

254
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:42,195
By late November, the Arctic ocean
is sealed once again by ice.

255
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:59,094
The lights of the aurora

256
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,305
play in the winter sky.

257
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,816
And at the other end
of the planet - in the Antarctic -

258
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:18,070
there is the southern aurora.

259
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:36,887
Antarctica is now
emerging from winter.

260
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:41,097
This is the coldest,
windiest place in the world.

261
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:45,271
Temperatures are still hovering
at a numbing minus 50,

262
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,565
and the returning sun
has virtually no warmth.

263
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:53,613
Very few animals can survive
such extreme conditions...

264
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:58,249
but Emperor penguins can.

265
00:27:58,418 --> 00:28:00,494
(H0WLiNG, R0ARiNG WiND )

266
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:06,335
Standing on the frozen sea,

267
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:09,963
they endure the full force
of the Antarctic storms.

268
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,483
0nly by huddling together

269
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:25,070
can they survive
the appalling winter months.

270
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:35,371
They take it in turns
to bear the brunt of the gales.

271
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,457
They can only live here at all

272
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:43,797
because Antarctica is surrounded
by the great Southern 0cean

273
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:47,008
and no land predators
have been able to reach it,

274
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,260
so, unlike Arctic animals,

275
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,141
they're not threatened
by polar bears.

276
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,443
The sea is still frozen,

277
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,982
but one seal, nonetheless,
manages to stay here,

278
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,534
even throughout the winter -

279
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:09,374
the Weddell seal.

280
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:28,304
Underwater, it's protected
from the storms above,

281
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:31,187
but it must have access
to the air all year

282
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,318
in order to breathe.

283
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,788
And they keep
their breathing holes open

284
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:49,623
with their teeth.

285
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,265
0nly by continually
scraping away at the ice

286
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,895
can they maintain access
to the air,

287
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:09,520
but that means that their teeth
get badly worn down.

288
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:13,399
Then, they can no longer hunt
and eat effectively.

289
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:16,246
Weddell seals die young.

290
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:27,671
The continent of Antarctica

291
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:29,919
is so isolated and so high -

292
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:32,670
almost 5,000 metres in places -

293
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:36,053
that it's considerably colder
than the Arctic.

294
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:42,350
ice slides slowly down
from its centre

295
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:45,018
towards its rim
in immense glaciers.

296
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:51,739
During winter, the continent
effectively doubles in size

297
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:53,573
as the sea freezes over.

298
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,454
ice forms around its shores

299
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:59,498
and extends outwards
for hundreds of miles

300
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,748
around the entire land mass.

301
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,720
Under the sea ice live small
shrimp-like creatures - krill.

302
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:14,980
They have been here all winter.

303
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,565
During these dark months,

304
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:22,774
they feed by scraping algae
from the ice.

305
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:28,111
Remarkably, they also shrink in size

306
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:31,575
and revert to their juvenile form
to save energy.

307
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:41,763
As the temperature rises in spring,

308
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,757
the ice begins to melt,

309
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:47,468
and little air bubbles
trapped within it are released.

310
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:50,563
Microscopic algae grow
around these bubbles

311
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:52,808
and the krill now graze on them,

312
00:31:52,984 --> 00:31:55,939
gathering them up
with their beating legs.

313
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:15,084
As the sun's rays grow stronger

314
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:17,930
and penetrate deeper
into the water,

315
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:20,505
floating algae begin to flourish,

316
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,844
and krill leave the dwindling ice

317
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,145
and gather in swarms

318
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:28,392
as they harvest this new crop.

319
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,122
Far to the north,

320
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,366
beyond the blanket of sea ice,

321
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,120
chinstrap penguins

322
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,249
have been overwintering
in the open ocean.

323
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,800
The occasional iceberg

324
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,135
gives them the chance of a rest -

325
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,389
if they can get onto it.

326
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:34,511
But at this time of year,
where they really want to be

327
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:36,146
is on land.

328
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,897
it's just getting there
that's tricky.

329
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:02,296
it's spring, and the penguins
are returning to breed.

330
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:13,054
Their need to get ashore
is now urgent and imperative.

331
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:29,376
Doing so is all a matter of timing,

332
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:31,619
and picking the right wave.

333
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:23,183
But their journey
has only just begun.

334
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:26,395
Most of them will have to walk
many miles

335
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:28,894
before they can find a nest site.

336
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,823
(TREMEND0US DiN)

337
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,754
This is Zavodovski island,

338
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:50,295
which has the largest
penguin colony in the world.

339
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,427
About two million chinstraps
breed here,

340
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,851
and they come to THiS island
for a good reason.

341
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:05,729
it's an active volcano.

342
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:09,192
The heat from the crater
and the fumeroles

343
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:12,239
keeps the slopes
free from the ice and snow,

344
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:16,163
allowing these chinstraps
to start breeding earlier

345
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,209
than those further south.

346
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:22,466
But then again,

347
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:26,502
living on an active volcano
is not without its risks.

348
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,968
Unlike the Emperors,

349
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:33,927
these penguins are able to lay
their eggs on the bare ground.

350
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:38,056
Little wonder so many choose
to brave the mountainous waves

351
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,778
in order to get here.

352
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,028
Further south, near the continent,

353
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,327
the blanket of sea ice
is beginning to break up.

354
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,879
icebergs are gigantic fragments
of ice

355
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:04,133
that have broken away into the sea
from the front of glaciers.

356
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:07,843
During the winter,
they were frozen into the sea ice,

357
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,393
but now they're set adrift
once more.

358
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:51,730
As the bergs break up,

359
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:53,898
they form brash ice.

360
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:58,610
it litters the backwaters
of the Antarctic peninsula.

361
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:23,307
Minke whales make their way
into these placid waters in summer.

362
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:27,233
This is the most abundant whale
in the Southern 0cean.

363
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:42,964
Minkes are one of the smallest
of all the baleen whales,

364
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:46,168
and like all others,
they come here to feed.

365
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,686
The majestic humpback whales

366
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:03,736
are also summer visitors.

367
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,330
They have travelled
thousands of miles

368
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:18,872
from their winter breeding grounds
in the tropics

369
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:22,881
to gather the food that becomes
available here in summer.

370
00:39:38,697 --> 00:39:40,357
in just four months,

371
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:42,609
they accumulate enough fat

372
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:46,914
to provide them with energy for
the whole of the rest of the year.

373
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:08,887
All these animals have come here
in search of one thing -

374
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,608
the krill.

375
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,895
Krill is the mainstay

376
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,148
of the Antarctic food web.

377
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,706
it occurs in phenomenal quantity -

378
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:29,833
billions of individuals
in a single swarm,

379
00:40:30,382 --> 00:40:32,708
and swarms can stretch for miles.

380
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:42,430
Fur seals also collect
this rich, super-abundant food.

381
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,557
Krill swarms are very patchy,

382
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,276
but once found,

383
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,986
feeding is easy.

384
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:20,475
Humpbacks engulf
hundreds of thousands of them

385
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,223
in a single gargantuan mouthful.

386
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,751
When the going is good,

387
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:38,876
the whales feed continuously,

388
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:41,537
each eating
up to two tonnes of krill

389
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,341
in 24 hours.

390
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:51,347
Further south, near the continent,
the sea ice is still sound.

391
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,888
Here, where the ice remains
for most of the summer,

392
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:57,390
Emperor penguins make their home.

393
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:01,143
These have been feeding out at sea,

394
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:04,774
and are now ready to make
their way back to the colony

395
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:06,660
to feed their chicks.

396
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:12,580
instead of heading
straight for the ice edge,

397
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:15,789
the penguins hesitate
some distance from it.

398
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:18,216
They're nervous.

399
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:32,351
They dive down

400
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:35,147
and investigate the ice edge...

401
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:52,040
And for good reason.

402
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:55,216
Leopard seals patrol this border.

403
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:08,272
Leopard seals are the Antarctic's
equivalent of polar bears.

404
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:10,316
They're the top predators,

405
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:13,523
but they hunt most successfully
in the water,

406
00:43:13,698 --> 00:43:15,276
so by and large,

407
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:18,654
the animals they prey on
are safer out on the ice.

408
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:30,464
They have a lazy grace
that belies their ferocious nature.

409
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:47,561
Confident that the coast is clear,

410
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:50,444
the Emperor penguins
head for the ice...

411
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:54,778
but they certainly don't linger.

412
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:40,966
Now they have a long walk back
to the colony.

413
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:50,138
Emperor penguin colonies are
some way back from the ice edge.

414
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,640
in winter, they may be
as much as 100 miles from it,

415
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,937
but as the summer progresses
and the ice melts,

416
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,818
the edge comes ever closer
to the colony.

417
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:03,565
So by the time the chicks
are fledged

418
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:06,070
and ready to take their first swim,

419
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,789
the water is close by.

420
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:19,218
This colony is in the lee
of a headland,

421
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:22,424
and that prevents the ice
from being broken up

422
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,224
by ocean currents.

423
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:27,397
The returning adults
are so full of food

424
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:29,355
that they can barely walk,

425
00:45:29,524 --> 00:45:32,360
but with no predator
to threaten them now,

426
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:34,604
they can take their time.

427
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:47,961
Somehow, in this melee
of 60,000 or so penguins,

428
00:45:48,129 --> 00:45:50,419
a parent has to find its chick.

429
00:46:00,853 --> 00:46:04,269
it returns to the place
where it last left its chick

430
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,442
in the hope
that it might still be close by...

431
00:46:09,988 --> 00:46:12,610
but chicks tend to wander,

432
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:15,322
so the adult has to call to it.

433
00:46:17,914 --> 00:46:20,536
(ADULT MAKES L0W TRiLLiNG CALL)

434
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:26,080
(CHiCK MAKES HiGH-PiTCHED PEEP)

435
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,798
The chick responds,

436
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:34,380
and they slowly
home in on one another.

437
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,050
The plaintive entreaties
of the chick

438
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:41,061
stimulates the adult
to regurgitate a mouthful of fish.

439
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,156
With the return of one parent,

440
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:57,369
the other is free to go to sea
to feed for itself.

441
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:15,721
Aware of the leopard seal's
presence,

442
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:19,103
the penguins press together
at the ice edge

443
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:22,529
unwilling to be the first
to risk diving in.

444
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:42,010
0ccasionally,
the seal comes out onto the ice

445
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,256
and attempts to grab one...

446
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,904
But its most successful strategy
by far

447
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,622
is to lie in wait.

448
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,962
it hides behind a corner of ice.

449
00:48:18,055 --> 00:48:20,131
The Emperors gain confidence

450
00:48:20,308 --> 00:48:21,886
and make a dash for it.

451
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:36,904
The first wave of penguins escape.

452
00:48:39,747 --> 00:48:42,239
0nce in open water,
they will be safe.

453
00:48:47,423 --> 00:48:49,748
But the seal is alerted
by the noise,

454
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:53,295
and through the mass of bubbles,
it makes its attack.

455
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,314
Almost invariably, it makes a kill.

456
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:17,493
Encouraged by the absence
of the seal,

457
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:21,285
the remaining penguins
make a break for the open sea.

458
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:43,900
in time, their chicks will fledge,

459
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:47,109
and when the Antarctic autumn
is near its end,

460
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:50,654
these adults will walk
across the newly-formed ice

461
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,907
to endure yet another winter

462
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:55,409
on the frozen sea.
