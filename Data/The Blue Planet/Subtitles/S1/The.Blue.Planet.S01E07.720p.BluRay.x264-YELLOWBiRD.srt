1
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:40,626
There is a force sufficiently
powerful to move the oceans

2
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,001
of this world.

3
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:11,189
it is a force not of this Earth.

4
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:20,024
The Moon is large enough
to generate gravity

5
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:26,365
and with sufficient force to pull
on the Earth 230,000 miles away.

6
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,902
As the Moon orbits the Earth,

7
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,373
its gravity sweeps across
the face of our planet.

8
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:39,451
its power drags a great bulge
of oceanic water in its wake...

9
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:49,673
..the rising tide.

10
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,213
The River Amazon in Brazil.

11
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:02,266
0n some special days,
the gravitational forces

12
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:06,267
of the Moon and the sun combine,
to extraordinary effect.

13
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:19,397
A growing tidal wave from the ocean
is being forced 200 miles inland.

14
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:23,818
This is a tidal bore.

15
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:05,558
Fortunately, tidal bores are rare,

16
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:11,234
but the Moon does create strong tides
out in the world's oceans

17
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,608
on every day of the year.

18
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,617
The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia.

19
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,788
The tides here
are the largest in the world,

20
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:33,123
and have a profound effect
on marine life,

21
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,581
creating a rich feeding ground.

22
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:45,590
A feast that attracts some
of the largest diners on the planet...

23
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,757
..humpback whales.

24
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:03,015
But they are not the biggest threat
to the herring.

25
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,784
These are finback whales.

26
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:25,114
At 70 tonnes, they are the second
largest animal on Earth,

27
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:30,411
but so streamlined they are
the fastest of the great whales.

28
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:35,830
This combination of speed
and immense size

29
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:40,083
makes the finback a voracious hunter
of schooling fish.

30
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:44,791
The Bay of Fundy
can attract so many fish

31
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,459
that, during the summer,

32
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:53,887
as many as 500 of these magnificent
whales hunt here every day.

33
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:59,259
The feeding is best
where the tides run strongly.

34
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:03,806
So the whales
move further into the bay,

35
00:05:03,982 --> 00:05:07,930
following tidal rips
and searching for fish.

36
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:19,776
Their movements are closely watched
by flocks of Cory shearwaters.

37
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:29,163
As the whales dive down towards
the fish, more and more birds gather,

38
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,250
anxious to pick up scraps.

39
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,421
The flowing tide

40
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:53,051
may provide a feast,
but, before long, it will turn.

41
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:59,349
in just six hours,
100 billion tonnes of water

42
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,597
will flow out of the bay,

43
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:07,014
the sea level falling
by as much as 15 metres

44
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:11,272
and exposing vast tracts
of mud and sand.

45
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:17,234
At first sight, a barren place,
entirely devoid of life.

46
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:26,788
in fact, the damp sand
is packed with microscopic life,

47
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:30,657
the meiofauna,
feeding in a sandy underworld,

48
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:34,832
quite unaffected
by the departure of the sea.

49
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:41,458
But life is not all roses
in this miniature world.

50
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:48,221
A sand bubbler crab
in Northern Australia.

51
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,097
it hunts meiofauna.

52
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:53,266
just a centimetre across,

53
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:56,885
the sand bubbler
works at breakneck speed,

54
00:06:57,062 --> 00:07:01,806
filtering out the meiofauna
and kicking aside the waste.

55
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:08,604
The crab will clean

56
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,906
every grain of sand
within a metre of its burrow.

57
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:18,825
Endless practice for the best
backheel in the natural world.

58
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,420
The crabs work fast

59
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:46,211
because they can only sieve
when the sand is damp.

60
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,599
Remarkably, they work
the entire surface of the beach

61
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:54,680
within a couple of hours
of the tide retreating.

62
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,684
Then they simply return to their
burrows and await the next tide.

63
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,107
Underwater,
the falling tide is the cue

64
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,609
for some bizarre activity.

65
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:25,071
These slow-moving clams
use their muscular feet

66
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,740
to bury themselves under the sand.

67
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,286
if they fail to get under cover,

68
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:36,502
the tide will leave them exposed
to the air and they will perish.

69
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,126
But once underground,
they can wait,

70
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:46,055
safe beneath the beach,

71
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:52,180
And not a moment too soon.

72
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:59,597
june in south east Alaska.

73
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:04,565
in just four hours, a vast beach
is exposed by the falling tide.

74
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,649
The bears are hungry.

75
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:20,111
At this time of year, the pickings
on land are few and far between.

76
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:26,076
But any food here has long since
buried itself deep under the sand.

77
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:33,755
To a hungry adult bear,
that is no barrier.

78
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:38,797
They smell the clams through
the sand and simply dig them out.

79
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:43,296
For such large animals,

80
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:46,258
they show
quite extraordinary dexterity

81
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:49,136
at opening
the unfortunate shellfish.

82
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:13,405
Cubs try their luck, too,
none too successfully.

83
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,830
But for the adults,
the shellfish feast

84
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:25,125
lasts as long
as the tide remains out.

85
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,754
Table Mountain in South Africa.

86
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:42,213
Every day, the retreating waves
leave flotsam on the beach.

87
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:45,673
And this creature
is scenting the currents

88
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,968
for the odour of rotting fish.

89
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:54,384
The tide carries the scent
far into the surf zone.

90
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:02,184
Responding to the smell,
snails emerge from the sand.

91
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:11,446
This is a race against the tide.

92
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:14,783
The snails need to find their meal

93
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:17,704
before the tide
leaves it beyond reach.

94
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:21,655
But snails are slow
and the tides fall rapidly.

95
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,830
These, however,
are no ordinary snails.

96
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,502
They can surf!

97
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,020
They ride the waves up the beach

98
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:05,902
but, all too soon, the tide leaves
the fish beyond the surf zone.

99
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:17,487
Without the sea, there's a danger
the snails will lose the scent,

100
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:20,534
but as long
as the sand remains damp,

101
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,076
they can still follow
a faint trail to the food.

102
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,751
0nce there,

103
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:31,455
they tuck in with macabre relish.

104
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:42,928
Good things come to those who wait.

105
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,898
Soon, the heat of the sun
forces them to retreat into the sand

106
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,940
to await the return
of the next tide.

107
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,776
February in Britain.

108
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:15,862
The falling tide is eagerly awaited
by these knot.

109
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:44,971
As the water retreats,
countless small invertebrates

110
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:47,265
seek shelter under the mud.

111
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:54,023
And with good reason.

112
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:13,613
Waders are specialists
at probing in the mud,

113
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,780
their variety of beak shapes

114
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,490
designed for reaching
different invertebrates -

115
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,450
keys that unlock the safety
of the tidal flats.

116
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,797
But within a few hours,
the tide will turn again.

117
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:54,100
Soon, the waders
are out of their depth.

118
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,145
The creatures of the mud
are safe once more.

119
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:07,155
Underwater, incoming tides
can create a strong current,

120
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:13,161
and flounder are experts
at hitching a tidal lift.

121
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,449
They are shaped
rather like a kite,

122
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,743
a perfect design
for gliding on the tide.

123
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:26,713
in Newfoundland
on the east coast of Canada,

124
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:31,423
large numbers of flounder ride
the currents up into the shallows.

125
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,337
They've come to hunt invertebrates

126
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:41,515
that will emerge
now that the water is back.

127
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:03,781
The pickings in the shallows
can be very good.

128
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:09,950
The activity
has not gone unnoticed.

129
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,493
But ospreys can't dive deeply.

130
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:27,627
As long as the water is more than
a metre deep, the flounder is safe.

131
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,268
Going too far inshore

132
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,806
can be a risky business.

133
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:56,647
This fish buries itself
completely in the sand

134
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,943
at any sign of danger.

135
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:04,780
But when the tide floods in again,
as long as the coast is clear,

136
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:07,406
these sand lancet will re-emerge.

137
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,585
After a wait of six hours
under the sand,

138
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:20,828
they are desperate for food.

139
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:24,372
Unlike flounder,
they head out to sea,

140
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:26,754
looking for shallow, open water

141
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:32,926
where the tidal currents will
concentrate their food - plankton.

142
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:44,677
in untold thousands, they stream
towards the best feeding grounds,

143
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,847
where they simply pick up

144
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,556
tiny planktonic creatures
from the water.

145
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:05,691
But, if they swim too far off-shore
in search of food,

146
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:10,993
they risk meeting large predators
that live in deeper water.

147
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,537
Dogfish - small sharks.

148
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:23,291
The sand lancet have strayed
out of their safe depth.

149
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:25,205
The effect of the turning tide

150
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:30,294
can be totally different
on a rocky shore.

151
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,639
Here, on the coast
of Vancouver island in Canada,

152
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,723
the sun bakes the exposed rock.

153
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:47,308
it's almost impossible to dig
underground when the sea retreats,

154
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:53,401
so these mussels and barnacles
are fully exposed to the sun's heat,

155
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:56,606
literally cooking
in their own shells.

156
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:03,531
And the seaweed
simply dry to a crisp.

157
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,245
it can be a wait of many hours
before the water returns.

158
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:20,546
Throughout each month, the size
and strength of the tide changes.

159
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:24,550
The biggest tides of all happen

160
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:28,335
when the gravities of the sun
and Moon pull in unison.

161
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:31,880
That happens immediately
after the new moon...

162
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:36,926
..and again after the full moon.

163
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:44,888
These are called the spring tides.

164
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:50,651
They reveal vast tracts of seabed
that would normally be covered.

165
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:58,109
For these racoons, it's a chance
to look for a seafood feast.

166
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:03,286
A mother ventures forth
with her kits.

167
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:07,071
With the spring tide,
they've come further down

168
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:10,082
than smaller tides
would normally allow.

169
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:24,210
Searching
with their sensitive paws,

170
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:26,294
they look for suitable prey.

171
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,798
With the extreme low tide,
they could find something special.

172
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:51,560
And what could be better
than a red rock crab?

173
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:57,442
That is, if it weren't
for the risk of a painful pinch.

174
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:05,612
With crabs, there's no substitute
for experience.

175
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,873
The mother
makes an expert's catch.

176
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:20,542
But the kits learn fast.

177
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,885
And for those that don't,
begging is always worth a try.

178
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:39,311
All too soon, the returning tide
will cover the racoon's table.

179
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:51,480
For the invertebrates,
it's a welcome relief,

180
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:55,604
but in rough weather,
they are exposed

181
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,491
to the worst of the waves.

182
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:40,893
Even when there are no waves,

183
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:46,022
the incoming tide can create
considerable forces underwater.

184
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:50,605
The gaps between these islands
on the east coast of Vancouver island

185
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,440
channel the tidal flow.

186
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:57,903
As the tide keeps rising,
gradually the water flows faster,

187
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:01,243
and soon these 30-metre-long
bull kelp plants

188
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:04,497
bend to the current.

189
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:20,918
They are sufficiently flexible
to cope without too much damage,

190
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:26,679
but there are some spots where
the currents are especially powerful.

191
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,339
This is the Nakwakto Rapids.

192
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:36,435
At the turn of the tide, water from
almost 700 miles of coastal fjords

193
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:40,850
will have to empty through a gap
half a mile wide.

194
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:46,183
Within a few minutes, the current
is already picking up speed,

195
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:50,192
until water roars by
at over 17 miles an hour.

196
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:31,718
Tidal currents
are not always damaging.

197
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:38,185
Here, in the Poor Knight islands
of New Zealand,

198
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:43,432
weak tides run through rock arches,
making it an ideal resting place

199
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,318
for stingrays.

200
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:59,328
These rays congregate here
in huge numbers every March.

201
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:01,619
They've come to breed.

202
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:12,872
The arches funnel the current,
which the rays can ride

203
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:17,543
with the minimum of effort,
so saving energy.

204
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,716
Nearby, out in open water,

205
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:31,433
a school of two spotted demoiselle
fish are feeding on plankton,

206
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:37,604
and the current is perfect
for sweeping their food past them.

207
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:53,064
0nce the current starts to weaken,

208
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:55,319
there is insufficient food

209
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:58,744
to warrant the risks
of swimming out in the open.

210
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:02,697
So, the demoiselles head off
to find shelter en masse.

211
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,081
Safety is in numbers.

212
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:19,092
More and more demoiselles
pour towards the cave entrances

213
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,345
that riddle the Poor Knight islands.

214
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:55,866
Safe at last. inside the cave,
they are less exposed

215
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,030
to attack from predators.

216
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:04,453
Thousands of demoiselles
and blue mao mao

217
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:08,955
wait for the return of the current,
when, once again,

218
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,166
they will head out
into the open to feed.

219
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:20,961
The Moon's gravitational pull
is weaker

220
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:24,139
nearer to the Earth's equator.

221
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:29,218
So, the more equatorial the location,
the smaller the tides.

222
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:34,814
0ut in the Caribbean Sea,
the tidal movements are slight.

223
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:37,223
Even so, they are sufficient

224
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,018
to push free swimming plankton
in their path.

225
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:47,779
These are thimble jellyfish.

226
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:51,526
They swim towards sunlight,

227
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:55,366
and invisible boundaries
formed by the tidal motion

228
00:28:55,538 --> 00:29:01,575
help to herd them together,
until they gather in immense swarms.

229
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:04,751
They put the tropical sunshine
to good use.

230
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,244
Their brown colour comes from algae

231
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:10,256
that live inside
the jellyfish's body

232
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:13,673
and photosynthesise
energy from the sun.

233
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,716
in open water they are fairly safe,

234
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:30,388
but the tide is sweeping the whole
swarm gently towards the Bahamas,

235
00:29:30,563 --> 00:29:34,013
where hungry mouths are waiting.

236
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,439
Although the sea level
doesn't change much,

237
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:48,571
the tides are still pushing
an enormous volume of ocean water

238
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:52,988
through the small gaps
between the island cays.

239
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:07,750
Underwater, the tidal currents
race past soft corals...

240
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,179
..and on over
the sandy banks themselves.

241
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:25,224
it is an immense area of coral sand

242
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:29,307
that is only just submerged
at high tide.

243
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,979
This incoming tide is bringing in
a fresh supply of oceanic plankton.

244
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,392
Razorfish gather at the best spots

245
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,780
to catch the pick
of the microscopic feast.

246
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:49,904
Although there's plenty here
for these small fish to eat,

247
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:51,986
gathering in one place

248
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:56,206
makes it easy
for their predators to find them.

249
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:02,499
A nurse shark is little threat.

250
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,082
(CHiRPS AND CLiCKS)
But this sound...

251
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:11,210
heralds a quite different danger.

252
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,555
A bottlenose dolphin.

253
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:36,641
it's using its sonar
to locate razorfish beneath the sand.

254
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,899
0nce it finds a suitable target,
it simply digs out its prey.

255
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:31,644
The buried fish have no defence
against this attack.

256
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:35,813
They simply have to wait
and hope they aren't found out.

257
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:54,537
This dolphin appears to have
a razorfish craving.

258
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,783
Well, she is pregnant.

259
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,505
Success at last.

260
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:26,344
The incoming tide
sweeps on towards America,

261
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:29,771
flooding across vast flat
plains of seagrass.

262
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,431
They are so shallow
that, at low tide,

263
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,021
all large fish are forced
to retreat into deep water channels,

264
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:40,066
like these nurse shark...

265
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,114
..and stingrays.

266
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:48,819
Both predators hunt crustaceans
on the seagrass beds,

267
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:51,617
but until the tide
brings enough water,

268
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,245
they will have to wait.

269
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,789
So now, for this tulip snail,
it appears safe

270
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:09,548
to patrol the shallows
in search of a meal.

271
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,925
But is it?

272
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,717
This is a rather bigger snail.

273
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:27,931
At five kilograms in weight,
the giant horse conch

274
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:34,144
has little to fear from any shark,
and it has a taste for tulip snail.

275
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:43,740
Sensing the approaching danger,

276
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,949
the snail flees.

277
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,738
But, in a world of snail paces,

278
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:53,666
the conch
is something of a Ferrari.

279
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,502
it calls for desperate measures.

280
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:05,002
Exhausted by the effort
of its last-ditch attempt,

281
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:07,879
the tulip snail
is slowly gunned down.

282
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:16,891
The tide has to rise
for another hour

283
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:20,676
before the big predators can feed.

284
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:26,356
But out on the flats, the scent of
dying snail wafts away on the tide.

285
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:33,944
it's a scent these hermit crabs
are particularly partial to.

286
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:41,446
it's vital that the crabs
have the best possible protection

287
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:45,152
from the heavy teeth
of the waiting sharks and rays.

288
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:49,408
For that, they need the shell
with the perfect fit.

289
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,866
Today, there is new real estate
on offer -

290
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:57,253
and competition
in this housing market is fierce.

291
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:26,846
The action becomes
even more desperate

292
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:31,022
when the shell of the devoured
snail is ready for release.

293
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,984
This crab simply can't wait
any longer.

294
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,823
But it's a decidedly risky
acquisition.

295
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:57,952
The risk paid off handsomely.

296
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,376
The new shell is both lighter
and stronger than the old home.

297
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:08,088
it's not a moment too soon,
because the tide is flooding the plains.

298
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,385
At last, the predators are free
to start their foraging.

299
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:27,729
Both stingrays and shark
have an electrical sense

300
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:32,361
which they use to search
for buried invertebrates.

301
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,111
They can sense minute movements
beneath the sand.

302
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:44,111
Finding a promising signal,
this ray digs out its meal.

303
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:48,616
An unprotected hermit crab
would have no chance.

304
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:59,918
Within a few hours,
the tide ebbs out once more

305
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,755
and all the predators
are forced to leave.

306
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,424
They will have to wait
until the next high tide

307
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,434
before making
another feeding foray.

308
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:22,805
At certain times of the year,
called the equinox,

309
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:28,437
spring tides are exceptionally large
and rise higher than normal.

310
00:38:30,446 --> 00:38:35,984
Predators can reach the shallowest
fringes of the seagrass flats.

311
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:41,151
These two-metre-long tarpon
are going further inshore still.

312
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:44,115
They are heading for the mangroves.

313
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:51,203
These flooded forests cover
huge areas of the coastal shallows.

314
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:58,667
Extraordinarily, the roots of
the mangrove can live in salt water,

315
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:02,339
and they make a perfect nursery
for small fish.

316
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:16,261
Silversides and snapper
find sanctuary in the maze of roots.

317
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,220
Big predators
seldom find a way in here.

318
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:30,769
And now the tide
is falling once more.

319
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:37,320
The water starts losing
what little oxygen it contained,

320
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:40,244
and quickly becomes stagnant.

321
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:46,787
Most predators
have abandoned the mangroves,

322
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:52,248
but the tarpon are still here,
trapped by the falling tide.

323
00:39:56,882 --> 00:40:00,215
Dissolved oxygen
is fast running out,

324
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:04,595
but they have a vital survival
technique...

325
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:08,639
..they can breathe air.

326
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,974
Pumped up with fresh oxygen,

327
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,933
they can easily out-manoeuvre
the dozy silversides.

328
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:53,334
The tide has turned again.

329
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,463
And this is no ordinary tide.

330
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:02,085
Since it is the equinox,
the tide is rising fast,

331
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:04,135
but now, out to sea,

332
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:08,800
a hurricane is on its way,
forcing the tide yet higher.

333
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:45,824
The passing storm leaves large
areas of the coast flooded.

334
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,120
Low-lying islands,
like the Bahamas,

335
00:41:52,297 --> 00:41:57,005
are particularly prone
to the storm flooding.

336
00:41:57,176 --> 00:42:00,840
The sun's power here is immense.

337
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:06,056
As the tide recedes and the
remaining flood water evaporates,

338
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,841
a remarkable transformation
takes place.

339
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:25,566
The mud is coated
with a magical world of salt.

340
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:38,704
Any remaining water
is extremely salty.

341
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:41,872
Very few creatures
can survive here...

342
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:44,957
except brine shrimp.

343
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,711
And, on the water's edge -

344
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:56,040
brine flies.

345
00:42:56,218 --> 00:43:02,965
Both are the favourite food
of an extraordinary animal.

346
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:07,218
The Caribbean flamingo.

347
00:43:10,394 --> 00:43:14,936
Remarkably, they actually seek out
such briny places.

348
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:19,316
They are the best spots
for them to find their food.

349
00:43:33,285 --> 00:43:36,120
They also provide the protection

350
00:43:36,288 --> 00:43:39,786
the flamingos need
to raise their young.

351
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:44,119
Nesting sites like this
are surrounded by corrosive brine.

352
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:46,830
it's a formidable barrier

353
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:52,044
to any predator
seeking to dine on flamingo chicks.

354
00:43:56,594 --> 00:44:01,171
The flamingos take the precaution
of building raised nests

355
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,098
just in case of further flooding.

356
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:15,766
Strangely, it's actually
the power of the storm tides

357
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:21,775
that gives the flamingos food and
a perfect habitat in which to breed.

358
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:38,078
The breeding of many animals
in the ocean

359
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:41,782
is closely co-ordinated
with the tidal cycles.

360
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:47,497
The half moon in November.
it's the time of small tides.

361
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,713
Christmas island in the Pacific.

362
00:44:56,595 --> 00:45:00,009
Strange happenings are afoot.

363
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:09,684
it's one of only
a few nights each year

364
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,973
when female Christmas island crabs

365
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:16,847
risk heading down towards the sea.

366
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:21,944
They number in tens of thousands

367
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:27,532
and all of them are laden
with hundreds of eggs.

368
00:45:29,868 --> 00:45:32,275
They have to shed them
into the ocean

369
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:35,323
if the eggs are to develop
into baby crabs.

370
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,867
But these are land crabs

371
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:46,419
and they can neither swim
nor breathe underwater.

372
00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:59,050
There's a great risk of drowning.

373
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:04,761
That is why they pick the smallest
tides, to minimise the danger.

374
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:35,080
The eggs will develop far offshore.

375
00:46:35,248 --> 00:46:38,118
And, in exactly one month's time,

376
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:43,747
a swarm of baby crabs will return,
again choosing the perfect tide.

377
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:54,090
Whether it's the daily
or monthly cycle,

378
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:58,388
tides are the rhythm of the ocean -

379
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,215
its pulsing clock.

380
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:03,225
For every tide brings opportunity

381
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:06,595
to marine life
somewhere in the world.

382
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:14,898
Now, a spring tide
is flooding the shallows,

383
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:17,392
and hunters are on the prowl.

384
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:20,688
A small group of bottlenose dolphin

385
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:23,152
are working their way inshore

386
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:27,901
to start a quite extraordinary
hunting campaign.

387
00:47:54,137 --> 00:48:00,256
After one successful pass,
the dolphin move off to start again.

388
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:04,595
0ne animal peels off from the group
and swims in a circle,

389
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:11,138
stirring up the mud and driving
the mullet towards the other dolphins.

390
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:18,230
it's a remarkable team effort
and it's extremely effective.

391
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:27,243
The dolphin will feed like this

392
00:48:27,411 --> 00:48:33,198
for as long as the tide grants them
access to the shallows.

393
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,113
Eventually,

394
00:49:22,283 --> 00:49:27,109
the falling tide will force
the dolphin to leave the flats

395
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:32,955
and the mullet will be safe
once more, until the next high tide.

396
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:40,203
Because, in the ocean,
every turn of the tide

397
00:49:40,379 --> 00:49:45,419
spells the difference
between life and death somewhere.
