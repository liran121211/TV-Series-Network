1
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:40,071
Dwarfed by the vast expanse
of the open ocean,

2
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,948
the biggest animal
that has ever lived on our planet.

3
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:56,042
A blue whale, 30 metres long
and weighing over 200 tonnes.

4
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,919
it's far bigger
than even the biggest dinosaur.

5
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,925
its tongue weighs
as much as an elephant.

6
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,177
its heart is the size of a car,

7
00:01:07,353 --> 00:01:10,686
and some of its blood vessels
are so wide

8
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,932
that you could swim down them.

9
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,400
its tail alone

10
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:20,020
is the width
of a small aircraft's wings.

11
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:41,371
its streamlining,
close to perfection,

12
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:43,753
enables it to cruise at 20 knots.

13
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:47,257
it's one of the fastest animals
in the sea.

14
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:53,760
The ocean's largest inhabitant

15
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:57,466
feeds almost exclusively
on one of the smallest -

16
00:01:57,643 --> 00:02:01,225
krill, a crustacean
just a few centimetres long.

17
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,058
Gathered in a shoal,

18
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:09,393
krill stain the sea red,

19
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,732
and a single blue whale in a day
can consume 40 million of them.

20
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,866
Despite the enormous size
of blue whales,

21
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,116
we know very little about them.

22
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:31,412
Their migration routes
are still a mystery,

23
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:34,836
and we have absolutely no idea
where they go to breed.

24
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:40,751
They are a dramatic reminder

25
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,003
of how much we still have to learn

26
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,713
about the ocean and the creatures
that live there.

27
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:52,265
0ur planet is a blue planet.

28
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:55,805
0ver 70 per cent of it
is covered by the sea.

29
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:01,897
The Pacific 0cean alone
covers half the globe.

30
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,402
You can fly across it non-stop
for 12 hours

31
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:08,857
and still see nothing more
than a speck of land.

32
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,777
This series will reveal

33
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:15,285
the complete natural history
of our ocean planet

34
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:19,867
from its familiar shores to
the mysteries of its deepest seas.

35
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,668
By volume, the ocean makes up

36
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:37,047
97 per cent of the earth's
inhabitable space,

37
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,973
and the sheer quantity
of its marine life

38
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:42,928
far exceeds that
which inhabits the land.

39
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,787
But life in the ocean is not
evenly spread. it's regulated

40
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,076
by the path of currents
carrying nutrients,

41
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,409
and the varying power of the sun.

42
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,538
in this first programme, we will
see how these two forces interact

43
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:24,792
to control the distribution of life

44
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:28,502
from the coral seas
to the polar wastes.

45
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:28,349
The sheer physical power
of the ocean

46
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:30,392
dominates our planet.

47
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,649
it profoundly influences
the weather of all the world.

48
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:55,654
Water vapour rising from it forms
the clouds and generates the storms

49
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:58,404
that ultimately
will drench the land.

50
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,510
The great waves that roar in
towards the shores

51
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,805
are dramatic demonstrations
of its power.

52
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:43,076
Waves originate far out at sea.

53
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,826
There, even gentle breezes
can cause ripples,

54
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:49,369
and ripples grow into swells.

55
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:02,420
0ut in the open ocean,
unimpeded by land,

56
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:05,427
such swells can become gigantic.

57
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,609
it's only when an ocean swell
eventually reaches shallow water

58
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:34,859
that it starts to break.

59
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:46,328
As it approaches the coast,
the water at the bottom of the swell

60
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,171
is slowed by contact
with the seabed.

61
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,457
The top of the swell,
still travelling fast,

62
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:55,549
starts to roll over
and so the wave breaks.

63
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:32,782
The ocean never rests. Huge currents,
such as the Gulf Stream,

64
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:36,869
keep its waters constantly
on the move all round the globe.

65
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:40,162
it's these currents
more than any other factor

66
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:44,665
that control the distribution
of nutrients and life in the seas.

67
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,923
A tiny island lost
in the midst of the Pacific.

68
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:53,171
it's the tip of a huge mountain

69
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:57,178
that rises from the sea floor
thousands of metres below.

70
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:05,979
The nearest land is 300 miles away.

71
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:12,980
isolated sea mounts like this one

72
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,905
create oases
where life can flourish

73
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:19,773
in the comparatively empty expanses
of the open ocean.

74
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,699
But all the creatures that swim
beside it would not be here

75
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:35,120
were it not for one key factor -

76
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,213
the deep ocean currents.

77
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:47,716
Far below the surface,
they collide with the island's flanks

78
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,131
and are deflected upwards,

79
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,436
bringing with them from the depths
a rich soup of nutrients.

80
00:09:56,272 --> 00:10:00,767
Such up-wellings attract
great concentrations of life.

81
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:12,151
Most of the fish here
are permanent residents

82
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:16,275
feeding on plankton -
tiny floating plants and animals

83
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:20,072
nourished by the richness
brought up from the depths,

84
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:23,249
and they attract visitors
from the open ocean.

85
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:25,961
Tuna.

86
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,019
The plankton feeders
are easy targets.

87
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:10,992
All this action attracts
even larger predators.

88
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,285
Sharks.

89
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,961
Hundreds of sharks.

90
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,381
These silky sharks
are normally ocean-going species,

91
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,470
but the sea mounts
in the eastern Pacific

92
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,176
like Cocos, Mapelo
and the Galapagos,

93
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:38,678
attract silkies in huge groups
up to 500 strong.

94
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:46,355
Silkies seem to specialise
in taking injured fish

95
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:48,767
and constantly circle sea mounts

96
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:51,779
on the look out for the chance
to do so.

97
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:59,482
But silkies are not
the only visitors.

98
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,666
Hammerheads gather
in some of the largest shark shoals

99
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,075
to be found anywhere in the ocean.

100
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:14,250
Sometimes, thousands will circle
over a single sea mount.

101
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,011
But these sharks are not here
for food.

102
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,420
They have come for another reason.

103
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:31,644
Some of the locals
provide a cleaning service.

104
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,519
Following the last El Nino year,

105
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:42,435
when a rise in water temperatures
gave many sharks fungal infections,

106
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,778
the number of hammerheads
visiting the sea mounts

107
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,821
reached record levels.

108
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,578
Nutrients also well up
to the surface

109
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:04,159
along the coasts of the continents.

110
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:09,794
This is Natal
on South Africa's eastern seaboard.

111
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,508
it's june,

112
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:15,507
and just off-shore,
strange black patches have appeared.

113
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:22,764
They look like immense oil slicks
up to a mile long.

114
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,683
But this is a living slick:

115
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:32,184
millions and millions of sardines
on a marine migration

116
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,435
that in terms of sheer biomass,

117
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:38,525
rivals that of the wildebeest
on the grasslands of Africa.

118
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,108
These fish live mostly
in the cold waters south of the Cape,

119
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:49,490
but each year
the coastal currents reverse.

120
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:53,792
The warm Agulhas current
that flows down from the north

121
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,162
has been displaced
by cold water from the south,

122
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,910
and that has brought up
rich nutrients.

123
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,540
They in turn have created
a bloom of plankton,

124
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,136
and the sardines
are now feasting on it.

125
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,595
As the sardines travel north,

126
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,724
a whole caravan of predators
follow them.

127
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:28,484
Thousands of Cape gannets
track the sardines.

128
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,856
They nested off the Cape
and timed their breeding

129
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,403
so that their newly-fledged chicks

130
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,148
can join them
in pursuing the shoals.

131
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:48,744
Below water, hundreds of sharks
have also joined the caravan.

132
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,667
These are bronze whaler sharks,

133
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:58,920
a cold water species that
normally lives much further south.

134
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:06,554
These three-metre sharks

135
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:10,094
cut such great swathes
through the sardine shoals

136
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,057
that their tracks
are visible from the air.

137
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:15,306
Harried by packs of predators

138
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:18,602
and swept in
by the action of the waves,

139
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:22,062
the sardine shoals are penned
close to the shore.

140
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:45,000
Common dolphin are coming in
from the open ocean to join the feast.

141
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,218
There are over a thousand of them

142
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,470
in this one school.

143
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:17,151
When they catch up with the sardines,
the action really begins.

144
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:25,495
Working together, they drive
the shoal towards the surface.

145
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:38,171
it's easier for the dolphins
to snatch fish up here.

146
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,680
Now the sardines have no escape.

147
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,272
Thanks to the dolphins,

148
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:13,694
the sardines have come within
the diving range of the gannets.

149
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,294
Hundreds of white arrows
shoot into the sea,

150
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:32,080
leaving long trails of bubbles
behind each dive.

151
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,513
Next to join the frenzy
are the sharks.

152
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:03,938
Sharks get very excited
when dolphins are around.

153
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,274
They can feed particularly well

154
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,321
once the dolphins
have driven the sardines

155
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:12,365
into more compact groups
near the surface.

156
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:19,991
As the frenzy continues,
walls of bubbles drift upwards.

157
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,508
They are being released
by the dolphins

158
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,750
working together in teams.

159
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,011
They use the bubbles

160
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,429
to corral the sardines
into ever tighter groups.

161
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,929
The sardines seldom cross
the wall of bubbles

162
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,180
and crowd closer together.

163
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,565
Bubble netting in this way,

164
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:53,946
enables the dolphins to grab
every last trapped sardine.

165
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:08,992
just when the feasting
seems to be almost over,

166
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,041
a Bryde's whale.

167
00:19:15,547 --> 00:19:17,955
The survivors head on northwards,

168
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:21,050
and the caravan of predators
follows them.

169
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:33,342
Nutrients can also be brought up,
though less predictably,

170
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,596
by rough weather.

171
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:44,267
Particularly near the poles,
huge storms stir the depths

172
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:46,852
and enrich the surface waters,

173
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:49,106
and here, in the South Atlantic,

174
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:52,034
the seas are the roughest
on the planet.

175
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,821
And very rich seas they are, too,

176
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,448
for here, the cold Falklands
current from the south

177
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:04,661
meets the warm Brazil current
from the north,

178
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,623
and at their junction
is food in abundance.

179
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:13,248
These black-browed albatross
are duck-diving for krill

180
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:16,213
that has been driven up
to the surface.

181
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,305
Like all albatross,

182
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:25,554
black-brows are wanderers
across the face of the open ocean.

183
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,531
A feeding assembly on this scale
is a rare sight.

184
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,947
Most of the time, the birds
of the open sea are widely dispersed,

185
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:53,782
but these feeding grounds are close
to an albatross breeding colony,

186
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,867
and a very special one.

187
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:07,418
This is Steeple jason,

188
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,797
a remote island
in the far west of the Falklands.

189
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:14,175
it has the largest albatross colony
in the world.

190
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:26,314
There are almost
half a million albatross here,

191
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:30,647
an astonishing demonstration
of how fertile the ocean can be

192
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,897
and how much food it can give

193
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:36,358
even to creatures
that do not actually live in it.

194
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,047
Nutrients by themselves

195
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,592
are not enough to generate
these vast assemblies.

196
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:11,970
The heat and light from the sun
is also essential

197
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:15,596
for the growth of the microscopic
floating plants -

198
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:18,015
the phytoplankton.

199
00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:26,860
And it's the phytoplankton that is
the basis of all life in the ocean.

200
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:37,700
Every evening, the disappearance
of the sun below the horizon

201
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:40,791
triggers the largest
migration of life

202
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,035
that takes place on our planet.

203
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,960
0ne thousand million tonnes
of sea creatures

204
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:58,300
ascend from the deep ocean to
search for food near the surface.

205
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:09,725
They graze on the phytoplankton
under cover of darkness.

206
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,604
Even so, they are far from safe.

207
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:15,101
0ther marine hunters follow them,

208
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,647
some travelling up
from hundreds of metres below.

209
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:21,574
At dawn,

210
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:25,959
the whole procession returns
to the safety of the dark depths.

211
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:37,208
The moon, too, has a great
influence on life in the oceans.

212
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:40,925
its gravitational pull

213
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:44,679
creates the daily advances
and retreats of the tide.

214
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:59,978
But the moon has more
than a daily cycle.

215
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:04,565
Each month, it waxes and wanes
as it travels round the earth,

216
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,737
and this monthly cycle
also triggers events in the ocean.

217
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:14,742
The Pacific coast of Costa Rica

218
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:16,991
on a very special night.

219
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:21,543
it's just after midnight
and the tide is coming in.

220
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,545
The moon is in its last quarter,

221
00:25:28,718 --> 00:25:31,920
exactly half way
between full and new.

222
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,217
For weeks,
the beach has been empty,

223
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:39,467
but that is about to change.

224
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:43,889
At high tide, turtles
start to emerge from the surf.

225
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:52,436
At first, they come
in ones and twos,

226
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:54,604
but within an hour,

227
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,899
they are appearing
all along the beach.

228
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:06,495
They are all female
Ridley's turtles,

229
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:08,740
and over the next six days or so,

230
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,415
400,000 will visit this one beach

231
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,661
to lay their eggs in the sand.

232
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:27,552
At the peak time, 5,000
are coming and going every hour.

233
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:30,593
The top of the beach
gets so crowded

234
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:34,514
that they have to clamber
over one another to find a patch

235
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:36,762
where they can dig a nest hole.

236
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,898
A quarter of the world's population
of Ridley's turtles

237
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,770
come to this one beach
on a few key nights each year.

238
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:52,024
The rest of the time,

239
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,403
they are widely distributed
through the ocean,

240
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:58,112
most, hundreds of miles away.

241
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:03,163
This mass nesting is called
an arribada. How it's co-ordinated

242
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,410
is a mystery,

243
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:07,911
but we do know that arribadas start

244
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:11,622
when the moon is either
in its first or last quarter.

245
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:23,384
Forty million eggs are laid
in just a few days.

246
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,342
By synchronising their nesting,
the females ensure

247
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,853
that six weeks later,
their hatchlings will emerge

248
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:33,098
in such enormous numbers

249
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:35,765
that predators are overwhelmed,

250
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:41,067
and a significant proportion of baby
turtles will make it to the water.

251
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:47,066
But why do the females
use a cue from the moon

252
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,651
to help synchronise their nesting?

253
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,905
Part of the answer to that

254
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:55,414
becomes clear at dawn
on the following morning.

255
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:21,346
The day shift of predators
are arriving for their first meals.

256
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,809
Vultures have learnt

257
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:33,397
that the returning tide can wash
freshly laid eggs out of the sand.

258
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:39,073
The risk of eggs being exposed
by the surf

259
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:42,446
may be partly why
turtle arribadas tend to occur

260
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:45,740
around the last or first quarter
of the moon.

261
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,417
it's on such days as this when
the moon is neither full nor new,

262
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:58,586
that the tides are weakest
and the sea is likely to be calmer.

263
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:19,013
So it's easier for the female turtles
to make their way through the surf,

264
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:22,311
and harder for eggs
to be washed out of the sand

265
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:24,395
and taken by vultures.

266
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:40,576
The moon's monthly cycle
and its influence on the tides

267
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,075
triggers many events in the ocean,

268
00:29:43,252 --> 00:29:47,000
from the spawning of the corals
on the Great Barrier reef

269
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,248
to the breeding cycles of fish,

270
00:29:49,424 --> 00:29:51,665
but there's an even longer rhythm

271
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:54,547
that has the most profound effect
of all -

272
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,795
the annual cycle of the sun.

273
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:01,719
The sun's position
relative to the earth

274
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:03,968
changes through the year,

275
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:06,848
and it's this
that produces the seasons.

276
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:08,894
in the north, spring comes

277
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:12,018
as the sun begins to rise
higher in the sky.

278
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:15,396
0ff the coast
of north west America,

279
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:20,029
the seas are transformed by
the increasing strength of the sun.

280
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,659
Here in Alaska,
the coastal waters turn green

281
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,403
with a sudden bloom
of phytoplankton.

282
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,745
Herring that have spent the winter
far out to sea

283
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,665
time their return to the shallow
waters to coincide with this bloom.

284
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,964
They come in vast numbers

285
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:49,427
and initiate one of the most productive
food chains in all the oceans.

286
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:08,683
Humpback whales
are at the top of that food chain.

287
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:10,937
They have spent the winter

288
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:14,564
breeding in the warmer
tropical waters off Hawaii,

289
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,817
but there was little food there.

290
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:19,069
This herring bonanza

291
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,660
provides the majority of their food
for the year.

292
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:45,838
Stellar and Californian sea lions

293
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:50,724
also return from the open ocean
each year to feast off the herring.

294
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:05,442
The herring, however,
have not come here for food.

295
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:08,781
They are about to breed.
Nothing deters them

296
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:12,236
as they head
for even shallower waters.

297
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:16,030
Now the waters are so shallow

298
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:18,163
that glaucous-winged gulls

299
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,499
can snatch live fish
from just below the surface.

300
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:36,512
in spite of these attacks,
the herring swim on

301
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:38,887
until they reach the vegetation

302
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,809
that the females need
if they are to lay.

303
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,475
Each female produces
around 20,000 eggs,

304
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:54,058
and they're very sticky.

305
00:32:58,115 --> 00:33:02,361
After the females have spawned,
the males release their sperm

306
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,610
in vast, milky clouds.

307
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:13,959
Soon, the excesses
of the herrings' sexual spree

308
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:17,745
creates a thick white scum
on the surface.

309
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:21,290
Through the season,

310
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,000
curds of sperm clog the shores
for hundreds of miles

311
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:29,009
from British Columbia in the south
to Alaska in the north.

312
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:39,896
After a few days, this gigantic
spawning comes to an end,

313
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:43,184
and the herring
head back out to deeper waters,

314
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,849
leaving behind them fertilised eggs

315
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:49,396
plastered on every rock
and strand of vegetation.

316
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:05,876
They time the spawning so that two
weeks later, when the eggs hatch,

317
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:10,336
the annual plankton bloom will be
at its height, and the fish fry

318
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,581
will have plenty to eat.

319
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:15,164
in the meantime,
these eggs provide food

320
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:18,793
for armies of different animals
below and above the surface.

321
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,638
Millions of birds arrive to collect
a share of the herrings' bounty.

322
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:33,889
Some of it is easily gathered,

323
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:37,765
for millions of eggs have been
washed up onto the shore.

324
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,770
This encapsulated energy

325
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:44,729
is particularly valuable
to migrating birds.

326
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:47,065
These surfbirds are on their way

327
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:51,904
to their breeding grounds in
the Arctic and come down to refuel.

328
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,282
Stranded herring eggs
are just what they need.

329
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,540
Bonaparte gulls collect the eggs

330
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:01,999
just below the surface
of the water.

331
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,789
Further out in the bay,
huge flocks of ducks have gathered.

332
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:11,007
They're mostly surf scoters -

333
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:15,341
diving ducks that can feed
off the bottom several metres down.

334
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,470
There are such huge quantities
of eggs,

335
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:24,721
that even a big animal like a bear

336
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:27,352
finds it worthwhile
to collect them.

337
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:34,269
The spawning of the herring
is a crucial event

338
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:37,649
in the lives of many animals
all along the coast.

339
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:41,275
The whole event coincides
with the plankton bloom,

340
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:44,322
and within three short weeks,
it's all over.

341
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:54,043
The migratory birds leave
to continue their journey north.

342
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:06,048
They will not come back until
the herring also return next year.

343
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,843
As the herring spawning finishes,

344
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,353
other migrants
are starting to arrive offshore.

345
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,732
Grey whales.

346
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,897
They have followed the sun north,

347
00:36:30,074 --> 00:36:32,399
and they too are seeking the food

348
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:35,695
generated by the bloom
of the phytoplankton.

349
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:42,993
Krill are feeding off it, and these
whales are feeding on the krill,

350
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:47,247
skimming it from the surface
with the filter plates of baleen

351
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,579
that hang from their upper jaws.

352
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:54,210
Grey whales make
one of the longest migrations

353
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:56,424
of any marine mammal -

354
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:59,264
a round trip of 12,000 miles or so

355
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:02,550
from their breeding grounds
off Mexico

356
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:07,053
along the entire coast of North
America up to the Arctic 0cean.

357
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,973
They travel close to the coast,

358
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:15,980
with the males and non-breeding
females leading the way.

359
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:20,943
The last to start are cows
that have just given birth.

360
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:25,277
They have to wait until their calves
are sufficiently strong

361
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,574
to tackle such an immense journey.

362
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,746
Their progress is necessarily slow.

363
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:34,072
The mothers stay with their young,

364
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,867
and even a strong calf
only travels at a couple of knots.

365
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:42,161
They stick even closer
to the shore,

366
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,415
often within just 200 metres.

367
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:50,219
Killer whales.

368
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:54,550
They have learnt that grey whales
follow traditional routes.

369
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,800
The killers have no trouble

370
00:37:56,976 --> 00:38:00,724
in overtaking the calf
and its devoted mother.

371
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:08,059
Normally, they continually call
to one another,

372
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,607
but now they have fallen silent.

373
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,854
The grey whale and her calf

374
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,150
have no idea
that they've been targeted.

375
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:41,627
Catching up with the grey whales
is the easy part for the killers.

376
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,463
They have to be cautious

377
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:46,971
for they are only
about half the size of the mother.

378
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:53,935
She can inflict real damage
with her tail.

379
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:05,853
But the killers are after her calf.

380
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:10,074
As long as the mother can keep it
on the move, it will be safe,

381
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:13,492
and she does her best
to hurry it along.

382
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:21,037
At first, the killers avoid getting
too close but just stay alongside.

383
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:26,203
They know that the calf, going at
this speed, will eventually tire.

384
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,926
After three hours of being harried,

385
00:39:39,098 --> 00:39:42,549
the calf becomes too exhausted
to swim any further.

386
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,802
The mother has to stop.

387
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:48,512
This is the moment the killers
have been waiting for.

388
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,186
They start to try and force
themselves between mother and calf.

389
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:19,247
A calf separated from its mother
will not be able to defend itself.

390
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:22,541
Time and again,
the black fins of the killers

391
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:25,005
appear between the grey whales.

392
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:38,553
At last the killers succeed,

393
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,848
and now they've got the calf
on its own,

394
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,099
they change their tactics.

395
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,809
They leap right onto the calf,
and try to push it under.

396
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:01,279
They are trying to drown it.

397
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,999
The calf snatches
a desperate breath.

398
00:41:28,101 --> 00:41:31,220
The mother becomes
increasingly agitated.

399
00:41:31,396 --> 00:41:35,309
Frantically, she tries to push
her calf back to the surface

400
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:37,558
so that it can breathe.

401
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:41,978
But now it's so exhausted

402
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:45,357
that it has to be supported
by its mother's body.

403
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,996
The killers won't give up.

404
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:09,335
Like a pack of wolves, they take
turns in harassing the whales.

405
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:33,611
Now, the whole pod is involved.

406
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:46,954
0ne of them takes a bite.

407
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:03,714
Soon, the sea is reddened
with the calf's blood,

408
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:07,005
and the killers close in
for the final act.

409
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,112
The calf is dead.

410
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:37,653
After a six-hour hunt,

411
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:41,162
the killer whales
have finally won their prize.

412
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:48,912
The mother, bereft,

413
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:52,254
has to continue her migration north
on her own.

414
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,963
She leaves behind
the carcass of a calf

415
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,921
that she cherished for 13 months
in her womb,

416
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,634
for which she delayed
her own journey to find food.

417
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:15,017
The 15 killer whales spent over
six hours trying to kill the calf,

418
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:17,398
but having succeeded,

419
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:22,526
they've eaten nothing more
than its lower jaw and its tongue.

420
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:35,075
Valuable food like this
will not go to waste in the ocean.

421
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:38,783
Before long, the carcass
will sink to the very bottom

422
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:40,704
of this deep sea,

423
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:43,998
but even there its flesh
will not be wasted.

424
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:50,922
0ver a mile down, in the total
darkness of the deep ocean,

425
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:53,383
the body of another grey whale,

426
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:55,097
a 30-tonne adult.

427
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:58,431
it settled here
only a few weeks ago.

428
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:04,019
Already, it has attracted
hundreds of hagfish.

429
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,689
These scavengers, over half a metre
long and as thick as your arm,

430
00:45:14,864 --> 00:45:17,485
are only found in the deep sea.

431
00:45:17,658 --> 00:45:21,240
They have been attracted
by the faint whiff of decay

432
00:45:21,411 --> 00:45:24,744
suffusing through the water
for miles around.

433
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:31,416
With their heads buried
in the whale's flesh,

434
00:45:31,586 --> 00:45:35,417
they breathe through gill openings
along their sides.

435
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,996
They're very primitive creatures -

436
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:41,293
not even true fish
for they lack jaws.

437
00:45:41,468 --> 00:45:43,544
They feed, not by biting,

438
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,468
but by rasping off flesh
with two rows of horny teeth.

439
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:51,384
in just a few hours,

440
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,806
a hagfish can eat several times
its own weight of rotting flesh.

441
00:45:59,024 --> 00:46:01,100
Next to arrive,

442
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:03,351
a sleeper shark.

443
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:13,115
it moves so slowly
to conserve energy -

444
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:16,570
an important strategy
for so large an animal

445
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:18,988
surviving in such a poor habitat.

446
00:46:25,753 --> 00:46:28,670
Sleeper sharks live
over a mile down,

447
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:31,294
and grow to over seven metres long.

448
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:38,174
They can go for months
without food, slowly cruising along,

449
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:40,339
waiting for rare bonanzas

450
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,388
such as this one

451
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:44,432
to arrive from above.

452
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:54,690
A whole range of different
deep-sea scavengers

453
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,979
will feast on this carcass
for a long time

454
00:46:58,154 --> 00:47:01,487
before all its nutriment
has been consumed.

455
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:04,484
18 months later,

456
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:08,988
all that is left is a perfect
skeleton stripped bare.

457
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,118
The sun's energy, that was captured
and turned into living tissue

458
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,369
by the floating phytoplankton,

459
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:22,245
has been transferred
to another link in the food chain,

460
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:26,502
and has ended up as far away from
the sun as it is possible to be -

461
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,752
at the bottom of the deep sea.

462
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:33,008
But some energy
also returns from the deep.

463
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:43,640
Millions of opalescent squid
are on their way to the shallows.

464
00:47:43,815 --> 00:47:46,353
They've come up here to mate.

465
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:50,902
As the males grab the females,
their tentacles flush red.

466
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:55,197
For most of the year,

467
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:58,615
these squid live
at a depth of around 500 metres.

468
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:02,652
They are part of these breeding
schools for a few weeks.

469
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,163
just one school was estimated
to contain animals

470
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,740
that weigh around 4,000 tonnes.

471
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,260
Wave after wave
rise from the depths,

472
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,755
and soon the seabed
in the shallows

473
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:30,509
is strewn with dense patches of
egg capsules several metres across.

474
00:48:36,065 --> 00:48:39,267
As each female
adds another capsule to the pile,

475
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:42,775
the males fight
to fertilise its contents.

476
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:02,034
The squid make their huge journey
into the shallows

477
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,622
because their eggs will develop
faster in the warmer water here,

478
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:10,166
and when the young emerge,
they will find more food

479
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:13,675
more easily than they would
in the ocean depths.

480
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:20,007
Dawn the next morning,

481
00:49:20,183 --> 00:49:24,132
and the seabed for miles around
is covered in egg capsules.

482
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:27,726
The squid have all gone.
Many have died,

483
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:31,432
but some will have returned
to their home in the deep.

484
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:34,728
They will not return
to the light of the sun

485
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:39,030
until the next time they are
driven up by the urge to spawn.
