1
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:40,294
In all the seas of the world,
the warm waters of the tropics

2
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:44,215
contain the richest
and most colourful communities.

3
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,975
Coral reefs.

4
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:56,678
They may seem
like underwater paradise,

5
00:00:56,855 --> 00:01:02,061
but they are perpetual
battlegrounds for space.

6
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:08,649
Even the corals
have to fight for it.

7
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:16,202
in this crowded frenetic community,
every individual needs its place,

8
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,908
its own way of surviving.

9
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:30,042
None of these creatures would be
here if it were not for the coral.

10
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:58,986
A coral larva
drifts in the open sea,

11
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:02,154
floating in a soup
of young reef animals.

12
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:20,250
if just one of these coral larvae
survives in a suitable spot,

13
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,876
a new reef will be founded.

14
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:35,299
in just a few days, the larva
changes form and becomes a polyp,

15
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:37,597
similar to a sea anemone.

16
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:44,350
identical copies bud off
and, gradually, a colony develops.

17
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:50,062
Each polyp surrounds itself
with a hard skeleton,

18
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:54,280
and, from this solid base,
begins to grow.

19
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,165
it increases in length
by an impressive 15cms a year.

20
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:20,379
This branching coral
is only two years old.

21
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:23,801
A mature reef can be thousands.

22
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,935
Corals provide the foundations

23
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,393
on which the entire
reef community relies.

24
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,228
Some organisms,

25
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:49,230
like the Christmas tree worms,
actually live within the coral.

26
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:59,821
0thers climb out,
away from the reef,

27
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,750
to filter their food
from the water.

28
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:19,712
As the community grows,

29
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,262
intimate relationships form,

30
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:26,976
and different creatures
become dependant on one another.

31
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:34,689
Even animals that spend much
of their time travelling in the ocean

32
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,529
return to the reef for a clean.

33
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:52,737
Coral reefs can be home
to astounding numbers of fish.

34
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:12,549
Here swim the smallest
and the largest fish in the sea.

35
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:23,180
Whale sharks are only visitors.

36
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:27,567
When currents bring nutrient-rich
water up from the deep,

37
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,811
they come here to feed.

38
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,820
All these animals are here

39
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:43,953
because of the coral.

40
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,336
This extraordinary complex maze
is built, layer upon layer,

41
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:57,212
by millions and millions
of individual animals -

42
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:59,043
polyps.

43
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:16,225
Each polyp's flesh is supported
by a limestone skeleton.

44
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,812
Below the gut...

45
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:31,694
..is the place
where most of the growth occurs.

46
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:37,206
Here, the living tissue deposits
an intricate lattice of limestone.

47
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:46,370
Beneath that,
the limestone skeleton is bare,

48
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:49,880
having been vacated
by the living coral tissues.

49
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,209
This is the hard structure
that forms the foundation of the reef.

50
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:58,756
A single reef can extend
for many miles.

51
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,314
Coral reefs are only found
in the clear, warm,

52
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,945
shallow waters of the tropics.

53
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:30,319
Sunlight is vital to them,
even though they are animals,

54
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:36,701
because inside their flesh live
millions of tiny single-cell algae,

55
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,538
plants.

56
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:45,844
And all plants need sunlight
to photosynthesise sugars.

57
00:07:55,685 --> 00:08:01,437
98% of the food the corals consume
is produced by the algae.

58
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,559
Without them,

59
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,142
the reef would not exist.

60
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:20,484
Like any plant, algae need
just the right amount of light.

61
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:23,414
Not too much, not too little.

62
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:32,290
The corals regulate that
with pigments that we can only see

63
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:36,924
when they are illuminated
by ultraviolet light.

64
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,537
Most corals, for protection,

65
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,409
spend the day withdrawn
into their stony fortresses.

66
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:28,007
Even then they are not safe
from the jaws of these butterfly fish.

67
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:49,519
At night, the corals take in water,

68
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:54,352
expand their tentacles
and emerge to feed.

69
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,580
They collect plankton.

70
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:20,297
Each tentacle has stinging cells,
which fire on contact.

71
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:25,376
0nce the prey is caught, it's passed
down to the polyp's mouth.

72
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:37,602
it is at night,
when the polyps are extended,

73
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,313
that they add to the limestone
foundations beneath them.

74
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,992
inevitably, the corals
begin to overgrow each other,

75
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,996
and that means trouble.

76
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,708
When neighbours get too close,

77
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,745
they detect
one another's presence chemically.

78
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:17,252
The aggressor on the right
prepares for battle.

79
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,097
The polyps extrude their guts

80
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:34,730
and simply
digest their rivals alive.

81
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,953
A no-man's-land -
a band of white skeleton -

82
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:06,039
is the only evidence
of the night's border dispute.

83
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:19,132
Some corals are targeted
by yet more deadly predators.

84
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:32,353
Predators that can crawl
in search of their victims.

85
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:36,020
Crown of thorns starfish -

86
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:39,981
poisonous,
invincible eating machines.

87
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,161
They also extrude their gut
and digest coral wholesale.

88
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:05,671
But some corals have help.

89
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:10,258
Small crabs living within their
branches resist these onslaughts

90
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:13,220
and defend their home.

91
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,772
From beneath, they launch an attack

92
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:29,563
on the vulnerable underside
of the starfish.

93
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:49,663
Even the crown of thorns
will retreat

94
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,958
from such a determined attack.

95
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,087
This coral is left unharmed.

96
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:09,177
Humphead parrotfish,
nearly a metre and a half in length.

97
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:14,774
Their jaws are so powerful
they can bite through rock.

98
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:23,687
When they descend to feed,
the reef itself is under threat.

99
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,334
They are indiscriminate feeders,

100
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:43,744
taking both rock and coral alike
in their quest for algae.

101
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,807
These fish play a large part
in the erosion of the reef.

102
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:04,845
The rock and coral emerges later
as a fine sand.

103
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:09,815
0n a single reef, they can produce
tonnes of it every year.

104
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:27,912
This soft sand
forms the tropical beaches

105
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,408
that we find so alluring.

106
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:46,548
0ver time, the sand builds up
to form an island,

107
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:50,423
which is then colonised
by animals and plants.

108
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,980
Trees take root.

109
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:03,024
Birds arrive.

110
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:14,483
The guano from thousands of terns
which have chosen to nest here

111
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:19,951
enriches the sandy soil,
which then can support more plants.

112
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:25,121
But these terns,
like other seabirds,

113
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,453
depend on the ocean for their food.

114
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:43,514
Below water, there is not only
competition for living space,

115
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:48,392
but a continual contest
between predators and prey.

116
00:16:55,277 --> 00:17:00,270
it's the arms race between them
that over millions of years

117
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:05,274
has produced today's
extraordinary diversity of form.

118
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,414
jacks are one of the key predators
on the reef.

119
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,125
Their weapon is speed.

120
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:40,053
They seek silversides,
whose defence is to congregate

121
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:44,096
in confusing shoals
of shimmering silver.

122
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:54,106
The jacks deal with that by herding
the silversides onto the reef.

123
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,704
Here, the jacks
have a better chance

124
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:06,454
of separating individual fish
from the shoal.

125
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:24,342
The jacks can now catch
the isolated individuals

126
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:26,589
with lightning attacks.

127
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:43,734
it's far safer to be hidden
on the reef itself,

128
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:47,604
within the tunnels of a sponge,
for example.

129
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:52,609
These tiny shrimp are no bigger
than grains of rice.

130
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,496
These shrimps are unique.

131
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,742
it's recently been discovered

132
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:05,251
that they have
a highly-sophisticated social system,

133
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,164
similar to that of bees.

134
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,288
All members of the colony
are the offspring of one female.

135
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,796
She is the queen
and the only one to produce eggs.

136
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,892
As in a colony of bees,

137
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:31,648
different individuals are
specialised for particular tasks.

138
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,023
Some are guards and are armed

139
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:37,728
with particularly
large and powerful claws.

140
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:46,403
They are on watch at all times,
ready to tackle intruders.

141
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:04,005
A polychaete worm. For it, a sponge
is an excellent hunting ground.

142
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:27,019
in such a maze of tunnels,
attack can come at any time

143
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,269
from any quarter.

144
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,418
0nce the guards are alerted,
the worm loses its advantage.

145
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,602
Better to retreat intact
than risk serious injury.

146
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,857
The sponge not only makes
a safe home for the shrimps,

147
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:26,986
it also supplies them with food,
so they never need venture outside.

148
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,989
An establishment that provides
all their needs

149
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:34,078
is clearly well worth defending.

150
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:37,655
just as shrimps guard their home,

151
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:41,284
other animals defend
their hunting grounds.

152
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:51,921
Glassfish make tempting prey
for the redmouth grouper.

153
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:55,712
its strategy is to swim
slowly amongst them

154
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,055
till they no longer see it
as a threat.

155
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:12,606
There are other fish here, too.

156
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:15,896
Lionfish are ambush predators,

157
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:21,657
taking their time
and watching for the right moment.

158
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:25,989
But there isn't room here
for two predators.

159
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:38,544
The grouper, braving the lionfish's
poisonous spines,

160
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:40,790
tries to evict its rival.

161
00:22:57,771 --> 00:23:00,059
But lionfish are persistent.

162
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:06,185
This grouper spent many hours
simply defending his hunting patch.

163
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:27,165
Some animals prefer to avoid
conflict whenever possible.

164
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:31,961
These harlequin shrimp,
having captured a starfish,

165
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:34,622
are taking it back to a safe house

166
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,334
beyond the reach
of competitors and danger.

167
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:42,259
The problem is that starfish
have minds of their own

168
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:45,384
and five large sticky arms.

169
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,019
By the time the shrimps
have prised off one arm,

170
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:54,477
another has reattached itself.

171
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:09,658
0nly by manoeuvring
the starfish onto its back

172
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:13,492
can they have any hope
of gaining the advantage.

173
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,542
Even so, getting it back home

174
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,206
is a major undertaking.

175
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:41,224
The starfish
is now a living larder.

176
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:47,099
if the shrimps can hang onto it,
it will feed them for days to come.

177
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:49,978
The top of the reef
is usually covered

178
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:54,397
by a thin layer of green algae,
another living larder.

179
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:58,438
And many fish depend on it.

180
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:07,492
Powder blue tangs
defend their right

181
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:10,665
to graze on a particular patch.

182
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:14,665
But, for a larder as well stocked
as this, there is always competition.

183
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:44,482
When a shoal of convict tangs
decide to graze,

184
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:46,775
little can stop them.

185
00:25:56,453 --> 00:25:59,323
The powder blue tangs
try to keep them off...

186
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:13,585
..but they are overwhelmed
by sheer numbers.

187
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:23,088
The territory is stripped of algae
in minutes.

188
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:43,020
The blue tangs appear
to be fighting a losing battle.

189
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:52,662
But, eventually,
they begin to get the upper hand.

190
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,833
They persist with their attacks

191
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:13,261
until the marauders
are well on their way.

192
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:33,773
When night falls, some very strange
creatures creep out of crevices

193
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:36,698
and crawl over the reef.

194
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,914
This moving bush is an animal -

195
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:52,745
a basket star -

196
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,711
which spreads out its arms
to catch the night's plankton.

197
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:22,984
The reef becomes
uncannily tranquil.

198
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:29,525
Fish retire, hiding themselves
where they can.

199
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:33,744
Marbled rays come out to hunt
for prey buried in the sand...

200
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:40,368
..using electro-receptors
to scan the seabed.

201
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:49,169
Their activity attracts sharks.

202
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:10,479
White tips.

203
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:39,839
At night, when vision is of little use,
sharks have a real advantage.

204
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:47,007
They can still use both smell
and electro-reception to track fish.

205
00:30:55,439 --> 00:31:01,558
These sharks are also hunting
for fish concealed within the reef.

206
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,656
Their slender shape

207
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:14,486
enables them to squeeze
through surprisingly narrow gaps.

208
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:29,587
There is nowhere to hide.

209
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:52,474
Few animals are safe
during these feeding frenzies.

210
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:51,110
Night after night, the reef animals
are subjected to these raids.

211
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:12,920
But life on the reef
is not just about food,

212
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:15,627
it's also about sex.

213
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:21,298
There are many different
breeding strategies,

214
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:26,712
but each is aimed at maximising
the number of young that will survive.

215
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:34,015
Every afternoon for two months,
brown surgeonfish can be seen

216
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:37,059
streaming across reefs
in the Red Sea.

217
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:41,772
They all head for the same place,

218
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:44,780
usually some prominent feature.

219
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:53,995
Here, they wait
for the light to fade.

220
00:33:56,707 --> 00:34:00,241
Suddenly, females within the group

221
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:03,869
make a dash away from the reef
to release their eggs.

222
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:07,663
They're followed
by the quickest and closest males,

223
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:11,920
all of whom are striving
to fertilise the eggs.

224
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,938
inevitably, others come here
to feast on such easy food.

225
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:38,063
As the surgeonfish spawn,

226
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,865
fusiliers move in above
to eat the nutritious eggs.

227
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,256
These are just the first
of many predators which will feed

228
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:10,050
on the eggs and developing larvae

229
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:13,389
as they drift
during the next few weeks.

230
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,724
0ther fish are less casual
about their eggs.

231
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:30,645
Banded pipefish stay close
to a small chosen area on the reef.

232
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:34,820
Every morning at sunrise,
the female leaves her sleeping site

233
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:36,949
and swims to find her partner.

234
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,660
For ten minutes or so,
they remain together,

235
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:49,542
reaffirming the bond that is
essential to their partnership.

236
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:59,173
They swim together
around his territory

237
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,633
in a simple greeting dance.

238
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:08,715
Throughout the summer,
when the female's eggs are ripe,

239
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:12,476
courtship begins in earnest
in the early morning.

240
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:17,189
it takes time. After about two hours,
they rise off the seabed,

241
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,609
entwining their two bodies.

242
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:29,320
The male rubs himself
against the female,

243
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:33,325
stimulating her
to release her eggs.

244
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,706
And now, swiftly,
the male takes them.

245
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,135
The eggs, now stuck to his belly,

246
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:55,169
are patted down
to ensure that they stay there.

247
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,276
The female then leaves him,

248
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,992
but, every morning, returns for
a session of synchronised swimming

249
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:28,241
and so ensures
that their bond is maintained.

250
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:35,626
Ten days later, under the cover of
darkness, the male shakes his body

251
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:39,081
and the young pipefish are born.

252
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:50,929
0nly now are they
independent of their parents.

253
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:57,219
Since the male takes charge
of the eggs as soon as they are laid,

254
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:00,480
the female can start
producing the next batch.

255
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:04,728
Without his help, the pair could
only breed every 20 days,

256
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:06,562
rather than every ten.

257
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:08,813
By sharing the work, they double

258
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:12,856
the number of young
they can produce in any one year.

259
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,241
A flamboyant cuttlefish.

260
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:36,008
Unlike most cuttlefish, this one
spends much of its time walking,

261
00:38:36,177 --> 00:38:39,012
rather than jetting
across the seabed.

262
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,255
This is a male.

263
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,097
He is using his colourful display

264
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:55,522
to try and seduce the larger female,
who seems unimpressed.

265
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,238
Eventually, she concedes.

266
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:18,249
The final event, the transfer
of sperm, is very quick.

267
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,915
(WHALE S0NG)

268
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,346
A singing male humpback whale.

269
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:56,482
Humpbacks are only visitors
to the reef.

270
00:39:56,657 --> 00:40:00,191
After a pregnancy
that lasted a whole year,

271
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:05,575
the females come here to give birth
and suckle their newly-born young.

272
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:09,958
Their investment in their single
offspring is considerable,

273
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:12,913
for each female
will continue to nurse it

274
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:15,293
for a further six to 12 months.

275
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:18,914
But the males are here to mate.

276
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:32,557
The lone males sing to establish
their relative seniority.

277
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:42,727
The louder and longer the song,
the bigger and stronger the singer.

278
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:19,922
The better the song,
the larger the male,

279
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:23,846
the more mating opportunities
he will get.

280
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:31,812
All these different mating
strategies have the same aim -

281
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:36,026
to ensure that the greatest
possible number of offspring

282
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,313
will live long enough
to breed themselves.

283
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:47,572
Corals also reproduce sexually,

284
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:53,165
but being fixed to the seabed,
they can't move to find a mate.

285
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:58,124
Somehow, they must synchronise
their sexual activity.

286
00:41:58,295 --> 00:42:02,244
They do so using the rising
water temperatures of spring

287
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:04,296
and the phases of the moon.

288
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:20,097
A few days after the full moon
in late spring,

289
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,140
when tidal currents
are at their weakest,

290
00:42:23,314 --> 00:42:27,975
the corals of the Great Barrier Reef
are ready to spawn.

291
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:40,274
Some corals are male
and release clouds of sperm.

292
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:44,865
Nearby, a female
will be releasing eggs.

293
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:05,762
0ther species of coral
are both male and female.

294
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:12,806
These release packages of eggs

295
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:16,062
already pre-wrapped in sperm.

296
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:13,308
Bundles of eggs and sperm
float to the surface

297
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,861
to mix with others
from further along the reef.

298
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,530
Each kind of coral
times its release

299
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:28,573
to a certain hour
on a certain night.

300
00:44:28,747 --> 00:44:32,790
That maximises the chances
for cross-fertilisation.

301
00:44:39,964 --> 00:44:41,837
The fertilised eggs

302
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,758
drift away from the reef.

303
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,788
The stormy season brings real
danger to the animals of the reef.

304
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:33,255
Lobsters in the Caribbean
sense a change in the water.

305
00:45:33,423 --> 00:45:37,751
The temperature drops and powerful
swells disturb the sand.

306
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,675
Under the cover of darkness,

307
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:46,013
they emerge to run before the storm

308
00:45:46,183 --> 00:45:49,930
and risk crossing
the exposed sand flats

309
00:45:50,102 --> 00:45:53,186
to seek shelter in deeper water.

310
00:45:58,317 --> 00:46:01,271
Every year they make this journey.

311
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,945
From all over the reef,
lobsters come to join the march.

312
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:18,540
They conserve energy by travelling
in one another's slipstream.

313
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:28,956
And there is the added benefit

314
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:31,209
of safety in numbers.

315
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:48,304
By daybreak, they've reached
the edge of the deep reef

316
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:50,141
and down they go.

317
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:52,854
For the rest of the stormy season,

318
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:56,478
they will remain in the shelter
of deep water,

319
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:58,612
out of harm's way.

320
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:20,415
Sometimes, during the stormy
season, a hurricane builds.

321
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:25,714
Then the very structure
of the reef itself is under threat.

322
00:48:56,249 --> 00:49:02,002
An entire reef can be destroyed
by just one big storm.

323
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:07,377
Hundreds of years of growth
gone in a few hours.

324
00:49:24,563 --> 00:49:29,141
Out in the ocean,
new life continues to develop.

325
00:49:29,317 --> 00:49:34,820
in time, coral larvae will return
to colonise the rubble

326
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:39,032
and a new reef will grow
on the wasteland.
