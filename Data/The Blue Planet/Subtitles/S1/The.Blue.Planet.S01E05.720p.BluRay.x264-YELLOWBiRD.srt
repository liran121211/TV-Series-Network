1
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:41,387
There are some seas
where fish swarm in millions...

2
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:48,138
..and plankton blossoms
in vast clouds.

3
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:55,565
The sheer quantity of life here is
unmatched anywhere in the oceans.

4
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:06,869
These are the most productive seas
on Earth.

5
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:15,250
They are the Seasonal Seas.

6
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,968
The Seasonal Seas border
the temperate zones,

7
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,473
where conditions change
through the year.

8
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:37,737
The seasons also affect
the underwater world.

9
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:43,822
The power of the sun
is constantly changing.

10
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,785
in the far north,
during the summer,

11
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,496
there are long hours of sunlight,

12
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:58,174
but in winter, that dwindles,
and there can be weeks of darkness.

13
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,338
The summers are warm and gentle,

14
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:06,724
the winters
racked by savage storms.

15
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:05,987
in conditions like this,
life of any sort

16
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,277
has to struggle to survive.

17
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:18,702
january on Sable island
off the coast of Nova Scotia.

18
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,665
Grey seals
have managed to get ashore

19
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,377
through the crashing breakers.

20
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,345
Gales here can blow
for days on end.

21
00:03:56,373 --> 00:04:01,284
Sable island has the world's
largest colony of grey seals.

22
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,665
100,000 come here
to breed each year,

23
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,125
just when the weather
is at its worst.

24
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,475
To add insult to injury,

25
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:21,981
the pups, having suckled for
only 18 days, are then abandoned.

26
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:26,894
Their mothers must return to
the sea to find food for themselves.

27
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:34,281
As yet unable to dive,
the pups are marooned,

28
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:37,488
sustained only
by their fatty blubber.

29
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:44,286
it will be five weeks before
they are strong enough to swim,

30
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:50,915
but then it will be spring and
the ocean will be teeming with food.

31
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:10,315
By May, spring has reached
the coasts of Scotland.

32
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:16,191
Underwater, it arrived
rather earlier.

33
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:19,155
in March,
the seas had warmed enough

34
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,579
to trigger
a magical transformation.

35
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,296
These are phytoplankton -

36
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:41,932
tiny floating algae,
each much smaller than a pinhead.

37
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,675
They multiply with amazing speed

38
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:50,228
to produce more annual growth
than all the plants on land together -

39
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,773
six billion tonnes of it.

40
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:59,690
This immense bloom spreads
across the face of the ocean

41
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:02,241
and, within a couple of months,

42
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:06,410
turns vast areas of it
a dense green.

43
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:13,044
Animal life
reacts to the blooming sea.

44
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:18,375
These look like small anemones,
but they're about to change.

45
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:24,508
They separate, revealing themselves
to be tiny common jellyfish.

46
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,898
They are less
than three millimetres across.

47
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:41,239
Within a few months, they will
have assembled into vast swarms.

48
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:50,200
Minute copepods
are part of their staple diet.

49
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,294
These appear every spring
in vast numbers

50
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:57,507
and graze
on the phytoplankton bloom.

51
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:04,297
Their beating legs create currents
that sweep the little algae

52
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:07,308
into the filters
round their mouths.

53
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:16,019
0n this microscopic scale,
water is so viscous

54
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:20,570
that the phytoplankton
can't swim against the current.

55
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:25,862
Whilst feeding,
sensors on the copepod's antennae

56
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:28,527
give warning of dangers ahead.

57
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,833
Lighting by lasers

58
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:39,166
reveals that feeding copepods
leave wakes behind them,

59
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,417
like jet trails in the sky.

60
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:03,150
Slightly larger floating predators

61
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:08,150
are able to use these trails
to find their prey.

62
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:27,545
A close call, but some predators
are simply too large to avoid.

63
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:37,271
jellyfish.

64
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:45,484
They may appear to be delicate
as well as beautiful,

65
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,111
but they are deadly hunters.

66
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,155
With every pulse
of the delicate bells,

67
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:33,451
plankton-rich water is drawn
into their lacy throats

68
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:39,657
and pushed out again, leaving
copepods stuck to the membranes.

69
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,138
A single sea-nettle jellyfish,
only a few centimetres across,

70
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:57,254
can collect thousands
of copepods in a day.

71
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:14,117
So, the killing power of giants
like these is hard to estimate.

72
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,822
Each of these jellyfish
weighs up to 30 kilos

73
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,955
and has tentacles
stretching over eight metres.

74
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:35,048
But there are even greater dangers
awaiting the copepods.

75
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:40,972
By late spring, the baby
common jellyfish are fully grown.

76
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,512
They gather in millions,

77
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,473
forming swarms
hundreds of metres long,

78
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:53,987
which filter out all the small
planktonic animals in their path.

79
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:48,073
Nevertheless, there are such
astronomic numbers of copepods

80
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,995
that enough will survive
to form swarms of their own.

81
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,263
A basking shark.

82
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:17,110
This huge eight-tonne fish
feeds on plankton and nothing else.

83
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,902
Every hour it filters 1,000 tonnes
of seawater through its gills.

84
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:32,496
Numbers of these shark appear
when the bloom is at its peak

85
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:37,295
and travel along currents
where the plankton is thickest.

86
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,720
Even so, the supply of plankton
is so abundant

87
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,138
that another group of animals
can feast -

88
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,225
animals that live on the sea floor.

89
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:59,724
Every centimetre of rock is covered
with invertebrates of some kind -

90
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:03,106
anemones, sea squirts, gorgonians -

91
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,410
all trapping plankton
from the passing water.

92
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:54,662
Not all life in the Seasonal Seas
depends upon plankton.

93
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:58,664
it is early spring
in British Columbia.

94
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:04,670
Seaweed has started to grow slowly
in the cold water.

95
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,089
As the hours of sunlight increase
and the water warms,

96
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:14,475
these small plants turn into
great beds of bull kelp.

97
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:26,562
The immense 30-metre long strands

98
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:30,866
have small gas-filled floats
which keep them high in the water,

99
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:34,237
within reach
of the energy-giving sunlight.

100
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:47,798
Further south,
the sunshine is more powerful,

101
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:51,003
so here,
on the coast of California,

102
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,966
the biggest kelp of all can grow.

103
00:14:56,308 --> 00:15:00,057
This is giant kelp,
and by midsummer,

104
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:05,769
each plant is growing in length
by nearly a metre a day.

105
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:17,486
The main stem is fixed
to the bottom 35 metres below

106
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:22,455
by a small
but immensely strong holdfast.

107
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:25,960
Fully grown,

108
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:30,957
these gigantic plants
are 100 metres long

109
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:33,886
and they form vast marine forests.

110
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:39,433
Great schools of fish
find sanctuary here.

111
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:49,308
These are blacksmith fish.

112
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:54,194
They are plankton feeders
and, whenever it seems safe,

113
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:59,442
they head into open water to feed
where the plankton is thickest.

114
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:05,074
But at the first hint of danger...

115
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:10,536
..they rush back to the safety
of the forest.

116
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:19,469
Fish are not the only creatures
that shelter here.

117
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:28,604
Californian sea otters
gather in the kelp forest

118
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:31,940
to rest and snooze in safety.

119
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,946
To prevent themselves
being carried away

120
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:41,195
into dangerous open water
where the big predators cruise,

121
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:46,411
they anchor themselves by winding
straps of kelp around their body.

122
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,128
Sooner or later,
they have to find food,

123
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,250
and that lies on the seabed
a long way below them.

124
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:04,723
Sea otters, however, can stay
underwater for up to ten minutes,

125
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:09,056
ample time to find
the shellfish they need.

126
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:43,043
Many of the smaller creatures
that live in these forests,

127
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:45,463
such as urchins, graze on the kelp

128
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,768
and can seriously damage it
if their numbers are unchecked.

129
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,972
The sea otters
feed on some of these grazers

130
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:56,065
and prevent them
getting too numerous.

131
00:17:56,234 --> 00:18:01,904
So, in effect, the sea otters
are the guardians of the forest.

132
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:09,993
Garibaldi fish do not,
in fact, damage the kelp.

133
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:12,323
if anything, they help it

134
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,162
by picking off tiny animals
that encrust the leaves.

135
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,341
They graze on bryozoans,
tiny colonial animals

136
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:28,086
which build their colonies

137
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:32,559
like a patchwork of white skins
on the leaves.

138
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:48,900
When night falls, there are
fewer predatory fish around,

139
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:53,454
and the bryozoans emerge
from their white shelters.

140
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:01,622
Now, just like coral polyps,

141
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:06,210
they start filtering out the
plankton under cover of darkness.

142
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:16,182
They're not the only animals
to venture out at this time.

143
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:25,059
This is an amphipod,
just two centimetres long,

144
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:28,238
and it does eat kelp.

145
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:34,703
in turn,

146
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,537
it is excellent food
for many predators.

147
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:49,841
To protect itself, it produces
silk, just like a spider,

148
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:54,472
and uses it to sew together
two sides of a kelp frond

149
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:56,598
and so form a shelter.

150
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:08,023
This one is in particular need
of a secure home.

151
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:10,272
She's a mother.

152
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:18,618
There are over 50 youngsters
clustered on her abdomen,

153
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,289
so her home is becoming
somewhat cramped.

154
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:26,123
They will soon
be old enough to leave,

155
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:29,132
and, whenever she can,
she kicks them out

156
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,755
to get a taste of the outside world.

157
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:43,186
Dawn.

158
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:47,476
Beds of eel grass
grow in the shallows

159
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:51,102
between the kelp forest
and the shore.

160
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:55,523
A harbour seal
has found sanctuary here,

161
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:59,994
and is sleeping
after a hard night's foraging.

162
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,577
But not for long.

163
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:10,631
A male seal gives a wake-up call.

164
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,635
More seals are attracted
from all directions.

165
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:31,773
it's june, the time
when young male harbour seals

166
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,566
start their strange
mating displays.

167
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,954
0ne listens attentively to the
grunting noises made by the other.

168
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,666
These calls are almost certainly
a way of establishing

169
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:53,126
which of the two will be dominant.

170
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:03,887
But if the animals are closely
matched in size and experience,

171
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,217
grunts won't settle the issue.

172
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:09,561
The rivals
will have to come to blows.

173
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:17,812
And seals can be
surprisingly violent.

174
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,326
in a month's time,

175
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:36,544
the breeding season will start
and then fights will be in earnest,

176
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:40,665
but now, in midsummer,
these exchanges are harmless.

177
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,672
They're just playing.

178
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:48,891
Many of the creatures
that shelter in the kelp

179
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:51,552
have to venture out
in order to feed.

180
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,563
The bat ray for one.

181
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:00,770
Unlikely though it seems,

182
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:03,024
the sandy floor of the open sea

183
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,070
is, for the bat ray,
a rich feeding ground.

184
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,426
There is food
hidden within the sand,

185
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:28,380
and the bat ray has
a special technique for finding it.

186
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:35,933
it uses jets of water

187
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:41,730
to blow the sand aside
and expose small invertebrates.

188
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:49,489
A kelp bass hangs about alongside
waiting for scraps.

189
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:13,927
0ther hunters
are also on the prowl.

190
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:18,518
The fan-tailed sole.

191
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:34,619
There are mantid shrimps here,
living in tunnels.

192
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:43,080
But, once again, hunger compels
them to venture into the open.

193
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:46,126
That, of course, is a gamble.

194
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:51,218
They will either eat...

195
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:55,091
..or be eaten.

196
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:05,813
A sea slug called janolus.

197
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:09,984
its colours suggest
that it is poisonous,

198
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:15,496
and so it is, to everything
except another kind of sea slug...

199
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,959
..the predatory Navanax.

200
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,714
Navanax pulls itself
along the trail of slime

201
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,591
that janolus leaves behind it.

202
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:53,942
0nce caught,
janolus rolls into a ball.

203
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,036
All Navanax gets
is a few yellow tentacles.

204
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:13,050
And janolus is swept to safety
by the current.

205
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:25,765
it's now midsummer, and the sun is
shining at full strength.

206
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:31,606
The increasing warmth is the cue

207
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:35,858
for an Atlantic lobster
to start on a long journey.

208
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:40,908
She's spent the winter 250 metres down,
far beyond the reach of the storms.

209
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:48,417
But it was cold down there and now
she needs to find warmer water,

210
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:52,121
so she's marching
towards the shallows.

211
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:55,916
They, however,
are 150 kilometres away.

212
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:08,144
After a month of walking, she arrives
at her favoured sand bank.

213
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,770
But she is not the first here.

214
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:16,937
Dozens of other lobsters
have already dug homes in the sand

215
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:21,326
and they don't intend
to surrender them to newcomers.

216
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:58,399
Size counts for everything
in these battles.

217
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:00,897
The new arrival
is in need of a pit,

218
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:07,693
and since she weighs a hefty seven
kilos, she'll probably get one.

219
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:23,294
She has won.

220
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:32,553
These battles continue
for the next two months,

221
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,438
and they are crucial,

222
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:39,019
for the females must have shelter
and warm water to raise young.

223
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:40,854
For the last seven months,

224
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,109
each female has been carrying
about 20,000 fertilised eggs,

225
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:49,530
but their task
is approaching its end.

226
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:54,247
The warmth of the shallows
is speeding the eggs' development.

227
00:28:56,002 --> 00:29:01,507
Two more months
and the eggs are ready to hatch.

228
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:23,517
At first, they're not very good
at swimming.

229
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:25,854
But within a few minutes,

230
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:30,361
the babies are able to set off
in a purposeful way.

231
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:37,582
At this time of the year,
the sea is full of larval animals.

232
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,669
This one is a day old lobster.

233
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:45,048
And this - a three-week-old crab -

234
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:49,428
just ready to start its life
on the sea floor.

235
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:54,553
its feet touch the bottom
for the first time.

236
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:03,561
At this stage, it's a vegetarian
with a taste for sea lettuce.

237
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,652
As it grows,
it will repeatedly moult

238
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:10,025
and expand into a bigger,
thicker skin.

239
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,773
The chances are it will be eaten,

240
00:30:12,952 --> 00:30:18,326
but if it survives for five years,
it will become an armoured giant.

241
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,413
Now it eats meat,

242
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:33,301
and special adaptations
enable it to hunt in the dark.

243
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:40,178
its jointed feet
are covered in sensors

244
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:45,858
which detect the slightest chemical
change in its surroundings.

245
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:49,111
As it walks through the darkness,

246
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,229
its feet can, literally,
taste the sand.

247
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:58,109
As soon as it finds suitable food,

248
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:02,072
it passes it forward
to its powerful crushing claws,

249
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,204
which make light work
of the soft flesh.

250
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:09,210
And those claws are also
very useful for defence.

251
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:20,392
A one and a half metre long
common octopus glides by.

252
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:29,145
The jet-propelled giant
is both powerful and very clever.

253
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,533
With octopus about, it's risky
for even a crab to be in the open.

254
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:44,991
Even in the dark,
the octopus's eyes are sensitive

255
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,041
to the slightest movement.

256
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:03,052
Against a hunter like this,
the crab's claws are useless.

257
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:15,111
Late summer in South East Alaska.

258
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,825
The water is still warming,

259
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:27,200
and mysid shrimp
swarm near the surface.

260
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:36,333
it's a final feast
for Pacific salmon

261
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:40,886
returning to the coast
from the open Pacific.

262
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:53,022
They are heading inshore to breed
and they arrive in huge numbers.

263
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:58,068
They have to swim
far up the rivers to spawn,

264
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:01,857
but this river's level
is still too low.

265
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:06,025
They'll have to wait
till rain causes it to rise.

266
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:11,952
For now, they are trapped
in the sea, close to the shore,

267
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:13,918
the worst place to be.

268
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:17,876
A three metre long salmon shark,

269
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,296
a close relation
of the great white.

270
00:33:26,683 --> 00:33:28,343
This one has sensed

271
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:31,934
minute electrical signals
from the salmon nearby.

272
00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:35,556
Shark can maintain
their blood temperature

273
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:39,352
at a higher level
than the surrounding water.

274
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:44,404
And that means they have the energy
to be quick.

275
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:52,080
Quicker than salmon.

276
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:18,846
Early autumn in Vancouver island
in Canada, 600 miles to the south.

277
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:22,940
The ocean temperature
is slowly dropping.

278
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:25,402
40 metres below the surface,

279
00:34:25,574 --> 00:34:31,197
this year's baby herring feed
on the last of the summer plankton.

280
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:36,578
Their movements attract attention
from the skies above.

281
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,467
Gulls can't dive,

282
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:50,634
so for now,
the fish are still safe.

283
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:56,310
But there are birds which CAN dive.

284
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,730
Auklets and murres swim with ease
down beneath the school.

285
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:09,482
The panicked herring are forced
towards the surface.

286
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:24,078
They gather into a giant
defensive ball of swirling fish.

287
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:29,426
The commotion attracts
yellowtail rockfish.

288
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,550
They, too, are hunters.

289
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:46,648
The marauding fish
scatter the herring.

290
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:01,157
Repeated attacks split the ball
into numerous smaller groups.

291
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:09,582
Now, it's easier for the divers

292
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:13,459
to keep the confused fish
penned at the surface.

293
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,963
Even the gulls can get at them.

294
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,824
Attacked from all sides, the little
fish have virtually no chance.

295
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:44,872
More and more divers
are attracted to the scene.

296
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,166
They harry the shrinking numbers
of herring

297
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:55,378
right down
to the very last individual.

298
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,068
Far bigger predators
cruise here, too.

299
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:20,490
Pacific white-sided dolphin.

300
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:27,287
But the dolphin
are mainly nocturnal hunters.

301
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:30,745
During the day,
they concentrate on socialising.

302
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:35,963
They display by releasing streams
of bubbles

303
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:38,423
and they play games.

304
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:45,090
Games like pass the seaweed,
for example.

305
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:24,381
Exactly eight months ago,
in the winter off Western Scotland,

306
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:29,931
an egg was laid and securely fixed
to a strand of kelp.

307
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:34,351
inside, a tiny embryo
started to develop.

308
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:45,493
Protected by the tough egg case,

309
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:49,326
it endured
the worst of the winter storms.

310
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,668
By summer, it was half-grown.

311
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:18,525
Now, at last, in late autumn,
it's nearly ready to hatch.

312
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:30,201
A fully-formed miniature shark
swims free.

313
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:33,288
This year's plankton will soon die,

314
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,031
but the dogfish is so well developed

315
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,793
that it can hunt immediately
for larger prey.

316
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:44,628
The days are getting shorter now.

317
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:51,008
in British Columbia,
the water begins to chill.

318
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:55,726
This bizarre-looking creature
is searching the kelp for food.

319
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:01,816
This is Melibe -
the hooded sea slug.

320
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,823
it catches plankton
with its net-like head.

321
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:23,036
As winter approaches,
plankton is becoming scarce,

322
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:27,378
but Melibe
is an assiduous searcher.

323
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,463
it can swim.

324
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,930
it flaps away to look
for a better feeding spot,

325
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:44,939
but its search is becoming
increasingly difficult.

326
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:50,235
Within the next two weeks, most of
the plankton will have disappeared.

327
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,833
As the sunlight
becomes ever more feeble,

328
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:07,540
the kelp starts to die,
gradually rotting away to nothing.

329
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,907
Soon, it will be winter.

330
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:54,254
But 9,000 miles to the south,
the sun is rising on a new spring day.

331
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:59,767
The southern hemisphere, too,
has temperate regions.

332
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:04,180
And now the plankton is beginning
to bloom around Tasmania.

333
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:07,558
just as in the north,

334
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:12,774
the Southern Seasonal Seas
have areas of rich green water...

335
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,445
..with their own kelp forests...

336
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:22,830
..and their own swarms of plankton.

337
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:33,085
Some of the inhabitants
of these seas

338
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:36,045
live only
in the southern hemisphere.

339
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:39,670
This is one of them -
the handfish -

340
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:44,260
that strolls around
on modified fins.

341
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:52,265
But, when needs must,
it can resort to tail power.

342
00:42:56,864 --> 00:43:01,325
Every summer, visitors come
to the shallows around Tasmania.

343
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:06,405
These are Australian squid,
about half a metre long.

344
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:11,915
They are here to breed.

345
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:21,927
The larger males compete
for the attentions of a female,

346
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:25,051
displaying towards her
and to one another,

347
00:43:25,225 --> 00:43:29,934
by putting on a ballet,
continually changing costume colour.

348
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,711
Eventually,

349
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:04,341
they form pairs.

350
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:14,348
A male passes a packet of sperm
across to the female.

351
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:21,361
After the eggs
have been fertilised,

352
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,741
they are deposited
in tough, rubbery egg cases

353
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,444
that other creatures find poisonous.

354
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:35,576
Within three weeks,
the babies are ready to hatch out.

355
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:44,753
They are already
able to change colour,

356
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:47,549
but aren't so good at swimming.

357
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:10,785
There is another animal here
that is a rather more devoted parent.

358
00:45:10,953 --> 00:45:15,662
This is a male leafy sea dragon,

359
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:19,747
an exquisitely-decorated relative
of the sea horse.

360
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,840
He is carrying his partner's eggs
around with him.

361
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:30,422
They would be a nutritious snack
for any predator that found them.

362
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:34,512
But that's not easy
because the eggs are attached

363
00:45:34,685 --> 00:45:38,599
to their father's
perfectly-camouflaged body.

364
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:42,390
They could scarcely be
in a safer place.

365
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:12,511
By November,
10,000 miles to the north,

366
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,005
winter has arrived.

367
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:19,310
Norway now gets less than
five hours of daylight in every 24.

368
00:46:19,478 --> 00:46:22,479
The temperature is falling rapidly.

369
00:46:25,192 --> 00:46:29,521
But, despite the cold,
the sea is far from deserted.

370
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:33,825
Every winter, 500 million tonnes
of adult herring

371
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:37,077
seek shelter in these deep waters.

372
00:46:39,665 --> 00:46:42,701
They will stay here
for four months,

373
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:46,043
living entirely
on the fat they accumulated

374
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:49,048
during the summer feasts
of plankton.

375
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,588
But they are not alone.

376
00:46:53,053 --> 00:46:54,761
0rca.

377
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:00,350
This pod is part of a population
of some 500 killer whales

378
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:04,931
that specialise in hunting
North Atlantic herring.

379
00:47:06,774 --> 00:47:08,933
(WHALE S0NG)

380
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:22,657
Using their echo location,
they have detected a shoal of herring

381
00:47:22,832 --> 00:47:24,990
50 metres below them.

382
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,583
With enough air
for a ten-minute dive,

383
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:31,708
they swim deep below the herring

384
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,171
and drive the fish upwards.

385
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:42,634
Bubbles stream from the rising fish

386
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,518
as gas in their swim bladders
expands and escapes.

387
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:57,946
Even an orca finds it difficult
to catch a healthy herring.

388
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:02,445
But they have a devastating weapon
all their own.

389
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:14,581
They use their tails to club the fish
with waves of water pressure.

390
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:28,351
Then it's simply a matter
of collecting the stunned casualties.

391
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:44,819
The herrings have no chance.

392
00:48:44,995 --> 00:48:48,578
Both orca and gulls
will eat as much as they can

393
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:51,536
every day for the next four months.

394
00:48:56,423 --> 00:49:00,586
But there are so many fish
wintering here,

395
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,252
over five billion individuals,

396
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,715
that the losses
are almost unnoticeable.

397
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:17,686
Violent as this winter weather
may be,

398
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:23,021
it's essential for the renewal
of the riches of the Seasonal Seas.

399
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,943
0ut in the open oceans,

400
00:49:25,118 --> 00:49:29,411
the surging waters stir up
nutrients from the depths.

401
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:35,501
By the end of winter,

402
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,288
the Seasonal Seas will be
full of minerals once more,

403
00:49:39,465 --> 00:49:45,918
ready for the return of the sun
and the next great plankton bloom.
