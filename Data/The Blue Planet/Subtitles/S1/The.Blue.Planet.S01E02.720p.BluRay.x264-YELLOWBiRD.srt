1
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:38,175
0ver 60 per cent of our planet

2
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,057
is covered by ocean
more than a mile deep.

3
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,773
That, the deep sea,

4
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:46,025
is by far the largest habitat
on Earth

5
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,271
and it's largely unknown.

6
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:55,490
join us on a journey

7
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,871
to the very bottom of the deep sea,

8
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:01,376
to an alien world
never revealed before.

9
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:06,919
it's home to some
of the strangest animals on Earth.

10
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:12,304
Fish flash in the darkness.

11
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,311
New species are discovered

12
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:20,357
on almost every dive.

13
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:24,275
More people have travelled
into space

14
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:26,525
than have ventured this deep.

15
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,088
Come on a journey

16
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:39,799
into the abyss.

17
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,265
A sperm whale takes a breath,

18
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,898
its last for over an hour.

19
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,689
it's about to leave
the warm, well-lit surface waters

20
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,943
and dive far down

21
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,156
into the cold, dark depths
of the deep ocean.

22
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,165
At the surface

23
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,035
it took in air at the same pressure
as we breath it.

24
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,421
But it's going to look for food

25
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,673
at more than 1,000 metres down,

26
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,053
where pressure is 100 times
that on the surface,

27
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,103
crushing the whale's lungs

28
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,681
to just one per cent
of their volume.

29
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,604
For us to follow the whale,

30
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,272
we need the very latest submersible.

31
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:40,118
A reinforced acrylic sphere

32
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,668
with walls 12 centimetres thick
protects a pilot and our cameraman

33
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:47,162
from the enormous pressure below,

34
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,878
and allows the submarine to dive

35
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,009
to just over 900 metres.

36
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,673
(PILOT) 900 feet,

37
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,722
With every passing metre,

38
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,386
pressure increases

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,600
and sunlight diminishes.

40
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,060
(PILOT) 1,000 feet,

41
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,725
By 300 metres,
it's already very dark

42
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:08,193
and the temperature of the water

43
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,157
is dropping fast.

44
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,876
We are entering the twilight zone,

45
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:20,120
a weird world of gloom

46
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:23,997
where many animals have become
completely transparent.

47
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:31,016
in this twilight,

48
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:32,928
and animal needs to see,

49
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:36,473
and yet, as far as possible,
must avoid being seen.

50
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,572
A giant amphipod,

51
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:47,360
12 centimetres long
and almost perfectly transparent.

52
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:49,863
its head is completely filled

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,784
by two huge eyes

54
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,794
with which it strains
to detect its prey.

55
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:01,047
Another twilight monster, phronima,

56
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,174
the inspiration
for the Alien movies.

57
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:09,013
She and her developing
pink offspring

58
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:12,474
live like parasites
in the stolen body of a jelly.

59
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,236
This impressive cutlery set

60
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,902
and its huge eyes

61
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:22,614
make phronima a powerful predator.

62
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,121
Even really complex animals

63
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,418
have become transparent
in the twilight zone.

64
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:39,130
Squids are among
the most advanced of invertebrates,

65
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:43,140
but this one never meets
a hard surface in its entire life,

66
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:47,856
so its body need not be as robust
as that of its shallow water cousins.

67
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,022
There's a rich variety of jellies

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,071
that live nowhere else
but in the deep sea.

69
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:08,674
Thousands of tiny cilia propel them
through a world without walls.

70
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,352
invisible in the gloom,

71
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:22,061
they grope blindly for their prey.

72
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,028
Comb jellies let out long sticky
nets to catch passing copepods.

73
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,125
But the most extensive death trap

74
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,375
is set by siphonophores.

75
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,005
This pulsating bell
is the head of a colonial jelly

76
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,258
that can be 40 metres long.

77
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:55,263
Millions of tiny stinging cells

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,517
drifting through the sea.

79
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:08,496
500 metres down,

80
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,951
and in even
the clearest tropical waters

81
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:15,579
only the faintest vestige
of the sunlight remains -

82
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:19,457
so little that our eyes
can't detect it, but others can.

83
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,725
Survival in the twilight zone

84
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,723
is all about seeing,

85
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:31,642
yet not being seen.

86
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,405
Hatchet fish

87
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,243
are masters of the game
of hide and seek.

88
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:43,408
They have the large, sensitive eyes
needed for seeking prey

89
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,788
but their bodies are flat...

90
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,459
and their sides are highly silvered.

91
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,049
Head on, they are just visible,
thin though they are,

92
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:02,303
but as soon as they turn,

93
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,021
their mirrored sides

94
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,725
reflect the remnants of blue light
from the surface,

95
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:10,228
and they disappear into the gloom.

96
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:14,106
Viewed from the side,
whole shoals can hide in this way,

97
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,610
but what about from below?

98
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:23,205
The tubular eyes

99
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,215
of many of the predators,
even in this gloom,

100
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,708
are able to distinguish their prey

101
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:32,670
silhouetted against the faint
glimmer of light from above.

102
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:38,601
Hatchet fish, however,
have a way of confusing any eyes

103
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,560
that might be searching for them
from below.

104
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:45,353
Their bellies carry rows
of light-producing cells

105
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,108
called photophores.

106
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,202
They can use these

107
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,282
to exactly match the changing colour
of light from the surface far above.

108
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:08,256
This counter shading
breaks up their silhouette,

109
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:11,387
making them almost invisible
from below...

110
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,480
almost.

111
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,899
But these are no ordinary eyes.

112
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,494
The enormous yellow lenses
enable their owner to distinguish

113
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:34,334
between light produced
by photophores and sunlight.

114
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:39,009
So, one device for escape

115
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:42,927
is countered by another
equally subtle one for attack

116
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,015
in an evolutionary arms race that
has been waged for millions of years.

117
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,860
Descend below 1,000 metres,

118
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,107
and you enter the dark zone.

119
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:01,329
No sunlight whatsoever
penetrates this deep.

120
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:05,744
The temperature of the water
is below four degrees Centigrade.

121
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:09,502
The pressure is more than 100 times
that at the surface.

122
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,632
Life becomes ever more sparse.

123
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,426
it's a dark, dangerous world.

124
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,733
Relative to body size,

125
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:28,523
these are the largest teeth
in the ocean.

126
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:30,238
They are so big

127
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:33,028
that their owner
can't close its mouth.

128
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,662
They belong to the fang tooth.

129
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,374
Unlike most deep sea fish,

130
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,627
this has powerful muscles

131
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:50,880
and is an aggressive hunter.

132
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,188
With food in such short supply
at this depth,

133
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:07,692
dark zone predators have to be able
to deal with a meal of any size.

134
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,158
Many animals here are dark red,

135
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:17,209
like this deep sea jelly.

136
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,258
Caught in the lights
of the submersible,

137
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:34,523
it's a spectacular firework display
of colour.

138
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:43,738
Normally, no red light
penetrates as deep as this,

139
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:48,159
so animals with red pigment
appear completely black down here,

140
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,875
perfectly concealed.

141
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:57,750
Predators here, however,
don't just rely on vision -

142
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,470
many have tiny eyes.

143
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:02,177
instead, their thin, rod-like bodies

144
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,597
are lined with organs sensitive
to tiny movements in the water.

145
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,277
This monster, half a metre across,

146
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,531
is a hairy angler.

147
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,199
This is the first time
it's been seen.

148
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:30,164
it's covered with hundreds
of sensitive antennae,

149
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,133
which detect the movements

150
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:35,339
of any prey careless enough
to stray too close

151
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:38,302
to this motionless predator.

152
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:50,949
But this, surely,

153
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:55,197
must be the strangest of all
the deep sea fish yet discovered.

154
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,909
A highly sensitive metre-long tail

155
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,835
hangs down from the head
that makes up a quarter of its body.

156
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:05,881
its eyes are tiny,

157
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,127
but its mouth is truly enormous.

158
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,093
it's called the gulper eel

159
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,391
because it can engulf a meal
of almost any size.

160
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:27,075
Hanging motionless in mid-water,

161
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:30,779
its enormous gape enables it
to deal with passing prey,

162
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:32,367
whether it's small,

163
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,415
or large.

164
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,293
Gulper eels can swallow prey
as big as themselves,

165
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,546
which is very useful in a world

166
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,424
where you never know
when the next meal is coming along.

167
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:57,358
Even in the dark zone,
there is S0ME light.

168
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,735
Turn off the submersible headlights,

169
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:04,444
and you see a pyrotechnic display
outside.

170
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,956
These lights are created by animals.

171
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:12,454
This is bioluminescence.

172
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:18,876
A deep sea angler fish
flashes in the darkness.

173
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:23,800
The light is generated by bacteria

174
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:26,765
that live permanently
inside the lure

175
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,559
which attracts prey
to these murderous teeth.

176
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:37,449
There are all sorts of lures
out in the darkness.

177
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:48,746
Come into my mouth, little fish!

178
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:57,221
And what is the purpose
of THiS lure,

179
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,267
suspended on a long rod,

180
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:02,557
way below its owner's
terrifying set of teeth?

181
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,321
it's difficult to be sure,

182
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,648
but then, this monster does have

183
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:12,819
another giant flashing lure

184
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,739
much closer to its mouth.

185
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,339
These fish are called anglers

186
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,713
because they use their lures
in much the same way

187
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:30,842
as fly fishermen
use their imitation flies.

188
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,728
For a hunting squid with huge eyes

189
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,392
this glimmer is intriguing.

190
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:48,572
it might just be food.

191
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,007
A satisfying meal

192
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:02,130
for a fish
with a highly extendible stomach.

193
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:13,650
Attracting a mate

194
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:15,692
in this endless darkness

195
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,614
can be even harder
than finding food.

196
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,243
Flashing lures may be helpful;

197
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:28,701
certainly, only female anglers
have them.

198
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:38,796
The tiny males are just a tenth
the size of the females.

199
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:42,841
Their only purpose is somehow
to find a mate in the darkness.

200
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,636
She releases chemicals
into the water

201
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:51,479
which the males scent with a special
white organ in front of their eyes.

202
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,076
Having found a partner,

203
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:01,195
the male bites at her belly
with specially designed teeth.

204
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,461
He needs to get
permanently attached.

205
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,343
Within a matter of weeks,

206
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,304
the male is completely fused
to the female,

207
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,350
and there he will stay
for the rest of his life.

208
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,766
Her blood circulating in his body

209
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:27,064
provides him
with all the sustenance he needs.

210
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:31,238
in return, she gets a continuous,
reliable supply of sperm -

211
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,946
a brilliant solution to the problem
of finding a mate

212
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,615
in the vast emptiness
of the deep sea.

213
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:52,513
To help in the constant battle
between predators and prey,

214
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,763
some fish in the dark zone

215
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,015
have developed headlights.

216
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:07,150
These light-producing photophores
beneath their eyes

217
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,533
may be used to search out prey
in the darkness.

218
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:16,039
Most bioluminescence in the deep sea

219
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,291
is blue or greenish-blue,

220
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,544
but a very few predatory fish

221
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,796
produce red light.

222
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,354
With this,

223
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:32,310
red prey becomes obvious
in the darkness.

224
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:36,902
Red light is rare down here

225
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:39,944
and most animal eyes can't see it.

226
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,862
0nly these fish can do so.

227
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:44,781
This gives them a sniper scope -

228
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,994
a headlight invisible
to their targets.

229
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,544
This copepod, unalarmed,

230
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,797
takes no avoiding action.

231
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,102
Bioluminescence

232
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:08,854
is useful in escape

233
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:10,570
as well as attack.

234
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:19,489
A shrimp senses a threat.

235
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:25,707
it spins in the water,

236
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:28,207
releasing a bioluminescent glue.

237
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,678
This acts like a burglar alarm,

238
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,926
startling the attacking fish

239
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:38,724
and leaving it illuminated
in the dark,

240
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:41,388
and vulnerable to its own predators.

241
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:47,401
These twinkling lights
in the darkness

242
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,366
are produced by copepods.

243
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,244
They probably flash like this
to communicate with one another

244
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,375
and confuse their predators.

245
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,549
The most sensitive eyes in the ocean

246
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,463
belong to an ostracod

247
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:08,632
called gigantocypris.

248
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:11,894
it's the size of a pea,

249
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:13,604
but that's enormous

250
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,315
for an ostracod.

251
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,898
Copepods are a favourite prey,

252
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,021
and it actively searches
for their flashes in the darkness...

253
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:31,748
but this copepod has a way of
confusing a hunting gigantocypris.

254
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,670
it discharges a packet
of bioluminescent liquid.

255
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,266
The flash is delayed,
like a depth charge.

256
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,354
Spinning, confused, in the water,

257
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:55,647
gigantocypris chases
after the flashes...

258
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:04,957
and the copepod

259
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,834
slips away unseen

260
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:08,580
into the darkness.

261
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,010
The ultimate bioluminescent
defence mechanism

262
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,764
has to be the light show

263
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,308
created by the deep sea jellyfish,
periphylla.

264
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:41,372
That, presumably, is the way
it scares away its enemies.

265
00:20:58,064 --> 00:21:01,932
These bright lights
are all produced by firefly squid.

266
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,694
Normally, they live way down
at around 300 metres,

267
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:09,614
beyond the reach of
these japanese fishermen's nets...

268
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:14,248
but for a few months each spring,
they come to the surface each night.

269
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,130
The brightest lights
come from the bioluminescent tips

270
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,259
of their two front tentacles,

271
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,051
but it's only in the dark
of the deep sea,

272
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:31,970
that you can really appreciate
the full complexity of their displays.

273
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,223
it's not just their tentacles

274
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:38,148
but their whole bodies
that are covered in photophores.

275
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:42,691
The exact function is not clear.

276
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:46,403
The bright tentacle tips
may be for attracting mates

277
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,123
or dazzling predators.

278
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,368
The rest may be camouflage,

279
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:54,250
providing counter shading
for the squid

280
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:57,211
as they journey up
into the twilight zone.

281
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:01,882
Every night in the season,

282
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:04,134
hundreds of thousands of squid

283
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,181
journey up into the shallow water
to spawn.

284
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:15,231
Before dawn,
they will return to the depths,

285
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:18,527
leaving their eggs
to develop in the shallows.

286
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:31,501
The daily cycle of the sun

287
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:35,046
has a profound influence on life
in the deep ocean.

288
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:39,301
As the sun sets,
it triggers the largest migration

289
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:41,850
of living organisms on our planet.

290
00:22:42,773 --> 00:22:45,264
0ne thousand million tonnes
of animals

291
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:47,482
travel up from the dark zone

292
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,940
into richer, shallower water
every night.

293
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:57,030
Tiny grazers are first up,

294
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:59,745
searching for the microscopic plants

295
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:02,706
that only grow
in shallow, sunlit waters.

296
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,629
Predators follow the grazers.

297
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,173
An enormous variety
of different animals

298
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,892
join the convoy

299
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,137
or feed off it as it passes.

300
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:26,027
Many will travel up hundreds
of metres towards the surface,

301
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,032
and, at dawn, finding themselves
at risk from predators,

302
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:33,954
the visitors return
to the safer darkness of the depths.

303
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:44,590
The sun's rays
only have a direct effect

304
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:47,599
in the top 100 metres
or so of the ocean.

305
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:51,804
it's only here that photosynthesis
can take place

306
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,057
and coral reefs can flourish.

307
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,559
Leave this thin, rich slice of life

308
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:59,442
and travel over the outer face
of the reef

309
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:02,984
and you quickly enter
a far more demanding world.

310
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:14,125
Below 150 metres,

311
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,217
photosynthesis becomes impossible.

312
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:21,091
You find no plants,

313
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:22,808
just animals.

314
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:28,848
Here, the animals are adapted
to catch marine snow -

315
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:33,355
particles of dead animals and plants
that drift down from above.

316
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,695
So they depend second-hand
on the energy captured from the sun

317
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:40,277
by organisms in the surface waters.

318
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,335
Travelling close to the sea floor,

319
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:56,633
we're going to take a journey
to the very bottom

320
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:58,267
of the deep sea...

321
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:03,310
to a world completely separate
from the mid-water above.

322
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:15,195
At around 300 metres,

323
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:19,952
the drop-off levels out, and we move
out onto the continental slope.

324
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,545
This stretches for about 150 miles

325
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:27,343
from the coast,

326
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:29,469
sloping in a gentle gradient,

327
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:32,261
down to a maximum depth
of 4,000 metres.

328
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,972
Water temperatures down here

329
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,556
drop below four degrees Centigrade

330
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:43,816
and the pressure can reach
up to 400 times that of the surface.

331
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,954
Without the lights
of the submersible,

332
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:56,203
it would be completely dark.

333
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:01,752
The water is crystal clear because
there's so little organic matter.

334
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:05,380
0nly three per cent of any food
in the surface waters

335
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,716
reaches the continental slope.

336
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,227
At first sight,
it appears a lifeless desert,

337
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:17,609
but take a closer look

338
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,698
and you notice a network
of tracks and trails.

339
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,738
There is life even down here.

340
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,748
These animals would die immediately

341
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,162
if brought to the surface in nets,

342
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:35,211
so you can only see them
behaving normally

343
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,963
from submersibles.

344
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,213
Many are new to science.

345
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,428
The deep sea floor is dominated

346
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,230
by echinoderms -

347
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,772
sea cucumbers, brittle stars

348
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:51,486
and sea urchins.

349
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:54,324
There are literally millions
of them,

350
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,567
marching across the sea bed,

351
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:59,069
hoovering up any edible particles

352
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:00,789
in the sediment.

353
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,493
They come in all shapes and sizes,

354
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,541
and though they are thinly spread,

355
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:10,503
these are among
the most numerous animals

356
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,504
on the planet.

357
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:17,384
Their spikes are good
for locomotion and defence,

358
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,096
but perhaps not quite so good
when it comes to mating.

359
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:27,944
Finding a mate
in this largely empty sea floor

360
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,657
could be a problem,

361
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:32,495
so some urchins
stay together in herds

362
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:36,826
to be sure that they're never
too far from a potential partner.

363
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:41,666
Rocky outcrops
provide good anchorage

364
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,291
for animals that rely on food
that might drift past.

365
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:49,298
These crinoids or sea lilies
look like plants,

366
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:51,550
but are, in fact, animals.

367
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:59,269
Their long stalks ensure that
their umbrella of feeding tentacles

368
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,481
are positioned to best effect
in the current.

369
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:04,982
Particles are swept onto the arms,

370
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,908
and carried down to a mouth
in the middle of the umbrella.

371
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,407
These sudden movements swat away

372
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:18,047
tiny amphipods that try to steal
the sea lily's captures.

373
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,435
Coral reefs are not supposed
to exist in total darkness,

374
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,731
but recently, a new kind of coral

375
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:36,607
was found as deep as 2,000 metres.

376
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:40,908
in the cold waters
of a Norwegian fjord,

377
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:44,992
there was a deep sea reef
30 metres high and 200 metres long.

378
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,624
This coral gets no energy from
the sun, so it has to be very efficient

379
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,257
in catching food.

380
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:57,340
its polyps are far larger
than those of shallow water corals.

381
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:05,689
These are, in fact,

382
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:08,894
the largest coral polyps
in the ocean.

383
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:13,777
They belong
to the deep sea mushroom coral.

384
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:17,864
Their three-centimetre-long
tentacles

385
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:19,663
can catch far larger prey

386
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:21,410
than other corals can.

387
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:27,833
This necessity to capture
every particle of food

388
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:30,879
that comes within reach
in this near desert

389
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:33,545
has radically changed many animals.

390
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:36,476
Most tunicates

391
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,186
are filter feeders,

392
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:40,596
but this one has become a predator

393
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:43,016
and its greatly enlarged siphon

394
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:45,270
has been converted into a trap.

395
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:58,793
Most sea cucumbers

396
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:01,121
stay firmly on the bottom,

397
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:04,715
but not this extraordinary
deep sea species.

398
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,011
its skirts of skin

399
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,511
allow it to swim hundreds of metres

400
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:15,231
above the sea floor.

401
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:32,996
Eventually, it will descend

402
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,712
and, with luck,

403
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,288
will land on fresh feeding grounds.

404
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,515
This has to be the most
extraordinary animal design of all.

405
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,266
it's a polychaete worm

406
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,273
and, normally, you would expect
the long, pulsating body

407
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:56,818
to be stick firmly in the sediment.

408
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,453
This worm,

409
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:03,163
alone in its group,

410
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:04,873
swims in the open water.

411
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:12,334
Propelling itself
with its yellow frill,

412
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,051
it moves about

413
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,378
and so finds new sources of food,

414
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,759
or maybe succeeds
in escaping from a predator.

415
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:28,937
This is chimaera,
a close relative of the sharks,

416
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:30,654
less than a metre long.

417
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:36,484
Sensory pits on its chin
help it hunt prey on the bottom,

418
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:41,325
while its surprisingly large eyes
may help it spot bioluminescence.

419
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,175
Large fish are rare down here -

420
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:55,385
there's not enough live prey
to sustain them.

421
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,637
Most have become scavengers.

422
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:01,099
A dead tuna has attracted
a deep sea conger eel...

423
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,480
and a six-gilled shark.

424
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,364
These monsters grow

425
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,407
to eight metres long.

426
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:27,259
Six gills are living fossils.

427
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:30,967
For 150 million years,
they've existed unchanged,

428
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:35,225
living in water
as deep as 2,500 metres.

429
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:43,946
Very few people have glimpsed
these sharks from submersibles,

430
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:47,488
and we know almost nothing
about their behaviour.

431
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:58,299
The body of a tuna
is a substantial meal,

432
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:00,129
but just occasionally,

433
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:01,965
a really gigantic corpse

434
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,382
drifts down to the deep sea floor.

435
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:11,604
This is the freshly dead carcass

436
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:13,853
of a 30-tonne grey whale.

437
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,900
it's resting on the sea floor
a mile down.

438
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:20,946
it's only been on the bottom
for six weeks,

439
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:24,491
but already it has attracted
hundreds of hagfish.

440
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:28,246
These ancient scavengers

441
00:33:28,422 --> 00:33:32,206
are nearly always the first
to discover a fallen body,

442
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,876
and are attracted from miles around.

443
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:43,229
They lack jaws and rasp at the flesh
with two rows of horny teeth

444
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,352
on either side
of their sucker-like mouths.

445
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:54,151
Next to arrive,

446
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:57,946
a sleeper shark -
a real deep sea specialist.

447
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:00,532
They grow to over seven metres long,

448
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,996
and have never been filmed
at such a depth before.

449
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:12,346
The gaping wounds
in the whale's flank are its work.

450
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,312
Unlike the hagfish,
it has powerful jaws,

451
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:26,655
so is able to rip off
huge chunks of meat.

452
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:35,835
Sharks, hagfish

453
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:39,538
and a whole succession
of different deep sea scavengers

454
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:43,963
will feast on the carcass for years
before all its nutriment is gone.

455
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:48,433
Eighteen months later,

456
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,677
when we returned to this whale,

457
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:54,555
all that was left was
a perfect skeleton stripped bare.

458
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:05,485
it was almost
as if a museum specimen

459
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:08,499
had been carefully laid out
on the sea floor.

460
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,881
At first, the skeleton
seemed totally abandoned,

461
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:20,464
but even after so long, there was
still some flesh left in the head.

462
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:30,980
Hagfish have a skeleton
of cartilage and are so flexible

463
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:33,560
that they tie themselves into knots

464
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:37,274
and so get a better purchase
on the flesh they feed on.

465
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:46,414
But smaller organisms had fed here.

466
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:48,956
A thick band of white bacteria

467
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:50,591
had formed on the mud

468
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:53,879
outlining the original shape
of the whale,

469
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:55,964
and on the skeleton itself,

470
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,548
colonies of specialised bacteria

471
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:02,179
were extracting energy
from the bones themselves.

472
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:08,230
Most remarkably,
and in huge abundance,

473
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:12,569
polychaete worms were collecting
the last edible fragments.

474
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:14,286
These are a new species

475
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:18,618
that so far have only been found
on the fallen bodies of whales.

476
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,330
Scientists have discovered
178 different animals

477
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:26,584
on a single whale vertebra,

478
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,631
most of which have been found
nowhere else.

479
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:32,297
This whale, lying over a mile down,

480
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:36,937
was not filmed from a submersible
with an acrylic sphere.

481
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:39,728
Such craft can't go as deep as this.

482
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:43,437
To withstand the pressure here,

483
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:46,105
you need a far stronger submersible.

484
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,826
This is Alvin,

485
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:51,328
a two-metre-wide sphere
with just enough room in it

486
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,575
for a pilot and two observers.

487
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,709
its walls are made of titanium.

488
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:58,631
The viewing ports have to be tiny -

489
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,919
any larger,
and the submersible would implode

490
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,847
under the enormous pressure
down here.

491
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,807
Alvin can dive

492
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,016
to 4,500 metres,

493
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,264
three miles below the surface.

494
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:21,441
Around 3,000 metres, the continental
slope finally flattens out

495
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:23,825
and joins the abyssal plain.

496
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:27,575
This covers over half
the earth's surface.

497
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,827
Mostly it's completely flat,

498
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,207
but in places
it's gashed by massive trenches

499
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:35,458
hundreds of miles wide.

500
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,680
The deepest of these
is the Mariana Trench,

501
00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:48,389
which drops to over seven miles
below sea level.

502
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,944
There are just five manned
submersibles world-wide

503
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:02,364
that can reach the abyssal plain,

504
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,167
and between them so far,

505
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:07,456
they have explored
less than one per cent of it.

506
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:12,834
There are a thousand times
fewer large animals down here

507
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:15,089
than on the continental slope,

508
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,808
but in places,

509
00:38:16,976 --> 00:38:21,105
hundreds of brittle stars
cross the sea bed in search of food.

510
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:27,980
Fish have been found right down to
the bottom of the deepest trenches.

511
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,232
Most come from one family -

512
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,485
the aptly named rattails.

513
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,866
They forage near the sea floor

514
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,499
and use their battery
of sensory pits

515
00:38:40,671 --> 00:38:43,922
to follow odour trails
from rotting carcasses.

516
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:46,381
Rattails can travel long distances

517
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:48,213
across the abyssal plain

518
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:49,931
in search of food,

519
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,266
but others down here
prefer to sit and wait.

520
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,809
This is a tripod fish.

521
00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:02,520
it supports itself
on two specially adapted fin rays

522
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:05,568
and can sit motionless
for hour after hour.

523
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:09,538
it does have tiny eyes,

524
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:11,782
but it's almost totally blind.

525
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,035
it locates potential prey

526
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:16,453
with a pair of fins behind its head

527
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:20,047
which are sensitive
to even tiny movements.

528
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:29,050
We know more about the surface
of the moon

529
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:31,436
than we do about the abyssal plain.

530
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:35,857
Every dive still produces
complete surprises.

531
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:43,954
This deep sea octopus

532
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:46,198
is about the size of a beach ball

533
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,581
and has been nicknamed Dumbo.

534
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:02,517
An umbrella of skin
between its tentacles

535
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:05,177
and its extraordinary flapping ears

536
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,681
allow Dumbo to hover effortlessly

537
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,401
over the sea floor

538
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:11,692
as it searches for food.

539
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:32,173
Right in the middle
of the abyssal plain

540
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,131
lie the largest geological
structures on our planet...

541
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,525
the mid-ocean ridges.

542
00:40:52,412 --> 00:40:55,414
Rising almost two miles
off the sea floor,

543
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,786
the ridges extend
for over 28,000 miles,

544
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:01,631
the largest mountain chain on Earth.

545
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:10,934
When submersibles finally succeeded

546
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,509
in reaching the ridges in the 1970s,

547
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,013
they found an extraordinary world

548
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:18,729
with mile upon mile
of once molten rock

549
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:23,316
that had welled up from the deep
in the past and had now solidified.

550
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,164
They discovered towering chimneys,

551
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,369
pouring out water
as hot as molten lead.

552
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:06,118
At the surface, water becomes steam
at 100 degrees Centigrade,

553
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:09,662
but here, under the immense pressure
of the ocean,

554
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,418
it remains liquid at temperatures
as hot as 400 degrees Centigrade.

555
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:22,387
The submersible
has to move carefully.

556
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:25,729
Disaster is very close
when surrounded

557
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:28,854
by such enormous temperatures
and pressures.

558
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:32,234
And here,
where the very water is loaded

559
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:36,571
with hydrogen sulphides
poisonous to normal life processes,

560
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:38,822
they found living creatures.

561
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:47,007
Some of the chimneys
were encrusted with white tubes.

562
00:42:47,175 --> 00:42:49,002
The tubes were inhabited

563
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:51,503
by a new species of polychaete worm

564
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,177
that was exposed to temperatures
as high as 80 degrees Centigrade.

565
00:42:58,438 --> 00:43:03,184
No other animal on Earth was known
to tolerate such high temperatures,

566
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:07,193
so the scientists called
these creatures Pompeii worms.

567
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:11,944
But this was just the beginning.

568
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:14,198
Nearby, there were chimneys

569
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:18,289
covered by whole communities
of different organisms.

570
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:22,247
The bottom of the vent
was encrusted with large mussels.

571
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,337
There were swarms of white crabs,

572
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:29,424
and, most spectacular of all,

573
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,729
dominating the chimney were
hundreds of bright red tubeworms,

574
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:37,101
each two metres long
and four centimetres wide.

575
00:43:39,154 --> 00:43:41,859
Until these creatures
were discovered,

576
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:45,733
all life on Earth was thought
to be dependent on the sun,

577
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:49,032
but here, in the complete darkness
of the deep,

578
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:52,043
they had discovered
a rich density of life

579
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:54,667
that derived no energy from the sun.

580
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,840
So what do they live on?

581
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:07,718
The answer was found
within the tubeworms themselves.

582
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:11,017
They were packed full
of specialised bacteria

583
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,565
that are able to derive energy

584
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:16,904
from the sulphides
that pour from the vents.

585
00:44:20,787 --> 00:44:24,239
The worms' plumes were bright red
with haemoglobin

586
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:28,165
that carries sulphides and oxygen
down to the bacteria.

587
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,706
These bacterial colonies

588
00:44:30,882 --> 00:44:34,715
are the primary source of energy
for all that lives here.

589
00:44:34,887 --> 00:44:37,213
The mussels were packed with them.

590
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,933
just as green plants

591
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,470
are the basis of life
for animals living in the sun,

592
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,054
so these bacteria and other microbes

593
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,309
are at the foot of the food chain

594
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:49,977
on which over 500 species depend.

595
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:59,498
Crabs and shrimps feed off bacteria

596
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:03,036
and even try to steal pieces
of tubeworm plumes.

597
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:13,631
Since the vents were first visited
by biologists in 1979,

598
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:17,510
a new species has been described
every ten days.

599
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:24,104
At the top of the food chain, fish
that never stray far from the vents,

600
00:45:25,031 --> 00:45:28,281
but they or their descendants
will move eventually,

601
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:32,153
for we now know that
individual vents are rarely active

602
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:34,288
for more than a few decades.

603
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:50,517
Such a density of life

604
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:53,356
living in such harsh conditions

605
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:57,522
in the middle of a vast
and otherwise barren abyssal plain

606
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:00,945
astounded the biologists
who first saw it.

607
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:08,658
it seemed to them that here was
evidence of how life on this planet,

608
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:12,416
which certainly started in the sea,
might have begun.

609
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:19,885
Deep sea submersibles

610
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:24,100
made an even more
extraordinary discovery in 1990.

611
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,074
0ver half a mile down,

612
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,781
at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico,

613
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:43,703
they came across what appeared
to be an underwater lake,

614
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,453
over 20 metres long,

615
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:47,667
with its own sandy shore.

616
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,542
Around its edge,
there even seemed to be a tide line,

617
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,878
but this couldn't be, of course,

618
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:57,132
this was underwater.

619
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,801
in fact, the lapping edge
was created

620
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:03,470
by a thick soup of salty brine

621
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:06,603
far heavier than
the surrounding sea water,

622
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:08,320
and the sand was made up

623
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,979
of hundreds of thousands of mussels.

624
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,371
0nce again, in the midst
of a totally barren sea bed,

625
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:19,078
an extraordinarily
rich oasis of life

626
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:22,038
totally independent
of the sun's energy.

627
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:29,426
The source of energy this time
was not sulphides

628
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,298
but methane bubbling
out of the sea bed, and once again,

629
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,347
the mussels carried special bacteria

630
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,642
capable of fixing
the methane's energy.

631
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:41,894
just like the hot vents,

632
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,199
a complete ecosystem had developed
based on the bacteria.

633
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:51,076
There was an enormous variety
of completely new species - shrimps,

634
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:53,704
weird squat lobsters,

635
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:55,335
and bright red

636
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:57,163
polychaete worms.

637
00:48:06,474 --> 00:48:09,392
These oases were called cold seeps

638
00:48:09,561 --> 00:48:12,765
and were surprisingly similar
to the hot vents.

639
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:22,194
The geological processes
in the sea floor that produce methane

640
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:26,201
also tend to result in the release
of hydrogen sulphides.

641
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:28,532
it was hardly surprising, then,

642
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,951
when, not far from the brine pool,

643
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:32,837
they found tubeworms...

644
00:48:34,382 --> 00:48:37,052
extensive fields of tubeworms

645
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,711
that stretch for hundreds of metres.

646
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:42,559
This new species also uses bacteria

647
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:44,802
to fix energy from sulphides,

648
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:48,099
but it extracts them directly
from the ground.

649
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,106
Their beautiful gills

650
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:57,947
are only used to supply oxygen
to the bacteria.

651
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:05,418
Amazingly, these tubeworms
are over 200 years old.

652
00:49:06,171 --> 00:49:07,879
While hot vent tubeworms

653
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:11,500
may be the fastest-growing
invertebrates in the sea,

654
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:13,635
these appear to be far slower -

655
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:17,934
all the more reason to protect
your gills from biting amphipods.

656
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:26,608
The energy sources exploited
by the hot vent animals

657
00:49:26,779 --> 00:49:28,321
may suddenly fail,

658
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:32,238
but here, life can enjoy
a more stable geological future.

659
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:40,997
To discover within ten years
two completely new ecosystems,

660
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:44,291
both totally independent
of the sun's energy,

661
00:49:44,466 --> 00:49:46,543
has been quite extraordinary.

662
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,848
So far, we have explored just one
per cent of the deep ocean floor.

663
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:54,717
Who knows what is still out there
to be discovered?
