1
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:39,459
These seas, thousands of miles
from nearest land,

2
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,956
are the most sterile on our planet.

3
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,624
These are marine deserts.

4
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:51,511
But here live the swiftest
and most powerful of all ocean hunters.

5
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:01,722
Simply finding them
is an immense challenge...

6
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,311
but we are about to follow them

7
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,563
as they search for their food

8
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,360
in this little known part
of the seas...

9
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,909
the open ocean.

10
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,585
Striped marlin -

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,338
voracious predators

12
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:37,299
that can grow to three metres long.

13
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,010
They hunt mainly in daylight,

14
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,309
searching the tropical oceans

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,556
from close to the surface

16
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,973
down to depths of 100 metres or so.

17
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:54,435
Normally, the fish they feed on
are widely dispersed,

18
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:58,064
but sometimes their prey
gathers in dense shoals,

19
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:00,280
like these sardines.

20
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:38,783
This feast may last
for over an hour...

21
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,036
time enough for other hunters
to reach the scene.

22
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,378
juvenile tuna join in
the feeding frenzy.

23
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,599
The noise attracts a giant -

24
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,981
a sei whale.

25
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:26,945
it's 14 metres long
and 20 tonnes in weight,

26
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,196
and has an appetite to match.

27
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:38,554
Soon, the only sign
that the sardines ever existed

28
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:42,424
are scales sinking
down into the abyss.

29
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,804
Such feasts don't last long.

30
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,056
Within a few short days,

31
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,557
waters that once swarmed with food

32
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:53,810
will have been cleaned out.

33
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,145
The hunters must move elsewhere

34
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,402
and once again search the seemingly
featureless open ocean.

35
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:06,071
A manta ray - immense,

36
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,123
five metres across

37
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,039
from the tip of one wing-like fin
to the tip of the other.

38
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:16,457
it's travelling Economy,
wasting as little energy as possible

39
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:19,751
as it glides through the waters
of the tropics.

40
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:27,426
The remora fish that accompany it

41
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,264
travel more economically still
by hitching a lift.

42
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,845
Their host is searching for food -
plankton,

43
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:40,269
the minute fish and invertebrates
that float near the surface.

44
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,021
it needs lots of them

45
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:46,275
and may cruise for days before
it finds a good feeding ground.

46
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,866
Dusk, at the edge
of a Pacific island,

47
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,741
3,000 miles
from the nearest continent.

48
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,117
Here, surgeon fish
have assembled to spawn.

49
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,915
As they perform
their nuptial dances,

50
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:06,788
they discharge clouds of eggs
and sperm into the water.

51
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:10,752
The manta must have known
this was about to happen,

52
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:14,095
for it arrived at exactly
this critical moment,

53
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:16,423
and it is not the only one
to do so.

54
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,676
0thers are here, too.

55
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,190
Now, they just need to sweep
the water into their mouths

56
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,233
and sieve out the eggs.

57
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,711
Within an hour,
the whole event will be over.

58
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:02,675
Any surviving eggs
will be so dispersed

59
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,256
that they are not worth collecting.

60
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:14,933
But other perils await them

61
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:18,193
as they join the clouds of eggs
and larvae and tiny fish

62
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,983
that drift through
the surface waters of the open ocean.

63
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:26,909
These are the eggs
of yellow-fin tuna.

64
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:29,153
if the hatchlings survive,

65
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,283
it will take them two years
to become adults.

66
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,503
in three years,

67
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:42,751
they could be nearly two metres long
and weigh 200 kilograms.

68
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:49,420
Perhaps only one in a million
will live as long as that.

69
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:52,590
They and the other animals

70
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,388
and microscopic plants
of the plankton

71
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:59,178
constitute the basis of all life
out on the open ocean.

72
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:06,809
A storm petrel
dancing on the water.

73
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,063
But this is no amiable waltz.

74
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,781
it's a hunt.

75
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:17,448
As they hover facing into the wind,

76
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:21,701
they pick out morsels from near
the surface, including eggs.

77
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,085
0nly a tiny percentage
of the developing eggs

78
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,585
will survive long enough to hatch.

79
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:39,806
These newly emerged tuna
are only three millimetres long,

80
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,050
and although they CAN swim,

81
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,384
they're still very vulnerable.

82
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:49,310
it will be many weeks before
they can swim strongly enough

83
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,973
to make any real headway
in the ocean.

84
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,743
After the sun goes down,

85
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,402
other predators
rise from the depths

86
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,988
to attack the floating multitudes.

87
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:30,050
Darkness shrouds the arrival

88
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:33,594
of battalions of dangerous,
drifting predators.

89
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:51,740
These shimmering comb jellies -
sea gooseberries -

90
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,865
trap their prey
with sticky, net-like webs.

91
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,914
0ne ill-timed fin stroke

92
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,249
could bring certain death
to a hatchling fish.

93
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:04,915
There are many kinds
of these comb jellies -

94
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,876
all of them very effective hunters.

95
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,061
By dawn,

96
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:25,475
most of the nocturnal feeders
will have returned to the depths.

97
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:32,066
The surviving hatchlings, however,

98
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,989
have already started
on their travels.

99
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,328
Vast current systems
like immense rivers

100
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:51,910
carry them around the ocean basins.

101
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:57,589
The boundaries between
these masses of moving water

102
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,923
form invisible barriers that
can trap plankton and nutrients

103
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,971
carried up from the depths.

104
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,019
So, parts of the ocean
become rich with food

105
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,561
for days or even weeks at a time.

106
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:20,518
This attracts vast schools
of plankton-feeding fish,

107
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,483
like these sardine.

108
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,283
They take in water
through their mouths

109
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,662
and expel it through their gills,

110
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,996
sieving out the plankton which is
then funnelled down their throats.

111
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:48,254
The immense schools travel
along the boundaries of the currents,

112
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,797
seeking the spots
where the plankton is thickest.

113
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:58,972
As the position of the current
boundaries changes constantly,

114
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:03,060
so does both the supply of plankton
and the numbers of fish.

115
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,198
A small pod
of Pacific spotted dolphin,

116
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:23,616
20 miles from the coast of Panama.

117
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:26,996
Like all predators,
they seek parts of the ocean

118
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,247
where their food is thickest.

119
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:41,587
They cover as much
as 100 miles in a day,

120
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,843
and while they travel,

121
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:45,561
they play.

122
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:05,112
They have detected
the sound of schooling fish

123
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,363
from hundreds of metres away,

124
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,659
and start to track down the shoals
using sonar,

125
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,992
leaving their toys behind them.

126
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,293
For the hunted,
there are few places to hide.

127
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:28,471
Schooling mackerel.

128
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:33,053
They have already sensed the sonar
beams of approaching dolphin.

129
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:40,018
Their only defence
is to gather into a ball.

130
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:44,521
Any fish that stayed out of the
shoal would be quickly picked off.

131
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:48,231
Within it, there is
at least S0ME chance of survival.

132
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,041
The noise of the attack
alerts another predator -

133
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:04,413
a sailfish, one of the fastest fish
in the ocean.

134
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,799
it has detected rapid vibrations
in the water,

135
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:15,047
and is searching for the cause.

136
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:32,352
Sailfish rely on eyesight
for their final approach,

137
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,688
so they hunt mainly in daylight.

138
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:43,028
When sailfish become excited,
they change colour,

139
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,411
lighting up with blue stripes.

140
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:50,409
Since mackerel eyes are especially
sensitive to blue and ultraviolet,

141
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:54,418
these colours confuse them,
making them easier to catch.

142
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:40,083
Far below, a blue shark
returns from a squid-hunting trip

143
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,998
in the cold darkness

144
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,000
300 metres down.

145
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:48,089
it's heading for the surface
to reheat in the warmer water.

146
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:52,971
As it ascends, it detects the smell

147
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:54,635
of oils and proteins

148
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,845
shed into the water
by the panicked mackerel.

149
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:05,270
The trail leads both the shark
and its attendant pilot fish

150
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,234
towards an easy meal.

151
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,115
Scraps and casualties

152
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,569
float in the wake
of the passing mackerel school.

153
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,536
Throughout the ocean,
predators and prey

154
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,244
are locked in a deadly
three-dimensional contest

155
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,920
of hide and seek, played out
over immense distances.

156
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:34,167
To survive, they must travel.

157
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:45,386
The huge four-metre-long
blue-fin tuna has special blood vessels

158
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:49,179
that enable it to keep
its body temperature warmer

159
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:51,432
than the surrounding water.

160
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:59,236
As a result, they can survive
in much colder conditions

161
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:03,107
than any other tuna,
and they travel thousands of miles

162
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:07,946
away from their spawning grounds
in the tropics to hunt in cold seas

163
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:10,530
where the food supply is richest.

164
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:14,372
0cean travellers
come in many guises -

165
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,249
and few are stranger than this...

166
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:26,261
a crab that spends
much of its life afloat.

167
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,475
it's a worrying passer-by

168
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:38,563
for booby birds with delicate toes.

169
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,787
Many floaters are little more
than jelly enclosed in membranes

170
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:04,665
but they may drift
for vast distances.

171
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:08,882
And turtles,
like these olive Ridleys,

172
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,419
migrate thousands of miles
every year.

173
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,803
The ocean is full of such wanderers

174
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:21,806
riding the currents and doing
their best to avoid enemies

175
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,054
while they search for food

176
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,306
and a safe place to breed...

177
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,437
which is exactly
what these rays are doing -

178
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,770
forming the two-mile high club,

179
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:37,066
gathering together
for courtship on the wing,

180
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,317
far above the ocean floor.

181
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:08,681
More nomads - flying fish.
They seem to be

182
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:11,010
on every large predator's menu,

183
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:14,888
so their whole life is spent
on the run in the open ocean.

184
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:20,061
They don't scatter their eggs

185
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:23,855
but lay them on pieces of flotsam
like this palm frond.

186
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,400
if the quality of water is right,

187
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,151
they will attach their eggs
to the frond

188
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,659
which will then serve as a kind
of life-raft for their offspring.

189
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:40,620
But it's not only flying fish
that seek nurseries.

190
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,882
Any piece of floating debris

191
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:52,671
can serve as a shelter
under which baby fish can hide.

192
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:57,727
The only drawback

193
00:20:57,895 --> 00:21:00,136
is that predators like this wahoo

194
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:03,433
check up on who's hanging about
in the shadows.

195
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,771
The wahoo may trail the flotsam
for weeks.

196
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:17,198
Few bits of flotsam
are without their quota of lodgers,

197
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,658
even man-made junk attracts them,

198
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,535
and some,
like this oceanic trigger fish,

199
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,661
defend their squatters' rights
with vigour.

200
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:38,339
The triggers, in fact, tend
to claim all the prime residences.

201
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:47,763
0ut here, even discarded netting
can provide valuable shelter,

202
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,772
so, in a bizarre twist,

203
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,015
a wrecked trawl net like this

204
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,350
can end up as a sanctuary for fish

205
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,436
until it finally sinks.

206
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:04,401
A single large piece of flotsam

207
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:08,112
can be the reason why several
square miles of open ocean,

208
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,747
instead of being empty,

209
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:13,533
will support a fish population
of hundreds of tonnes.

210
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:21,166
This huge clump of seaweed
is doing exactly that.

211
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,759
it's a giant kelp plant,

212
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,047
ripped from rocks
off the coast of California.

213
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,967
Now, it's floating
above thousands of metres of water,

214
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,719
held up by its gas-filled floats.

215
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:46,111
Young rockfish are growing up in
the safety of its shadow.

216
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:55,954
Giants also seek out
this algal flotsam.

217
00:22:58,332 --> 00:22:59,874
This is a sunfish.

218
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:04,122
it can measure as much as four
metres from fin tip to fin tip.

219
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,003
Rather surprisingly,

220
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:09,707
it has the record as
the heaviest bony fish in the sea.

221
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:16,505
Sunfish spend much of their time
at depth, where they feed on jellyfish,

222
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:18,804
but it's cold and dark down there

223
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:22,889
so from time to time, they seek
a little rest and recuperation

224
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,138
and warm up near the surface.

225
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:28,979
They too are looking
for floating kelp plants...

226
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:32,069
not for shelter,

227
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:35,985
but because here they can find
a particular kind of fish

228
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:38,232
that only lives in such places.

229
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:43,989
Half-moon fish.

230
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,534
The sunfish form up

231
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,499
in an orderly queue.

232
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,577
They have a problem.

233
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:54,161
Their skin is covered in parasites.

234
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,381
The hungry half-moons will help.

235
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:10,052
The sunfish turn their heads

236
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:14,142
as a clear invitation
to their personal hygienists.

237
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:18,312
The half-moons nip off and eat
every parasite they can find.

238
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,159
if the half-moons don't do the job,

239
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:43,334
there is another rather
drastic treatment available here.

240
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,921
Gulls rest on the floating kelp...

241
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,674
and if the sunfish
send the right signals,

242
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:55,718
the gulls will investigate.

243
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:06,016
Their beaks can dig out
the most stubborn parasites.

244
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,796
But even the very best
of health clinics

245
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:33,669
can only trade
on a temporary basis.

246
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:36,048
The seaweed rafts are rotting

247
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:39,006
and will eventually lose
their buoyancy.

248
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:49,847
Then their lodgers
will have to find a new home.

249
00:25:50,023 --> 00:25:52,394
if they can't, they will be eaten

250
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,025
or die

251
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,150
and sink down into the abyss.

252
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:12,832
But the open ocean is not entirely
devoid of permanent shelter.

253
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:20,918
A volcano is erupting
from the sea floor

254
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,167
and it's still growing.

255
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,825
it has formed an island

256
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,871
some 70 miles
from the coast of New Zealand.

257
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:10,834
Some juvenile
reef fish have already arrived,

258
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,168
carried here by a lucky current.

259
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:16,630
Now they are growing up
in the shelter of the weeds

260
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:18,882
around the island's fringes.

261
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:29,644
More plankton and juvenile fish
are being swept by currents

262
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,893
straight towards the island,

263
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,690
but now there's
a welcoming committee.

264
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:42,527
Schools of trevally and blue maomao
are patrolling the surface water.

265
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,619
All are in search of a meal.

266
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,841
These one-kilo fish

267
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,881
snap up every morsel
of plankton they find.

268
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:17,483
At times, the currents
sweeping in from the open ocean

269
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,478
bring with them all kinds of small
creatures in dense concentrations.

270
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:24,777
These are mysid shrimps.

271
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:03,555
Very little that is edible
is left after such feasts.

272
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:07,266
islands are far from being
safe havens for plankton.

273
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:15,525
The Pacific 0cean, however,

274
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,274
is peppered
with over 23,000 islands,

275
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:22,533
as well as countless other
submerged mountains - sea mounts -

276
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:25,328
whose summits do not break
the surface.

277
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:30,541
juvenile fish
for their first few months

278
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:33,039
would do well to avoid such places.

279
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:39,130
These yellow-fin tuna, however,
are now more than six months old

280
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:41,380
and 40 centimetres long -

281
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,722
big enough to be able to eat fry,

282
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:48,427
so sea mounts for them
are promising feeding grounds

283
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:51,225
where they may hunt
for several months.

284
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,820
The base of a sea mount.

285
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,065
As currents sweep towards it,

286
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:05,028
they're deflected
up its towering walls.

287
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,366
The water coming from the depths

288
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:18,078
carries both nutrients
and plankton to the surface.

289
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:26,586
Numerous reef fish
take up permanent residence,

290
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:29,929
feeding where the currents
are strongest

291
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:32,174
and the plankton most dense.

292
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:46,022
Where the cold water mixes
with warmer water at the surface,

293
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:48,817
there's a strange,
shimmering effect -

294
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,524
a clear sign that the currents
are running strongly.

295
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:13,917
But these currents attract
more than just coastal fish.

296
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:20,349
Giants come here
from the open ocean -

297
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,639
hammerhead sharks,
and in great numbers.

298
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,688
During the day,

299
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:38,405
they circle the sea mount looking
for small fish at the reef edges...

300
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,409
but not in order to eat them.

301
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:44,452
They, like the sunfish,

302
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:48,369
are looking for cleaners
to rid them of their parasites.

303
00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:56,288
White-tip reef sharks
gather here, too.

304
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:58,706
They D0 eat reef fish...

305
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,269
but they prefer to hunt at night,

306
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:14,721
when the reef fish are sleepy
and easier to catch.

307
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:17,015
Far better to rest by day

308
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:19,978
and allow the cleaners
to do their work.

309
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,945
Even swarms of breeding trigger
aren't a serious temptation.

310
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:45,041
These triggers spend
much of their time in open water,

311
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:48,044
but they've come to the sea mount
to spawn.

312
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,093
Trigger eggs are good food,

313
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,223
and the planton feeders
gather what they can

314
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,769
before the current
sweeps them away.

315
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,021
This community is here because
of the nutrients and plankton

316
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,361
the sea mount deflected
into the surface waters.

317
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:17,116
But ocean-going hunters

318
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:18,827
are never far away.

319
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:24,707
Silky sharks specialise
in picking off injured fish

320
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:28,290
and constantly check over
the residents around the sea mount.

321
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:34,339
At some times of the year,

322
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:38,920
seasonal changes make the currents
especially rich in nutrients,

323
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:43,223
and the ocean around the sea mount
becomes a virtual soup of plankton.

324
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:56,015
At such times, hunters gather
in astonishing numbers.

325
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,162
Bonito, smaller relatives
of the tuna.

326
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,030
They are searching
for still smaller plankton feeders

327
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,746
that have been attracted
by the bloom.

328
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,457
So are these jacks,

329
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:22,086
and their prey is nearby.

330
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:30,587
A school of anchovetta
has strayed up near the surface,

331
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:34,845
even though it's broad daylight
and hunters are on the prowl.

332
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:39,981
These small fish

333
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:44,395
can already feel the vibrations
of the approaching predators.

334
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,772
Swimming at speed,
they have formed into a ball,

335
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:50,734
and now they must wait
for whatever comes.

336
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:01,665
They've been detected.

337
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,474
At first, the sheer scale
of the bait ball

338
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:22,718
seems to daunt the predators...

339
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:40,901
but now the bonito arrive
and launch the first attack.

340
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:50,073
Still the bait ball holds together.

341
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:01,750
The young yellow-fin tuna move in.

342
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:04,252
The speed of this attack
is so great

343
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,842
that groups of anchovetta are
splintered from the main fish ball.

344
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,950
Before long,
the currents will shift,

345
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:18,524
and the ocean will become once more

346
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:21,489
a blue tropical desert,
plankton-free,

347
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:24,236
and the hunters
will have to move on.

348
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:37,168
Spinner dolphins,
still searching for food.

349
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,929
Their twisting leaps are,
apparently, purely social displays.

350
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:53,765
Since the hunting has been good,
many hundred have gathered together

351
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,017
in this exuberant super-pod.

352
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:06,330
But now the spinners
are starting to hunt once more.

353
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:14,878
Their skill in tracking food
is not a secret.

354
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,295
Yellow-fin tuna must be aware of it,

355
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,630
for they regularly follow them,

356
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:23,390
but only adult tuna in their
second or third year of life

357
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:28,056
have sufficient stamina to keep up
with the fast-moving spinners.

358
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:48,998
These are another kind -
common dolphin.

359
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,372
They too are on the move.

360
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:57,418
As they travel - ever inquisitive -
they pay a call

361
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,793
on one of their larger relations,
a pilot whale.

362
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:04,670
The whale is not hunting.

363
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:08,926
it's on its way to its breeding
grounds in the Mediterranean.

364
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,551
Pilot whales normally hunt
in small family groups,

365
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:17,639
but in mid-summer they head
for traditional socialising grounds,

366
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:21,765
where they will assemble in
super-herds several hundred strong.

367
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,606
Already, two families
have joined together.

368
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:29,399
The males are competing
for the favours of the females.

369
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:03,229
As the weeks pass by,

370
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:07,608
these group rubbing sessions
will become more overtly sexual,

371
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:10,313
but now
it's just flirting in the sun.

372
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:35,373
Timing in the ocean can be crucial.

373
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,796
in summer, the northern Atlantic
waters are beginning to warm.

374
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,046
The hunting is good here,

375
00:41:42,222 --> 00:41:43,800
and by june,

376
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:48,303
predators from southern waters
are heading towards the Azores.

377
00:41:57,611 --> 00:42:00,184
These are more common dolphin.

378
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:11,740
Like most oceanic dolphins,
they too often travel in huge herds

379
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:14,536
containing many different families.

380
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:24,417
There is seldom enough prey in any
one place to feed such numbers...

381
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:32,426
so small groups leave the super-pod

382
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,007
and set off on hunting expeditions.

383
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:41,430
This group will be away
from the main herd for many hours.

384
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,031
By midday, they're nearing
the islands of the Azores,

385
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:59,654
900 miles west
of the Portuguese coast.

386
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:07,289
0ther hunters are already here -
Cory's shearwaters.

387
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:18,091
Half a million of these birds
breed on the Azores every year

388
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,671
and scour the nearby ocean
for food.

389
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,384
There's insufficient wind
to support gliding flight,

390
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:28,392
and since flapping is a waste
of energy, they sit out the calm,

391
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,850
clustered in rafts
and riding the gentle swells.

392
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:53,919
By mid-afternoon, the dolphin
are starting to hunt in earnest.

393
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,301
As the sea breeze picks up,

394
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,256
the shearwaters
take to the air once more.

395
00:44:16,981 --> 00:44:20,101
0ut to sea,
the dolphin have found prey.

396
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:29,734
They are driving a shoal of small
mackerel up towards the surface.

397
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,413
The shearwaters crowd the skies,

398
00:44:40,585 --> 00:44:43,254
following the dolphins' every turn.

399
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:54,512
The mackerel
are still some metres down...

400
00:44:56,891 --> 00:45:00,306
but when the baitfish
come sufficiently close,

401
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:03,015
the airborne division
makes its move.

402
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:06,521
Far from being mere bystanders,

403
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:10,475
the shearwaters become
underwater predators themselves.

404
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:18,487
incredibly, they can dive
down to depths of several metres.

405
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:24,906
The hunting dolphin prevent the
mackerel from escaping downwards,

406
00:45:25,082 --> 00:45:28,083
and both predators
gorge themselves.

407
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:57,933
Soon, the diving birds
outnumber the dolphin

408
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:00,981
and even drive them away
from their meal...

409
00:46:01,155 --> 00:46:06,397
but another squadron of predators
arrives to replace the dolphin -

410
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,652
adult yellow-fin tuna.

411
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:14,578
These are giants, two metres long.

412
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:24,374
They are heading
directly for the bait ball.

413
00:47:25,186 --> 00:47:27,724
Despite the arrival
of the giant fish,

414
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:32,060
the shearwater continue
to press home their attack unfazed.

415
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:51,539
Eventually, the tuna move on,

416
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:55,291
leaving the shearwaters
to battle among themselves.

417
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:07,591
As long as a predatory fish
or a dolphin remains at the scene,

418
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:10,255
the mackerel can't escape to safety,

419
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:13,968
but when the little skipjack tuna
start to move away,

420
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:18,391
gradually the bait ball sinks
into the depths towards safety.

421
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,566
The shearwaters follow it down

422
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:35,195
to the very limit
of their breath-holding ability,

423
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:37,448
perhaps as deep as 15 metres.

424
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:48,245
At last, even they are forced
to leave their quarry.

425
00:48:59,768 --> 00:49:03,101
However good or bad
this summer's feeding may be,

426
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:06,188
within three months,
winter will be on its way

427
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:10,520
and the temperature of these waters
will drop by a few degrees.

428
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:14,608
Then the ocean hunters
will abandon the Azores once more.

429
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,857
As ever, they will move on,

430
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:20,069
searching for another
feeding opportunity -

431
00:49:20,244 --> 00:49:24,740
the next pulse of life in the distant
reaches of the open ocean.
