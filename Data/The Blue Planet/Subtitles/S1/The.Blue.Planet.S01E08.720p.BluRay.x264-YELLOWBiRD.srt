1
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,835
The coast - the frontier
between land and sea.

2
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:55,419
This is the most dynamic
of all the ocean habitats.

3
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:58,428
The challenge here
is to survive change,

4
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:00,589
extreme change.

5
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:32,833
Cape Douglas, on the most
westerly Galapagos island,

6
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:37,828
totally unprotected from
the massive rollers of the Pacific,

7
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,955
and one of the roughest coastlines
in the world.

8
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:20,865
The marine iguanas of the Galapagos

9
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:23,996
are the world's only
sea-going lizards.

10
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:37,883
Seaweed is all they eat, but doing so
is a dangerous business.

11
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:42,185
The local crabs have become
specially flattened,

12
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:46,979
minimising the effect
of the pounding waves.

13
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:51,276
And the iguanas have huge claws
to grip the rocks.

14
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:54,065
This seaweed really is fast food.

15
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:58,947
There are only a few seconds
in which to grab a few mouthfuls

16
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:02,237
before the next breaker
comes pounding in.

17
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:12,124
Females feed
only on the exposed rocks,

18
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:19,128
but the larger males dive beneath
the surface to reach the weed.

19
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,796
They go as deep as ten metres,

20
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:27,922
for there,
below the destructive waves,

21
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:30,010
they find the best fronds.

22
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:35,097
Cold-blooded, they have to return
to land after about ten minutes

23
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:37,313
to warm up again in the sun.

24
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,248
Finding food is not the only
challenge for coastal residents.

25
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,582
These rocky shores are hardly
a safe place to lay their eggs.

26
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,713
Each year, the marine iguanas

27
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:09,046
have to journey inland
to find a more suitable one.

28
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,760
The females lay their eggs
in burrows

29
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,423
and leave them there to hatch.

30
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:19,686
To do that,
they need nice soft sand.

31
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:33,069
Down at the water's edge,
it was easy to escape danger

32
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,984
in rocky crevices.

33
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:39,239
Up here, the females
are dangerously exposed.

34
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,248
A Galapagos hawk.

35
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:18,019
The lizards don't give up
without a struggle.

36
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:43,958
These hawks stay on the coast
all year, but they are exceptional.

37
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,587
Most of the birds
that frequent this frontier

38
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,762
spend most of their time
in or above the open ocean.

39
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,975
However, all seabirds have to come
to land in order to lay their eggs.

40
00:05:57,147 --> 00:06:01,608
And, after many lonely months
spent searching the ocean for food,

41
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,227
they have to re-establish
social relationships.

42
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:09,652
Frigate birds display

43
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,612
and exchange nest material.

44
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:18,369
Waved albatross dance.

45
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:36,340
The need to lay eggs on firm ground
ties the albatross to the coast,

46
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:39,848
but parental responsibilities
are shared.

47
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:44,893
While one looks after the egg,
the other can go off to feed.

48
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:16,671
The need to breed
brings many different animals

49
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:19,546
to the coast each year
for a few weeks.

50
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,969
Male sea turtles
spend all their lives at sea,

51
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:29,223
but the females, like birds,
must come to land to lay their eggs.

52
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,189
To do that, green turtles that live
and feed off the coast of Brazil

53
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:44,311
swim 1,500 miles to the tiny island
of Ascension,

54
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:48,570
that lies bang in the middle
of the Atlantic 0cean.

55
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,789
How they manage to navigate
with such accuracy

56
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:08,670
and find this tiny lump of rock
just seven miles wide is a mystery.

57
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:16,222
But, each year, up to 5,000 turtles
manage to do so,

58
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:21,304
and then, close to
the coast of Ascension, they mate.

59
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:25,858
Travelling to and from Ascension
and nesting can take six months.

60
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:29,976
Throughout the entire time,
none of them feed at all.

61
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,776
After mating,

62
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:40,574
a female has to leave her natural
element and haul herself onto land.

63
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:46,999
She does so at night, laying three
or four times at 15-day intervals.

64
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,918
After that, she swims back
to the seas off Brazil.

65
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,795
She returns to this very same
island throughout her life.

66
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,513
Remarkably, all the world's sea
turtles return, year after year,

67
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:04,138
to a few traditional
breeding sites.

68
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:09,221
Crab island in Australia
is one of them.

69
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:15,689
This tiny two-mile long
crescent of sand,

70
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:19,230
lying a few miles off
Queensland's northerly tip,

71
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,066
provides nesting sites

72
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:25,025
for half the population
of one of the rarest sea turtles.

73
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:28,239
Flat-backed turtles
are over a metre long,

74
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:30,454
but they have to be careful -

75
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,578
there are other giant reptiles
here, too.

76
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:36,670
Salt-water crocodiles.

77
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:45,471
Every night throughout the year,
there are flat-backs

78
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:49,505
burying their eggs
all along this stretch of sand.

79
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,567
Nine weeks later,

80
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,738
and things are about to happen.

81
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:18,910
These eyes shining in the darkness
belong to night herons.

82
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:28,914
As if from nowhere, hundreds
of birds appear on the sand dunes.

83
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:32,508
Pelicans wait patiently.

84
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:36,806
jabiru storks pace up and down.

85
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,730
Before long, they see
what they've been waiting for.

86
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,248
Because these turtles
lay their eggs throughout the year,

87
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:19,092
the hatchlings emerge nightly in
a steady trickle of beak-sized meals.

88
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:43,648
The pelicans' broad beaks allow them
to dig out the hatchlings

89
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:47,691
before the herons
can spear them on the surface.

90
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:56,327
The surf may be
hundreds of metres away

91
00:11:56,502 --> 00:12:00,369
and at least a third
do not survive the journey.

92
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:03,298
it's not just the birds
that take them.

93
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:11,930
Crocodiles, sharks and hungry fish
are all waiting in the shallows.

94
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:18,551
in fact, only one in 100 hatchlings
will survive to adulthood.

95
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:31,689
Another beach, another continent
and a very special night.

96
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:36,741
in Costa Rica, a turtle has found
a way of reducing these dangers.

97
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:41,739
When Ridley's turtles arrive
to lay their eggs,

98
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:46,791
they don't come in tens
or hundreds, but in thousands.

99
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:52,834
in the next six days, around 400,000
females will visit this beach.

100
00:12:54,802 --> 00:13:00,223
At the peak time, 5,000 are
coming and going each hour.

101
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,637
The beach gets so crowded,
they have to clamber over one another

102
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:08,061
to find bare sand
where they can dig a nest hole.

103
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:15,354
40 million eggs
are laid in these few days.

104
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,529
These turtles ensure
that six weeks later,

105
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:22,530
when their hatchlings emerge,
it's not just a trickle.

106
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,777
it's a flood!

107
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:39,038
0n some nights,
over two million hatchlings

108
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,457
race down to the sea together.

109
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:54,346
With so many
appearing simultaneously,

110
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:57,724
the predators are overwhelmed.

111
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,734
Most of the turtles
reach the sea safely.

112
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:17,407
Leaving the sea and emerging
onto land is hard enough for turtles.

113
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,417
it's even harder for fish.

114
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,928
Each year, for hundreds of miles
along the Newfoundland coast,

115
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:36,009
capelin throw themselves
onto the beaches.

116
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,333
At least a million tonnes of fish
floundering out of the water -

117
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:12,713
a real gift for scavenging
eagles and gulls.

118
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,935
0dd though it may seem
for the fish,

119
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:40,612
the capelin, like the turtles, have
also come out of the sea to breed.

120
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:56,536
The males are trying
to fertilise the eggs

121
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,415
that the females deposit in the sand.

122
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:04,499
Like the Ridley's turtles, they've
synchronised their mass laying with the tide.

123
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:07,795
in a few days, it will be over.

124
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,006
Most of the capelin die,

125
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:14,799
but only after they've left
their eggs in the sand.

126
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,847
0ther capelin populations
lay their eggs in the ocean,

127
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,474
so why do the Newfoundland fish
spawn on land?

128
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,731
it seems that eggs deposited
on the beach are safer from predators

129
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,854
and develop faster
than in colder waters out to sea.

130
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:40,328
But, wherever they do so,
the huge spawning shoals

131
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,330
provide the concentration of food
that seabirds need

132
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,625
when THEY assemble to breed.

133
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,878
95% of the world's seabirds
nest together,

134
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,715
mostly in large
spectacular colonies.

135
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:04,223
This is Funk island, 40 miles
off the coast of Newfoundland -

136
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:08,854
an isolated rock
crammed with breeding seabirds.

137
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:21,404
This was the last breeding ground
for the flightless great auk,

138
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:23,236
sadly now extinct.

139
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:27,740
Today, it's still the world's
largest guillemot colony.

140
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:33,999
0ver a million of them share
this island with 250,000 gannets.

141
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,124
it's not the lack of suitable sites

142
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:41,591
that causes seabirds
to breed in such densities.

143
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,669
Here, in the North Atlantic,

144
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:48,056
there's a wide choice of empty
coastline the birds could use.

145
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:51,806
The key factor limiting
seabird colonies

146
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:57,184
seems to be availability of food
in the surrounding ocean.

147
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,354
There are lots
of hungry mouths to feed

148
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,234
and a constant demand for fish.

149
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,956
Throughout the long summer days,
at colonies like Funk,

150
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:22,035
there's a continual stream of birds
heading out to find food

151
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:26,423
and returning with full crops
to feed their young.

152
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:36,422
Gannets will travel up to 200 miles
from the colony

153
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,971
on a single foraging trip.

154
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,144
They are not fussy eaters

155
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:46,440
and will take everything
from tiny sand eels to herring.

156
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:04,080
Puffins, on the other hand,
are particular about what they eat.

157
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:07,866
Because they can only fly
short distances,

158
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:12,954
they only nest where there is
a good supply of food close by.

159
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:22,845
0ne such place is the Sea
of 0khotsk in far eastern Russia.

160
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,596
This is the island of Talan.

161
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:36,225
Throughout the long Arctic winter
it is encircled by ice.

162
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:40,066
But as spring approaches,
that begins to break up,

163
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:43,938
and seabirds that have wintered
far to the south

164
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,192
begin to return.

165
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:54,329
its isolated position
and steep cliffs

166
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:57,750
make Talan a perfect nesting site.

167
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,371
The tufted puffins arrive first.

168
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,121
These are the Pacific cousins

169
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:08,084
of our less spectacular
Atlantic species.

170
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,760
Horned puffins soon follow.

171
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:20,227
in all, 14 different species
return to Talan each spring.

172
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:23,185
in a few weeks, the silent cliffs

173
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,186
come alive to the calls
of four million breeding seabirds.

174
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:35,159
This is a multi-storey avian city.

175
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:47,376
Assembling in these colonies,

176
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,998
after having spent
a largely solitary life at sea,

177
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:54,341
provides the birds
with the social stimulation

178
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:57,714
that is the key
to co-ordinating their breeding.

179
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,554
By nesting and laying together,

180
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:06,850
they ensure that most chicks will
leave the nest at the same time.

181
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:12,063
Like the turtles, this is the way
they spread the impact of predators.

182
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:18,938
The world's largest eagle -
Steller sea eagle -

183
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:22,152
a third as big again
as a golden eagle.

184
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:29,827
Throughout the summer, the eagles
hunt in Talan's crowded colonies.

185
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:44,550
Riding on the updrafts,
they patrol the cliff tops,

186
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:48,256
looking out for any kittiwake

187
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,848
that ventures too far
from the rock face.

188
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,229
The huge eagle swoops with
the aerial agility of a falcon.

189
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:15,281
Co-ordinated panic among the
kittiwakes confuses their attacker.

190
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:31,759
But the eagle doesn't give up.

191
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:47,436
And it has got one.

192
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,611
Another kind of seabird on Talan

193
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,128
has a particularly effective way
of defending itself against predators,

194
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:13,506
but it doesn't appear
until an hour before sunset.

195
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,346
As if from nowhere, dense swarms
of seabirds suddenly arrive offshore.

196
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,769
They've spent the day
feeding far away

197
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:32,974
where the sea ice
has already broken up.

198
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:37,775
They are crested auklets,
hardly bigger than starlings.

199
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:40,862
A million of them
return to Talan each year

200
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:43,438
to nest in its fields of boulders.

201
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:51,495
For the hour before sunset,

202
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:56,872
the hillsides come alive
with huge flocks of circling auklets.

203
00:23:57,045 --> 00:24:01,623
They're nervous.
No one wants to be the first to land.

204
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:10,757
Auklets are very social
when they're together at the coast.

205
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:13,932
0ne advantage of nesting
in such densities

206
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:18,051
may be the chance to share
information on feeding sites.

207
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,642
it also gives them
the opportunity to court.

208
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,491
But, most importantly,
there is safety in numbers.

209
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,787
Ravens and peregrines

210
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:42,621
circle above the scree slope
every evening.

211
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:03,137
By taking off together, the auklets
hope to confuse the predators.

212
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:38,294
Eventually,
their persistence pays off.

213
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,934
The birds that face
the greatest challenge

214
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:56,052
in coming to the coast to nest
are surely the penguins.

215
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:12,196
Unable to fly,
they have no alternative

216
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,577
but to brave the immense waves.

217
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:27,590
Most penguins live
in the southern ocean,

218
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,803
and they have to accept
being hurled about by the surf.

219
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:52,147
Whatever the weather,

220
00:26:52,322 --> 00:26:56,236
the penguin parents have
to come back to feed their chicks.

221
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,699
A southern sea-lion bull.

222
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:14,252
He knows the penguins always use
the same traditional landing beach.

223
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,335
Having braved the thundering surf,

224
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:24,890
the penguins have to make a mad dash
across open rock to their nests.

225
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:51,782
Despite his massive size
and a body adapted for swimming,

226
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:57,378
the bull chases the penguins
for 40 or 50 metres across the rocks.

227
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:56,804
Having caught his penguin, the
sea-lion carries it into deeper water,

228
00:28:56,972 --> 00:29:02,097
where, by violently thrashing
the little body, he skins his meal.

229
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:15,143
The seas around the Falklands are
some of the roughest in the world.

230
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:19,942
in spite of that,
the southern ocean is home

231
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:25,075
to millions of tiny seabirds hardly
bigger than swallows - petrels.

232
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:29,196
Being so small, they're very
vulnerable to the bad weather.

233
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,162
A storm can blow them
miles off course

234
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:35,954
and keep them
away from their nests for days.

235
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:42,216
But these birds have developed
an effective solution to the problem.

236
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:45,802
They lay a rather special egg.

237
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:50,053
Most birds' eggs, left exposed
for even a few hours,

238
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:52,468
will chill and never hatch.

239
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,852
But these eggs are different.

240
00:29:55,023 --> 00:29:59,601
They can be left undamaged
for several days without incubation

241
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:03,644
while the parents struggle home
through the storm.

242
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:10,945
Prions have also come up with
a good way to avoid most predators.

243
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,702
They never come back to the coast
until after dark.

244
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:20,330
These are thin-billed prions.

245
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:23,836
Their burrows honeycomb
this Falklands hillside.

246
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,880
it's deserted in daylight,

247
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,710
but as soon as it's dark

248
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:31,502
and difficult
for airborne predators to hunt,

249
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,755
the prions return.

250
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,268
As soon as they land, they call.

251
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,101
(CHiRPiNG)

252
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:54,319
The problem, of course, is finding
your burrow among all the others.

253
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:58,571
He's listening out
for his mate's call.

254
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,537
And down he goes.

255
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,371
The Alaskan coast.

256
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:17,708
it's spring, and the last
of the winter storms is subsiding.

257
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:22,050
The plankton in this sea
is in bloom again.

258
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,931
just off shore, humpback whales
have returned to feed.

259
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,684
For these huge animals,

260
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,727
there's a real risk
in coming into such shallow water,

261
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:42,605
and each year, a good number
of them pay the price.

262
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:49,863
it's an ignominious ending
for an ageing whale,

263
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,202
but so much flesh
will not go to waste.

264
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:59,496
A black bear
emerges cautiously from the woods.

265
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:13,176
Visitors to the coast
that don't come to breed,

266
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:16,305
usually come to scavenge.

267
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:21,520
A whole range of animals exploit
the enormous quantity of food

268
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:25,855
that washes up every day
on coastlines around the world.

269
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,030
But, like so much of the coast,

270
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:34,109
the quantity of flotsam and jetsam
is unpredictable.

271
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,742
Nobody can rely on it alone.

272
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,289
This carcass even attracted
a shy pack of wolves,

273
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:48,502
only too happy to anoint themselves
with the scent of rotting whale.

274
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:59,430
it was months before the scavengers
finally cleaned up all the meat

275
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,549
on this huge and unpredictable
gift from the sea.

276
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:10,314
Whales give birth
to their young at sea,

277
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,520
so can spend
their entire lives there.

278
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,403
0ther marine mammals -

279
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:19,320
ones that are, in fact,
distant cousins of bears -

280
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:24,237
have to return each year
to their ancestral home on land.

281
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,248
The high Arctic.

282
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:32,786
Here lives one of them -
the walrus.

283
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,796
Walruses spend
nearly all their lives at sea.

284
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:48,429
But each year, for a few weeks,

285
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,842
they have to return to the coast.

286
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,688
They seek out isolated beaches like
Round island in the northern Pacific.

287
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:03,897
Suitable sites like this,
free from bears, are so scarce

288
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:07,322
that at times
as many as 14,000 animals

289
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:11,110
will cram themselves
onto this one beach.

290
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:23,964
When they first emerge from the sea,
the walrus are white.

291
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:27,796
As warm-blooded animals
living in a very cold ocean,

292
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,628
they conserve heat

293
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:34,429
by keeping their blood concentrated
in the core of their bodies.

294
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,841
0n land, it's warm enough

295
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:40,636
for them to allow
their outer blood vessels to dilate.

296
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:44,478
That turns their skin
from white to pink.

297
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:55,070
Now they can moult
the outer layers of their skin,

298
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:58,658
rubbing themselves
up against the rocks.

299
00:35:00,664 --> 00:35:06,582
But more than anything else,
coming to land brings the walrus relief

300
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:08,875
from having to spend energy

301
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:13,090
maintaining body temperature
in an icy-cold ocean.

302
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:20,170
Heat conservation, in fact,
may be the primary reason

303
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:25,424
so many sea mammals are forced
to return to the land each year.

304
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:31,514
The world's coldest seas

305
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:33,932
are in Antarctica.

306
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:38,059
Each spring, half the world's
southern elephant seals

307
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:41,073
return to the island
of South Georgia.

308
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:46,400
Elephant seals have a particularly
thick insulation of blubber

309
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,370
that keeps them warm.

310
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,452
For them, breeding is the only
reason to leave the sea.

311
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,001
With temperatures down to minus 20,

312
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:02,249
and 100-mile-an-hour winds,

313
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,999
it can't be comfortable
on the beach.

314
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:09,127
But heat dissipates more rapidly
through water than air.

315
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:11,465
So even in these conditions,

316
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,720
their young, which at first
don't have a thick coat of blubber,

317
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:17,183
will be far warmer on the land.

318
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:22,941
0nce the males are established on
the beach, the females soon follow.

319
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,315
Within just ten days,

320
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:34,781
the empty beach fills up
with 6,000 elephant seals.

321
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,164
Almost immediately,
the females give birth

322
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,658
to pups sired the previous year.

323
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:56,929
Their milk is very rich and the
pups grow astonishingly quickly.

324
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,060
in just three weeks,
they turn from thin bags of skin,

325
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,641
to fat balls of blubber.

326
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:17,940
As soon as they've given birth, the
females become sexually receptive.

327
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:23,821
Now the advantages of breeding
in dense colonies become clear.

328
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:27,080
Females can choose from many males,

329
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:32,374
while successful males can have
access to lots of females.

330
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:42,049
But to gain that access
and control a harem of females,

331
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:45,008
the bull must be prepared to fight.

332
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,762
(R0ARS)

333
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:11,236
The larger the male, the louder
the roar, the more likely he is to win.

334
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,995
When males are well matched,

335
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:28,800
these bloody battles
will last 20 minutes or more.

336
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,195
Eventually, the loser retreats

337
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:53,442
into a stream already pink
with his own blood.

338
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:09,916
These battles certainly help
females select the strongest bulls,

339
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:12,840
but they bring great dangers
to the pups.

340
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:26,099
Each year, in the denser parts
of the colony,

341
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,555
a fifth of the pups
are crushed to death.

342
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:32,138
This is why
it may be better to mate

343
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:35,270
at the edge of the beach
close to the sea.

344
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,323
Less dominant males
hide in the surf.

345
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:48,194
They are waiting to try and steal
an illicit mating

346
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:50,827
with females as they come and go.

347
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:57,834
This male knows he has been spotted
by the big bull

348
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:01,872
who claims all the females
on this part of the beach.

349
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:09,771
Breeding in groups
can bring advantages to pups

350
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,817
as well as to adults.

351
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,531
Along the coast of Patagonia,

352
00:41:20,702 --> 00:41:25,992
southern sea-lions breed together
in groups several hundred strong.

353
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:32,084
For the growing pup, these colonies
act rather like a school.

354
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:38,173
The bonds developed here may be
vital for the rest of their lives.

355
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:40,335
Sea-lions are social animals.

356
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:43,084
As adults and young
forage together,

357
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:48,886
they probably share information
about good feeding sites.

358
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:54,390
Conditions could hardly be better
for the growing youngsters.

359
00:41:54,565 --> 00:42:00,235
As the tide goes out, it leaves
a selection of sheltered pools.

360
00:42:00,404 --> 00:42:04,152
Perfect places
for learning to swim.

361
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:42,808
At high tide,
it's easy for the pups

362
00:42:42,982 --> 00:42:47,276
to take their first
experimental dips in the surf.

363
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,883
A killer whale.

364
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:31,388
These young pups have never seen
anything like it before.

365
00:43:42,784 --> 00:43:46,034
The whales,
though, are very experienced.

366
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:50,415
Each year, this same group
turns up along the coast

367
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:55,043
at precisely the same time
as the pups start to swim.

368
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:06,340
The whales
need to surprise the pups,

369
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:10,724
so they have stopped calling
to each other, and keep silent.

370
00:44:19,483 --> 00:44:21,356
Speed is everything.

371
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:29,528
The whales do not take pups
that are out of the water,

372
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,950
but their momentum
can drive them up the beach

373
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,535
and then there's real danger
of getting stuck.

374
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:17,164
The whale has to thrash in this
frenzied way to get off the beach.

375
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:22,044
Most of the pups are taken
into deep water while still alive.

376
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:27,291
And there the whales,
apparently, play with them.

377
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:55,611
0ften, an adult whale
is joined in the game by a youngster.

378
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:58,952
it may be learning
how to grab a seal pup

379
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:02,122
before it risks
a drive up the beach.

380
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:13,794
Whatever the reason,
the seal pup - still alive -

381
00:47:13,968 --> 00:47:18,594
is tossed back and forth
for over half an hour.

382
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,915
Even when the pup is dead,

383
00:47:53,085 --> 00:47:56,252
the whales' sport
is not completely over.

384
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:28,858
We can only speculate

385
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:33,695
at the real reasons behind
this extraordinary behaviour.

386
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:51,175
But, for the whales,
the hunting season is a short one.

387
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:56,006
Before long, the pups learn
to stay clear of the water,

388
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:59,017
and the whales
become less successful.

389
00:48:59,184 --> 00:49:02,019
After two weeks, they move on.

390
00:49:02,187 --> 00:49:05,638
The killing season is over.

391
00:49:15,115 --> 00:49:18,234
That's how it often happens
along the coast.

392
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:20,532
Things are always changing.

393
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:23,075
They're never the same for long

394
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:28,288
in this, the most dynamic
of all the ocean's habitats.
