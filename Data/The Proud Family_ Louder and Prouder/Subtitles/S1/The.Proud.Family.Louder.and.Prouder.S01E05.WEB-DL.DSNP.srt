I don't know, Lizzo. People already threw
stuff at me when I was up on that stage.

377
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,104
I don't wanna go through that again.

See? I told you.
You can do anything you want.

526
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,672
Don't ever forget that, Penny.

527
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,674
I won't. Thank you, Lizzo.

528
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,177
Now, me and Deathwish
gotta find your daddy.

529
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,930
That $500 check bounced, girl.

530
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,729
(LAUGHS)

531
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,398
Hey.

532
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,359
Penny, you were amazing!

533
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,945
Girl, the crowd loved you! Go on ahead!

534
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,408
Yeah, your voice made
the song pippeta-pop, child.

535
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,994
Let's not go overboard. She was okay.

536
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,122
She was great,
and we owe you an apology, Penny.

537
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,916
We didn't have your back
like friends are supposed to.

538
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,253
Yeah, and we all sisters
in this man's world.

539
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,588
We gotta stick together.

540
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,423
Amen, sister!

541
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,681
So, what do you say, Penny? We still cool?

542
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,225
Like the other side of the pillow.
