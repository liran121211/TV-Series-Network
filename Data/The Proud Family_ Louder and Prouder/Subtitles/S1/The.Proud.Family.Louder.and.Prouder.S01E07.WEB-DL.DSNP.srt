Sleeping through class? Getting F's?

340
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,770
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
but I'm late for orchestra rehearsal.

341
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,565
Fine, be that way. You wack anyway.

342
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,071
Dijonay, where you goin'?

343
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,074
Back to middle school. College is hard.

344
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,826
Plus, ain't nobody here
who can do my hair and nails.

345
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,497
Good thing Roker gave us a week
to change our mind.

346
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,457
You better make a decision.

347
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,168
Bye, girl.

348
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,212
Dijonay, are you ready?

349
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,090
You're leaving too, LaCienega?

350
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,092
I've looked forward
to my quince all my life,

351
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,428
and I am not giving that up
for a school called P.U.

352
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,138
Guys, why are you leaving?

353
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,683
'Cause this ain't nothin'
but a glorified plantation.

354
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,811
-I belong at an HBCU.
-Me, too.

355
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,271
Me? I hate pledging.

356
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,024
This is what we dreamed of.
Being on our own.

357
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,903
No. That was your dream, Proud.
Enjoy the loneliness.

358
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,071
(LAUGHS)

359
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,993
Don't worry, Kareem, we'll still have
plenty of fun without them.

360
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,870
No, you have fun. I'm outta here.

361
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,497
But what about us?

362
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,957
I'll see you in four years.

363
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,543
(SCOFFS) You'll probably
still be a sophomore.

Kareem, too. Ooh! He's so...
Can't... Ugh! They...

370
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,984
They couldn't handle being grown.

"Failure to attend class,
to register, to pay dorm fees.

374
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,542
"Failure as a human being."

377
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,976
Will somebody tell me
what's the deal with this?

378
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,104
-And what's with the hair, Myron?
-The ladies love it.

379
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,565
Speaking of which,
I hear your boy toy dipped.

380
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,900
I thought maybe we could...

381
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,485
No, Myron.

382
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:54,114
People don't call me Myron here, Penny.
I go by M-Squared.

383

384
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,367
I'm hilarious. (GRUNTS)

You gonna fix this for me
or what, blockhead?

386
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,622
Ooh, Penny, you've been in the gym.

387
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,166
I can't touch this.
You gotta talk to the big guy.

388
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,001
Who's this "big guy"?

389
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,257
I don't know how I can owe
this much money in just seven days.

390
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,718
Listen, y'all are gonna have
to get it from my parents.

391

(DISTORTED VOICE) Oh, but you don't have
parents in this world, Penny Proud.

393
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,105
That's Dean Big Guy to you.

394
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,898

395
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,067
Ooh, such saucy language.

396
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,862
I'm 19. I can say whatever I want.

397
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,657
Sure you can,
but you also have responsibilities.

398
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,034
Like going to class, paying tuition

399
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,246
and your food tab, which you ran out on.

400
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,206
We frown upon dining and dashing.

401
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,417
But I spent all my money on books.

402
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,253
And a brand-new car.

403
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,883
I'll take those keys, by the way.
I've always wanted a convertible.

404
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,261
Take the car, then. I just wanna go home.

405
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,597
Too late to be a penny pincher.
You missed that deadline.

406
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,975
Get me out of here, Roker!
I'm not playin'!

407
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,602
I'll tell you what.
Since I like you so much,

408
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,480
I'll let you go back
after you pay off your debt.

409
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,651
What don't you understand
about the words "I'm broke," Roker?

410
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:17,865
Ah, giving Dean Big Guy attitude
will get you nowhere. Now take this.

411

(THUDS)

412
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,538

413
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,998
What the heck is a mixtape?

414
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:30,252
You know those annoying people
at barbershops, beauty salons, car washes?

415
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,837
They all work for me.

416
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,299
Providing subpar goods
at above-par prices.

417
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,594
So, if you wanna get back home,
you better get to sellin'.

418
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,221
But I don't even know what this stuff is.
How can I sell...

419
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,473
No buts. You wanted to be on your own?

420
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,019
Welcome to adulthood, Penny Proud,
where there are no free rides.

421
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,812

Now this other one,
I don't know what...

430
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,715
Hey, everybody.
I got that Egyptian Musk.

431
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,926

You get a cool refund of $3 and 50 cents!

443
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,630
$3 and 50 cent?

444
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,633
I spent over a thousand dollars
for these books!

445
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,094
If you brought the books back unused
like Dijonay,

446
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,470
I'd give you a better price.

(GRUNTING)

507
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,417
Get your little Roker butts out here!

508
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,835
LITTLE LEBRON: You know it, boss!

509
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
(CHATTERING)

510
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,593
Ahhh!

511
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,802
Oh, that's hot.

512
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,764
Yes!

513
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,558
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)

514
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,062
ROKER: We're num...
We're number one! Whoo-hoo!

515
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,108
-No!
-(EXCLAIMS)

516
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,402
-(SQUEALING) We won! We won! We won!
-(LAUGHING)

517
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,737
We won! Yes!

518
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,697
Ugh!

519
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,574
-No!
-Unbelievable!

520
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,328
Man, it's all over. Pay up, Roker, baby.

521
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,455
Fine. All right, you both can go.

522
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,625
Say less. You ain't gotta tell me twice.
Let's go, Daddy.

523
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,418
Nope. I'm staying, baby girl.

524
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,587
I still got six days left
on my free trial.

525
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,632
Next time you see the Big O,
I'll be in the NBA.

526
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,799
Send her home, Roker.

527
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,593
Wait, Daddy. Aren't you coming with...

528
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,347
So, Big Fella, the Big O era starts today.

529
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,140
And it also ends today.

530
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,268
-Bye, bye, Big Zero.
-Wait, wait, wait...

531
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,271
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)

532
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,940
(COUGHING)

533
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,399
<i>Oh, boys, get me a cough drop.</i>

534
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,822
Oh, yes! It's me again! Yes! (LAUGHS)

535
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,451
(GROANS)

536
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,536
(GLASS BREAKING)

537
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,371
Daddy, I thought you were staying.

538
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,248
So did I. Roker tricked me.

539
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,999
Yeah, that's what he does.

540
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:48,171
Daddy, I just wanna say,
I owe you an apology.

541
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,759
I really thought being on my own
was gonna be easy, but I am not ready.

542
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,843
(CHUCKLES)

543
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:58,348
And you don't have to be, baby girl.
You got plenty of time to figure it out.

544
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,393
And until you do, we got you.

545
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,523
No matter how embarrassing it might seem,
we're only doin' it for you.

546
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,318
So you mean you going on stage

547
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,196
and getting shot out of a cannon
by Lamorne Morris

548
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,322
was for me, Daddy?

549
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,658
Actually, no, Penny. That was for me.

550
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,536
I've always wanted to be
in a big Broadway show.

551
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,414
(SINGING) <i>I sold out, I'm not a sell-out</i>

552
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,208
<i>I sold out, I'm not a sell-out</i>

553
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,586
<i>I sold out, I'm not a sell-out</i>

554
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,087
PENNY: Daddy... (CHUCKLES)

555
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,757
-I love you.
-OSCAR: And I love you, too, baby girl.

556
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,093
<i>I sold out, I'm not a sell-out</i>

557
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,762
