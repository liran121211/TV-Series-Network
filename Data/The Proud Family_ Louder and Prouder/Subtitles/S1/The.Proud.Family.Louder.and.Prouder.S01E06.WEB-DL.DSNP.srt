I wanted to let you know that me and
my friends started a rideshare business

for parents who are too busy
to pick up their kids.

230

That's cute, baby girl.
But Daddy's too busy to talk right now.

231
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:25,249
But, Daddy, you're always looking
for a great business opportunity, right?

232
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:30,087
So, for only $200,
you can get in on the ground floor.

233

If I had $200, do you think I'd be trying
to teach a monkey how to speak English?

234
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,594
Why are you trying to start
a business? You're too young.

But, Daddy, you've always told me
I can do anything.
