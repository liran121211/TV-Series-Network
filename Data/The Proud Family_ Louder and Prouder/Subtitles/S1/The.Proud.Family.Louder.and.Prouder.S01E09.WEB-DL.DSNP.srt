Look, LaBrea told me what really happened,

520
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:59,127
and I had no idea the kind of pressure
I was putting on that girl.

521
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,964
I've been doing the same thing to her
that Mom used to do to us.

522

Look, I apologize about everything.

Ever since the divorce,

528
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,857
I've just been really stressed
and taking it out on everyone.

529
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,405
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I wish we could be like we used to be.

530
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,698

(IN ENGLISH) Bye, girl.
I'm really gonna miss you.

00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,409
Miss you too, LaBrea,

541
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,995
and I'll be sure to unblock you
on all my social media.

You've been going over what, Felix?

558
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,408
Nothing. As long as my baby is happy.

559
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,995
I mean we did spend her college fund,
but as long as she's happy.
