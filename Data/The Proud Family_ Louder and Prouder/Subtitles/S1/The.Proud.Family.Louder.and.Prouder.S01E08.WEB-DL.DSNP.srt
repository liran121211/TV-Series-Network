(ALL LAUGHING)

178
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,590
Guess how many detentions you got? A lot.

179
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,385
Don't act like I don't know that song.

180
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,389
Zang! Why is Ms. Hill so mean?

181
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,599
That's what I was tryin' to tell you guys.

182
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,186
Last night, I got in trouble
because I left my phone in detention,

183
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,231
so I bought this really cool night crawler
stealth suit on Wizard Prime.

184
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,066
Ooh, it was midnight blue,
it was so cute...

185
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,651
Get to the point, Black Widow.

186
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,363
So, I crawled outta the house,
and when I got to school,

187
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,241
Ms. Hill was in the teachers' lounge.

188
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,203
So? That's where teachers go,
hence the name "teachers' lounge."

189
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
Not at 10:00 at night.

190
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,458
And not wearing old pajamas
and a lunch room avocado facial mask,

191
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,836
while singing
<i>It's My House and I Live Here.</i>

192
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,337
Why would she be doin' that?

193
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,382
Y'all, I think she's homeless.

194
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,343
Aw, that's sad.

195
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,428
I know, right?

196
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,015
You gotta keep this a secret.
You can't tell anybody.

197
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,111
Thanks, Penny, for getting
your Uncle Bobby to help me.

All right, Zoey, show me
what you're workin' with.

No. No, that's Lisa, baby girl.

211
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,665

I got nine brothers and sisters.

225
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,092
Besides, Ms. Hill made her own bed.

226
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,010
She doesn't even have a bed.

to say is that I feel bad.

Wait, I'm sorry, why is there
a microwave in your front seat?

237

Why anybody else would have
a microwave in they seat?

those pictures to Dijonay,

she wouldn't have gone to the principal.

Ms. Hill needs to take her butt
over to Dijonay's house

in the nine o'clock position.

The knife goes on the right,
sharp side pointed towards the plate

321

Now I remember you.

You were that little bougie girl
that my Bobby took to the prom.

Worst day of my baby boy's life.

to the prom dinner to cut up his meat,

it would've gone better.

333
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,466

all you can do for me

344
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,868
is write a 500-word essay
on why your snacks are so nasty.

345
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,829
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, you can talk about
my mama and my wife,

346
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,498
but nobody talks about my snacks.

347
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,582
And give my shirt back!

348
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,666
That's it!

349
