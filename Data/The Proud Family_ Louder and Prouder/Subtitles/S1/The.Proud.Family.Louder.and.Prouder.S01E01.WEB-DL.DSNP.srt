00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,457
which means there's nothing
we can do about it!

513
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,085
Ugh. You actin' real lame right now.

514
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,420
No, I'm not!

515
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,422
It's just that he seems happy.

516
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,678
But, if this is what you wanna do,
then I guess...

517
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,222
Penny, remember how we raised you.

518
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,893
You know what? You're right.

519
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:02,107
I am lame, inconsequential,
superficial, and a fool.

520
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,110
Because I was willing
to do anything to be your friend.

521
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,029
I don't know if seeing the light
the other night confused me,

522
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,533
but as of now,
I am officially no longer confused.

523
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,493
You're the superficial one.

524
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,497
Not to mention pushy, delusional,
and hard-headed.

525
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,334
The bear just told you he's happy,
but you won't hear it.

526
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,254
Well, I did,
and I am not kidnapping a bear.

527
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,842
That's federal time. And I'm through
letting you kidnap me. I'm out!

528
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,093
Where you goin'?

529
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,345
To hang out with my "squad."

530
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,514
They may not be all that to you,

531
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,809
but at least they appreciate me
for being me.

532
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,062
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shuggie.
Keep doin' you.

533
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,650
Now, see, Shuggie like her.

534
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,945

-TRUDY: Take the twins with you, Oscar.

Damn, woman,
can I have a moment to myself?

Besides, I don't even have no car seats
in the car. Now, bye!
