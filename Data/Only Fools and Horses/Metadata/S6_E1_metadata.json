He even - temporarily - gives up the Nag's Head for a trendy wine bar where he is just a little too casual for his own good. Rodney goes on a computer course and meets a nice girl called Cassandra. When she offers him a lift home, he is ashamed to tell her where he lives and gets her to drop him off in an upmarket suburban avenue. She eventually rumbles his deception, but agrees to go on a date anyway.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "Del has re-invented himself as a self-styled 'yuppie', and is hatching plans to buy the Trotters' flat off the council - only with plans then to sell it on at a tasty profit. Meanwhile, Rodney has aspirations of his own - and has enrollled at a computer class at his local college. Del's attempts to impress the ladies with his new image meet with a mixed response - though Rodney seems to be having slightly more luck with a well-to-do girl he's met at his evening class. Will 'yuppie love' prevail, or will they both have to learn some difficult lessons?\u2014stevecann2003"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0666595", "rating": 9.2, "votes": 838, "number_of_episodes": 64}
