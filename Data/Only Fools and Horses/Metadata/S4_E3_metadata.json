To make things worse, the deep-fat fryer they sold to Mike, landlord of The Nag's Head, is on the blink and the tension brings Del and Rodney to boiling point. Throughout all this trouble, Uncle Albert, whom Rodders blames for their bad luck, keeps telling them that something will turn up. As Albert leaves the pub, he accidentally falls through an open cellar door, and the Trotters quickly come up with a way to get some cash: by suing the pub for damages. Albert's accident claim finally makes it to court, but to his nephews' shock, it appears that he has already sought 15 identical damage claims going back to 1944. Their case gets chucked out of court, and Albert admits that he was using some of the tricks he learned in parachute training to try to help Del and Rodney pay for Grandad's headstone.\u2014Rune Thandy", "Trotters' Independent Traders are running seriously short of money--and Rodney's investment at auction in \u00a3500-worth of sun-cream in the middle of a freezing winter hasn't exactly helped matters.
