It's not long before Del discovers that Jason's mother, June, is an old flame who he last saw around nineteen years ago. While Del and June rekindle their romance, Rodders is dating a lovely girl from the newsagent called Debby - a fact that is seriously curtailing his dirty magazine fetish. It soon transpires that Debby is June's daughter, and it's almost her 19th birthday. Del and Rodney soon put two and two together, and decide that Debby may well be Del's daughter. It gets worse when Rodney realises that he has fallen for a girl who could be his niece. Everything comes to a head when Del finally confronts June to find out whether Debby is his daughter or not. It turns out that Debby was actually fathered by his friend Albie Littlewood, who tragically died on the railway line whilst he was seeing June behind Del's back.\u2014Rune Thandy", "By chance, Del meets old flame June, whom he hasn't seen for nearly 20 years - and now back on the same council estate as the Trotters.
