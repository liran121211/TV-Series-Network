But while Grandad is worried about Sandra knowing about the Trotters' sullied reputation, Del is sweating over the amount of dodgy gear stored in the flat. At the end of their date at the cinema, Rodders brings Sandra back to the flat for a nightcap. As soon as she arrives, Del spots her wearing a stolen watch that Rodney has given her as a gift. Thinking fast, he 'accidentally' pours gin over it and promises to buy her a replacement. Ever the gent, Rodney offers to walk her home, and everything appears to be forgiven. But as Sandra says goodbye, she tells Rodney he has 24 hours to empty the flat of stolen goods belonging to Trotters' Independent Traders before she notifies CID.\u2014Rune Thandy", "Rodney, ever the 'plonker', dates a new girlfriend called Sandra who turns out to be a policewoman. This isn't good news for the Trotters, and Del and Grandad aren't best impressed - especially with their law-evading reputation, and flat filled with dodgy gear. When Rodney unwisely brings her home after a cinema date, it seems he's become a law unto himself - and he seriously runs the risk of Sandra putting police 'business' before pleasure.\u2014stevecann2003"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0666577", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 688, "number_of_episodes": 64}
