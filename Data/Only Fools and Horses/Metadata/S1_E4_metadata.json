Despite their engagement, Pauline left Del for another Mod with a faster scooter.

Del hears rumours about a recent police investigation into the death of Pauline's former husband (Bobby Finch), and when Pauline urges him to take out life insurance, a frightened Del heads for Clacton, leaving an eviction notice for his fianc\u00e9e.\u2014Rune Thandy", "Del's ex-fianc\u00e9e Pauline unexpectedly turns up at the Nag's Head, and he's surprised to hear that not only has she been married twice since, but both of her husbands have died sudden deaths.
