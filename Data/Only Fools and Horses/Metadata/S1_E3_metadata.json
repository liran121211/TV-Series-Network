After a dance at the Camberwell Chamber of Trade, Del and Vimmal are cornered by Mr Ram and his heavy boys. It seems that Vimmal is holding onto a pricey porcelain family heirloom that belongs to the Ram family - and they want it back. In order to make an impression, Del offers to mediate between the two men, especially because Mr Ram is willing to pay four grand for the return of the statue to his family. Unluckily for Del the four grand is just a ruse and he ends up losing a fortune to Vimmal and Mr Ram, a couple of con men touring the country using the same scam on local businessmen wherever they go.\u2014Rune Thandy", "Del has attended a posh Chamber of Trade bash, and seems to have made a promising new business contact from the Asian community in the shape of Vimmal Malik. Before he realizes though, he gets inadvertently caught up between Vimmal and the rival Raam family over the ownership of a valuable Indian statuette, which they both claim is a family heirloom.
