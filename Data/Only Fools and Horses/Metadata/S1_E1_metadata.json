When Rodney decides to become the Trotters' financial adviser - monitoring the accounts and keeping Del's dodgy dealings in check - Del has second thoughts about their partnership. Cracks show in the partnership when Rodney inadvertently bungles a deal with Trigger. But despite Del's anger, it turns out that Rodder's advice would have prevented the purchase of 25 briefcases that are locked with the serial number inside. Del and Rodney have yet another row and 'Little Bruv' plans a career change. Desperate to make his mark on the world, Rodney decides to leave for Hong Kong - a great plan, if only he'd remembered his passport.\u2014Rune Thandy", "In this first episode, we get to meet wheeler-dealer Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter, younger brother (and so-called business partner) Rodney, and their twin-TV-watching Grandad - all living together in a council tower block in East London. Down at their local The Nag's Head, they meet friend Trigger - and do a swift deal to buy some briefcases off him, which Del hopes to sell at a tidy profit.
