However, possibly due to one of the Albanian radios Del has imported and is fitted in the coach there is a fire and an explosion and, due to a train strike, the party are forced to stay overnight. As it is a Bank Holiday accommodation is scarce and the Trotters find themselves in a creepy old guest house run by scary Mrs. Cresswell. Del and Rodney go to a club where they see magician the Great Ramondo and his assistant, Raquel, a former girl-friend of Del. Returning to the guest house they find themselves locked out and return to Raquel's flat, where Del, who still has feelings for her, makes a fool of himself by assuming that Ramondo, who is actually gay, is sexually harassing her and hits him, throwing his suit-case out of a window. On return to London Rodney makes a similar fool of himself by assuming that Cassandra is having an affair with her boss, whilst Del finds out that the suit-case he threw out of the window hit Boycie and Trigger.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "It's Bank Holiday weekend, and the Trotters (plus the regulars of the Nag's Head) hire a coach for their bi-annual Jolly Boys' daytrip to the seaside town of Margate.

Everyone has a good time in Margate, but events take a couple of unexpected twists as it appears the Jolly Boys may be staying beside the seaside a little bit longer than expected...\u2014stevecann2003"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0666576", "rating": 9.6, "votes": 1602, "number_of_episodes": 64}
