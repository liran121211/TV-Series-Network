When Rodney admits to Del that he was lying about the girl he's bringing to the party. Del sets about trying to get him a date. On Friday night the brothers go clubbing, and after trying just about every club in London, they end up in a seedy little bar where Del spots Yvonne, an old flame who, he remembers, isn't too picky about dates, and he offers to pay her part of the winnings from Rodney's bet if she'll escort his little bruv the following night. When Rodney gets home from The Nag's Head on Saturday night he's in tears. Apparently, the date went well--until halfway through the evening when Yvonne takes centre stage in the pub and starts stripping off in front of all of Rodney's mates.
