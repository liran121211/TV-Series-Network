He unsuccessfully tries to tell her a rickety old cabinet is in fact a 'Queen Anne' original, but wise to the ruse, she coolly declines. Her attitude towards Del does warm when she responds to an advertisement placed by the Trotters in the local paper. When a painting Del has in stock catches her eye, Miranda soon worms her way into Del's affections and in no time at all, he has given her the painting as a gift. Keen to see her again, Del pays a visit to her shop, and is informed that she's at the local auction house. Arriving at the auction, Miranda seems quite surprised to see him there, but not as half as surprised as Del Boy when Lot 24 is announced. The Lot turns out to be Del's painting - a valuable work by 19th century painter Joshua Blythe that Miranda is hoping to make a huge profit on. It seems like Miranda has stung Del good and proper, but as usual, he has the last laugh when he informs her that she's actually selling stolen property.\u2014Rune Thandy", "When posh antiques dealer Miranda answers Del's newspaper ad concerning an alleged Queen Anne cabinet he's trying to sell, they both look to be getting slightly more than they bargained for. Can Miranda really have fallen for Del's charms - or does she have other more ulterior motives?\u2014stevecann2003"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0666594", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 612, "number_of_episodes": 64}
