1
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:17,410
Everyone was aiming
for the eye of the fish,

2
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,732
but the guy who hit the bullseye,

3
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:23,009
was the founder of Apha1, Mehta.

4
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:27,927
And that's how
Maharashtra offline princess

5
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:30,877
KC Enterprises, finally tied the knot.

6
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:32,947
We need to wait and watch,

7
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:38,573
where the princes of undersized
kingdoms like Pragati will aim for now.

8
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,384
What will be their next target now?

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,806
To find out like, comment
and subscribe to RRR.

10
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,821
Who the fuck is this Startup Kumar.

11
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,788
Since I mentioned don't write dickhead,

12
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,629
he keeps writing dickhead
when I come online.

13
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,314
We should have seen this coming.

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,064
But we didn't.

15
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:01,690
The founders should have seen it.

16
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,893
But this is backstabbing.

17
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:05,501
How would they know?

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,851
And this idiot Pappi
bought an extra cake.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,285
It was for everyone,
to celebrate.

20
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:15,136
Can deals be cancelled like this?

21
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:18,408
Pappi, all this is very common.

22
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:21,607
It happens. If we couldn't crack this
one, we'll partner with someone else.

23
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:22,661
So what?

24
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:24,714
The guys must be planning something big.

25
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:26,607
Not to worry.

26
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:30,690
Yogi didn't tell us anything.

27
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:32,554
I'll go ask him.

28
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:33,758
I'll come too.

29
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:38,454
Jeetu sir's deal--

30
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,920
You're not supposed
to talk about the CEO.

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,390
You'll get us in trouble, Pappi.

32
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:48,417
Five million was already locked.

33
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,244
Why did VC cancel that?

34
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,269
We were the ones who unlocked it.

35
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,670
Don't tell brother anything.

36
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,272
That's the third mail from Prachi.

37
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,173
Asking when are we meeting.

38
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:03,669
Did you ask Naveen?

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,819
He hasn't been answering
my calls for two days.

40
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,264
That's why I told him not to move out.

41
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,721
You can't get mad at your roommate
if your girlfriend dumped you.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,444
A sensitive guy should not live alone.

43
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,243
That's why I moved in with you.

44
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:26,008
Yes, brother. Are you here?

45
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,230
We're coming.

46
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,222
So Elon Musk...

47
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:37,754
Jeff Bezos...

48
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:41,985
So you finally bought the SUV.

49
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:45,881
-Touch screen, four-ways AC.
-Sunroof.

50
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:46,878
Yeah.

51
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:51,262
Yogi, how is it?

52
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,247
Big.

53
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,650
This isn't what you call big.

54
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,302
It's going to look timid
compared to a private jet.

55
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,452
That's what you guys are gonna buy,
when you release your IPO.

56
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:02,069
IPO.

57
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,807
See this...

58
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,805
Perks of having a job.

59
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,933
Right, screw me.

60
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,825
We employees keep running
between salary and bonus.

61
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,836
You startup guys are changing the world.

62
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:19,857
No, brother.

63
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,232
Don't call me brother, Yogi.

64
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,956
You are older than me.

65
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,950
By the way, congratulations.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,469
Mandal was saying
you are going to have a baby.

67
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,592
When did I tell you?

68
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,673
-I did.
-Oh, yes.

69
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:33,983
-Yeah.
-Actually, even my friends call me Mandal.

70
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:35,101
Yeah, so...

71
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:37,633
But everyone's invited
to the baby's naming ceremony.

72
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:40,172
Tell Jeetu and Naveen
they are invited too.

73
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,085
I want all four friends there.
It's a family affair.

74
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,018
What was the name of
Naveen's cute girlfriend?

75
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,046
-Shreya.
-Shall we invite her too?

76
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:56,175
-Where is she nowadays?
-What are you saying, brother?

77
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:57,636
I told you...

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,486
You are going to be a father,
learn to behave.

79
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,929
But I am just another guy around you.

80
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,540
-Let's go booze.
-No, no...

81
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,021
I am not asking, I am telling you.

82
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:10,271
It's been a long time.

83
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,850
Your sister-in-law has made
this state a dry state.

84
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,564
Open the sunroof.

85
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:18,321
It's the moonroof at night, Yogi. Okay?

86
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,648
Mandal.

87
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,056
I really bonded with your brother today.

88
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:23,913
-That--
-He's a cool guy.

89
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:29,659
When you win after you've
lost is a 'Baazigar' (Player)!

90
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,705
What do you call a person
who's lost a winning game.

91
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:35,439
Founder.

92
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,857
No, no, no. Co-founder.

93
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,318
Yeah, co-founder.

94
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:47,787
Oh, God!

95
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:58,273
Yogi and Mandal's
house is being ransacked.

96
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,802
You?

97
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,372
What happened?

98
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,926
I still have a key.

99
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:27,144
PIVOT?

100
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,123
2.0?

101
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:35,300
Yes.

102
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:41,119
So that's what Pragati 2.0
is going to look like.

103
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,805
Seriously? Product change?

104
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,319
Isn't that a desperate move, guys?

105
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,500
Are you guys sure about it?

106
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,246
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-Yes.

107
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:00,993
Yeah...

108
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,715
We just need to figure out
little things. But mostly we are good.

109
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,390
Don't worry, Prachi.

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,437
From Nokia to Starbucks, all these
big companies were made by pivoting.

111
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,027
And according to a survey,
13% of startup

112
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,518
fails if they don't pivot
at the right time.

113
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,546
And according to that survey,
25% of startups shutdown

114
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,239
because of a pivot gone wrong.

115
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,752
You are trying to
convince us and yourself,

116
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,390
that we should do this.

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,768
But... I think it's right to say
that we don't have a choice.

118
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes, but what's wrong with it?

119
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:37,126
Have you heard about Odeo?

120
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:38,742
The cream biscuit.

121
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:41,648
Odeo. ODEO.

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,027
It was a podcast-sharing website.

123
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:47,624
But they suffered a setback like us
when iTunes was launched.

124
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,469
And even they had to pivot.

125
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,876
Now we all have Odeo on our phones.

126
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,539
Called Twitter.

127
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:58,368
-Have you heard of Bourbon?
-The cream biscuit?

128
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:00,605
It was a check-in app,

129
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,493
which pivoted to a photo-sharing app.

130
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,641
That's the first thing
we check every morning we get up.

131
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:08,348
Instagram.

132
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,969
Everyone pivots.

133
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,034
Milkbikis.

134
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,371
Did they pivot too?

135
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,146
No. It's still a biscuit.

136
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:18,454
Guys.

137
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,815
Look, I think you want to
believe that I am naive,

138
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,761
but I am not.

139
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:29,773
I know what you guys are doing.

140
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:33,254
After the series-A was cancelled,
you guys reached a dead end.

141
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:36,848
You are trying to correct your course,
and I understand.

142
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,866
But if you're going to use my fuel,

143
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,156
to find yourself a different route,

144
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:43,974
get a driver first.

145
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:47,827
You guys want to pivot,

146
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:49,818
get a CTO first.

147
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:51,542
Yes.

148
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:55,409
Yes, I mean... yes.

149
00:07:56,622 --> 00:08:01,277
Prachi, we don't have a tech head,
but we have a tech team.

150
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,340
-We will manage.
-You don't have to manage.

151
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,183
Every team needs a captain.

152
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,371
Name one company that pivoted
without a tech head.

153
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:15,431
Yes.

154
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:18,368
Yes...

155
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,893
I'm meeting with the
partners in three days.

156
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,338
Get yourself a CTO,

157
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:27,287
I will convince them
that we need to pivot.

158
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,050
Three days?

159
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:32,343
How will we find a
CTO in three days, Prachi?

160
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:34,904
Rohan, please tell them
how much runway they have?

161
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,176
About 90 days.

162
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,927
It's not three days,
it's 3.33 % of your entire battery life.

163
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,156
It is what it is guys.

164
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:53,129
I want to help you,
but you have to help yourself first.

165
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,489
Next meeting.

166
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,975
Shall we?

167
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,239
Thank you.

168
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:02,890
All the best, guys.

169
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:06,603
Okay.

170
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,288
Do you want to come for a smoke?

171
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,748
No.

172
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:20,951
Since when did you
start smoking so much.

173
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,155
I wasn't even a smoker.

174
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,454
Jeetu was.

175
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,704
He needed company.

176
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:30,432
He's gone, and now I am addicted.

177
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:32,925
It's been six months.

178
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,261
I think you should drop old habits,
and get yourself some new ones.

179
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,072
Hiring someone for a post like this,

180
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,837
is nothing short of a wedding.

181
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,017
Like we have to find a bride,

182
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,524
check if she suits you,
then arrange a meeting.

183
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:50,758
Then she has to like you.
Convince her to marry you.

184
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,875
And we've no clue who she is or where.

185
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:58,273
Hey... he sent a mail invite.

186
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:01,421
Meeting Pragati co-founders
with CTO in three days.

187
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:05,329
-Are you serious?
-Issue number 13.

188
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,974
Finding the CTO in three days.

189
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,153
Where was your list of issues when we
were discussing this the past two days?

190
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,042
I was posting it on the group, but
you guys weren't taking it seriously.

191
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,291
What else can we do, Mandal?
Shut down the company?

192
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:17,777
Did I say that?

193
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:19,440
I never said that. What is he saying?

194
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,753
Listen bro, either we go down,

195
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,440
or we change the company's direction.

196
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,319
It's very simple.

197
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,574
If you know a third way,
then speak now. We can try that.

198
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:29,413
-Oh, man...
-Let's do it, bro.

199
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:32,469
Change is the only constant.
Let's do it, okay.

200
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:35,181
Let's tell HR to put up
a post for walk-in interviews.

201
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,174
You keep making a list of issues,
and we'll execute Pragati 2.0.

202
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:39,388
Come on.

203
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:40,866
Let's not talk. Let's do it.

204
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,295
-Give me the bag.
-Here.

205
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,263
That's not what I said.

206
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,791
-You are always coming up with issues.
-What do you mean? What?

207
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,215
-Hello.
-'Appu, I've mailed you the job offer.'

208
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,204
Yeah, I got your mail.

209
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,450
Yes.

210
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:02,818
Just give me a second.

211
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:07,036
Yup!

212
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,801
Yes, please tell me.

213
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:14,098
'Appu, you know your situation
better than me.'

214
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,071
'Leave that sinking ship called Pragati,
and come join me.'

215
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,750
Can't say if it's
a sinking ship, but...

216
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,357
I feel very valued here.

217
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:27,256
You know, like I am a part
of every decision in the product.

218
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,633
'And here you'll make the product.
Lead programmer.'

219
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,952
-'Your salary--'
-Salary is not the issue, sir.

220
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,560
After all, it's CISCO, yeah.

221
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:39,155
-Appu, come on. Everyone's waiting.
-Yeah, one minute.

222
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:42,637
Yeah, sir. I will get back to you. Yeah.

223
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:57,672
So this is what Pragati 2.0
is going to look like, after the pivot.

224
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,376
I still have to finalise
a few more details.

225
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,232
I will prepare a product
road map in a couple of days,

226
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,982
and share it with everyone. Okay.

227
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:06,523
But, sir, this needs major changes.

228
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,493
You can't succeed
without changes, Sukhi.

229
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:11,183
-We'll do it.
-I mean cost,

230
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,990
execution...

231
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,559
It's going to be a tough job.

232
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,312
Say something, guys.

233
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:18,051
It does look tricky.

234
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:19,715
Well, cost was already on my list.

235
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,889
Number fourteen, execution.

236
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,326
Mandal.

237
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,087
I am still trying to compile this.

238
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,435
But we are taking a huge left turn.

239
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,217
It's a major change.

240
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:32,867
Don't be afraid of the change, Appu.

241
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:34,209
It's the only constant.

242
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,155
But, Yogi... we

243
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:40,698
We first locked a product vision,
and worked on it for a year.

244
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:42,556
Finally, it's stabilised now.

245
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:47,274
Why are we moving our goalpost,
just because Alpha1 has made a move?

246
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:49,295
No, we're not doing
anything because of Alpha1.

247
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:51,763
First of all, get this straight.

248
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,880
Our end goal hasn't changed.

249
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,412
Appu. We are only changing our route.

250
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,325
Guys, a pivot is not a failure.

251
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:00,841
It's a process.

252
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:04,793
Paypal pivoted five times in a year.

253
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:08,228
Before they landed on
their best and final version.

254
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:12,092
You guys know every
startup changes its product.

255
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,759
Drop all attachments
with the older version.

256
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,179
Let's burn the boat.

257
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,266
Let's jump out of a
parachute and build a plane.

258
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:19,353
What? What?

259
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,976
Let's jump out of a
plane and build a parachute.

260
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,160
Right.

261
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,236
In case the parachute doesn't open,
then what?

262
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,149
-It will open if we pull properly.
-Yes.

263
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:29,076
Naveen, Yogi,

264
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:32,206
product pivot is always interesting.

265
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:33,435
But challenging.

266
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,123
I mean we'll need a team for it,

267
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:37,982
also means extra workload.

268
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:41,221
Framework, architecture,
we'll have to redesign everything.

269
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,775
So, I am not sure how we can...

270
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:44,952
Number fifteen,

271
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,985
convince the team to pivot.

272
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,204
This will shock the entire backhand.

273
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:55,116
Web services, Deb ops...

274
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:56,450
Not to count the load on them.

275
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,062
The workload was always there.

276
00:14:58,725 --> 00:14:59,711
But we did it, didn't we?

277
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,062
Back then we had...

278
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:08,116
I mean back then we had a CTO.

279
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:13,389
Naveen, I think we should
discuss this at length.

280
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:16,018
Aparajita,
I think that we'll discuss this.

281
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:18,339
We'll discuss it and let you know.

282
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,635
If you guys have any feedback to share.

283
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:21,980
I mean if you want to think about it,

284
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,277
then you should think
about how we fix this.

285
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,950
How do we make this happen?

286
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,306
You should give your
input in this direction.

287
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:29,853
Stop counting problems.

288
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,026
Yeah, got it?

289
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,516
-Yes.
-Makes sense.

290
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:36,200
Yes, sir.

291
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:53,779
Here we imagined we'll
be looking at half of Mumbai,

292
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,372
and here we're stuck
looking at uncle's underwear.

293
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,627
And he hasn't even
changed them for a year.

294
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,186
Cheetah print.

295
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,413
Shit.

296
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,857
Hey...

297
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,879
Naveen, I saw your plan.

298
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,803
We can do it.

299
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,455
We'll discuss the remaining
technical details with your tech head.

300
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,424
How can we do this
in three days, Prachi?

301
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,262
You know who we are trying to replace.

302
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:30,588
He wasn't just our CTO.

303
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,370
We have to do it, Naveen.

304
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,533
You'll have to put this behind you.

305
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,251
Look, sometimes what you need to do,

306
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:40,149
is more important
than what you want to do.

307
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,178
Have I told you,

308
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:45,939
how I found out about
Pragati in the first place?

309
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:50,697
From my brother.

310
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,653
He's been a user
of your app since day 1.

311
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,273
And you know, just like him,

312
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:00,295
Pragati has had many users,

313
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:02,534
and will have many users in the future.

314
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,447
So you have to remember that.

315
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,501
Whatever you do,

316
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,458
whatever you have done
and whatever you will do in future,

317
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:12,338
is not for yourself.

318
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:14,545
It's for others.

319
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,262
Whatever you are building,

320
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,527
has to be bigger than you,
me, or any of us.

321
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:27,070
But the builder is gone.

322
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,157
I don't know...

323
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,596
Sometimes I feel,

324
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,292
can I even handle this without him?

325
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:40,118
There are no permanent enemies
or permanent friends here.

326
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,303
And... especially not CTOs.

327
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:44,890
They are like startup butterflies.

328
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,227
Today here, tomorrow there.

329
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,596
They keep fluttering.

330
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,726
Today they are with one co-founder,
tomorrow they are with another.

331
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,640
But in the end,
the one who keeps standing will be you.

332
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,183
Because you started this alone.

333
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:01,088
And you will finish this.

334
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,997
Right?

335
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,280
Naveen, this is your journey.

336
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:15,160
No matter what happens,
you have to keep moving forward.

337
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,725
Finding a CTO in three
days is difficult, I get it.

338
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,418
Make it easy for yourself.

339
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:24,918
Just look for someone who is
willing to help you out at this point.

340
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,186
That's it.

341
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:30,461
Yeah, I think you are right.

342
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,032
Okay, all the best.

343
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,962
I... I want you to know that
I have faith in you.

344
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:38,364
I'll see you soon. Take care.

345
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:41,171
Thanks.

346
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,366
Thank you.

347
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,076
Ohh...

348
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,304
sorry, I didn't know.

349
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,489
No, no, Appu, please carry on.

350
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,017
Any update from HR?

351
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,321
How many CVs so far?

352
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:24,484
How much.

353
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:26,854
Not even one.

354
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:35,777
Message from Prachi.

355
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:37,538
What is she saying?

356
00:22:38,393 --> 00:22:40,223
"Let's meet day after at lunch."

357
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,788
Fuck.

358
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:43,852
What do we do, Yogi?

359
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,745
The day is about to end.

360
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:49,799
Fuck walk-in,

361
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:51,984
we'll have to do walk-out interviews.

362
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:56,008
I'll scan from Hiranandini to Kurla.

363
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:57,856
We'll find some struggler coders.

364
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,201
And prepare a task sheet,

365
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,788
and ask everyone to write their problems
regarding pivot.

366
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:13,625
Sir... are we auditioning
for Roadies here?

367
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:16,248
-What? -Several people
are waiting in line outside.

368
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:26,923
What?

369
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:28,673
Don't you accept online payments?

370
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:29,618
No, sir.

371
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,444
Embrace technology.
It's necessary.

372
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:32,447
Thanks sir.

373
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,618
Is the OLA startup office here?

374
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,974
Yes, this is the one.

375
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,775
-Are you a coder?
-No. I am a salesman.

376
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:47,077
Joining in three days.

377
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,091
Even the notice period is three months.

378
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:50,156
No possible.

379
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,322
Your portfolio is quite impressive.

380
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:00,403
He's saying thank you.

381
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:03,284
Why isn't he saying it himself?

382
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,567
These genius coders are very introvert.

383
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:08,441
They don't speak for themselves,
their work does.

384
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,401
He's saying if you want to hire him,
you got to hire me as well.

385
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,346
I had a word with them.

386
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:21,869
I can join in a month.

387
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:29,141
Brother Yogi, doesn't matter
how many glasses you buy,

388
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,380
I cannot do it.

389
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,532
I can't do it.

390
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:33,173
I am married to my job.

391
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,706
I am not telling you to divorce her.

392
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:37,796
Just have an extra-marital on the side.

393
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:39,611
-No, no.
-Till the delivery of my baby.

394
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:40,970
-No, no.
-Bro...

395
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,415
No.

396
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:43,763
Kishore sir.

397
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:47,449
It's a surprise to
see a senior guy like you,

398
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:49,237
in a start-up circle.

399
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,584
Because everyone is a college dropout.

400
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:55,932
That is why I hate the startup culture.

401
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,541
Every startup wants to
move fast and break things.

402
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,845
But I am here to move
slow and build things.

403
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,338
This startup culture
needs to shut down, sir.

404
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:08,461
Shut down!

405
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:11,406
Coder.

406
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:13,226
-Excuse me, are you a coder?
-No.

407
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:14,833
-Bro... are you on the tech team?
-No.

408
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,127
Okay, let's seal the deal in 15 days.

409
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,246
Let me know if it's a yes.

410
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,442
Bro, watch my speed.

411
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:20,776
-Coder?
-Yeah.

412
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:21,888
Are you a lead coder?

413
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,356
-Excuse me, are you interested in.
-I said I don't want a credit card.

414
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:25,994
Yes.

415
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:27,761
We'll call you.

416
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:32,326
What is this?

417
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:35,812
CTO?

418
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,344
How much equity will I get?

419
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:38,529
What's your experience?

420
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:39,681
I don't code.

421
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,561
But I can get a coder for you.

422
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:44,235
What the fuck am I doing?

423
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:47,768
HR will let you know our decision ASAP.

424
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:50,442
See... just because she's your HR,

425
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:53,779
you are addressing her by her post.

426
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:56,757
But guess what, she is human first.

427
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,539
Human resources.

428
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:59,822
And she has a name.

429
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:01,539
Ma'am, what's your name?

430
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:02,539
Hina Rizwan.

431
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,300
But everyone calls me HR.

432
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,336
How is my second favourite
coder from college?

433
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:09,107
I quit coding after my MBA.

434
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:10,542
Now I am working at Indusverse.

435
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:11,966
Marketing manager.

436
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,825
If I have another beer,

437
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,815
I'll head straight to the office
with my resignation,

438
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:24,532
and throw it in my boss' face.

439
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:26,016
Have it.

440
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:28,847
Thank you.

441
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:35,423
What do you mean you
got sober on the way?

442
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:36,878
I bought an entire pitcher for you.

443
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:40,521
You should have fucking peed
after giving your resignation!

444
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,194
You can't even control 200 ml of pee,
bloody nincompoop.

445
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,759
I can join from tomorrow.

446
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,607
In fact, I've seen your app.

447
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,585
And I already have a few ideas.

448
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:52,837
Like we can use a few APIs
to make the transition smooth and...

449
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,658
That's KPI.

450
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:56,489
Sorry.

451
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:59,435
No, API.

452
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:03,213
You guys are interviewing for tech head,

453
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:06,213
and you don't know what is API?

454
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:17,210
Application programming interface.

455
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,666
Sixteen.

456
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:23,965
We need a tech person
to hire a tech person.

457
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,281
If you can't give a solution,
then stop counting the problems.

458
00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:49,714
Please, please, Appu.

459
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,666
If knowing the definition of API
was in my KPI,

460
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,181
I would have never asked you.

461
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,656
But hiring a CTO isn't in my KPI either.

462
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,168
What if we hire some amateur?

463
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:00,671
The management will blame me.

464
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:02,348
Yes, I understand that.

465
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,380
Do you know what
'M' in 'CMO' stands for?

466
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:10,885
-Marketing.
-And Management.

467
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:13,411
Mr. Saurav Mandal,

468
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:16,084
I am also the chief management officer.

469
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:18,201
And the management...
See...

470
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:21,213
Is personally asking you
because it trusts your judgement.

471
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,993
See, Appu, after all,

472
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,328
you are the senior most
tech person we have here.

473
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:30,528
Okay, look.

474
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:34,596
Even I have some doubts regarding
this pivot like the rest of you.

475
00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:36,783
But we'll discuss that.

476
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:39,462
But even for that, we need a tech head.

477
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:40,505
Come on.

478
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:50,400
Okay.

479
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,361
Yes.

480
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:54,945
But there are other ways to test coders,
than just asking questions.

481
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:56,129
Okay, yes.

482
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,561
I'll my boss just
the way my boss hired me.

483
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,969
Yeah... done.

484
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,538
Hi.

485
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,429
I am here for the interview.

486
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:16,124
The HR sent me.

487
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:17,923
Yeah, hi. Please, come in.

488
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:18,989
Come, come.

489
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,316
Shall I reduce the temperature?

490
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:30,350
No, thanks. I am fine.

491
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,055
Just a bit tired.

492
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:33,340
The staircase.

493
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:34,407
Yes.

494
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:35,793
You know, Naveen,

495
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:39,324
the perfect AC temperature
is supposed to be 24 degrees Celsius.

496
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:42,660
Aah... I didn't know that.

497
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,438
Well, nobody did.

498
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,508
So, I wrote an algorithm to prove it,

499
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,054
and put it on social media.

500
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:51,943
People needed time to accept it,

501
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,434
but now whenever you switch on
the air-conditioning,

502
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:57,702
the default temperature is
24 degree Celsius.

503
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,617
Wow, that's quite impressive.

504
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,348
As I said, nobody believed it initially,

505
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:05,980
but now they do.

506
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:18,040
So... you wanna talk a little
bit more about my past experiences.

507
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:21,766
Yeah, sure.

508
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:24,405
Seems like you're interviewing me,
not the other way.

509
00:30:25,768 --> 00:30:27,945
You know, Naveen, how I look at it is,

510
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,432
it's important for a company
to choose the right candidate,

511
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:34,839
and equally important for a candidate
to choose the right company.

512
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:37,275
Yeah, correct.

513
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,226
Yes.

514
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:45,115
Mayank, your CV has pretty big names.

515
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,793
SwiftPay and IndoGames.

516
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:48,966
And we are just a growing company.

517
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,456
So...

518
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:51,993
I mean are you sure?

519
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,245
You're right.
I mean when I joined these startups,

520
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:56,631
they were small too.

521
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,873
It's my job to make them big.

522
00:31:00,907 --> 00:31:01,785
Okay.

523
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:03,276
That's cool.

524
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,466
One second. Sorry.

525
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:25,852
Sorry.

526
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,781
So, Mayank, how did you
know about this opening?

527
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:32,756
Was that Prachi?

528
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:35,955
Yeah.

529
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:38,859
Why didn't you tell me?

530
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:45,059
Because I didn't want any bias
to come in between, Naveen.

531
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
I don't want you to hire me
because your investor referred me.

532
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,767
I want you to hire me because,

533
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:53,940
you should feel I am
the right guy for the job.

534
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:56,829
So?

535
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:58,793
What do you feel?

536
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,149
I don't know.
I mean your CV is quite strong.

537
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,239
CV...

538
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,328
The thing about CVs is it's just a page.

539
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,064
You're looking at the entire book,

540
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:12,485
in flesh and blood.

541
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:15,173
Talking about the book,
let me narrate a chapter for you.

542
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,878
You know, when I was with SwiftPay,

543
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:20,594
the CEO Aman...

544
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,200
Great guy, lovely guy.

545
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,947
Great to work with, but...

546
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,674
his only problem was
he was a little myopic.

547
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:30,712
You know,
a little short sighted with working.

548
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:35,323
I mean when you have a guy
who can build a road to Mars,

549
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,284
why would you want to plan a trip
to the moon?

550
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:38,875
Isn't it?

551
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:44,789
Anyway, I prepared a version
according to his product brief,

552
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,964
but I also prepared my own version.

553
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:49,725
And even got more traction on it.

554
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,469
No points for guessing, which version
is currently getting widely used.

555
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:00,960
Naveen, I feel there are only two
kinds of people in this world.

556
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,949
The one who takes shit.

557
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,738
and the others who shit done.

558
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:09,538
I get shit done.

559
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,720
So, I've no doubts

560
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,906
that this pivot can help Pragati,
become a rocketship if you're lucky.

561
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:21,555
But if you have me,

562
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,009
you don't need luck.

563
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:29,215
Think about it

564
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:31,235
and let me know.

565
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:34,521
Or let Prachi know

566
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:36,573
right?

567
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:41,948
Thank you.

568
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:43,729
Pleasure.

569
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:11,269
What...

570
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:16,086
When did he do that?

571
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,729
We'll do it, right?

572
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:21,809
Listen, Mandal.

573
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:25,952
Pawan Putra's mom and dad
are coming to the office tomorrow.

574
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:27,157
To meet the CEO.

575
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:29,016
Pappi.

576
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,331
What happened?

577
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:32,472
Sir...

578
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,929
-I...
-What?

579
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:40,038
I drunk-dialled my dad.

580
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:46,245
You drunk-dialled your own dad?

581
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,484
Everyone was saying
the future of the company is uncertain.

582
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,025
I got a little nervous and...

583
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,896
Sir, please help me out.
I don't want to leave.

584
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,348
Yogi isn't in the office.

585
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:03,565
Naveen is busy.

586
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:05,544
You handle their parents.

587
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:06,587
Thank you, sir.

588
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:07,794
What?

589
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:09,283
Me?

590
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:12,250
Even me and my father are...

591
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,489
No, no.

592
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,326
And, didn't he want to meet the CEO?

593
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,554
But you're the Chief Management Officer.

594
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:23,597
I mean... this is a management issue.

595
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,195
Like managing Pappi's father.

596
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:28,587
And he's coming to Mumbai
with a form for the Bank PO.

597
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:32,206
Please convince him.
I know you can convince him, sir.

598
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,489
Please.

599
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:37,619
Why is my heartbeat racing?

600
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:39,100
Can I get you some water?

601
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:40,880
I think you can do it.

602
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,231
Please, sir.

603
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:44,057
Coming.

604
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,207
Who drunk dials his own father?

605
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:51,978
I've been looking since morning.

606
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,696
I think I found God, but not
one tech guy that suits the bill.

607
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:56,878
How are you handling it out there?

608
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,597
I am standing in front
of Vikroli's co-working space.

609
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:02,565
Yeah.

610
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,486
I'll let you know if I find anyone.

611
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:05,553
Okay.

612
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,511
So, HR, how is it going?

613
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:09,869
Good.

614
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:12,359
How is your health?
You taking care of your diet?

615
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:13,784
-Yeah-yeah, I am.
-Yaa.

616
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:17,477
One second.

617
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:35,859
Yeah.

618
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:39,326
I needed another approval.

619
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,413
Of course.

620
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:41,674
I'll sign it.

621
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,592
What the fuck? What is this?

622
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,964
It's a draft of a termination letter.

623
00:36:58,193 --> 00:36:59,486
Who told you to do this?

624
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:03,410
Naveen, everyone's contract
has a three-month notice period.

625
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,063
And the company only has funds
for three months.

626
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,432
Who... told you this?

627
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:14,772
See.

628
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:21,888
These are our expenses,
and that's our account balance.

629
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,615
After punching in the entire data,
this is the result.

630
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:28,408
Three months.

631
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:32,648
Even I don't want to believe it.

632
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:36,015
But these numbers were entered by you.

633
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,069
And since it's tally,

634
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,015
it can't be wrong.

635
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:00,977
Does anyone else know about this?

636
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,160
No.

637
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:04,103
And I'll keep it that way.

638
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,554
See, Naveen,
I am just looking out for Pragati.

639
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,794
Some of the earlier startups,
faced major issues with employees.

640
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,459
I'll send you some links.
See for yourself.

641
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:23,469
Sometimes founders even go to jail
for such dues.

642
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,866
It's statutory compliance.

643
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,358
See, it's just a failsafe.

644
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:42,858
We should prep.

645
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:46,337
I really hope we never have to use this.

646
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:57,176
I'll take your leave.

647
00:38:57,755 --> 00:38:59,040
You think about it.

648
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,864
Since I'm a Brahmin, I won't lie.

649
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:35,649
I thought since this is a startup,
you'd be working out of some garage.

650
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,538
But it...

651
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,462
looks like an office.

652
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:42,551
Yes.

653
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,116
Uncle, I am not a Brahmin,

654
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:49,236
yet I won't lie.

655
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:51,334
It's not that kind of start-up.

656
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,605
We don't know how many
'types' of startups exist.

657
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:57,529
Where we come from
the startup trend hasn't picked up.

658
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:58,380
I see.

659
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,108
What place is that?

660
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:01,130
'Ghatiya.'

661
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,056
Pappi, that's no way to talk.

662
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:06,511
Just because you live in a big city now,

663
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,174
doesn't mean you should
disrespect your hometown.

664
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:10,154
'Ghatiya' is the name of our town.

665
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:10,991
Yes.

666
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,540
Ohh...

667
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,222
We come from a family
of government employees.

668
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:15,916
Yes.

669
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:18,459
My father worked for 'BHEL',
and so do I.

670
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:20,898
His older brother wanted
to try something different,

671
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:22,053
so he joined CELL instead.

672
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:23,107
I said fine.

673
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:27,331
I got him in GAIL, but no.
He wanted to join a startup.

674
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,148
Here's my question,

675
00:42:29,238 --> 00:42:32,568
if he doesn't finish his internship
who will offer him a job?

676
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:33,967
No, uncle.

677
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:40,509
This company and Pappi's internship
is absolutely safe.

678
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:43,976
Well, we had an important project
on our hands,

679
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,039
which didn't go too well. That's it.

680
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:48,183
It must have made him
anxious and called you.

681
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,118
Ups and downs are
common in any job, uncle.

682
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,140
Look, son.

683
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:55,741
Only share markets see ups and downs,

684
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:59,243
and we choose FD.

685
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:00,213
Yes.

686
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:02,787
If he wanted to join a private company,

687
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:05,939
he could have opted for TCS, Infosys,

688
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:09,820
which are the bigger
players in the market.

689
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,509
Your friends are there too.

690
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,813
In a 9-5 job.

691
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:16,248
What? What did you say?

692
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:17,335
What did you say?

693
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:20,889
I said I didn't want
a 9-5 job like them.

694
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,307
And you would rather work 9-9 here?

695
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:25,707
Uncle... Uncle...

696
00:43:29,457 --> 00:43:31,012
Tell me one thing.

697
00:43:31,386 --> 00:43:33,897
What are your office timings?

698
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,930
What are your working hours?

699
00:43:38,028 --> 00:43:39,329
9 to...

700
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:41,451
9 to?

701
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:44,506
-Okay, fine.
-No, no...

702
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:47,647
-I get it. I get it. I get it.
-No, no.

703
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:51,579
See...

704
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:54,481
Nothing is certain in a startup.

705
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:59,133
Companies like this open
and shut down overnight.

706
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:01,913
Friends starting a company is one thing,

707
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:03,698
but keeping it afloat is different.

708
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:10,712
Rather than wasting
your education on a startup,

709
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,854
you should have opted for a job instead.

710
00:44:14,854 --> 00:44:17,321
Secured our future and yours as well.

711
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,997
Pappi, your father
is just like my father.

712
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:30,394
Says you're his son,

713
00:44:31,122 --> 00:44:33,085
but doesn't trust his decisions.

714
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:37,024
Uncle...

715
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,242
even I built this startup for friends.

716
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,426
But I know how to run my business.

717
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,649
Our entire family has been
running businesses for many years.

718
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,775
As a kid, I read more ledger books
than comic books.

719
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,460
Then I did my MBA... from IIM Indore.

720
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:56,178
Yes.

721
00:44:58,035 --> 00:45:00,338
Education never goes to waste.

722
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:06,416
And we don't work here
staring at the clock.

723
00:45:07,677 --> 00:45:10,242
Because what we do here
will change time.

724
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:12,253
Look, son.

725
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,938
You are the founder.

726
00:45:15,394 --> 00:45:16,116
Yes.

727
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,620
If you succeed,
it will be your success alone.

728
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:20,879
Because Pappi is just an intern.

729
00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:24,161
Who has benefitted from
working under so much pressure?

730
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:25,699
-Am I right?
-Right. Right.

731
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:32,487
How do you cook lentils?

732
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:36,019
Lentils?

733
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,584
How do you cook lentils?

734
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,544
In the pressure cooker.

735
00:45:41,624 --> 00:45:42,671
Everyone uses the pressure cooker,

736
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:45,174
but you can make it
with any other utensil.

737
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:50,152
Well...we can make it
in a different utensil,

738
00:45:50,242 --> 00:45:52,652
-but it will be time-consuming.
-Yes.

739
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:54,326
Cooks faster in a pressure cooker.

740
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,457
Yeah...

741
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,525
you are absolutely right.

742
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,666
Pressure.

743
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:02,511
Pappi may be working
under pressure here,

744
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:06,171
but he'll be hardboiled pretty soon.

745
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:08,384
I can understand.

746
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,329
Yes.

747
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:12,539
But I know Pappi better than you.

748
00:46:13,724 --> 00:46:16,843
Pappi isn't ready
for such a daunting task.

749
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:19,256
Papa, you say I am your son,

750
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,539
but you don't trust him.

751
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:22,694
Shut up.

752
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:24,792
You talk about trust.

753
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:26,303
We've been to your flat.

754
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:27,933
There were no rations.

755
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:31,792
Just a satchel of green
leaves and a lighter.

756
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:35,346
I knew his room wouldn't be clean.

757
00:46:35,436 --> 00:46:40,101
This is why his brother
booked an OYO room for us.

758
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,556
How is your room?

759
00:46:45,023 --> 00:46:48,240
Excellent. Nice. Spic and span.

760
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,697
-They gave us a toothbrush and a comb.
-Yes.

761
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:52,142
Clean towels.

762
00:46:52,232 --> 00:46:53,418
See aunty,

763
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:57,288
the startup trend reached
all the way to your house,

764
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:58,940
and you haven't realised it yet.

765
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:04,125
This place where you're staying,
was a startup like ours.

766
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:08,473
And the founder was younger than Pappi
when he started.

767
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:14,276
The company's initial job was online
listing of budget hotels in their area,

768
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,015
and it was called Oraville Stays.

769
00:47:16,535 --> 00:47:19,558
Later he realised the problem
isn't about accommodation,

770
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:21,201
it was about a standard service.

771
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:22,640
Then he...

772
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,436
Pivoted...

773
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,221
I mean changed his business idea.

774
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,504
And within one year of the pivot,

775
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:44,265
Oraville Stays became OYO.

776
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:46,689
On Your Own.

777
00:47:49,015 --> 00:47:50,439
Just like we are right now.

778
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:52,102
'On our Own.'

779
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,121
Why are you telling us all this?

780
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:12,766
I am not.

781
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:41,396
Bastard... is disagreeing your passion?

782
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:45,707
What? You're on the same page now?

783
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,603
You are changing the approach
of the entire company,

784
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:52,416
I can change my own.

785
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:55,068
#Parivartan (change).

786
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,489
What happened?
Couldn't find anyone?

787
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:03,315
Not even one. In this short notice.

788
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:04,628
Most of them are assholes.

789
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:07,966
And the decent ones are getting paid
double than Silicon Valley in Bangalore.

790
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:09,817
So who will work for us?

791
00:49:10,608 --> 00:49:11,797
I think we are fucked.

792
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:14,838
Not yet.

793
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,115
There is a guy. Mayank Arora.

794
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:22,571
He's got experience,
and his CV looks good.

795
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:25,962
I am meeting him again today,
you guys should too.

796
00:49:26,866 --> 00:49:28,953
Have you met him?
Do you think he fits the bill?

797
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:31,182
-Yes, I think he's okay.
-Great.

798
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:34,094
Tell Prachi we completed
the task before time.

799
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:36,057
Prachi sent him.

800
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:37,454
We should thank her.

801
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:38,951
-Okay...
-Wait a second.

802
00:49:39,152 --> 00:49:41,356
-Prachi sent him?
-Yes, why?

803
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:44,437
Is he an investor hound?

804
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:46,725
What is that?

805
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,585
Fuck hostel four...

806
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:54,116
How are you dickhead?

807
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,070
At least stop ragging me now, Yogi.

808
00:49:56,682 --> 00:49:59,767
How is my second favourite
coder from college?

809
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:01,628
I quit coding after my MBA.

810
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,167
Now I am working at Indusverse.

811
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:04,580
Marketing manager.

812
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:06,425
What are you saying?
What about your startup?

813
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:07,597
Didn't you see?

814
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:09,654
We were trending on Twitter last year.

815
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:11,894
#boycottfoodinthehood

816
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:14,654
Are you serious?
But your product was great.

817
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:17,128
You were getting affordable
food to half the slums in Mumbai.

818
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:20,531
Bro, nowadays people judge you
by your popularity, not your actions.

819
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:23,259
Some asshole put up a post.

820
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:25,841
The word 'hood' is
insulting to our users.

821
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:27,515
Thus began the trolling.

822
00:50:28,018 --> 00:50:29,585
And do you know what the funny part is?

823
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:32,393
Most of our users don't
even know what hood means.

824
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,145
But until then we got
so much negative PR...

825
00:50:36,235 --> 00:50:37,347
You had to shut down?

826
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:39,306
No, we had to change our name.

827
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:40,469
RobinFood.

828
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,414
Our new CMO's idea.

829
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:45,620
Investors sent him to change
the visual of the company.

830
00:50:46,118 --> 00:50:49,729
But that asshole eventually
changed the entire vision.

831
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:53,112
-So, you had to shut down the company.
-No.

832
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:56,407
We don't get any orders
from Dharavi now, just Pali Hill.

833
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:59,364
I did not want to
be a part of that, so...

834
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,345
So did you shut down
the company, or what?

835
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,401
No. I quit.

836
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:09,638
But why didn't all the founders say no?
Why didn't you resist?

837
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:11,467
We were desperate.

838
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:14,129
And we didn't know the CMO will do this.

839
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:16,226
It's typical, brother Yogi.

840
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:19,343
When the company's screwed,
investors send their own guys.

841
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,840
Most of them are innocent and harmless.

842
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:22,883
Like puppies.

843
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,205
But some of them are hounds.
Investor's hound.

844
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,019
What the fuck is a hound?

845
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,838
They hunt vulnerable startups.

846
00:51:31,612 --> 00:51:33,411
They come with a simple goal.

847
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:37,515
To make the startup successful,
and give the investors an early exit.

848
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,258
But that success comes at a cost.

849
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:43,800
Founders exit before the investors.

850
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:49,565
Meaning if Mayank Arora comes on board,
we could be out.

851
00:51:56,427 --> 00:51:59,020
Honestly, even I thought
he was a control freak.

852
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:01,810
But we're out of options, Yogi.

853
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,742
That doesn't mean we'll hire a hound.

854
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:05,372
And you said he seemed
like a control freak.

855
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:07,881
-But we got to hire someone.
-Guys, I found someone.

856
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:11,421
The hackathon we arranged,
one guy killed it.

857
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,673
Perfect programming logic,
lovely code layout,

858
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,512
and exceptional handling
was exceptionally handled.

859
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:17,732
The best part was
he had his own algorithm.

860
00:52:17,822 --> 00:52:19,068
Not copied from stack overflow.

861
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:21,085
Please explain in Hindi, English
or Bhojpuri. We don't speak Java.

862
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:22,599
It's been ages since I last saw a code.

863
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,575
Like... 30 years.

864
00:52:24,665 --> 00:52:26,326
-Is he really good?
-He is amazing.

865
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,529
See it for yourself.

866
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:29,177
Let's go take a look.

867
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,790
Great.

868
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:35,776
What?

869
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:37,927
I don't know, dickhead. I am Ops.

870
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:39,481
I flunked C.

871
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:41,343
Are all the test cases clear?

872
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:43,293
Yes. Even the corner cases.

873
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,290
I always thought codes
look like The Matrix.

874
00:52:49,668 --> 00:52:51,440
But this is just numbers and letters.

875
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,888
It's been around by
the numbers and letters.

876
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:54,724
I know. I know.

877
00:52:54,814 --> 00:52:57,446
But with one wrong semi-colon,
it will give an error.

878
00:52:57,703 --> 00:52:58,864
But that's how we were hired.

879
00:52:58,954 --> 00:53:02,021
Jeetu sir put five bugs in a code
like this, and asked us to find it.

880
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:04,161
I had done the best. Four bugs.

881
00:53:04,636 --> 00:53:06,132
-Fine.
-Great, Appu.

882
00:53:06,731 --> 00:53:07,655
Appu...

883
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:10,185
Sir... his bug test is over.

884
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:13,441
How many? Did he match Appu's record?

885
00:53:14,029 --> 00:53:15,965
-Did he find the fifth bug?
-No.

886
00:53:16,055 --> 00:53:18,188
-Then how many did he find?
-Six bugs?

887
00:53:18,803 --> 00:53:19,754
-What?
-Yeah.

888
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:22,225
There was already a
bug in Jeetu sir's code,

889
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:23,694
which even he missed I guess.

890
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,695
-He found it?
-And fixed it.

891
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:29,345
-Seems like some stud, man.
-Yeah.

892
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:31,042
-Where is he?
-Conference room.

893
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,421
Come.

894
00:53:32,902 --> 00:53:34,040
He fixed all the bugs.

895
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:48,833
Chintu.

896
00:53:57,092 --> 00:53:59,380
-Dungeon Master.
-Good evening, Naveen sir.

897
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,734
Good evening, Yogender sir.

898
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,119
Good evening, Saurabh sir.

899
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:03,237
And with all due respect,

900
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:06,563
there's an underscore
between dungeon and master.

901
00:54:11,638 --> 00:54:12,690
Bloody--

902
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,068
Let's at least talk, Yogi.

903
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:22,513
Why do you become so rigid?

904
00:54:22,603 --> 00:54:23,546
What else should we do?

905
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:26,124
-You want to hire Dungeon.
-But we'll have to hire someone.

906
00:54:26,214 --> 00:54:27,477
Do you have another option?

907
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,201
Why are we considering him?

908
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:32,275
Okay, fine.
Let's relax and think about it.

909
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:33,701
Okay?

910
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:36,515
I know you have a problem with Dungeon,

911
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:37,747
but that can be solved.

912
00:54:37,837 --> 00:54:39,250
Did you see how he was bullshitting us?

913
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,088
I've come back because I've
nothing but respect for you guys.

914
00:54:42,736 --> 00:54:45,176
I could have taken up a job
in Silicon Valley, but...

915
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:50,019
I think you guys are the only
ones who deserve to be my bosses.

916
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:52,059
What bullshitting?

917
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,246
He was being so respectful.

918
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,187
He never even showed
respect to his father.

919
00:54:56,277 --> 00:54:57,644
And I am his distant uncle.

920
00:54:57,734 --> 00:55:00,746
Please think practically
and not emotionally.

921
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:02,712
We have to go meet Prachi.

922
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:04,771
I know you have problems with DM, but--

923
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:07,821
Great. You're giving him
nicknames already.

924
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,982
You guys might have forgotten,
but I didn't.

925
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:12,004
He was only 17 when that
dickhead personally attacked me.

926
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:15,006
I was 17.
I was just a college kid back then.

927
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:16,818
Now I am a college pass-out.

928
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:18,995
People change after college.

929
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:23,072
You keep saying change
is the only constant.

930
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:25,544
But this rule doesn't apply to morons.
Look at yourself.

931
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:28,896
Why are you getting mad at me?

932
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:30,983
I only get mad at people who are close.

933
00:55:31,073 --> 00:55:32,186
Naveen, tell him.

934
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:34,868
Don't drag me into
your toxic relationship.

935
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,450
We are not in a toxic relationship.

936
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,054
We are in a complicated relationship.

937
00:55:39,144 --> 00:55:40,455
We are fucking not in any relationship.

938
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,309
Why are you cussing now?

939
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:45,260
Okay, fine. Sorry. Sorry.

940
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:48,006
Guys, Prachi is arriving in two hours.

941
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:50,262
We got to decide now.

942
00:55:50,352 --> 00:55:51,826
The decision is simple.

943
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:54,256
How can we hire Dungeon
after what he did?

944
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:56,981
I only did it because,

945
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:59,315
I knew the potential
of the product even back then.

946
00:56:00,606 --> 00:56:02,529
I just want to be a part of it.

947
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:20,159
We cannot meet Prachi without a CTO,

948
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:25,741
and we're out of options
except for Dungeon.

949
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,548
Mayank Arora?

950
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:34,263
I don't want you to hire me,
because your investor referred me.

951
00:56:34,543 --> 00:56:36,399
I want you to hire me because,

952
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:38,794
you should feel I am
the right guy for the job.

953
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:40,042
Seriously?

954
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,054
You were against him.

955
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,894
My opinion has changed.
I think we can take him.

956
00:56:45,246 --> 00:56:46,768
Even my opinion has changed now.

957
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:48,985
I think Dungeon is better.

958
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:52,582
Jeetu literally kicked him out,
and now you want to offer him his seat.

959
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:55,236
You know,
I never wanted to replace Jeetu.

960
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:56,229
This is business.

961
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,346
Sometimes what we need to do,

962
00:56:57,436 --> 00:56:59,051
is more important
than what we want to do.

963
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:00,591
Then let's replace
him with Mayank Arora.

964
00:57:00,681 --> 00:57:02,043
Why do we need this idiot?

965
00:57:02,133 --> 00:57:04,959
I mean when you have a guy,
who can build a road to Mars,

966
00:57:05,049 --> 00:57:06,873
why would you want
to plan a trip to the moon?

967
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:08,721
I told you he'll want to run the show.

968
00:57:08,811 --> 00:57:10,734
How can he?
He's alone, and we are three.

969
00:57:10,824 --> 00:57:14,189
You can control a hound,
but not a 20-year kid.

970
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:16,734
Not every guy the investors
send would be a hound.

971
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:18,299
I don't have a problem
with Mayank Arora.

972
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:20,136
Fine, even I don't
have a problem with him.

973
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:21,636
Is it a yes or no?

974
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:23,335
It's always been a yes for me.

975
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:26,085
-For who?
-Who?

976
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:27,118
That...

977
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:29,553
Mayank.

978
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:32,984
Till now you were rooting for DM.
Why don't you ever take a stand in life?

979
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,009
How did Mayank get in now?

980
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,425
I haven't even met that Mayank.

981
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:39,796
How can I believe he's a control freak.

982
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:41,137
Think about it

983
00:57:42,077 --> 00:57:43,208
and let me know.

984
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:46,377
Or let... Prachi know.

985
00:57:46,627 --> 00:57:47,779
But I've met him.

986
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:48,942
I've been saying this too.

987
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,399
Mayank is a better choice than DM.

988
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:53,047
He isn't better. They both
have their own distinct problems.

989
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,518
You know what, let's order something.

990
00:58:23,608 --> 00:58:24,922
There is no 'Dahipuri' here.

991
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:28,097
I ordered 'Sev puri'.
No one said 'dahipuri'.

992
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:29,771
I ordered 'Dahi puri'.

993
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:30,978
He did.

994
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:32,391
Tell him.

995
00:58:32,481 --> 00:58:34,118
-He said 'Dahi puri'.
-He said.

996
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:35,090
You only said 'sev puri'.

997
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,611
Why wouldn't I order 'Dahi puri'?

998
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:38,689
I don't have any
enmity with 'Dahi puri'.

999
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:41,340
-He said it. -You said 'Sev
puri' and I ordered 'Sev puri'.

1000
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,406
-Two guys are saying this.
-Yogi, both of us are saying this.

1001
00:58:44,496 --> 00:58:45,408
Eat it.

1002
00:58:45,832 --> 00:58:47,876
-This isn't fair.
-Two guys are saying this.

1003
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:49,963
Next time write down your orders.

1004
00:58:50,233 --> 00:58:50,983
Give.

1005
00:58:51,063 --> 00:58:53,038
-Wouldn't I have ordered 'Dahi puri'?
-Guys...

1006
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:55,028
-Don't eat it. Don't...
-What are you doing?

1007
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,090
Mayank is on the way.
He just texted me.

1008
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,886
He is asking when are we meeting Prachi.

1009
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:02,821
We didn't even appoint him yet,
he thinks he's the CTO.

1010
00:59:03,593 --> 00:59:05,343
Typical like a hound.

1011
00:59:06,104 --> 00:59:08,006
Dungeon is better than him.
He is almost family.

1012
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:10,107
But at least Prachi
is okay with this Mayank.

1013
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:14,031
If she says no to Dungeon.

1014
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,194
Then our pivot plan
will stay on the board.

1015
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:17,226
Wait a minute, guys.

1016
00:59:17,316 --> 00:59:19,457
It will be our decision
who will be the CTO.

1017
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,435
We just need someone so
that we can get her approval.

1018
00:59:23,023 --> 00:59:24,088
In that case,

1019
00:59:24,178 --> 00:59:27,080
we all know who is
the best man for this job.

1020
00:59:27,754 --> 00:59:29,178
I am the best man for this job.

1021
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:32,037
Naveen, I feel there are
two kinds of people in this world.

1022
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:35,453
Since the day I saw Pragati,
I've been an obsessed lover.

1023
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,529
One, who takes shit.

1024
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,682
And the others who get shit done.

1025
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:44,624
Give the tech in my hands,
and I will always take care of her.

1026
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:45,994
I get shit done.

1027
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:54,324
Why can't you see it, Yogi?

1028
00:59:54,781 --> 00:59:56,437
Dungeon loves the product.

1029
00:59:56,977 --> 00:59:58,487
And Mayank loves power.

1030
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:00,433
Fuck...

1031
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:02,107
I forgot this argument.

1032
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:04,795
Remember what Dungeon
said last time we met him.

1033
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,719
He wants 30% equity
and final veto on the product.

1034
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:09,773
So... who loves power now?

1035
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,039
Prachi is reaching in 20 minutes.

1036
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,648
Guys, let's make a decision.

1037
01:00:20,738 --> 01:00:22,268
No, seriously.

1038
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,390
If they are both morons,
then let's take the experienced moron.

1039
01:00:25,695 --> 01:00:27,879
But he's also experienced in fuckups.

1040
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,586
Juju.

1041
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:34,035
-Shut up...
-No.

1042
01:00:35,354 --> 01:00:36,749
Then you guys decide.

1043
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,206
You guys take a call.

1044
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,032
Naveen,

1045
01:00:40,499 --> 01:00:42,108
you haven't taken a call for six months,

1046
01:00:42,198 --> 01:00:43,951
because you were not ready to move on.

1047
01:00:44,282 --> 01:00:46,999
Don't pressure us with
the decision at this crunch time.

1048
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:50,190
He is right.

1049
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:52,560
But let's not talk about this now.

1050
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,213
-Leave it.
-I am sorry. I am sorry.

1051
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,255
Okay, let's decide democratically.
Let's vote.

1052
01:00:59,335 --> 01:01:01,425
Write down your choices on paper.

1053
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:04,165
And everyone will have
to accept the final verdict.

1054
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:08,031
And we'll never discuss
who voted for whom.

1055
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,552
-Okay.
-I don't want this conflict again.

1056
01:01:11,107 --> 01:01:12,509
Fine. Done.

1057
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:15,958
Let's take five minutes
and think about it.

1058
01:01:19,979 --> 01:01:22,816
Appu, please help us
finish what you started.
