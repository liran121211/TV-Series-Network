1
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:08,984
MOM! I don't want to get married!!!

2
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:12,234
I'm only 27. Not even old
enough to get married!

3
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:14,461
Don't "Shona beta" me!

4
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:17,187
Mummy... Mummy, don't lie to me, OK?

5
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,808
You don't have any Thyroid cancer!

6
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,879
OK wait... I'm getting another call.

7
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,311
Yeah... Wait! Wait!

8
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,276
Yeah Aarti?

9
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:31,021
Actually no. I'm still in a client meeting.

10
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,866
Where are you?

11
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:35,902
Oh, you've already reached?

12
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:38,717
Where?

13
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:40,615
OK. OK.

14
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:41,779
You've just reached, then?

15
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,052
No, no, no...

16
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:47,769
My client meeting... can be cancelled!

17
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:48,445
Yeah, I'm on my way!

18
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:51,035
Let's go.

19
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:54,512
We've to go around and
then come back here!

20
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:55,297
Come on!

21
00:00:58,805 --> 00:00:59,872
Come on already!

22
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:11,957
Hi!

23
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:15,474
Sorry, I got a little late.

24
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,506
Hope I didn't keep you
waiting for long!

25
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:18,870
No!

26
00:01:19,116 --> 00:01:20,227
Nice ambience!

27
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:21,569
Did you order anything?

28
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:22,839
Akhilesh, 2 cappuccinos!

29
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:24,616
No... I don't want to have anything!

30
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,029
No, no. Both are for me.

31
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,720
I'll drink one now, and the other
one later, once it gets cold.

32
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:31,173
These guys charge 100 bucks
extra for cold coffee!

33
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:34,760
By the way...

34
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:35,735
You look...

35
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:36,934
Quite different
from your pictures!

36
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,095
I know!

37
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,482
I'm not photogenic!

38
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:40,339
I mean...

39
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:41,999
I look good in real life!

40
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,863
But my pictures, don't
come out that great!

41
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:47,775
You've met guys before... like this?

42
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:48,307
Yes!

43
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:50,312
2-3 times

44
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:52,035
Me too!

45
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:53,162
6 times!!!

46
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:54,558
You know...

47
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,536
Since I've completed my P.G.
from IIM Indore?

48
00:01:57,608 --> 00:01:59,956
Mom's had girls lined up for me to meet!

49
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,862
I told her, "Mom...

50
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:03,632
...I can't marry right now!...

51
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:04,612
...I want to explore the world...

52
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:06,108
...Travel with friends...

53
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:06,493
...Scuba dive...

54
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:07,279
...Sky dive"

55
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,412
I'm telling you... You too should
stop with this marraige shabang!

56
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:12,861
Marriage doesn't even make sense

57
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:15,455
Youngsters like us should have fun!

58
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,361
It's a good thing actually, that my
mom forcefully made me a profie.

59
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,472
Or else, we wouldn't have been on this date!

60
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:20,352
Wait a minute!

61
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,233
Your mom... made your...

62
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,638
Tinder profile?

63
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,702
Tinder?

64
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:25,940
No, no. Shaadi.com

65
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:27,488
You're..

66
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:28,813
Hi.

67
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,048
Nikita?

68
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,637
Nikita.

69
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:33,501
Nikita?

70
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:34,189
Nikita.

71
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:35,883
Oh...

72
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:37,243
Oh shit... shit!

73
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,185
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

74
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,307
I got confused!

75
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,491
It's a good thing he showed up early!

76
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:45,371
We were about to get...

77
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,442
WE were about to get married!

78
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:49,939
Saurabh Mandal!

79
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,867
I'm a marketing head in Technity.

80
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,525
And what do you do?

81
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:54,891
Today's Thursday?

82
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,320
Yes.

83
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:57,851
On Thursdays I...

84
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:57,669
...do legs!

85
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:01,632
Gym!!!

86
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:03,743
Nice... Nice

87
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,825
Please have a seat! Enjoy!

88
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:05,515
Enjoy!

89
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:08,870
And have fun also.

90
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,751
Mr. Saurabh?

91
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,380
Aarti?

92
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,018
Actually, Aarti. I wanted to clear
something first, before we start.

93
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,335
Mr. Saurabh, I know what you want to say.

94
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,419
That you've had girlfriends
before this, isn't it?

95
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:35,724
I know.

96
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:36,709
No, not really. That's not it.

97
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:40,486
How did you know that I like cappuccino?

98
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:43,779
Aarti, look...

99
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:45,914
I didn't want to come
here in the first place

100
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,399
It's just that my mom wanted me to be here.

101
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,502
You know how parents pressurize you

102
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:53,962
Your...

103
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,375
Your moustache is just like Anil Kapoor's!

104
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,294
No look, Aarti...

105
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:02,941
Actually, I can't go ahead
with this marriage!

106
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,538
Mr. Saurabh, I understand your reluctance!

107
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,867
How much sugar?

108
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:09,168
One.

109
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,286
Just like me!

110
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:13,343
Look, if I were to
tell you the truth...

111
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,137
I too, had two boyfriends before this,

112
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,420
And I got intimate with them, as well!

113
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,890
But we didn't  do anything "dirty".

114
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,675
That I will do...

115
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:23,041
...only with my husband.

116
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,083
After all, I'm an Indian!

117
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,547
How can I forget my
roots and culture

118
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,430
Aarti. No doubt, you're
a very nice girl...

119
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,452
Panditji too, says the same

120
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:32,148
No, no. Now...

121
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:32,717
Now, I...

122
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,792
Mr. Saurabh, it's a yes for me.

123
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,216
Just...

124
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,684
Like the last guy...

125
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:38,434
Don't hide anything from me!

126
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,224
Why... What did the last one hide?

127
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:43,525
My marriage with him
had been confirmed.

128
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,605
But just a few days
before the engagement...

129
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:46,605
...dad got to
know that...

130
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,088
...he was quitting a stable
job to begin a start-up!

131
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,104
And the marriage got
canned, then and there.

132
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:54,699
That's when I saw your profile and...

133
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,476
So what, if he was going
to begin a start-up?

134
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,342
Why would any girl marry
a "start-up guy"?

135
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,129
Now... If the company doesn't do well...

136
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,327
Will I have to leave my household
chores and go do a job?

137
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,866
Tell me Mr. Saurabh?

138
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,332
Actually, Aarti...

139
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,093
This is exactly, what I
wanted to tell you about...

140
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:13,716
(TVF Pitchers Theme Song)

141
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:04,224
No laundry from tomorrow!

142
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,197
No maid from tomorrow!

143
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,327
No milk from tomorrow!

144
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,451
Even, no newspaper from tomorrow!

145
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,819
Gym membership will be cancelled!

146
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,861
Metros will be used instead of the car!

147
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,453
Electricity will be saved!

148
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,557
Internet speed will be
reduced from 8mbps to 1mbps!

149
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,049
No. No. No. No dude.

150
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,080
Atleast let the net speed stay!

151
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:24,660
Do you not want Jeetu, then?

152
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:27,472
If we don't save enough, how
will we ensure his salary?

153
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:35,028
Alright then. Let's reduce the
speed from 8mbps to 4mbps.

154
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,031
Table top-ups will be stopped!

155
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,911
Ordering food from
restaurants will be stopped!

156
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,609
Will be absolutely stopped!

157
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:45,728
Infact, all kinds of luxury expenditures
will be absolutely stopped!

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,892
What's the total?

159
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:46,187
Three thousand

160
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,624
Seven hundred

161
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:49,656
Twenty-five.

162
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,023
And adding my share to it...

163
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,741
Seven thousand

164
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:56,574
Four hundred

165
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:57,614
Fifty.

166
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:58,282
And how much is Jeetu's salary?

167
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:58,840
One lac

168
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,495
Thirty seven thousand

169
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:00,588
Five hundred.

170
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,622
Superb plan!

171
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,035
We'll save for a
year and a half...

172
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,186
...and shell out one month's salary!

173
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:07,868
"Alright!"

174
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,224
"Alright!"

175
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:13,494
Madal, what are you doing dude?

176
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:13,603
What?

177
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,017
What are you doing?

178
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:15,917
Music!

179
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:17,233
Loud music!

180
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,573
Can't hear a thing!

181
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,375
You carrry on!

182
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:22,835
"Alright!"

183
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:32,889
What I'm saying is...

184
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:34,678
Let's add another 50 bucks to this...

185
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:35,974
And hire some intern to do the coding.

186
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,174
Yogi, an intern will replace Jeetu, now?

187
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:41,778
We need people with some work
experience in our compnay!

188
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:43,640
People who've worked at some senior level!

189
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,268
Someone who can build a
team in the future...

190
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:46,405
Someone who can strategize!

191
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:47,489
Naveen...

192
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,251
Did you find that t-shirt of mine?

193
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:49,989
What t-shirt?

194
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,585
The 'InfoCom' one.

195
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:53,748
Where I'd an experience of 4 years?

196
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:56,227
As a Senior Consultant!

197
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,430
Since I'd BUILT a team there...

198
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,593
They'd gifted that t-shirt to me.

199
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,735
I don't know dude.
We're busy right now!

200
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:03,775
Shit!

201
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,547
Now, I'll have to strategize
what to wear!

202
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:08,180
What do we do then?

203
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,386
Dude, I think we're getting
a little impatient here!

204
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:12,920
I was thinking, what if...

205
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,473
Jeetu manages to convince Soumya!

206
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:15,386
Naveen...

207
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:16,852
She's his wife!

208
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,039
She gives him sex!

209
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:20,544
You can never convince a
woman who gives you sex!

210
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:21,639
Trust me.

211
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:23,051
This is all coming from experience!

212
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,076
Look Yogi...

213
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,196
Without Jeetu, we have no company.

214
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,092
Naveen...

215
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:28,291
We've no jobs.

216
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,656
We have to start a company,
with or without Jeetu.

217
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:31,642
Yogi...

218
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:33,669
What are you doing?

219
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,030
Did you think about it?

220
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,259
I'd asked you something, yesterday?

221
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,410
What'd you asked?

222
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:41,489
That thing...

223
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,148
Can I be part of your start-up?

224
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,427
WHAT?

225
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,238
WHY?

226
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:47,809
What do you mean by "Why?"?

227
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:49,042
You all are engineers!

228
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,136
You need an MBA!

229
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:53,087
How will you'll run a company
without business expertise?

230
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,238
Mandal, I'll let you know!

231
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,029
Give me some time.

232
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,254
It's a very important
professional decision!

233
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,087
I'll let you know, alright?
-OK

234
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:03,492
So will you send me a mail, or
you'll communicate verbally?

235
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,708
Should I expect a call by Friday?

236
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,334
I'll...

237
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,541
Why Friday? He's a sweet kid!

238
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:10,040
Let's do your G.D. and P.I.
today itself!

239
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:10,715
And the results tomorrow.

240
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:12,293
Personal interview, today?

241
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,270
Iit's already 10.
When will I prepare...

242
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:15,508
Fuck, it's 10 already?

243
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,007
I'm going to get killed!

244
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:21,480
What if it's 10?

245
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,964
'Jhalak' comes up only
at 10 in the night!

246
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:25,685
No Yogi! I've to meet Shreya. If
I get late, she'll screw me!

247
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:29,052
Haven't you told her
already, about our start-up?

248
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,401
Where have I met her, since so many days?

249
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:33,707
MANDAL!

250
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:36,995
Where's my face-wash dude?

251
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,080
The 'Kurule' medical therapy one?

252
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:39,535
Don't use that!

253
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,075
I used it and 4 of my pimples combined into a boil!

254
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:42,932
No dude. My face-wash!

255
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,719
Will you get it, or should we disqualify
you before the interview round, itself?

256
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:47,529
I was just about to go!

257
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:50,815
Dude, look...

258
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,116
There's this coder...

259
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:53,080
He's in the third year.

260
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,111
He's the son of the paternal
uncle of a mutual friend!

261
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:56,449
He's almost family!

262
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:59,052
Let's get him onboard. I assure you, he'll rock!

263
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,132
Look, Yogi!

264
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,884
A comapny's all about the people in it.

265
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,830
You think, any college guy
can replace Jeetu...

266
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,753
If that's how randomly we want to hire
people, why don't we hire Mandal as well?

267
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:11,030
Sorry to disturb your important meeting!

268
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:13,631
But I hope you take the right decision!

269
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,486
I also love Jeetu!

270
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:19,328
Though 3 years late, I've passed
by cheating from his answer sheet.

271
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,052
We definitely want him onboard.

272
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:24,385
But till the time we do not ensure
his salary, we need a coder.

273
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:25,314
I'm telling you...

274
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,247
Let's go meet this guy...

275
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,097
And let's get the fucking thing started!

276
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:29,964
OK, alright.

277
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,243
Let me meet Shreya for now.

278
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,300
After that, let's go meet this
guy, in the afternoon. OK?

279
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:36,961
How do I look?

280
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:38,807
Fair!

281
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,077
OK. You make a move, I'll go
meet Shreya and then catch you!

282
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,101
Go. Go. Go. Go.

283
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:54,605
Hello?

284
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,627
Naveen!!!
- Hey Shreya!

285
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:57,761
You still haven't upgraded
your internet, have you?

286
00:10:58,494 --> 00:10:59,240
How are you?

287
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,401
You've always been and
always will be a miser!

288
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,007
Can you see me?

289
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,962
Wait a second.

290
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:04,694
I can see you now.

291
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:04,642
You can see me?

292
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,992
Oh God, what is that
shirt you're wearing?

293
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:08,748
Have you borrowed it
from the gardenkeeper?

294
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,875
Actually, his and mine shirt
size is the same. So it fit me!

295
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,763
By the way, his wife wears XL.
Looks like that too, will fit you!

296
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,224
If only you had something XL, no?

297
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:17,359
Baby, I have my heart.

298
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,335
My heart is so big.

299
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:20,348
OK, you should know, that I
haven't been looking for

300
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,486
wi-fi all over Bhutan, to
listen to all these ridicules.

301
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,058
Yeah, as if I asked to go to Bhutan!

302
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,083
Meditation is being learnt, with
Consultancy Project only as an excuse.

303
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,395
If it's meditation that you wanted
to learn, you could've done that

304
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:28,970
just by waking up in the mornings
to watch 'Ramdev baba' on the T.V.

305
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,176
Yeah, because I just love old, hairy men sweating at 6 in the morning!

306
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,212
Why do you think I
sleep with you, baby?

307
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,767
Baby, I thought you sleep
with me, because not

308
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,517
a lot of men, believe
in doing charity, no?

309
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:40,415
Oh, you want me to start counting
down on the charity cases?

310
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,399
Should we start listing your dating history, now?
-No, no, no, no...

311
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,846
When is my true love, by
tearing through clouds...

312
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,930
Landing on the grounds of
this country, we call India!

313
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:47,875
Four O'clock!

314
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:48,455
Sharp!

315
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,420
You're coming to
get me, right?

316
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:51,746
Ok, I've a meeting at 8 and I've
something very important to tell you.

317
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,909
Oh! Even I've something
very important to tell you.

318
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:56,280
OK, I'll go first. Please.
Please. Let me go first!

319
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:57,946
OK, go. As if I have a choice.

320
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:58,835
Blurt out!

321
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:00,682
Actually...

322
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,725
Naveen, I'm pregnant.

323
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:02,219
Very nice!

324
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:03,816
Who's child is it?

325
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:03,846
I don't know...

326
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:05,825
It could be anyone's.

327
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:06,967
It could be yours.

328
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,260
It could be Raghav's.
It could be Vaibhav's.

329
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,904
Oh, it could even be the monastery monk's.

330
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:14,636
Do you have anything important to say or are
you just eating into my internet pack?

331
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,412
No. No. No. I do have
something important to say.

332
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,426
But I'd thought, that
I'd keep it a surprise.

333
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:19,087
Should I tell you?

334
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:20,249
What? You bought handcuffs?

335
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,572
Yeah, but apart from that...

336
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:24,340
So!

337
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:28,181
There's this guy, who's leaving his
girlfriend and moving to Brazil.

338
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,737
This girl, decides to
start looking for a job.

339
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:32,133
In Brazil.

340
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,873
And, guess what?

341
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,404
She finds herself in the final shortlist.

342
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,261
Shreya! Wait!

343
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,317
...last telephonic interview is
left, but after that...

344
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:40,817
Shreya, wait.

345
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,359
...going to live with you in Rio, bitch!
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

346
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,666
Wait Shreya...

347
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,627
This is exactly what I wanted
to give you news about.

348
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:48,090
Tell me.

349
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,079
Uh...

350
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,309
What are you doing...

351
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,927
I was just about to wash them up

352
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,045
How much will you work, after all!

353
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,085
Anyway, the machine isn't workiing
and the maid hasn't come...

354
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,466
It hardly takes time...

355
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,461
I washed them...

356
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:16,624
What's the deal? Suddenly today...

357
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:18,166
It isn't really "suddenly"!

358
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,008
I'd cooked chicken, day before!

359
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,785
And last night, I'd chopped the vegetables.

360
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:25,912
In a household, if 2 people work
in unison, it becomes easy.

361
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,445
These days, these machines have come up...

362
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:29,350
Otherwise...

363
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:32,498
Our dads used to do it all, by hands.

364
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,233
Why don't you go...

365
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,191
Go do your prayers. I'll come,
make tea, once I'm done here.

366
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:41,516
Do you have something, to tell me?

367
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:41,983
No!

368
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,224
Why would you think so?

369
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:46,897
Give me.

370
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,229
Naveen... had called...

371
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:55,658
Yogi and Naveen have quit their jobs...

372
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,516
They're going to begin
their own start-up...

373
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,151
They were asking me... as well

374
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:04,061
You go on downstairs. I'll get done here.

375
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,628
So what were you saying?

376
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:08,525
What was I saying...

377
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:08,964
No...

378
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:12,635
Naveen and the guys were
asking me as well...

379
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,675
To quit my job and join them as the C.T.O.

380
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:16,034
But now...

381
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,953
This... When did you buy this?

382
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,272
This is an old one!

383
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,198
Had gotten it from my parents'.

384
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:27,429
No... I was saying... These colors
suit you... They come out very well!

385
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,350
So what did you say?

386
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,452
I said, I'll think about it...
Now things like...

387
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,778
...these can't just be
decided in the moment.

388
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,897
So I wanted to talk to
you as well, about this.

389
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:40,030
Will you be benefited, in your career?

390
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,498
If the start-up goes big,
then there's a benefit...

391
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:43,593
Otherwise, it's just a risk!

392
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,041
Well, the work will be a lot of fun...

393
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,160
It'll be interesting but the salary...

394
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,905
I think you should do it.

395
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:50,929
What?

396
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,897
You're not doing it right...

397
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:55,115
Give it to me!

398
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:56,935
No...

399
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:58,949
What were you saying?

400
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,853
I think, you should do it.

401
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:03,532
No...

402
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:05,900
You don't have any problem?

403
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,897
I was trying to say, that once...

404
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,454
...I quit my job, our plan to buy
a house will be delayed.

405
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,030
So, what's the hurry in buying a house?

406
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,464
Anyway, this is such a nice house.

407
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,490
There's such a big terrace!

408
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:21,036
And then the chances of your
growth, are also so much more.

409
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:23,312
I won't even
get an L.T.A.

410
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:26,192
We'll have to drop our
Mauritius trip, as well.

411
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,953
We'll go to Mahabaleshwar, instead.

412
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,821
Shalini's husband owns a resort there.

413
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,904
But the salary issue will still persist.

414
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,875
Our savings are good enough.

415
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,161
Anyway, it's been 5 months
since I've come to Mumbai.

416
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,239
I'm thinking...

417
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,282
...of getting a good job for myself.

418
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,429
How do you hang these? By clips?

419
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,099
I thought, you wouldn't agree to this.

420
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,845
I even had my flowcharts ready,
so that I could convince you!

421
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,152
I've only been thinking
about this, since Monday.

422
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,923
All the effort, went waste!

423
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:02,591
Don't worry.

424
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,764
None of your effort will go waste.

425
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,481
Anyway...

426
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,734
You'll have to talk to
your dad about this...

427
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:10,520
You wouldn't quit your job,
without asking him, would you?

428
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,987
I was asking you to do it properly!

429
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:17,797
Now I'll have to wash,
all the clothes again!

430
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,007
Even the maid's not come today!

431
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,694
...got down all the lectures, and
uploaded youporn videos, instead.

432
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,702
Our guy's won the IBM code
competition, twice over...

433
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:27,774
...in a row.

434
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:32,003
Legend says that he got a congratulatory
mail from Eric Schmidt, himself.

435
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:34,551
But he doesn't have random
expectations, does he?

436
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,099
He knows, he won't get anything
more than the basic stipend, right?

437
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:39,066
Dude, relax! He's our kid!

438
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,107
We'll offer him a couple of treats at
Barbeque Nation and he'll say yes!

439
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:43,099
I told him, it's an Environment
Science lecture motherf**ker...

440
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:46,203
If not proxy, should I
whoop your arse?

441
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:48,025
Is Rohan Negi's room this way?

442
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:54,172
Is he expecting you?

443
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:54,473
Yes.

444
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,888
Follow me!

445
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:19,385
You go to hell!

446
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,706
I don't want to see your face again!

447
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:27,673
You aren't satisfied only
with foreplay, are you?

448
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,666
You have to have this
afterplay of melodrama!

449
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:31,284
She got mad because it was strawberry.

450
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,063
It isn't ice-cream that you'd
get almond and pistachio flavours!

451
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,020
Does the uncle party, have matchsticks?

452
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,062
Go run to the canteen. It's time!

453
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:40,112
Uncle, give him a 100 bucks.

454
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:41,309
Give it.

455
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,856
Follow me!

456
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:58,085
I can't go beyond this point.

457
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:03,871
Deposit your mobiles, pendrives,
hard-disks and any other storage devices.

458
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,872
There's a door ahead...

459
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,062
Knock it.

460
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,007
Twice!

461
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,301
And then wait.

462
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:22,967
Do you smoke?

463
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:24,825
No.

464
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:26,593
Kids!

465
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:35,019
Yes?

466
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,031
Tell chintu, that 'Yogi bhaiyaa' is
here, to give him an internship.

467
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,483
Come in.

468
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:50,013
Sit.

469
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:13,969
He's in the middle of something...

470
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:14,926
Give him 75.

471
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,339
Minutes?

472
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,260
Headshots!

473
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:27,087
Despite being the class monitor, my performance
from class 6 to class 12 steadily increased...

474
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:30,395
From 72.3% to 87.8%

475
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,105
This goes to show...

476
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:33,175
I'm responsible...

477
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,167
...persistent...

478
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:36,250
...dedicated, motivated, over...

479
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,814
Under-rated dude!

480
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:43,005
Responsible, persistent,
motivated, dedicated, under...

481
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:45,000
Hi Shreya!

482
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:46,921
Hi Mandal!

483
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:47,644
Hi...

484
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:51,350
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb
your paranormal powerpoint fantasy.

485
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,930
I'll just sneak into Naveen's room and
lock the door, so you can't come in!

486
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:54,993
No. No. No.

487
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,774
Actually, I was waiting for you!

488
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:59,015
Naveen'd told me that you're going to come.

489
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,367
In that blazer and towel?

490
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:03,248
You aren't a serial killer Mandal, are you?

491
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,044
Only, if looks could kill!

492
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,439
Please have a seat!

493
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:13,031
Actually, if I get tensed,
I need to have a bath!

494
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,169
Better?

495
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,271
Congratulations Mandal.

496
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,844
You've reached a new level of creepy!

497
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:20,915
Soo...

498
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,653
Naveen's quit his job to...

499
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,788
Yeah, I know. He's told me everything.

500
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,036
And I too, want to...

501
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,005
Everything!

502
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:28,519
Soo...

503
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,352
So?

504
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:33,724
Shreya. We're friends, aren't we?

505
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,764
Facebook-wise or in real life?

506
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:38,416
Joke!

507
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:40,090
Do you remember?

508
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,804
Last month, early morning...

509
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,812
You wanted a Xerox of your PAN card.

510
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,224
Naveen was sleeping.

511
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:46,358
So you asked me for help.

512
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:47,944
I was getting late for work...

513
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,145
I didn't have any change on me...

514
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:52,268
I still went and got the Xerox done.

515
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,914
Look, I've this one philosophy...

516
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:58,126
Friends should always help each other!

517
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,656
No. No. No. No. No.

518
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:02,945
One second.

519
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,215
You want me to convince Naveen to hire you?

520
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:05,667
No.

521
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,080
Sorry.

522
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:07,336
Not gonna happen.

523
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,729
Anyway, I can't convince him.
Instead, he'll end up convincing me!

524
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:12,756
Shreya... Trust me!

525
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:14,599
He can never convince you!

526
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,564
A man can never convince
a woman, who gives him...

527
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:19,660
...Love!

528
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:20,969
And if...

529
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,757
He doesn't budge...

530
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:24,350
You know...

531
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:25,714
Use your methods!

532
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,363
What methods?

533
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:28,644
Intercourse

534
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,064
What?

535
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,651
Mandal, have you gone nuts?

536
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,191
Just for a 1 buck Xerox...

537
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,294
It's actually 2 bucks. One for each side!

538
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,906
I'm worth much more than that!

539
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:37,794
OK? I'm sorry.

540
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:41,358
I would've helped you with anything
else, but with this, I can't! Sorry.

541
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:42,667
Naveen needs my help!

542
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,628
Yogi keeps winding him up against me!

543
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:51,691
I really want to be a part of this!

544
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:58,832
I know, I'm gonna regret this.

545
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:02,910
OK.

546
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:04,295
Alright.

547
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:08,805
Tell me one thing.

548
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:11,056
When do...

549
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:12,151
You call for a plumber?

550
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:13,874
That wasn't me...

551
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,627
Naveen thinks that I broke
his jet spray and then...

552
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:18,143
No. I mean hypothetically.

553
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:18,881
I mean...

554
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,454
When would anyone, call for a plumber?

555
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,684
One calls for the plumber
when a tap's broken.

556
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:27,280
Right. And what if a tap isn't broken?

557
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:29,874
Then why call the plumber?

558
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:30,938
Exactly!

559
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:31,511
Look.

560
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,239
In this situation...

561
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:37,166
You're the plumber and Naveen's
start-up doesn't have any broken tap.

562
00:22:37,604 --> 00:22:40,548
Irrespective of, however great, the
work you're doing in life is...

563
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:43,882
Unless, your inclusion doesn't
solve any of their problems...

564
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,413
They don't need you!

565
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:49,302
See... You need to figure
out what they need.

566
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:54,276
You also need a bigger towel, dude!

567
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:55,457
No. No.

568
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:56,505
Don't shy away!

569
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:58,203
I'm wearing my underwear!

570
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,283
Sorry.

571
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,632
Not wearing any!

572
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:12,052
F**K!

573
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,306
F**K!

574
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,187
Yogi!

575
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:22,282
And...

576
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:22,946
You must be Naveen.

577
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,719
How are you 'chintu'? I saw you
at the threading ceremony, last.

578
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:26,743
Not 'chintu'.

579
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:28,700
Dungeon Master.

580
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:32,140
There's an underscore
between Dungeon and Master.

581
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:34,491
So...

582
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:35,599
You guys want me to work for your company.

583
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,007
You tell him.

584
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,524
We were interested in
discussing the possibilities...

585
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,594
I looked into your idea.

586
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:45,499
It's... quite interesting actually.

587
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:46,474
Looked into?

588
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:48,096
But, I haven't sent you any mail, as yet!

589
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,435
But you'd mailed NASSCOM, hadn't you?

590
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:53,634
You see...

591
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:57,181
Privacy on mail is a myth my friend!

592
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,011
So... If I join you guys...

593
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:02,594
How do I benefit?

594
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:03,808
What do I get?

595
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:05,989
Opportunity!

596
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,847
Of course, there'll also
be a stipend initially.

597
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,004
About... 7K.

598
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,625
8... 8K. Yeah.

599
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:16,474
And as we grow, your monetory
compensation will obviously increase...

600
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:19,891
Do you know what's the prize money for the
Internation Counter Strike competition?

601
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:22,460
How much?

602
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,689
475,000...

603
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:26,117
Dollars.

604
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,736
4... 4 times 6 is 24...

605
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,022
And you won that?

606
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,141
Twice!

607
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:34,871
4... 4 times 2 is 8... 8 times 6 is 48...

608
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,766
So theoritically... I can hire you guys.

609
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,823
But not the other way round.

610
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:45,736
I want 30% equity...

611
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,649
And... veto on product design.

612
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,117
Dungeon_master@hotmail.com

613
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,657
Don't forget the underscore.

614
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,810
Mail me by Monday.

615
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:02,426
Or just save it in your drafts.

616
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,295
I'll read it.

617
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:10,093
I think we need Jeetu.

618
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:12,095
Do you think we need Jeetu?

619
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,513
We need Jeetu.

620
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,608
We'll have to first change the
passwords for all our accounts.

621
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:16,754
What's up, start-up founder?

622
00:25:17,674 --> 00:25:20,071
Your battery looks dead
after listeninig to the deal.

623
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,650
What's up, entrepreneur uncle?

624
00:25:22,714 --> 00:25:24,791
Pass on some stake to us as well!

625
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,105
Listen up Jeetu. There's no other way out.
You have to join in.

626
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,533
I can't join in.

627
00:25:34,248 --> 00:25:35,567
Sorry.

628
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:37,651
I told you!

629
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:40,605
You can never convince a woman
who gives you sex!

630
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:41,645
Noo!

631
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:43,177
Suamya has agreed.

632
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:44,216
SO?

633
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:48,565
Ohh!

634
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:51,446
What?

635
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:53,508
Did you try talking to him?

636
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,927
That's all I've been able to do since I
was 1.5 years old. TRY to talk!

637
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,097
With whom?

638
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:00,203
Haven't you watched 'Udaan'?

639
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,685
Ohhhh!

640
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:02,955
Your dad?

641
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,232
He's alcoholic?

642
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,486
He's not alcoholic...

643
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,943
Why are you scared of your dad?
Are you still a kid?

644
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:11,280
Naveen. Even my passbook is with him.

645
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,597
If my salary doesn't get credited
on the 1st of the next month...

646
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,320
My life will get debited.

647
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,090
You guys, atleast, start.

648
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:22,439
I'll see. I'll try putting in a couple
of hours of work, everyday after my job.

649
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:25,637
"You guys start", "I'll see". Are you mad?

650
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:27,875
This way, even the Beta version
won't be ready in 6 months.

651
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,176
There's so much to do.

652
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,034
Excuse me!

653
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,112
Aren't you the guys launching the
coolest company of Indian history?

654
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,595
Hey! The start-up wags are here.
-Hey!

655
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:37,812
The gold-diggers are here
even before the money.

656
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:39,854
Listen, you need to get
a better CEO, though!

657
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:43,137
Don't know about the coolest, but
could be most short-lived for sure!

658
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:45,883
Don't say such bad things on
a good day like this, Jeetu.

659
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:47,173
This is for you'll.

660
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,557
So what's up, Jeetu?

661
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,073
What are you doing here?

662
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:52,219
I've come here for the interview!

663
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:55,009
Mandal, that was only a joke. There's
no interview happening.

664
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:55,980
I know. I know.

665
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:57,056
I know jokes.

666
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:59,456
I've taken improv. comedy
classes for a month.

667
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:00,469
Is this taken?
-Yes.

668
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,557
OK!

669
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:04,081
Don't you get it, motherf**ker?

670
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,058
Anyway our battery's down...

671
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,081
This is our shit, Madal!

672
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,247
We don't need you.

673
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:10,271
Trust me.

674
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:11,589
You need me!

675
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:13,104
Infact without me...

676
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,184
You don't have a company!

677
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,514
OK, go get a chair.

678
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:16,626
We'll interview you right away!

679
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:18,517
Just hear him out na, once.

680
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:39,927
Tell me.

681
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,126
Why should we hire you?

682
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:42,616
You know, as an MBA...

683
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:45,213
I've always had a clarity about my R&Rs.

684
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:46,049
One of my KRA has been problem...

685
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:47,936
We don't need a marketing manager.
We need a coder...

686
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,081
Thanks for applying. You interview's over.

687
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,116
No. No. No. One second.

688
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:52,386
I can solve your problem.

689
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,451
I can give you something, which you need.

690
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,958
I can give you Jeetu!

691
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:00,665
How?

692
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,810
Till the time, you'll
don't get an investment...

693
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,675
I'll pay for Jeetu's salary.

694
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:08,492
A part of it through my salary
and a part through my savings.

695
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:11,626
But I'll ensure that, Jeetu keeps getting
as much as he gets from his company.

696
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:15,723
Mandal. Why would you
do these things for us?

697
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,821
Not for you guys...

698
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,157
I'll do it for myself!

699
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,722
You guys are the best
friends I've ever had.

700
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,143
I know, apart from Naveen...

701
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,242
We've not interacted as much...

702
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:29,692
But I've always thought, that the
four of us are a very good team.

703
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:33,112
You know when I'd seen
'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'

704
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:34,651
I'd decided that...

705
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,770
The four of us too, just like them...

706
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,126
Would go on a trip.

707
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,443
But ZNMD had only 3 guys.

708
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:47,382
OK. Then... like 'Dil Chahta Hai'.

709
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:48,945
Again, only 3 guys, Mandal.

710
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:53,825
'Rock On' definitely had 4 guys.

711
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,453
The 4th one, gets cancer and dies.
Only 3 remain.

712
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:00,135
The point is, if I join your start-up...

713
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,564
Then Jeetu can work full-time with us.

714
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:09,386
All MBAs... are not that bad.

715
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,584
Soo...

716
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:23,060
Is somebody going to say something, or are
we sitting just like this for the next hour?

717
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:24,737
Don't worry, guys.

718
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,767
It won't be that bad.

719
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,330
Backstreet Boys... Alright!

720
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:32,854
Cheers!

721
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,108
And then there were four!

722
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:40,415
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

723
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,787
Finally, he's made himself useful!

724
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,168
So, Jeetu's back!

725
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:49,551
Important point - This news
doesn't get out of here!

726
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:52,822
If dad gets to know...
- Stop going "Dad. Dad."

727
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:55,036
Once we're a million dollar company,
even your dad will chill out!

728
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:58,171
And also, I've done some research and
thought of a few names for our compnay.

729
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,528
I think, our compnay name
should have 'le' in it!

730
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:03,633
Like Google had 'gle', Apple
has 'ple', Oracle has 'cle'

731
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,576
What non-sense are you talking? You've started
with your stupid marketing logics again!

732
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:08,599
Please don't throw fries on me.
I'm the marketing manager!

733
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:09,504
Oops! Sorry.

734
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,937
Careful! Why are you throwing it on me?

735
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:19,563
So, this is your million dollar team?
