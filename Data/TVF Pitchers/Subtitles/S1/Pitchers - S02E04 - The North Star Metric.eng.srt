00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,844
<font size="60">No, no, the engagement is low.
</font>

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,487
<font size="60">The engagement is low, it needs to be...
</font>

3
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,540
<font size="60">I am okay.
</font>

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:26,960
<font size="60">I am okay.
</font>

5
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:27,985
<font size="60">I am okay.
</font>

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,012
<font size="60">Take his belt, watch and any
other metallic object he's wearing,
</font>

7
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:35,147
<font size="60">and send him to the scan room.
</font>

8
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,230
<font size="60">Yes, I'll do it right away.
</font>

9
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:39,371
<font size="60">-And you sign this admission form.
-Yes.
</font>

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,547
<font size="60">What exactly is wrong with him, sir?
</font>

11
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:52,323
<font size="60">Nothing is wrong. We'll dispatch
him in the next couple of days.
</font>

12
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:53,458
<font size="60">Nothing is wrong?
</font>

13
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:54,690
<font size="60">Then why am I in so much pain?
</font>

14
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:57,479
<font size="60">Actually, you have a
problem with your L4 and L5.
</font>

15
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:58,841
<font size="60">There's a strain.
</font>

16
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:01,707
<font size="60">If you don't take better care of
yourself over the next couple of weeks,
</font>

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,199
<font size="60">then you can have a slipped disc.
</font>

18
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:03,965
<font size="60">What?
</font>

19
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,295
<font size="60">No need to worry.
</font>

20
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,760
<font size="60">I'll keep you under observation
for the next few days.
</font>

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,265
<font size="60">-Okay.
-Everything will be fine.
</font>

22
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:11,989
<font size="60">Thank you. Everything is fine.
I am okay. I am okay.
</font>

23
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:12,871
<font size="60">Very good.
</font>

24
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:14,428
<font size="60">I won't have a slipped disc either.
I am okay.
</font>

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,353
<font size="60">Thank you.
</font>

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,589
<font size="60">Naveen, I cannot stay here.
</font>

27
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,592
<font size="60">The product launched four days ago.
and we haven't seen any traction yet.
</font>

28
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:26,356
<font size="60">The real task of marketing begins now.
</font>

29
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:28,172
<font size="60">He'll say he's going home
but head straight to the office.
</font>

30
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:30,435
<font size="60">He's been staying at the office
for the last four days. Ask him.
</font>

31
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,283
<font size="60">Listen...
</font>

32
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,916
<font size="60">The hospital guys will
ask me to stay a couple of days,
</font>

33
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:39,043
<font size="60">and tell me to run a couple of tests.
It will add to the bill.
</font>

34
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:40,490
<font size="60">We already...
</font>

35
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,500
<font size="60">Not now...
</font>

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,302
<font size="60">Can you guys go out, please?
</font>

37
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:48,245
<font size="60">Nancy, thank you.
Tell everyone I am fine.
</font>

38
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,270
<font size="60">All is good.
</font>

39
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,942
<font size="60">How much is it?
</font>

40
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,355
<font size="60">How much is it?
</font>

41
00:01:58,899 --> 00:01:59,782
<font size="60">2,15,000
</font>

42
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,201
<font size="60">Don't worry.
</font>

43
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,751
<font size="60">-I am sorry, guys.
-Don't be crazy.
</font>

44
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:04,459
<font size="60">Sorry.
</font>

45
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:07,752
<font size="60">I know we've a cash crunch, but
the company can reimburse half the bill.
</font>

46
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,205
<font size="60">No, Naveen.
</font>

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,247
<font size="60">We're already in a tight spot.
</font>

48
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,867
<font size="60">I cannot be a liability anymore.
</font>

49
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:18,130
<font size="60">Have you lost your mind?
What liability?
</font>

50
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,629
<font size="60">What do you mean by liability, Mandal?
</font>

51
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,082
<font size="60">Get well soon and all
the liabilities will be over.
</font>

52
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:22,347
<font size="60">I'm right.
</font>

53
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,325
<font size="60">And if you want to help,
</font>

54
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,179
<font size="60">then help with the marketing budget.
</font>

55
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:32,501
<font size="60">The tech team made a new product,
now let me do my job.
</font>

56
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:34,090
<font size="60">This is my job now.
</font>

57
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:38,785
<font size="60">Mandal, focus on your job right now.
</font>

58
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:39,960
<font size="60">No, Naveen.
</font>

59
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,280
<font size="60">We must focus on user growth.
</font>

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,772
<font size="60">That's the most important metric.
</font>

61
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,009
<font size="60">-Yes, we are...
-If we don't see a bump in user growth,
</font>

62
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,509
<font size="60">then we cannot close this round.
</font>

63
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,501
<font size="60">Get well first, otherwise,
you'll see a bump on your back.
</font>

64
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,223
<font size="60">I know we've faith in this product,
</font>

65
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,785
<font size="60">but even apple needs marketing.
</font>

66
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,455
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

67
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,183
<font size="60">-I will figure it out.
-Yes.
</font>

68
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,170
<font size="60">Okay. Don't worry.
</font>

69
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,804
<font size="60">-You just...
-Yeah...
</font>

70
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:07,152
<font size="60">-Get some rest.
-I am alright. See, no stress.
</font>

71
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,494
<font size="60">-See, I am resting.
-No working.
</font>

72
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:09,622
<font size="60">-I am resting.
-Yes.
</font>

73
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:12,975
<font size="60">Get some rest. No talking either.
</font>

74
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,894
<font size="60">The doctor has said
that you have to do it.
</font>

75
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:27,905
<font size="60">We know this moron won't stop working.
</font>

76
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,491
<font size="60">Someone needs to stay with him.
</font>

77
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,399
<font size="60">Don't worry, sir.
I'll stay here and manage his workload.
</font>

78
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:36,329
<font size="60">Are you sure?
</font>

79
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,653
<font size="60">Call me if there is anything, okay.
</font>

80
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,894
<font size="60">Thank you.
</font>

81
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,120
<font size="60">-Come on, Pappi, let's go.
-Yes.
</font>

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,685
<font size="60">I'll send his favourite pillow.
</font>

83
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:46,950
<font size="60">We'll also buy some fruits on the way.
</font>

84
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:53,008
<font size="60">The changes in the social
media campaign, have they gone live?
</font>

85
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,613
<font size="60">-Yes, sir.
-Show me the graph.
</font>

86
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,872
<font size="60">Wha...
</font>

87
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,780
<font size="60">Shall we try influencer
marketing for promotions?
</font>

88
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:08,153
<font size="60">Sir, no 'blue-tick' guy
is agreeing to our budget.
</font>

89
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:12,175
<font size="60">Do you want me to google,
how to influence an influencer?
</font>

90
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,281
<font size="60">No.
</font>

91
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,744
<font size="60">Okay, this may be a long shot.
</font>

92
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:20,747
<font size="60">But have you seen the drone video?
</font>

93
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,420
<font size="60">To achieve something like that,
we'll need a marketing genius.
</font>

94
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,458
<font size="60">But just take a look.
</font>

95
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,048
<font size="60">Nancy,
</font>

96
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,240
<font size="60">a marketing genius is just
a marketing person with lots of money.
</font>

97
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,423
<font size="60">Sharks.
</font>

98
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,531
<font size="60">Pay attention!
Pay attention! Pay attention!
</font>

99
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:41,788
<font size="60">Wait a minute.
</font>

100
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:44,027
<font size="60">What are you doing?
Don't you want to make money?
</font>

101
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,446
<font size="60">Then skip if you can?
</font>

102
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,725
<font size="60">Skip... no wait.
</font>

103
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,235
<font size="60">We want initial traction, don't we?
</font>

104
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,454
<font size="60">We don't need any blue-tick guy for it.
</font>

105
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,141
<font size="60">Isn't he like a very down market?
</font>

106
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:00,292
<font size="60">Nancy...
</font>

107
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,884
<font size="60">I mean he is...
</font>

108
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:06,366
<font size="60">But we need to capture the market.
</font>

109
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,117
<font size="60">We'll think with up or down later.
</font>

110
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:10,931
<font size="60">But how are we going to
capture the market with him?
</font>

111
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:13,728
<font size="60">-He has only 150,000 subscribers.
-Nancy...
</font>

112
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:17,126
<font size="60">Nancy, he has 150,000 subscribers.
</font>

113
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:19,541
<font size="60">If we can get some of his viewers,
</font>

114
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,441
<font size="60">our user growth will start
walking instead of crawling.
</font>

115
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:26,174
<font size="60">Pappi got my stuff, didn't he?
</font>

116
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,601
<font size="60">Pass it.
</font>

117
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,568
<font size="60">It's time to work from the hospital.
</font>

118
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:40,450
<font size="60">To make a unicorn, sometimes
you got to stoop pretty low, Nancy.
</font>

119
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:46,012
<font size="60">But sir, after what happened between you
two, do you think Rastogi will agree?
</font>

120
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:49,352
<font size="60">People don't agree,
Nancy, they need to be convinced.
</font>

121
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,042
<font size="60">How am I looking?
</font>

122
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,769
<font size="60">I think Rastogi will agree.
</font>

123
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:56,326
<font size="60">After all, he was your friend.
</font>

124
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,620
<font size="60">I was your only friend.
</font>

125
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,922
<font size="60">Everyone in my group
thought you were a zero,
</font>

126
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:02,358
<font size="60">but I thought you were Zuckerburg.
</font>

127
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:04,807
<font size="60">And yet you came to Bangalore
and broke my laptop.
</font>

128
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,169
<font size="60">Blood Edwardo.
</font>

129
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,131
<font size="60">How can you forget why?
</font>

130
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,977
<font size="60">I wasn't happy about
stealing the pen drive either.
</font>

131
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:15,380
<font size="60">I went on a guilt trip as soon
as I got on the flight to Bangalore.
</font>

132
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,231
<font size="60">So, Mr. Rastogi, make just one video.
</font>

133
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,396
<font size="60">That will end your guilt trip,
</font>

134
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,813
<font size="60">and Pragati will get
a five-star rating as well.
</font>

135
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:29,457
<font size="60">Look...life doesn't give
everyone a chance for redemption.
</font>

136
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:32,595
<font size="60">I am not Shashank who needs redemption.
</font>

137
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,460
<font size="60">I need something else.
</font>

138
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,000
<font size="60">What?
</font>

139
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,679
<font size="60">If Pragati survives and you
get funding for the next round.
</font>

140
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,376
<font size="60">Then you will have to
become the angel investor
</font>

141
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,095
<font size="60">for one of my startups in the incubator.
</font>

142
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:48,275
<font size="60">It's been two years.
</font>

143
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,015
<font size="60">R-Cubator hasn't seen daylight yet.
</font>

144
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,005
<font size="60">If they don't show some results yet,
</font>

145
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:59,521
<font size="60">they will start thinking I am a zero.
</font>

146
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:04,945
<font size="60">Mandal, please.
</font>

147
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:08,627
<font size="60">I don't want to be
the Mandal of this group.
</font>

148
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,876
<font size="60">Just one post and one video, please.
</font>

149
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:14,546
<font size="60">Can't do it this time, Mandal.
</font>

150
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,597
<font size="60">Everyone says I am too accessible.
</font>

151
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,340
<font size="60">They are telling me to go exclusive.
</font>

152
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,429
<font size="60">Please, talk to my manager.
</font>

153
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,724
<font size="60">No, not Pragati.
Pragati is the name of my ex.
</font>

154
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:25,119
<font size="60">Okay, I'll do it.
</font>

155
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,854
<font size="60">But you must promise me one thing.
</font>

156
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,927
<font size="60">Every morning you'll
try anulom-vilom and pranayam.
</font>

157
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:30,988
<font size="60">Will you do it?
</font>

158
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,577
<font size="60">I love your product,
but I cannot do Amitji.
</font>

159
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:38,893
<font size="60">I am forwarding you everyone's number.
Call everyone.
</font>

160
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,685
<font size="60">Where did you get my number?
</font>

161
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,361
<font size="60">Forget how I got it,
</font>

162
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,190
<font size="60">let me tell you what
else I got from you.
</font>

163
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,093
<font size="60">So much of system, so much of knowledge.
</font>

164
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,063
<font size="60">Whenever I am lost,
</font>

165
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:54,566
<font size="60">I log on to YouTube and
watch a couple of your thumbnails.
</font>

166
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:55,815
<font size="60">And that makes me happy.
</font>

167
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,575
<font size="60">Our thumbnails are good.
</font>

168
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,723
<font size="60">I am also quite nice, bro.
</font>

169
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:02,333
<font size="60">Mandal, I really liked
the name of your product.
</font>

170
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:06,080
<font size="60">Very few startups
choose a name in 'Hindi'.
</font>

171
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,204
<font size="60">So congrats on that.
</font>

172
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:10,678
<font size="60">I am ready to make content for you.
</font>

173
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,392
<font size="60">I hope you're not making
any videos from RRR.
</font>

174
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:16,508
<font size="60">No.
</font>

175
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:21,056
<font size="60">Because 'Rastogi' is the
Shakuni of the startup world for me.
</font>

176
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,727
<font size="60">Well, my videos will have more views.
Girl power.
</font>

177
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,094
<font size="60">Do you have Ravish Kumar's number?
</font>

178
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,668
<font size="60">That's me, Raja Ravish Kumar.
</font>

179
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:32,360
<font size="60">Loyal to the youth,
hello I am Raja Ravish Kumar.
</font>

180
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,206
<font size="60">Okay, bro. Anything for
the Indian startup community.
</font>

181
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:36,569
<font size="60">Tell me about Pragati.
</font>

182
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,302
<font size="60">The app is called Pragati 2.0
</font>

183
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:44,491
<font size="60">Basically, our audiences overlap.
So what do you think?
</font>

184
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:48,074
<font size="60">I haven't even used your app.
</font>

185
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:50,831
<font size="60">So if you think I will
lie to my subscribers,
</font>

186
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,928
<font size="60">then I'll need more money for that.
</font>

187
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:55,015
<font size="60">What is your budget?
</font>

188
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:58,837
<font size="60">The teacher always gets his fee
for teaching his pupil.
</font>

189
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:01,898
<font size="60">So you do epic shit, I am with you.
</font>

190
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:03,731
<font size="60">We'll do epic shit together.
</font>

191
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,285
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

192
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:13,282
<font size="60">In the start-up community,
Pragati launched like a superstar.
</font>

193
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:16,542
<font size="60">They have added several features,
</font>

194
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,609
<font size="60">that you'll run out of fingers.
</font>

195
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,172
<font size="60">Isn't it nice?
</font>

196
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:22,810
<font size="60">Mandal just nailed it.
</font>

197
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:24,804
<font size="60">This was just Rastogi.
</font>

198
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:28,031
<font size="60">He's collaborated with several
micro and nano influencers.
</font>

199
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,487
<font size="60">The product is receiving great traction.
</font>

200
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:33,341
<font size="60">Nice curves, bro.
</font>

201
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:35,850
<font size="60">Yeah.
</font>

202
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,802
<font size="60">It's working. It's working.
</font>

203
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:40,025
<font size="60">Good afternoon sir. Sir, Ashish Jain
here will manage our warehouse.
</font>

204
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,008
<font size="60">Sir, lovely to do business with you.
</font>

205
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:44,729
<font size="60">Sir, big fan. Sir, one selfie.
Sir, please...
</font>

206
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,993
<font size="60">My younger brother is into startups.
I'll send him this.
</font>

207
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:52,751
<font size="60">One second.
</font>

208
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,077
<font size="60">Thank you, sir.
</font>

209
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:57,866
<font size="60">The veneration is done, but
vacating the warehouse will take time.
</font>

210
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,244
<font size="60">But work has begun from today, sir.
</font>

211
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,328
<font size="60">I made a huge board outside
with your name on it.
</font>

212
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,212
<font size="60">What nonsense is he saying?
</font>

213
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,460
<font size="60">I will talk to him, sir.
</font>

214
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:04,564
<font size="60">Come with me.
</font>

215
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:06,364
<font size="60">Bhaati, how many
warehouses do you own now?
</font>

216
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,055
<font size="60">Don't ask.
</font>

217
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:14,018
<font size="60">Bhaati, daily active
users are growing decently.
</font>

218
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,467
<font size="60">But the engagement is tremendous.
</font>

219
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:19,086
<font size="60">-And the KAKS...
-Stop bullshitting me numbers.
</font>

220
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:20,919
<font size="60">Ever read in a newspaper,
</font>

221
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,886
<font size="60">"DAU of the startup is low,
or their KAK is high"?
</font>

222
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,683
<font size="60">But metrics are important, bro.
</font>

223
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:29,083
<font size="60">There are several stars in the sky,
they are all important.
</font>

224
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,645
<font size="60">But the ship only follows one star.
</font>

225
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,202
<font size="60">The North Star.
</font>

226
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,681
<font size="60">If you want to make Pragati
the biggest company in the world,
</font>

227
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,267
<font size="60">then you have to follow
only one North Star metric.
</font>

228
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:41,457
<font size="60">Valueship.
</font>

229
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:46,209
<font size="60">Bhaati, I feel if we do a good job,
it will automatically make us big.
</font>

230
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:47,733
<font size="60">You should have opened an NGO instead.
</font>

231
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,973
<font size="60">-Why start up?
-What...
</font>

232
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:51,972
<font size="60">If doing a good job could make you big,
then Tesla wouldn't be going bankrupt.
</font>

233
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:53,828
<font size="60">But only valuation alone doesn't cut it.
</font>

234
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,433
<font size="60">A valuation is just a number.
</font>

235
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,965
<font size="60">You say it yourself. Just a perception.
</font>

236
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:58,660
<font size="60">No one gives a fuck about reality.
</font>

237
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,914
<font size="60">Only perception sells these days.
</font>

238
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,520
<font size="60">That's not true.
</font>

239
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,728
<font size="60">It is.
</font>

240
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:07,157
<font size="60">There were several companies
whose valuation was millions of dollars.
</font>

241
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:09,201
<font size="60">They have all closed down,
and no one even asking about them. So?
</font>

242
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:10,133
<font size="60">I don't buy this.
</font>

243
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,195
<font size="60">Then don't.
</font>

244
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:12,979
<font size="60">Why are you asking?
</font>

245
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:14,488
<font size="60">Do what you want to do.
</font>

246
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,609
<font size="60">I am running a company
worth 100 billion.
</font>

247
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:19,889
<font size="60">-Don't mind.
-Fuck!
</font>

248
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,112
<font size="60">Why are the company trucks being used?
</font>

249
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,818
<font size="60">Did you smoke weed
before coming on the job?
</font>

250
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,118
<font size="60">-I told Raunak not to.
-Raunak who?
</font>

251
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,791
<font size="60">He's our sales AVP.
</font>

252
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,291
<font size="60">-Fire him right now.
-Yes, sir.
</font>

253
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,054
<font size="60">-Right now.
-Yes sir. I'm doing right now.
</font>

254
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,602
<font size="60">Move the truck.
</font>

255
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,230
<font size="60">Sorry, Bhaati. I didn't mean it.
</font>

256
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:44,173
<font size="60">You are my mentor.
That's why I come to you for advice.
</font>

257
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,828
<font size="60">I am not giving you advice.
I am saying this out of the experience.
</font>

258
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:47,862
<font size="60">Sorry, sorry.
</font>

259
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:50,213
<font size="60">Hello, Raunak. Can you hear me?
</font>

260
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,302
<font size="60">Asshole, you are fired!
</font>

261
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,265
<font size="60">Did you know what valuation
Uber got in the beginning?
</font>

262
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:56,609
<font size="60">Five billion.
</font>

263
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:59,345
<font size="60">They were told that they
are just an urban taxi company.
</font>

264
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,662
<font size="60">And the founder said they are not a taxi
company, they are a logistics company.
</font>

265
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:04,101
<font size="60">And very soon they went global.
</font>

266
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:06,108
<font size="60">What was Uber's valuation finally?
</font>

267
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,973
<font size="60">-How much?
-40 billion.
</font>

268
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,085
<font size="60">What? From five to forty?
</font>

269
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,862
<font size="60">The founder just pitched the
same product with a different story.
</font>

270
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,943
<font size="60">Startup valuations are
not just numbers, Naveen.
</font>

271
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,101
<font size="60">It's their story.
</font>

272
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,533
<font size="60">And your story is right before my eyes,
</font>

273
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:24,189
<font size="60">so according to me,
your valuation should be...
</font>

274
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:27,553
<font size="60">This much.
</font>

275
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,201
<font size="60">This much?
</font>

276
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:34,526
<font size="60">Go sell your story, understand.
</font>

277
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:37,252
<font size="60">I've a friend in Eagle Vision. Ashu.
</font>

278
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,573
<font size="60">I'll set a date if you want.
</font>

279
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:45,077
<font size="60">No, Bhaati.
We're already in talks with Prachi.
</font>

280
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:46,496
<font size="60">Plutus will make us an offer.
</font>

281
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:48,351
<font size="60">Are you going to plan
your retirement with them?
</font>

282
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,794
<font size="60">The world is dreaming about
Sequoia, Softbank,
</font>

283
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,615
<font size="60">and you're jerking off
on local investors like Prachi Meena.
</font>

284
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,152
<font size="60">That's not it.
She backs us. She has always backed us.
</font>

285
00:12:58,232 --> 00:12:59,885
<font size="60">She believes in us.
That's why...
</font>

286
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:01,811
<font size="60">-Are you two having a scene?
-Of course not.
</font>

287
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,314
<font size="60">-No, we are just friends.
-With benefits?
</font>

288
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:05,570
<font size="60">No.
</font>

289
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:07,486
<font size="60">She saw it.
She saw the data and said this.
</font>

290
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,574
<font size="60">She said series A is almost done.
</font>

291
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,246
<font size="60">In fact, she is in
talks with the partners.
</font>

292
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,040
<font size="60">Of course, she will. You did your job.
</font>

293
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,523
<font size="60">You left her hanging till now.
</font>

294
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,973
<font size="60">The 'V' in VCs is silent.
</font>

295
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:22,425
<font size="60">They are all capitalists.
</font>

296
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:24,675
<font size="60">And what do capitalists want?
</font>

297
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,452
<font size="60">Speak up, asshole.
</font>

298
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:28,679
<font size="60">-Sir...
-What needs...
</font>

299
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,385
<font size="60">Sir's flight has landed.
We got to leave.
</font>

300
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,030
<font size="60">Think about it.
</font>

301
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:38,926
<font size="60">Bhaati, mail from Prachi.
</font>

302
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,460
<font size="60">-Again she left you.
-She sent a term sheet.
</font>

303
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:43,244
<font size="60">Take a look.
</font>

304
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,809
<font size="60">Glad to hear your offer...
</font>

305
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,922
<font size="60">...at a post-money valuation of...
</font>

306
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,502
<font size="60">This is nothing close to what you said.
</font>

307
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:55,993
<font size="60">Go on.
</font>

308
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:58,395
<font size="60">Go tie a friendship band to your friend.
</font>

309
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,367
<font size="60">Let's go.
</font>

310
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:08,425
<font size="60">You're signing your term
sheet and we're drinking coffee.
</font>

311
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:12,428
<font size="60">It's not on. We need to have whiskey.
We need to celebrate.
</font>

312
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,779
<font size="60">What happened?
</font>

313
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:25,604
<font size="60">Prachi, I am not happy
with the evaluation.
</font>

314
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,239
<font size="60">I mean, look at our turnaround.
</font>

315
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,451
<font size="60">We finished two years
of work in two months.
</font>

316
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,113
<font size="60">Naveen. Naveen. Naveen.
</font>

317
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,303
<font size="60">Don't get in the valuation game yet.
</font>

318
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,826
<font size="60">You just got on track.
</font>

319
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:40,219
<font size="60">This is not the time
to think about valuation.
</font>

320
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,506
<font size="60">It's not important right now.
</font>

321
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:44,323
<font size="60">It might not be important for you,
but it's very important for Pragati.
</font>

322
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,796
<font size="60">First of all,
it's very important for me.
</font>

323
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:50,774
<font size="60">And secondly,
we're an early-stage funders.
</font>

324
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,766
<font size="60">We don't sign big cheques.
</font>

325
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,736
<font size="60">This is the first time we're
getting into the series-A round. Right?
</font>

326
00:15:55,816 --> 00:16:00,064
<font size="60">So if this is happening,
trust me, I know this is very-very good.
</font>

327
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,912
<font size="60">We must sign on this
and move on from here.
</font>

328
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,223
<font size="60">This will help us stabilise the ship.
</font>

329
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,612
<font size="60">It will help both of us level up.
</font>

330
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,771
<font size="60">No, it's a level-up just for you.
</font>

331
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,689
<font size="60">You will grow, and your firm will grow.
</font>

332
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,645
<font size="60">They will make you the partner.
</font>

333
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,277
<font size="60">This is not a level-up for me.
</font>

334
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,760
<font size="60">Sooner or later even
we'll need bigger funds.
</font>

335
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,139
<font size="60">Even we need bigger cheques.
</font>

336
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,359
<font size="60">Okay, Naveen. Wait a minute.
</font>

337
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:22,849
<font size="60">After increasing the valuation,
</font>

338
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,089
<font size="60">the pressure to perform
will be more on who?
</font>

339
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:27,267
<font size="60">On you? Right.
</font>

340
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,700
<font size="60">And if I become a partner,
who will benefit from it?
</font>

341
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:30,977
<font size="60">You will.
</font>

342
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,656
<font size="60">I'll be in a position of power,
to standup for Pragati.
</font>

343
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,764
<font size="60">For you. Right?
</font>

344
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:40,179
<font size="60">I think this is the wisest
thing we can do right now.
</font>

345
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,524
<font size="60">-Yeah?
-Okay... let's not even talk about it.
</font>

346
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,480
<font size="60">You... forget about it.
</font>

347
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:53,233
<font size="60">Take your time. Think over it.
Calmly and take a call.
</font>

348
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,020
<font size="60">I know the next time I meet you,
</font>

349
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,097
<font size="60">you would have taken a
good decision for both of us.
</font>

350
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,729
<font size="60">And then it will be my treat.
</font>

351
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:02,091
<font size="60">-Okay.
-Okay.
</font>

352
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,469
<font size="60">-You're good.
-I am good.
</font>

353
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:04,898
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

354
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:06,682
<font size="60">Take care.
</font>

355
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:29,766
<font size="60">Yeah...
</font>

356
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,718
<font size="60">I am ready to meet
all the VCs I've to go to.
</font>

357
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,441
<font size="60">Set it up.
</font>

358
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,178
<font size="60">Use the term sheet like whiskey,
</font>

359
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:38,549
<font size="60">and see how high you go.
</font>

360
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,956
<font size="60">Go make it count.
</font>

361
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:50,965
<font size="60">Was the delivery okay?
</font>

362
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,331
<font size="60">-Is sister-in-law alright?
-Everyone is fine.
</font>

363
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:55,764
<font size="60">Just get well soon
and come see your niece.
</font>

364
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,125
<font size="60">-Yes.
-I saw that 'Rustomji' video.
</font>

365
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:00,061
<font size="60">-Rastogi.
-Yeah, that one.
</font>

366
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,723
<font size="60">He was selling it really aggressively.
</font>

367
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,223
<font size="60">Did you pay him?
</font>

368
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:05,807
<font size="60">That's the job of marketing.
</font>

369
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:06,994
<font size="60">Work from the hospital?
</font>

370
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:10,065
<font size="60">-No, I am at the office now.
-Okay, continue working.
</font>

371
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,625
<font size="60">Yogi, there are a
couple of dues pending.
</font>

372
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,229
<font size="60">-Office supply.
-AC repair and...
</font>

373
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,044
<font size="60">I already told you about the tax dues.
</font>

374
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,235
<font size="60">We've to pay our vendors as well.
</font>

375
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,516
<font size="60">HR was telling me if we could
have a meeting with you three,
</font>

376
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:25,743
<font size="60">that would be good.
</font>

377
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,324
<font size="60">-All three?
-Yes.
</font>

378
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,939
<font size="60">Mandal is still working in marketing.
</font>

379
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,617
<font size="60">And Naveen is busy with funding.
</font>

380
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,378
<font size="60">So we cannot trouble him.
</font>

381
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,406
<font size="60">Tell Hina we'll have a meeting.
Let's do it together.
</font>

382
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,630
<font size="60">-Okay?
-Okay.
</font>

383
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,181
<font size="60">Bro... how soon can
we close the funding?
</font>

384
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,750
<font size="60">I wanted to talk about my increment.
I am shifting home.
</font>

385
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,169
<font size="60">It's on track. The funding is on track.
</font>

386
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:49,676
<font size="60">After that everyone will get appraisal,
bonus, and Goa offsite.
</font>

387
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:51,652
<font size="60">-Goa offsite?
-Yes, of course.
</font>

388
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:54,131
<font size="60">A couple of guys were asking, so I
thought I should talk to you. Otherwise...
</font>

389
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,860
<font size="60">Let's all sit together and discuss this.
</font>

390
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,234
<font size="60">Okay. I'll solve this.
</font>

391
00:18:58,314 --> 00:18:59,184
<font size="60">-Okay?
-Yogi.
</font>

392
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,560
<font size="60">What?
</font>

393
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,857
<font size="60">We need to talk.
</font>

394
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:04,755
<font size="60">Yes.
</font>

395
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:06,608
<font size="60">Can we go someplace else?
</font>

396
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:08,833
<font size="60">Come.
</font>

397
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:14,492
<font size="60">What is it, Chintu?
</font>

398
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,330
<font size="60">I didn't say it publicly.
</font>

399
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:20,735
<font size="60">But good work. You did a good job.
</font>

400
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:22,043
<font size="60">Thanks.
</font>

401
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,594
<font size="60">Speaking of which I wanted to ask,
what is your percentage of equity.
</font>

402
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,426
<font size="60">What?
</font>

403
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:29,566
<font size="60">Don't get me wrong.
</font>

404
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,853
<font size="60">Actually, I am still discussing
my equity with Naveen.
</font>

405
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:38,235
<font size="60">And...although I made the entire
product, but you are my co-founder.
</font>

406
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:40,900
<font size="60">I don't want you to
get a lower equity than me.
</font>

407
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,400
<font size="60">You know.
</font>

408
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:45,400
<font size="60">I mean even if Naveen asks me,
I will say no.
</font>

409
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,715
<font size="60">I mean...despite our contribution,
</font>

410
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:52,648
<font size="60">I think we should get equal.
</font>

411
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:56,682
<font size="60">And...we can think about Mandal's share.
</font>

412
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:01,637
<font size="60">I know it's confidential
information, but...
</font>

413
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:03,552
<font size="60">Just like privacy...
</font>

414
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,600
<font size="60">Confidentiality is also a myth.
</font>

415
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:07,789
<font size="60">So...
</font>

416
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:12,421
<font size="60">Asshole, we'll adjust that
'sattu' that you drink all day.
</font>

417
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:14,985
<font size="60">Ass...
</font>

418
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,137
<font size="60">Freakin' 21 but still no change.
</font>

419
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:29,959
<font size="60">Yeah, Naveen.
</font>

420
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,294
<font size="60">Do you and Mandal have your suits ready?
</font>

421
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:33,113
<font size="60">Suit?
</font>

422
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:35,481
<font size="60">I don't know. Mandal gets dry-cleaned.
</font>

423
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:36,884
<font size="60">-Why?
-Get ready.
</font>

424
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,749
<font size="60">We are setting out to pitch.
</font>

425
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,503
<font size="60">Great.
</font>

426
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:46,883
<font size="60">"I need a dollar,
dollar a dollar is what I need"
</font>

427
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:47,843
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

428
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:51,908
<font size="60">"I need a dollar,
dollar a dollar is what I need"
</font>

429
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:52,638
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

430
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:57,003
<font size="60">"I said I need dollar dollar,
a dollar is what I need"
</font>

431
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:02,548
<font size="60">"If I share with you my story
would you share your dollar with me"
</font>

432
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,119
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

433
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,064
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

434
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,739
<font size="60">So apart from excellent retention,
</font>

435
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,770
<font size="60">our other user matrix
are also getting by the minute.
</font>

436
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:24,232
<font size="60">And, you know, we feel,
</font>

437
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:27,486
<font size="60">as we plan to grow and
scale up in our next phase,
</font>

438
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,310
<font size="60">we could use someone like you.
</font>

439
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,262
<font size="60">Yes.
</font>

440
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,056
<font size="60">So, what do you think, Ashutosh sir?
</font>

441
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:33,971
<font size="60">Please, call me Ashu.
</font>

442
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:35,431
<font size="60">That's what Bhaati calls me.
</font>

443
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,505
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

444
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,113
<font size="60">And I've been looking to invest
in your sector for a long time now.
</font>

445
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,917
<font size="60">I did take a look at the matrix before,
</font>

446
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,843
<font size="60">but I wanted to meet
you guys personally.
</font>

447
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,746
<font size="60">It's a shame your CTO couldn't make it.
</font>

448
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:51,171
<font size="60">You know how these tech guys are.
</font>

449
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,867
<font size="60">Their job isn't done even
after the product is launched.
</font>

450
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:00,233
<font size="60">So Naveen,
this is what I can offer you right now.
</font>

451
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:07,550
<font size="60">Actually, I already have
an offer with this same valuation.
</font>

452
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,237
<font size="60">-Ohh...you do.
-Yes.
</font>

453
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:11,979
<font size="60">Yeah, like discussions
are still ongoing.
</font>

454
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,577
<font size="60">I feel the final
offer will be much more.
</font>

455
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:17,810
<font size="60">-Seriously?
-Yeah.
</font>

456
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,283
<font size="60">I mean I have the term sheet,
if you want I can show you.
</font>

457
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:21,560
<font size="60">No, that's fine.
</font>

458
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:24,702
<font size="60">Bhaati trusts you, so okay.
</font>

459
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:34,351
<font size="60">This... This looks fine, I think.
</font>

460
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:36,053
<font size="60">Okay?
</font>

461
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,000
<font size="60">Yeah.
</font>

462
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,993
<font size="60">-Okay.
-It's fine?
</font>

463
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,220
<font size="60">-Yeah.
-Sure?
</font>

464
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,319
<font size="60">-Great.
-Thank you.
</font>

465
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:45,765
<font size="60">So... anything? Tea, soft drinks.
</font>

466
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:47,800
<font size="60">The money.
</font>

467
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:52,811
<font size="60">Naveen. Only you are
capable of doing this.
</font>

468
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,576
<font size="60">-That was quite a bluff.
-Yeah, I mean...
</font>

469
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:58,783
<font size="60">"...I reap what I don't sow"
</font>

470
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:03,395
<font size="60">"Well let me tell you something
all that glitters ain't gold"
</font>

471
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:04,249
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

472
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:08,373
<font size="60">"It's been a long old trouble
long old troublesome road"
</font>

473
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,472
<font size="60">I like the smell
you are wearing, Naveen.
</font>

474
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:12,730
<font size="60">Thank you.
</font>

475
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,565
<font size="60">See, Naveen, the valuation
you are asking for, is a bit too much.
</font>

476
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:22,814
<font size="60">I don't know how long
will your business will last.
</font>

477
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:26,114
<font size="60">According to research from
the Rockerfella University of New York,
</font>

478
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:30,280
<font size="60">humans retain the memory
of 1% of what they touch.
</font>

479
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,801
<font size="60">2% of what they hear,
</font>

480
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:34,771
<font size="60">5% of what they see, but...
</font>

481
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:38,615
<font size="60">35% of what they smell.
</font>

482
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,317
<font size="60">Interesting.
</font>

483
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:43,058
<font size="60">Sir, great business
ideas are like fragrances.
</font>

484
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:44,056
<font size="60">They stay.
</font>

485
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:47,113
<font size="60">Similarly,
sir, our business idea and its impact,
</font>

486
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:49,011
<font size="60">is going to stay in each user's memory.
</font>

487
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:50,851
<font size="60">That much I can guarantee you.
</font>

488
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:56,600
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

489
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:59,527
<font size="60">Everyone keeps on saying, go-big.
</font>

490
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,373
<font size="60">But I say... go-bigger.
</font>

491
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,376
<font size="60">If you want to expand or scale up,
</font>

492
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:06,735
<font size="60">I will help you.
I am on board.
</font>

493
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:14,748
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

494
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,775
<font size="60">"I need a dollar..."
</font>

495
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,804
<font size="60">-Are you fucking blind?
-Sorry, sorry.
</font>

496
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,128
<font size="60">Sorry.
</font>

497
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,436
<font size="60">So, guys, I'll send you the mail.
</font>

498
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:29,728
<font size="60">You know, I always wanted
to work with you guys.
</font>

499
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:33,611
<font size="60">Because your idea and product
are quite relatable to me.
</font>

500
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:36,424
<font size="60">And this pivot is a great move.
</font>

501
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:40,187
<font size="60">And, as we speak, our marketing
team is pushing really hard,
</font>

502
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,597
<font size="60">to make these numbers better.
</font>

503
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,395
<font size="60">Pramod, I am so sorry,
I think I'll have to take this.
</font>

504
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:46,217
<font size="60">-Oh yes.
-I'll get back.
</font>

505
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,906
<font size="60">Sorry, who is this?
</font>

506
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,383
<font size="60">Infinity Capital, six million.
</font>

507
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:54,682
<font size="60">And at what valuation?
</font>

508
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,631
<font size="60">If we want to meet,
you have to tell me the valuation.
</font>

509
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,505
<font size="60">"Hey hey!"
</font>

510
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:14,198
<font size="60">Bro...
</font>

511
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,847
<font size="60">-You nailed it.
-He agreed.
</font>

512
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:18,584
<font size="60">-Touchwood.
-I told you.
</font>

513
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,925
<font size="60">Use the Helvetica bold
and the pitch gets bold too.
</font>

514
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:23,550
<font size="60">Yeah, all this is happening
because of your suggestion.
</font>

515
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,294
<font size="60">Any word from Prachi?
</font>

516
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,690
<font size="60">No, let's not wait for her.
</font>

517
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,349
<font size="60">I just saw the bank statement.
We have money for only 15 days.
</font>

518
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,010
<font size="60">Let's decide and close the round.
</font>

519
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,875
<font size="60">Don't stress so much, Mandal.
</font>

520
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:38,024
<font size="60">For the first time in
life even we have options.
</font>

521
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:40,284
<font size="60">Let's choose one of these offers, but...
</font>

522
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:42,007
<font size="60">-Yeah...
-But don't stress.
</font>

523
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,080
<font size="60">-Okay.
-Let's go to the office.
</font>

524
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,834
<font size="60">The king,
minister, and commander are out here,
</font>

525
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,973
<font size="60">the thief must be having a ball,
understood.
</font>

526
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:50,943
<font size="60">Who is the king?
You or me?
</font>

527
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:53,395
<font size="60">-I think it's me.
-Listen, Yogi.
</font>

528
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,750
<font size="60">God... again he gave a one-star.
</font>

529
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,367
<font size="60">He never wrote anything
nice about any of our updates.
</font>

530
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:02,688
<font size="60">He's the KRK of the play store.
</font>

531
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,486
<font size="60">Let's talk to Appu, she will fix this.
</font>

532
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,073
<font size="60">Come on.
</font>

533
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:12,621
<font size="60">What are you doing?
</font>

534
00:26:13,514 --> 00:26:14,553
<font size="60">Appu.
</font>

535
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,745
<font size="60">-Some pages are loading slowly.
-Yeah.
</font>

536
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:19,671
<font size="60">Keeps loading forever.
</font>

537
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:21,153
<font size="60">Just fix this.
</font>

538
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:24,345
<font size="60">That's an issue from the front end.
I'll tell Dungeon.
</font>

539
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:28,817
<font size="60">Move. Move. I'm throwing grenade.
</font>

540
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,136
<font size="60">Move.
</font>

541
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,288
<font size="60">Hello, some pages...
</font>

542
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:40,056
<font size="60">Some pages are loading slowly,
</font>

543
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:41,831
<font size="60">can you just patch
it up at the front end?
</font>

544
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,504
<font size="60">I can, but I won't.
</font>

545
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:49,956
<font size="60">Please do it.
</font>

546
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:52,730
<font size="60">We're getting negative
reviews on the play store.
</font>

547

-EOD will be late.
</font>

548
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,549
<font size="60">EOD...end of discussion.
Stab him. Stab him.
</font>

549
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:03,993
<font size="60">What?
</font>

550
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,112
<font size="60">Why won't you do it?
</font>

551
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:06,320
<font size="60">It's your job.
</font>

552
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,857
<font size="60">It's my job to tell
you what everyone's job is.
</font>

553
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,480
<font size="60">You may be the CTO,
</font>

554
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:12,936
<font size="60">but I am with this company
since the early days.
</font>

555
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:16,114
<font size="60">So you won't know, but I
know how much is at stake right now.
</font>

556
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:18,296
<font size="60">And I am with this company
before it was a company.
</font>

557
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,669
<font size="60">You are right, there's a lot at stake.
</font>

558
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,758
<font size="60">But what about my stakes.
</font>

559
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:26,356
<font size="60">No one's talking about that.
</font>

560
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:29,412
<font size="60">You know, these guys...
</font>

561
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,828
<font size="60">These guys may be the stakeholders,
</font>

562
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:34,325
<font size="60">but you and me, we are the showrunners.
</font>

563
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,928
<font size="60">And if you can't see the
pride and respect in that...
</font>

564
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:37,917
<font size="60">What are you doing?
</font>

565
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,474
<font size="60">If you can't see the
pride and respect in that,
</font>

566
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,063
<font size="60">then maybe you are fucking blind.
</font>

567
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,181
<font size="60">Killed him.
</font>

568
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:45,943
<font size="60">I am not blind, Appu.
</font>

569
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:47,970
<font size="60">I can see everything.
</font>

570
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:51,536
<font size="60">How Naveen calls this product
'my baby' in front of everyone.
</font>

571
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:54,368
<font size="60">We made this product.
</font>

572
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:55,803
<font size="60">It's our baby.
</font>

573
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:57,644
<font size="60">You don't have to be the babysitter.
</font>

574
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,550
<font size="60">Come play CS with me.
</font>

575
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:01,058
<font size="60">Maybe you will know then,
</font>

576
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:03,766
<font size="60">when you have to storm the front,
and when you have to fall back.
</font>

577
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,563
<font size="60">Take him. Kill him. Kill all three.
</font>

578
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,230
<font size="60">Yes! Eat shit, bitch.
Not you, sorry.
</font>

579
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,750
<font size="60">I played a lot of CS in college.
</font>

580
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,428
<font size="60">But then I grew up.
</font>

581
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:18,761
<font size="60">And my favourite radio
command still is...
</font>

582
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,315
<font size="60">Stick Together Team!
</font>

583
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,266
<font size="60">I don't need a team.
</font>

584
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:26,650
<font size="60">The team needs me.
</font>

585
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:28,960
<font size="60">Because I am the fucking MVP.
</font>

586
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,568
<font size="60">So, if you will excuse me,
</font>

587
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:35,146
<font size="60">my team needs me for the second round.
</font>

588
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:38,374
<font size="60">Listen, dear.
</font>

589
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,495
<font size="60">I came here because the
front end is your domain.
</font>

590
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:45,217
<font size="60">But guess what,
when you became Pragati's MVP,
</font>

591
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,057
<font size="60">there were two coders.
</font>

592
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,968
<font size="60">And you were busy eating
fritters in the college canteen.
</font>

593
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:55,392
<font size="60">So when it comes to our product,
I can get it done with or without you.
</font>

594
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,756
<font size="60">And if you can find the time,
here's another game you can play.
</font>

595
00:28:58,951 --> 00:28:59,818
<font size="60">Call of Duty.
</font>

596
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:01,553
<font size="60">Maybe you'll learn something from it.
</font>

597
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,545
<font size="60">Does anyone want to play Call of Duty?
</font>

598
00:29:18,863 --> 00:29:21,595
<font size="60">I thought you wanted
to meet for a cup of coffee.
</font>

599
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,987
<font size="60">You ordered dinner.
</font>

600
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,025
<font size="60">Yeah, I thought you would be hungry.
</font>

601
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,535
<font size="60">Yeah, but,
how are we going to eat all this.
</font>

602
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:34,479
<font size="60">It's okay,
you're not supposed to eat all of it.
</font>

603
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,286
<font size="60">What's that? I didn't get it.
</font>

604
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,168
<font size="60">Don't worry, you will.
</font>

605
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,408
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

606
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,484
<font size="60">Go for it.
</font>

607
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,067
<font size="60">-Last time that we met...
-Yeah.
</font>

608
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:59,444
<font size="60">I had said that the next time we meet,
</font>

609
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:03,255
<font size="60">we'll sign the term sheet,
and it will be my treat, right.
</font>

610
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,803
<font size="60">So let's sign it.
</font>

611
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:08,970
<font size="60">Yeah, let's wait.
</font>

612
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:11,840
<font size="60">Naveen, it's been a week.
</font>

613
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:18,577
<font size="60">Yeah, I know...but I just
need a little more time to...
</font>

614
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:20,199
<font size="60">You know...
</font>

615
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:21,772
<font size="60">Shop around?
</font>

616
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:29,142
<font size="60">What did you think, Naveen?
</font>

617
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:30,772
<font size="60">I wouldn't know.
</font>

618
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,363
<font size="60">The world of VCs is too small.
</font>

619
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,347
<font size="60">And not all VCs are sharks.
</font>

620
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:38,928
<font size="60">Most of them are like sheep.
</font>

621
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,477
<font size="60">They walk in a line.
</font>

622
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:42,901
<font size="60">They all follow where one goes.
</font>

623
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:46,793
<font size="60">Other VCs are giving
me updates on Pragati's deal.
</font>

624
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,712
<font size="60">Have you thought of
how that makes me look?
</font>

625
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,333
<font size="60">You think it's fair.
</font>

626
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:54,365
<font size="60">You take an offer from me,
and on the basis of my deal,
</font>

627
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:55,873
<font size="60">you're looking for a better deal.
</font>

628
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,651
<font size="60">Prachi, tell me something.
</font>

629
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:03,073
<font size="60">If Pragati's valuation grows,
</font>

630
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,673
<font size="60">won't that increase the
equity of Plutus as well?
</font>

631
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:10,111
<font size="60">So at the end of the day,
I am just making you more money.
</font>

632
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,714
<font size="60">So if anything,
I think you should be grateful to me.
</font>

633
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,189
<font size="60">Yeah, grateful. Like last time.
</font>

634
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,013
<font size="60">Remember what happened
in the KC partnership.
</font>

635
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:17,229
<font size="60">Yeah, how can I forget that?
</font>

636
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:20,107
<font size="60">I kept begging you for two million.
</font>

637
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:21,761
<font size="60">And Mehta swooped away KC.
</font>

638
00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:23,829
<font size="60">So you are blaming me for your fuckup.
</font>

639
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:25,240
<font size="60">I am not blaming you for anything.
</font>

640
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:27,963
<font size="60">I am just doing what's
right for my company.
</font>

641
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,380
<font size="60">But you...only care about
your deal and your fucking growth.
</font>

642
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:35,723
<font size="60">My growth...
</font>

643
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:37,620
<font size="60">Here you go.
</font>

644
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:41,991
<font size="60">My growth?
</font>

645
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,718
<font size="60">If I cared about my growth,
</font>

646
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,564
<font size="60">I would have left Pragati
a long time again.
</font>

647
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:48,858
<font size="60">I any way get told at Plutus
that Pragati is a sinking ship.
</font>

648
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:50,116
<font size="60">You are wasting your time.
</font>

649
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:51,713
<font size="60">I don't think I am
wasting my time, but...
</font>

650
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:53,748
<font size="60">Unfair.
</font>

651
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:56,424
<font size="60">You know, you can still get out.
</font>

652
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,480
<font size="60">And I know if Pragati
shuts down tomorrow,
</font>

653
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:03,915
<font size="60">it won't make a difference to you.
</font>

654
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:06,267
<font size="60">Because we are not the biggest name.
</font>

655
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,172
<font size="60">We are just another
name in your portfolio.
</font>

656
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:10,328
<font size="60">But we have only one Pragati.
</font>

657
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,063
<font size="60">We are not that privileged.
</font>

658
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:15,290
<font size="60">Naveen, my name is Prachi Meena.
</font>

659
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,587
<font size="60">Trust me. I know a couple
of things about not being privileged.
</font>

660
00:32:19,782 --> 00:32:21,687
<font size="60">I know what Pragati
is and I know what you are.
</font>

661
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,771
<font size="60">You know what we are,
but I know what we can be.
</font>

662
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:24,671
<font size="60">-Do you?
-Yes.
</font>

663
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,122
<font size="60">What do you...
What do you know?
</font>

664
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:29,455
<font size="60">I feel I am the only one holding
on to the vision of this company,
</font>

665
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:31,481
<font size="60">where you started this journey.
</font>

666
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:33,517
<font size="60">I am the only one holding
on to that vision.
</font>

667
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,000
<font size="60">What are you doing?
</font>

668
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,785
<font size="60">You've derailed yourself completely.
</font>

669
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:39,582
<font size="60">Instead of value creation,
you are running after valuation.
</font>

670
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:42,638
<font size="60">And you know how risky the valuation
game is at this point for you.
</font>

671
00:32:42,718 --> 00:32:43,537
<font size="60">You are just...
</font>

672
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:48,289
<font size="60">Look, it's okay. It's your journey,
you do whatever you want to do.
</font>

673
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:52,213
<font size="60">But all I want to tell you is,
I am still on your side.
</font>

674
00:32:53,065 --> 00:32:55,367
<font size="60">I am still on your side, Naveen.
</font>

675
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:59,494
<font size="60">You want to walk,
you want to run, you want to sprint.
</font>

676
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:00,865
<font size="60">Do what you want to do.
</font>

677
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:04,311
<font size="60">I am just going to make
sure that you don't fall.
</font>

678
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,741
<font size="60">I don't want to run, Prachi.
I want to fly.
</font>

679
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:10,651
<font size="60">And you are just holding me back.
</font>

680
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,322
<font size="60">-I am not holding...
-No, you are.
</font>

681
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:13,805
<font size="60">-I am not holding you back.
-You are.
</font>

682
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,197
<font size="60">I am just trying to keep you grounded.
</font>

683
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:19,344
<font size="60">If you can't tell the difference between
the two, it's your fucking fault.
</font>

684
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:20,738
<font size="60">Yeah, no, no, it's never your fault.
</font>

685
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,725
<font size="60">Mehta had backing from his investors,
</font>

686
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,557
<font size="60">so he must have given
a cheque to Mehta right there.
</font>

687
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:27,047
<font size="60">But all we could offer
was a fake promise.
</font>

688
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:28,279
<font size="60">But no, it's never your fault.
</font>

689
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,047
<font size="60">Every time we come to you for support,
</font>

690
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:32,131
<font size="60">why do you make it
an obstacle race for us?
</font>

691
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,050
<font size="60">Why do we have to deal with this
fucking nonsense bullshit all the time?
</font>

692
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:36,380
<font size="60">There are other fund managers.
</font>

693
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,000
<font size="60">They sell their portfolio companies
extensively. They pitch for it.
</font>

694
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,930
<font size="60">They fucking put their skin in the game.
</font>

695
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,454
<font size="60">You just say that you are on our side.
</font>

696
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,173
<font size="60">But where are you?
You stand on the sidelines.
</font>

697
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:45,146
<font size="60">You are sitting there.
</font>

698
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:48,494
<font size="60">If you don't want to
get on the playing field,
</font>

699
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:50,943
<font size="60">then sit outside and
give your commentary.
</font>

700
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:53,505
<font size="60">Because I've no interest in
sitting here and hearing your bullshit.
</font>

701
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:01,256
<font size="60">Excuse me, give him the bill.
</font>

702
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,324
<font size="60">Why? Wasn't this your treat?
</font>

703
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:04,800
<font size="60">It's good to have hunger.
</font>

704
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,302
<font size="60">But if you don't know your limit,
then you have to pay for it.
</font>

705
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:21,696
<font size="60">Cheque, sir.
</font>

706
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:26,662
<font size="60">Can you write down my phone number?
I don't have it right now.
</font>

707
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:28,020
<font size="60">Can I pay for it later?
</font>

708
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:31,640
<font size="60">Add some sauce please.
</font>

709
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,569
<font size="60">Yes, it's done. It's done.
</font>

710
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:38,729
<font size="60">Why go to an expensive restaurant
when he doesn't have money?
</font>

711
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:41,441
<font size="60">Must be meeting some
potential investors.
</font>

712
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:44,152
<font size="60">You got to lay the
cheese for the mouse.
</font>

713
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,059
<font size="60">The bill is 12,500.
</font>

714
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,237
<font size="60">Our entire office can
drink tea for a month.
</font>

715
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:50,863
<font size="60">12,500
</font>

716
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:53,197
<font size="60">Switch to green tea from tomorrow.
</font>

717
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:54,971
<font size="60">We'll say it's health awareness month.
</font>

718
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,091
<font size="60">Nancy wants her salary.
It's her wedding.
</font>

719
00:34:58,572 --> 00:35:00,220
<font size="60">Hina needs her reimbursements.
</font>

720
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:02,190
<font size="60">He should have closed
the round by now.
</font>

721
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,524
<font size="60">What is Naveen doing?
</font>

722
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,613
<font size="60">Why are you stressed?
</font>

723
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:07,716
<font size="60">We'll get doughnuts for the team,
they will be okay.
</font>

724
00:35:08,195 --> 00:35:08,792
<font size="60">What...
</font>

725
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:12,027
<font size="60">Do you remember when you
last disagreed with Naveen?
</font>

726
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:14,801
<font size="60">I am agreeing with you.
</font>

727
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,929
<font size="60">Bro, make your special coffee for him.
</font>

728
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,320
<font size="60">The best.
Neither hot nor cold.
</font>

729
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,296
<font size="60">Room temperature coffee.
</font>

730
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:22,957
<font size="60">This vada-pav isn't even hot.
</font>

731
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:26,796
<font size="60">Come on, give me the coffee.
Give me something hot.
</font>

732
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,978
<font size="60">Tastes like a mixture
of tea and coffee.
</font>

733
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:36,245
<font size="60">He makes tea in the
morning in the same vessel.
</font>

734
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,873
<font size="60">I am telling you.
Mom told me this.
</font>

735
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:41,221
<font size="60">There's no difference between
broccoli and cauliflower.
</font>

736
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:42,354
<font size="60">Mark my words.
</font>

737
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,443
<font size="60">Cauliflower is going
to be the next superfood.
</font>

738
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:45,960
<font size="60">I am telling you. Cheers.
</font>

739
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,860
<font size="60">Cheers.
</font>

740
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:50,289
<font size="60">Bro, we're all out of gobi Manchurian.
</font>

741
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:55,856
<font size="60">Why does Bhaati call these
small leaguers to the party?
</font>

742
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,351
<font size="60">They kill the entire vibe.
</font>

743
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,099
<font size="60">He just acquired them.
</font>

744
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,878
<font size="60">By the way, 7th drink.
</font>

745
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:02,971
<font size="60">9th.
</font>

746
00:36:03,668 --> 00:36:05,392
<font size="60">Valuation 200 million.
</font>

747
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:06,478
<font size="60">250
</font>

748
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:08,232
<font size="60">Saif just invited me to lunch.
</font>

749
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:10,327
<font size="60">Bachchan sir invited me to Jalsa.
</font>

750
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:11,956
<font size="60">Saif Partners.
</font>

751
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,240
<font size="60">Please get my intro with him.
</font>

752
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,578
<font size="60">Listen, please...
</font>

753
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:18,441
<font size="60">Bhaati, get me a drink, man...
</font>

754
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:26,184
<font size="60">Bhaati?
</font>

755
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:31,977
<font size="60">Take him away. Come on.
</font>

756
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:46,344
<font size="60">He made a bet.
</font>

757
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:48,489
<font size="60">And after that he resigned.
</font>

758
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:50,899
<font size="60">How are you, bro?
</font>

759
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:52,254
<font size="60">I am great, Bhaati.
</font>

760
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,613
<font size="60">Why are you sulking?
</font>

761
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,432
<font size="60">No, it's just Plutus
nagging on my back.
</font>

762
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:02,120
<font size="60">Come on, let's play poker.
I'll show you.
</font>

763
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,699
<font size="60">I don't know how to, Bhaati.
</font>

764
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:05,687
<font size="60">I played only a couple of times.
</font>

765
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,738
<font size="60">It's not a big deal.
</font>

766
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,374
<font size="60">I don't have money either.
</font>

767
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:10,079
<font size="60">I will bankroll you.
</font>

768
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,112
<font size="60">Win or loss, all mine. Come on.
</font>

769
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,412
<font size="60">That's enough, Mehta.
Leave some for me as well.
</font>

770
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,176
<font size="60">Bhaati, it's a game of skill.
</font>

771
00:37:19,342 --> 00:37:21,833
<font size="60">If there is anyone more
skillful than me, he will beat me.
</font>

772
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,203
<font size="60">Okay, guys, this is Naveen.
</font>

773
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,383
<font size="60">He just had a fight with his investor.
</font>

774
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:29,867
<font size="60">We got to fix the boy's mood.
He will play poker with us.
</font>

775
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,333
<font size="60">Naveen, that's Prabhas.
</font>

776
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:33,263
<font size="60">That's Dolly,
founder of the D2C brand.
</font>

777
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:34,543
<font size="60">Recently turned Unicorn.
</font>

778
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,134
<font size="60">Play amongst yourselves.
</font>

779
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:38,207
<font size="60">Harish.
</font>

780
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,469
<font size="60">Hi.
</font>

781
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,507
<font size="60">If you don't have a
fight with your investors,
</font>

782
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:41,614
<font size="60">then you're not running a startup.
</font>

783
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:42,614
<font size="60">Come on.
</font>

784
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,609
<font size="60">Come on, deal the cards.
Sit down.
</font>

785
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:57,373
<font size="60">Guys, this is Kevin.
Michelin star chef.
</font>

786
00:37:57,982 --> 00:37:58,937
<font size="60">Do you guys want to order something?
</font>

787
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:00,655
<font size="60">Prawns, Sushi, bruschettas.
</font>

788
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:02,063
<font size="60">Cheese maggie for me.
</font>

789
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,592
<font size="60">And scrambled eggs for me.
</font>

790
00:38:06,557 --> 00:38:07,470
<font size="60">Scrambled eggs.
</font>

791
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:10,765
<font size="60">Come on.
</font>

792
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:11,996
<font size="60">Raise.
</font>

793
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:30,789
<font size="60">Raise.
</font>

794
00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:33,283
<font size="60">What the...
</font>

795
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,122
<font size="60">You are in the mood
to raise these days.
</font>

796
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:37,443
<font size="60">I've been doing it for 10 days.
</font>

797
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,038
<font size="60">There are other players here.
</font>

798
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:41,432
<font size="60">But I am looking to
take only one guy down.
</font>

799
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:42,943
<font size="60">He took my KC deal.
</font>

800
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:46,781
<font size="60">God, it's not my fault if
you couldn't please your partner?
</font>

801
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,929
<font size="60">And don't take it personally, brother.
It's just business.
</font>

802
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:51,742
<font size="60">There are ups and downs like poker.
</font>

803
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,323
<font size="60">-But, Mr. Mehta--
-Don't fuck the mood.
</font>

804
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,474
<font size="60">You are at Bhaati's party.
</font>

805
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,619
<font size="60">Kids make startups
just to be here someday.
</font>

806
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:01,123
<font size="60">Just talk about the future here.
</font>

807
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:06,415
<font size="60">So... how high did you go?
</font>

808
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,898
<font size="60">If I show you the list of VCs,
</font>

809
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:11,120
<font size="60">you'll be shit-scared.
</font>

810
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:13,015
<font size="60">I see.
</font>

811
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:14,177
<font size="60">Who's on the list?
</font>

812
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,560
<font size="60">I won't show you my hand.
</font>

813
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,950
<font size="60">Someone else will take the cake.
</font>

814
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:20,902
<font size="60">Right, Prabhas.
</font>

815
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:24,486
<font size="60">You approached KC after reading
my Twitter thread, didn't you?
</font>

816
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,282
<font size="60">You want a ready pitch.
</font>

817
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:29,226
<font size="60">KC is the guy who
showed up the other day?
</font>

818
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:30,534
<font size="60">Yes, that same uncle.
</font>

819
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:32,056
<font size="60">You are safe. He's a moron.
</font>

820
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,537
<font size="60">Look, guys.
</font>

821
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:37,620
<font size="60">Poker is a zero sum game.
</font>

822
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,785
<font size="60">Someone's win is another's loss.
</font>

823
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,892
<font size="60">But... in business,
</font>

824
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:44,808
<font size="60">we can always have a win-win.
</font>

825
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,897
<font size="60">There is a lot of space in the market.
There's a lot of money.
</font>

826
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,462
<font size="60">If you play nice,
</font>

827
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:50,807
<font size="60">you can be Swiggy,
Zomato of your sector.
</font>

828
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:54,082
<font size="60">Hopefully, we can
deliver for each other.
</font>

829
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:56,615
<font size="60">We can be Ola and Uber as well.
</font>

830
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:58,736
<font size="60">If we can ride on
each other's success.
</font>

831
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:02,755
<font size="60">-See...
-Good shot.
</font>

832
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:08,386
<font size="60">Come on.
</font>

833
00:40:39,012 --> 00:40:40,861
<font size="60">It's called all in, right?
</font>

834
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:42,657
<font size="60">Right?
</font>

835
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:45,223
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

836
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,091
<font size="60">-All in.
-No.
</font>

837
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,775
<font size="60">Remember his story?
</font>

838
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:03,522
<font size="60">Fold. I am off.
</font>

839
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,947
<font size="60">Same. Fold.
</font>

840
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,312
<font size="60">Mehta.
</font>

841
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:16,446
<font size="60">I got to admit, man.
</font>

842
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:19,345
<font size="60">He's got fucking balls.
Respect, brother.
</font>

843
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,206
<font size="60">Not everyone has the
balls to take such a risk.
</font>

844
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:34,539
<font size="60">Chuck all.
</font>

845
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:47,207
<font size="60">Bhaati. Let it go.
</font>

846
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,151
<font size="60">You had one drink too many already.
</font>

847
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,441
<font size="60">You have to go all in.
</font>

848
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,748
<font size="60">Fucking 750,000 on
the table right now.
</font>

849
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:57,734
<font size="60">Hey Pablo Chekobar of Vikhroli.
</font>

850
00:41:58,184 --> 00:41:59,318
<font size="60">Call it a showdown.
</font>

851
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:01,567
<font size="60">Showdown!
</font>

852
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,256
<font size="60">What showdown? See.
</font>

853
00:42:05,344 --> 00:42:06,195
<font size="60">Full house.
</font>

854
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,717
<font size="60">-Nice hand.
-Congrats.
</font>

855
00:42:13,591 --> 00:42:14,635
<font size="60">-Naveen.
-Bhaati, man.
</font>

856
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,146
<font size="60">-What are you doing?
-Make a drink.
</font>

857
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,427
<font size="60">What are you waiting for?
</font>

858
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,857
<font size="60">Did you have anything
or did you just blow it away?
</font>

859
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:30,780
<font size="60">What did you think
before going all in?
</font>

860
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:33,277
<font size="60">This.
</font>

861
00:42:36,091 --> 00:42:37,184
<font size="60">Four of a kind.
</font>

862
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:38,969
<font size="60">Nice!
</font>

863
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:42,422
<font size="60">-Great.
-Beginner's luck.
</font>

864
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,636
<font size="60">What a great luck.
</font>

865
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:45,819
<font size="60">You had folded.
</font>

866
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:48,635
<font size="60">It was luck, Bhaati.
I was shit-scared.
</font>

867
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:50,635
<font size="60">If I had lost, how could
I have repaid 200,000?
</font>

868
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:52,932
<font size="60">You just raised 750,000.
</font>

869
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:55,243
<font size="60">Three times the money
in a little over an hour.
</font>

870
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,651
<font size="60">No start-up gives this
kind of profit these days.
</font>

871
00:42:58,197 --> 00:42:59,976
<font size="60">Profit is the reward of risk.
</font>

872
00:43:00,806 --> 00:43:02,286
<font size="60">And like poker...
</font>

873
00:43:03,395 --> 00:43:05,166
<font size="60">We can't win without
taking risks, right?
</font>

874
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,708
<font size="60">Right.
</font>

875
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:08,347
<font size="60">Nice hand, brother.
</font>

876
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:10,360
<font size="60">-Thank you.
-You two are learning.
</font>

877
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:13,787
<font size="60">To bring excitement
to the game and the sector.
</font>

878
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,445
<font size="60">Close your round quickly.
</font>

879
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:18,636
<font size="60">Buy a penthouse.
</font>

880
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:21,483
<font size="60">We'll have the next poker party at
your house, and we'll all come over.
</font>

881
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:23,983
<font size="60">-But Invite me.
-Sure.
</font>

882
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:24,989
<font size="60">Cheers.
</font>

883
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,553
<font size="60">-Sure. Sure.
-Cheers. Cheers.
</font>

884
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:28,723
<font size="60">-Cheers.
-Cheers.
</font>

885
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,176
<font size="60">I did not know you are from Delhi.
</font>

886
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:33,165
<font size="60">You are also from Delhi?
</font>

887
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:34,542
<font size="60">Yeah, Rajouri Garden.
</font>

888
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:36,279
<font size="60">-I am from Lajpat Nagar.
-Wow.
</font>

889
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,580
<font size="60">I miss Delhi food.
</font>

890
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,531
<font size="60">Then you must have tasted
Moolchand's parathas.
</font>

891
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:41,434
<font size="60">Don't remind me.
</font>

892
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:44,416
<font size="60">Crazy.
</font>

893
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,152
<font size="60">Naveen, regarding the term sheet.
</font>

894
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,491
<font size="60">It's a little dicey.
</font>

895
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:53,037
<font size="60">Ohh... what happened?
</font>

896
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:55,223
<font size="60">Okay, so honestly,
</font>

897
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:58,724
<font size="60">I think your CMO had
over-projected a few numbers,
</font>

898
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:00,377
<font size="60">like your engagement.
</font>

899
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:02,771
<font size="60">The time spent on the app is nice,
</font>

900
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,479
<font size="60">but the sample base is too small.
</font>

901
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,172
<font size="60">But you liked the user matrix.
</font>

902
00:44:08,252 --> 00:44:12,026
<font size="60">Yeah, but the growth
matrix is too bloated.
</font>

903
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:16,031
<font size="60">I don't think we
can achieve that much.
</font>

904
00:44:16,193 --> 00:44:19,051
<font size="60">We can't go that big right now, okay.
</font>

905
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,733
<font size="60">No, no, I think you
are right, actually.
</font>

906
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,715
<font size="60">I'll talk to the team
and we'll rework our numbers.
</font>

907
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:24,822
<font size="60">We'll represent everything.
</font>

908
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:25,867
<font size="60">So that's not a problem.
</font>

909
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:29,680
<font size="60">Yeah, but the investment committee.
</font>

910
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,734
<font size="60">They don't think it's the
right time to invest in your sector.
</font>

911
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:36,777
<font size="60">Okay.
</font>

912
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,289
<font size="60">Yeah, okay. Not a problem.
</font>

913
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:46,317
<font size="60">Thank you.
I mean, thank you for coming.
</font>

914
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,272
<font size="60">I didn't want to
do this over the phone.
</font>

915
00:44:50,548 --> 00:44:52,202
<font size="60">No, that's okay. Not a problem.
</font>

916
00:44:56,315 --> 00:44:57,422
<font size="60">Cool then, I'll take your leave.
</font>

917
00:44:57,502 --> 00:44:59,132
<font size="60">Sure. Sure. Thank you.
</font>

918
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:01,003
<font size="60">Okay, Shreya, thank you so much.
</font>

919
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:07,772
<font size="60">Mandal, we'll have to
rework on the engagement, bro.
</font>

920
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:23,226
<font size="60">Hello.
</font>

921
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:25,261
<font size="60">Hi, this is Naveen.
</font>

922
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,982
<font size="60">I am trying to call Mr. Ahuja,
but he isn't responding.
</font>

923
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:33,321
<font size="60">One second, he was supposed
to mail me the term sheet.
</font>

924
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:37,866
<font size="60">You didn't send me the term sheet.
</font>

925
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:42,962
<font size="60">But what exactly happened.
</font>

926
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:45,612
<font size="60">You were very happy at the meeting.
You felt it worked.
</font>

927
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:52,925
<font size="60">Why?
</font>

928
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:55,340
<font size="60">So how long do we have to wait?
</font>

929
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,380
<font size="60">But we spoke about today?
</font>

930
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,532
<font size="60">So, are you going
to mail it to me, or...
</font>

931
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:32,749
<font size="60">Ashu, what exactly...
</font>

932
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,375
<font size="60">Has anything gone wrong?
</font>

933
00:46:34,556 --> 00:46:35,957
<font size="60">Did something happen?
I am not getting it.
</font>

934
00:46:36,037 --> 00:46:37,016
<font size="60">What happened?
</font>

935
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:40,876
<font size="60">Naveen,
</font>

936
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:43,914
<font size="60">you know a term sheet
is a non-binding document.
</font>

937
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:44,952
<font size="60">Right?
</font>

938
00:46:45,798 --> 00:46:48,600
<font size="60">I can choose not to fund
you even after we sign a term sheet.
</font>

939
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:50,461
<font size="60">So...
</font>

940
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:53,035
<font size="60">maybe you're focusing
on the wrong piece of paper.
</font>

941
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,497
<font size="60">Sorry, what paper?
What are you talking about?
</font>

942
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:02,175
<font size="60">We shook hands.
And now you're backing out.
</font>

943
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:03,524
<font size="60">It's not fair.
</font>

944
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:07,426
<font size="60">Don't tell me what's fair.
</font>

945
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:11,224
<font size="60">You guys are not following
any compliances at Pragati.
</font>

946
00:47:12,352 --> 00:47:13,687
<font size="60">This is how you guys work?
</font>

947
00:47:14,344 --> 00:47:16,171
<font size="60">What compliances are we not following?
</font>

948
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:17,790
<font size="60">What are you saying?
</font>

949
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:21,394
<font size="60">Naveen,
</font>

950
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,210
<font size="60">my team did some digging,
</font>

951
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:27,588
<font size="60">and found out that your company
has a liability of three million.
</font>

952
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,033
<font size="60">And you haven't paid it for two years.
</font>

953
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:30,792
<font size="60">What?
</font>

954
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:31,851
<font size="60">Taxes are due.
</font>

955
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:33,061
<font size="60">And whatnot.
</font>

956
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:35,746
<font size="60">When there are such unethical
practices at Pragati,
</font>

957
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:36,971
<font size="60">so how can I trust you?
</font>

958
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:38,541
<font size="60">That you are running
the company properly.
</font>

959
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:43,743
<font size="60">Ashu, I think there has
been some miscommunication.
</font>

960
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:45,989
<font size="60">I don't think there
is anything like that.
</font>

961
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:47,827
<font size="60">I am not even aware
of what you are saying.
</font>

962
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,578
<font size="60">Ohh, that's perfect.
</font>

963
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:51,812
<font size="60">You are the company's CEO,
</font>

964
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:53,830
<font size="60">and you don't know what's
going on in your company.
</font>

965
00:47:57,248 --> 00:47:59,411
<font size="60">We can't be associated
with such actions.
</font>

966
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,258
<font size="60">Only because Bhaati recommended you,
</font>

967
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:02,744
<font size="60">otherwise we never would
have had this meeting.
</font>

968
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:03,682
<font size="60">Seriously never.
</font>

969
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:05,492
<font size="60">And nothing personal.
</font>

970
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:07,286
<font size="60">It's not going to work out.
</font>

971
00:48:07,524 --> 00:48:08,631
<font size="60">I am so sorry.
</font>

972
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:33,254
<font size="60">This is not done.
</font>

973
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:36,223
<font size="60">Hina still has one left.
Okay so we...
</font>

974
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:37,804
<font size="60">Pappi, come to my cabin.
</font>

975
00:48:38,226 --> 00:48:39,188
<font size="60">I'll tell you later.
</font>

976
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:40,855
<font size="60">He's just come to the office.
</font>

977
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:43,110
<font size="60">I'll talk to him.
</font>

978
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:45,822
<font size="60">Please, please,
I'll call you back.
</font>

979
00:48:48,977 --> 00:48:51,150
<font size="60">Naveen, Prachi sent a mail.
What is this?
</font>

980
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,893
<font size="60">-Wait a minute...
-We need to talk right now.
</font>

981
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:53,911
<font size="60">Naveen.
</font>

982
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:55,426
<font size="60">Are you deaf?
</font>

983
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,768
<font size="60">-I am calling you to my cabin.
-Sir, Jogi sir made me an employee.
</font>

984
00:48:58,921 --> 00:48:59,880
<font size="60">Take it.
</font>

985
00:49:00,864 --> 00:49:02,283
<font size="60">Leave this. Come to my cabin.
</font>

986
00:49:02,363 --> 00:49:03,666
<font size="60">Please have it. Please.
</font>

987
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:05,075
<font size="60">-Can't you hear?
-Sir, please have one.
</font>

988
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,469
<font size="60">I said I don't want it!
</font>

989
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,210
<font size="60">Leave it. Leave it.
</font>

990
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,188
<font size="60">Did you get a notice
from the tax department?
</font>

991
00:49:17,284 --> 00:49:18,158
<font size="60">Tax...
</font>

992
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:20,577
<font size="60">I got a notice for tax dues, sir.
</font>

993
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:25,025
<font size="60">Two notices for 250,000
each around a month ago.
</font>

994
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:27,156
<font size="60">-I told Yogi--
-What Yogi? What were you doing?
</font>

995
00:49:27,737 --> 00:49:29,737
<font size="60">Let's talk inside. Come on.
</font>

996
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:30,851
<font size="60">Naveen.
</font>

997
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:32,297
<font size="60">Wait a minute.
What's there to talk about now?
</font>

998
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,383
<font size="60">We lost all the offers we had.
</font>

999
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:38,542
<font size="60">Because this 500,000
</font>

1000
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:41,063
<font size="60">with interest and penalty
has escalated to three million!
</font>

1001
00:49:42,322 --> 00:49:43,948
<font size="60">Whose job was it to tell us?
</font>

1002
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:47,311
<font size="60">Is it our job or yours?
</font>

1003
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:48,709
<font size="60">Naveen.
</font>

1004
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,538
<font size="60">What am I hearing?
</font>

1005
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,358
<font size="60">Is this how you plan to become a CFO?
</font>

1006
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:56,083
<font size="60">-Shall I demote you to intern again?
-Is this a joke, Yogi?
</font>

1007
00:49:58,034 --> 00:50:00,324
<font size="60">People are questioning my character.
</font>

1008
00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:01,810
<font size="60">Forget my character...
</font>

1009
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,455
<font size="60">People are asking whether we are
following compliances at Pragati at all.
</font>

1010
00:50:06,563 --> 00:50:10,022
<font size="60">And you're promoting the
guy that screwed our company.
</font>

1011
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,681
<font size="60">I will fire him today.
</font>

1012
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:13,877
<font size="60">Right now. Right here.
</font>

1013
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:15,626
<font size="60">You are fired. Right now!
Get out!
</font>

1014
00:50:16,207 --> 00:50:17,243
<font size="60">OUT!
</font>

1015
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:25,818
<font size="60">What are you looking at him for?
</font>

1016
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:28,957
<font size="60">Naveen, it's okay.
He made a mistake.
</font>

1017
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:31,012
<font size="60">Let's go inside and figure it out.
</font>

1018
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,465
<font size="60">Figure out what?
</font>

1019
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,540
<font size="60">Whose fault is it?
Is Pappi to be blamed for it alone?
</font>

1020
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:38,543
<font size="60">Who was looking after
the accounts department?
</font>

1021
00:50:38,623 --> 00:50:39,993
<font size="60">Who hired him?
</font>

1022
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:44,373
<font size="60">Who is running the finance department?
</font>

1023
00:50:44,552 --> 00:50:46,091
<font size="60">Whose responsibility is it?
</font>

1024
00:50:48,204 --> 00:50:49,461
<font size="60">What kind of people have you hired?
</font>

1025
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:51,437
<font size="60">Who are these guys...
There's a Pappi.
</font>

1026
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:53,208
<font size="60">Then there's a Tau.
</font>

1027
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,301
<font size="60">Are we running a company
or making your family film!
</font>

1028
00:50:56,868 --> 00:50:59,940
<font size="60">Trying to be the big brother,
you've hired morons.
</font>

1029
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,057
<font size="60">And you are the biggest
moron of them all.
</font>

1030
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,613
<font size="60">Naveen, Mandal, please don't...
</font>

1031
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,211
<font size="60">Naveen, you're crossing the line now.
</font>

1032
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,848
<font size="60">Why are you talking to Yogi like that?
</font>

1033
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:12,678
<font size="60">-Prachi's mail--
-Wait a second, guys.
</font>

1034
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:15,688
<font size="60">What? Why are you
giving your permission?
</font>

1035
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:17,320
<font size="60">Do we need your permission?
</font>

1036
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,656
<font size="60">You think I am Mandal
to be scared of you.
</font>

1037
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:22,884
<font size="60">Let's go.
</font>

1038
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:25,222
<font size="60">You really think they respect you.
</font>

1039
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:28,107
<font size="60">Have you ever done anything
respectable to date?
</font>

1040
00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:31,965
<font size="60">Why do you hang around with kids?
</font>

1041
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:34,061
<font size="60">Because you want their respect?
</font>

1042
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,410
<font size="60">They respect you.
</font>

1043
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,775
<font size="60">You are doing more damage,
</font>

1044
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,590
<font size="60">compared to the very little
you achieved because of them.
</font>

1045
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,912
<font size="60">Following up on the KC
deal was your responsibility.
</font>

1046
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:44,229
<font size="60">What did you do?
Shat on it.
</font>

1047
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,560
<font size="60">KC is a moron. Plutus is a moron.
Everyone is a moron.
</font>

1048
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,110
<font size="60">You shit in every quarter.
</font>

1049
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,902
<font size="60">So you are the bigger moron!
</font>

1050
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:57,713
<font size="60">Naveen, you're the bigger moron.
</font>

1051
00:52:00,136 --> 00:52:02,412
<font size="60">The tax liability was just an excuse.
</font>

1052
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:05,388
<font size="60">Three million is not a big amount.
</font>

1053
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:09,062
<font size="60">If any of the VCs
was actually interested,
</font>

1054
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:10,868
<font size="60">he could have managed it easily.
</font>

1055
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:15,546
<font size="60">Do you know why all the
VCs turned on their offers?
</font>

1056
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:20,278
<font size="60">Mehta beat us...
</font>

1057
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:21,883
<font size="60">again.
</font>

1058
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:26,366
<font size="60">Alpha1 has raised
40 million in series B.
</font>

1059
00:52:27,176 --> 00:52:29,930
<font size="60">Eagle Vision and all the
other funds that we went to,
</font>

1060
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,109
<font size="60">are participating there.
</font>

1061
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:35,043
<font size="60">So nobody wants to
back a losing horse.
</font>

1062
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:38,640
<font size="60">Even our existing investors.
</font>

1063
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:41,968
<font size="60">Prachi told me.
</font>

1064
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,175
<font size="60">Plutus has also cancelled their offer.
</font>

1065
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:49,769
<font size="60">You didn't know this, Yogi, did you?
</font>

1066
00:52:50,347 --> 00:52:51,945
<font size="60">Plutus had given us an offer,
</font>

1067
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,968
<font size="60">which we could have
closed 10 days ago.
</font>

1068
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:57,805
<font size="60">But this guy...
</font>

1069
00:53:01,685 --> 00:53:02,806
<font size="60">Now you tell us
</font>

1070
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:04,806
<font size="60">why didn't you tell us this?
</font>

1071
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:07,276
<font size="60">This was your job?
</font>

1072
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:13,982
<font size="60">Tell you what?
</font>

1073
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:18,237
<font size="60">Yes, they did.
</font>

1074
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,001
<font size="60">Prachi gave us a term sheet.
</font>

1075
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:21,523
<font size="60">She gave us the term sheet first.
</font>

1076
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:24,367
<font size="60">But the valuation was too low,
So I didn't accept it.
</font>

1077
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:28,746
<font size="60">I know the hard work
we did to get here.
</font>

1078
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:30,725
<font size="60">Should we accept
any random value for it?
</font>

1079
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:32,683
<font size="60">-That's why I didn't tell you.
-Why?
</font>

1080
00:53:33,465 --> 00:53:35,367
<font size="60">You bark every other
order in the group.
</font>

1081
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,432
<font size="60">Reduce the KAK.
Increase engagement.
</font>

1082
00:53:38,512 --> 00:53:40,155
<font size="60">This metric isn't working.
</font>

1083
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:41,306
<font size="60">Huh...
</font>

1084
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:44,029
<font size="60">And such a big decision on which
the entire company is relying on,
</font>

1085
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,475
<font size="60">wasn't communicated to us.
</font>

1086
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:48,083
<font size="60">You made us run all over the city,
but still didn't tell us.
</font>

1087
00:53:48,163 --> 00:53:49,474
<font size="60">You came along with me, didn't you?
</font>

1088
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,307
<font size="60">You saw we were getting more offers.
</font>

1089
00:53:51,387 --> 00:53:52,629
<font size="60">Didn't you see it for yourself?
</font>

1090
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:55,258
<font size="60">If we had only Prachi's offer,
</font>

1091
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:57,272
<font size="60">you would be the first to accept it.
I know that.
</font>

1092
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:00,517
<font size="60">Listen to me, Mandal.
</font>

1093
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:02,247
<font size="60">This might be brotherhood to you.
</font>

1094
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:04,571
<font size="60">You are doing it for a friend's sake.
You might not be serious.
</font>

1095
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:09,697
<font size="60">But I want to make Pragati the
biggest company in the world someday.
</font>

1096
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:12,589
<font size="60">And valuation is the
real north star metric for it.
</font>

1097
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,188
<font size="60">-What did you say?
-That's it.
</font>

1098
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,835
<font size="60">I won't do it if I
don't get the valuation.
</font>

1099
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:17,045
<font size="60">I am not serious?
</font>

1100
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:19,425
<font size="60">Asshole...
</font>

1101
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:22,566
<font size="60">that offer that you rejected,
</font>

1102
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:25,859
<font size="60">we got that because I was fucking
working from the hospital. Understood.
</font>

1103
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,119
<font size="60">You two have turned this into a joke.
</font>

1104
00:54:31,254 --> 00:54:33,475
<font size="60">Someone's celebrating
before we got the money.
</font>

1105
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,370
<font size="60">Someone's not accepting
the money being offered,
</font>

1106
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,975
<font size="60">because the valuation isn't right.
</font>

1107
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:39,404
<font size="60">We are fucking doing business here!
</font>

1108
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:42,503
<font size="60">And we need money to do business.
End of discussion.
</font>

1109
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:45,651
<font size="60">I told you this before,
</font>

1110
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:47,727
<font size="60">we have money to survive only 15 days.
</font>

1111
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:51,401
<font size="60">The only north star
metric we had to follow
</font>

1112
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:52,721
<font size="60">was money in the bank.
</font>

1113
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,046
<font size="60">But no.
</font>

1114
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:56,768
<font size="60">You...
</font>

1115
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,934
<font size="60">You the visionary CEO,
</font>

1116
00:54:59,014 --> 00:55:00,594
<font size="60">fucking play your games.
</font>

1117
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:03,280
<font size="60">Was I trying to fill my own pockets?
</font>

1118
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:06,048
<font size="60">I know how we've slogged to get here.
</font>

1119
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:07,272
<font size="60">I know our value.
</font>

1120
00:55:07,352 --> 00:55:09,016
<font size="60">Prachi was offering us much lower.
</font>

1121
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:10,234
<font size="60">That's why I said no.
</font>

1122
00:55:10,314 --> 00:55:11,821
<font size="60">We were pitching together, weren't we?
</font>

1123
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:14,129
<font size="60">Naveen, when will you understand?
</font>

1124
00:55:15,264 --> 00:55:18,281
<font size="60">It's not just us,
24 people are slogging with us.
</font>

1125
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:21,947
<font size="60">You cannot flip a coin
anymore to make decisions.
</font>

1126
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:25,406
<font size="60">Because your decisions
affect everyone.
</font>

1127
00:55:26,887 --> 00:55:28,998
<font size="60">And you've been doing
this from the beginning.
</font>

1128
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:34,082
<font size="60">Forget asking, he doesn't feel
it's important to tell us anything.
</font>

1129
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,961
<font size="60">You never realised that
Pragati had four founders.
</font>

1130
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,715
<font size="60">You always thought that
you are in the driver's seat,
</font>

1131
00:55:43,795 --> 00:55:45,168
<font size="60">and we are passengers.
</font>

1132
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:49,025
<font size="60">And thanks to this attitude
of yours there are just three left.
</font>

1133
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:12,239
<font size="60">Good.
</font>

1134
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:17,475
<font size="60">In fact, it will be better
if I am alone.
</font>

1135
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,263
<font size="60">At least we'll get some work done.
</font>

1136
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:27,106
<font size="60">Half the time is lost
in fixing your fuckups.
</font>

1137
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:31,852
<font size="60">You guys make me inefficient like you.
</font>

1138
00:56:33,803 --> 00:56:35,325
<font size="60">Okay, leave. I don't want you.
</font>

1139
00:56:35,405 --> 00:56:36,917
<font size="60">I don't want any suboptimal people.
</font>

1140
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:38,945
<font size="60">You came to me.
</font>

1141
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:40,612
<font size="60">You wanted to come on board.
Get in the team.
</font>

1142
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:41,789
<font size="60">Bloody freeloader.
</font>

1143
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,524
<font size="60">You, and he's the bigger freeloader.
</font>

1144
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:46,956
<font size="60">He's been a freeloader
since his college days.
</font>

1145
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:49,619
<font size="60">He wouldn't have passed out
of college if it wasn't for me.
</font>

1146
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:50,891
<font size="60">He would still be there.
</font>

1147
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:52,960
<font size="60">Right, Yogi.
Wouldn't you still be there?
</font>

1148
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:54,703
<font size="60">Am I wrong?
</font>

1149
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:57,927
<font size="60">You are a burden.
</font>

1150
00:56:58,238 --> 00:57:00,300
<font size="60">I've been carrying
you around on my shoulder.
</font>

1151
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:02,566
<font size="60">Good for nothing.
Still, I am carrying you around.
</font>

1152
00:57:02,646 --> 00:57:04,141
<font size="60">I don't know for how long.
</font>

1153
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,330
<font size="60">Go on.
</font>

1154
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:07,519
<font size="60">Fuck off.
</font>

1155
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:30,230
<font size="60">"Everything is fine."
</font>

1156
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:36,640
<font size="60">"It's just the effect of desires."
</font>

1157
00:57:37,338 --> 00:57:42,605
<font size="60">"The heart is stubborn."
</font>

1158
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:50,051
<font size="60">"walks on fire though it knows."
</font>

1159
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:56,423
<font size="60">"Let things get back on track."
</font>

1160
00:57:56,503 --> 00:58:02,839
<font size="60">"Let this night fade away."
</font>

1161
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:09,265
<font size="60">"Let this storm pass."
</font>

1162
00:58:09,345 --> 00:58:16,280
<font size="60">"Let me convince my innocent heart."
</font>

1163
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:47,027
<font size="60">"Everything is fine."
</font>

1164
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:53,460
<font size="60">"It's just the effect of desires."
</font>

1165
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:59,365
<font size="60">"The heart is stubborn."
</font>

1166
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:06,826
<font size="60">"walks on fire though it knows."
</font>

1167
00:59:06,906 --> 00:59:13,190
<font size="60">"Let things get back on track."
</font>

1168
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:19,583
<font size="60">"Let this night fade away."
</font>

1169
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:25,982
<font size="60">"Let this storm pass."
</font>

1170
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:32,685
<font size="60">"Let me convince my innocent heart."
