1
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,218
Thank you, Sir.

2
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:38,924
Thank you, so much.

3
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,924
Sir, great job at BuyEasy...
Fantastic you are

4
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:42,367
Thank you.

5
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,698
And sir, congratulations for your second
round investment too.

6
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:49,005
Actually sir, I work for an e-commerce website...

7
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,494
...and I am a category manager there and I...

8
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:53,093
You can upload your resume on career section on our website.

9
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,232
Sir, can I show you my work sometime...
-OK, bye.

10
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:56,396
Please sir... Give me one chance, sir.

11
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,963
Guys like these, don't even let you drink at your own party.

12
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,021
Bhati, how much did you get for 20%, 50?

13
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,292
It will be out in Sunday's Business Outlook... Take a look yourself!

14
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,786
Bhati, tell me, 60?

15
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,482
It's official, I can't reveal it now.

16
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,935
How much, 75?

17
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:11,678
75?

18
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:13,880
Now don't tell me it's 100.

19
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:16,708
F**K!!!

20
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:17,583
100?

21
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,134
A hundred million?

22
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,157
Bhati, your company's evaluation is half a billion dollars?

23
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:25,384
F**K!!!

24
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:26,888
So what's the big deal?

25
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,205
It's still lesser than Flipkart by 7.5 billion.

26
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,638
Bhati, it means one of my college
seniors is going to be a billionaire!

27
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,115
F**K, what luck!

28
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,404
It's not about fate or luck...

29
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:42,653
IIM?

30
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:44,933
LSR. IIM.

31
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,337
I should have appeared for CAT.

32
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,063
All you do, is keep harping about my luck.

33
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:52,560
You've told me about your start-up
idea over a 100 times now.

34
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,290
Why don't you do something about it?

35
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,408
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here.

36
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,377
And you are still selling these
cheap chinese phones on Mokart.

37
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,083
They're exculsive, Bhati.
-Bullshit.

38
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,240
Son, its not that easy.

39
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:08,177
Leave your job
and venture into the market.

40
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,631
And then you will learn, what
destinies are made of and from.

41
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:17,005
Dude, what the f**k?
Still on your first beer?

42
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:18,129
Down it!

43
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:18,124
I'm good, Bhati.

44
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:19,333
Beer for him.

45
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,732
Bhati, I have to wake up early at 8:30 for work.

46
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:22,458
Shut up!!!

47
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:24,122
Bhati, I've become very discipled now.

48
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,443
Nowadays I don't even need an alarm to wake up..

49
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,361
Not going to the office?

50
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:41,392
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:42,736
I switched on the geyser

52
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,767
The water's still heating up.

53
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,767
Mandal why do you take a bath in my bathroom?

54
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,861
The handle of my bucket is broken.

55
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:50,810
So, take my bucket to your bathroom.

56
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:52,619
Actually, I feel like taking a shower today.

57
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,775
Dude, you can take a shower even in your own bathroom.

58
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,069
The water must've heated up!

59
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,782
Atleast spare my towel.

60
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:26,065
Mokart f**ked me over Bhati. Completely f**ked me.

61
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,260
I put in so much effort into this Brazil project.

62
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,404
Worked even on Sundays.

63
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,310
I made atleast a 1000 PPTs.

64
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,911
Must've made more than 5000 excel sheets.

65
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:46,658
And when it came down to leading the team,
instead of me, they sent someone else to Rio.

66
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,169
Bhati, I will take revenge!

67
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,340
I will take revenge for sure!

68
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,406
I will even avenge them, Bhati.

69
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:55,639
Once I get the funding

70
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,299
I'll make so much money Bhati... So much money

71
00:03:58,032 --> 00:03:59,032
I'll buy Mokart and...

72
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,919
And sell it on OLX, f**king shit.

73
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:06,988
But how, Bhati?

74
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,363
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

75
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,740
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

76
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:15,308
What are you?

77
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:18,583
What do you mean, what am I?

78
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,161
What are you?

79
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:23,468
I am the Executive Regional Manager, Navin Bansal, Mokart.com

80
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,904
No, what are YOU?

81
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,294
Executive regional manager...
-You are a beer.

82
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:31,197
What do you mean?

83
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:33,841
You're beer, motherf**ker.

84
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:35,810
You're beer.

85
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,529
And this bottle here? This is your company

86
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:43,021
You think, you'll get into the glass.

87
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:44,996
You will have fun.

88
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:45,865
Isn't it?

89
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:46,911
But look at this.

90
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:48,523
Can you see?

91
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,475
You actually don't want to leave the bottle.

92
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,529
For the beer to get into the glass...
It needs to leave the bottle first

93
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,474
Once you're out of the bottle

94
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,607
Then you can get into any glass you want.

95
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,497
In this glass, if you want.

96
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,997
Or you can get into this glass

97
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,545
Even in this glass.
-Its a wine glass.

98
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:11,966
How the hell do YOU know that?

99
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:13,592
You are beer.

100
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:15,138
Get it?

101
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:16,503
You can go wherever you want.

102
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:18,810
Understand?

103
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,443
But it's quintissential you come out of the bottle, first.

104
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:24,510
Once you are out, you could fill half the glass

105
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:27,702
Or maybe you won't.

106
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,030
But if you don't come out

107
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,710
Then you'll definitely not be able to fill it.
Look here.

108
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,450
And its not your job to ask the questions.

109
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:37,693
You're beer.

110
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,012
And your job is to flow.

111
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,021
You are beer.

112
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:43,273
This is beer.

113
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,396
Not glass.

114
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:45,467
Infact there is no glass.

115
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,558
But there is a  glass on the table, Bhati.

116
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,075
No  glass.

117
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,273
I am a beer, Bhati.

118
00:05:59,016 --> 00:05:59,904
I am beer.

119
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:02,161
And I'll get out of the bottle.

120
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:04,174
I will get out of the bottle...

121
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,955
Will you have  breakfast?

122
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:17,384
Yes

123
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:17,925
What do you want to eat?

124
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:20,921
Bread Omlett.

125
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:23,200
We've no eggs left.

126
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:24,716
Bread Jam.

127
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,585
Which one, mixed fruit or mango?

128
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:29,642
Mixed fruit.

129
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:30,919
The mixed fruit one, got done with, last week itself!

130
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:32,649
Mango then!

131
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,339
We didn't get any mango in the first place!

132
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,128
Just toast the bread for me.

133
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:37,797
The toaster's been broken for such a long time, now!

134
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:39,349
Dude, one cup tea will do.

135
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,934
But I already used all the milk for the curd!

136
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:43,837
So what are you eating, then?

137
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:44,867
Curd.

138
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,347
I don't want any breakfast today. I'll have directly skip to lunch!

139
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:48,844
What?

140
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,071
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

141
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,667
Your 'battery' will start seeping. Your mom....
-Dude, please leave me alone.

142
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,707
What?
-Bhati... You were right!

143
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,047
What?

144
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,574
I'm beer, Bhati.

145
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,621
And I will flow out of the bottle.

146
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,637
I will resign.

147
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,380
I will resign.

148
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:13,931
This decision will change your life.

149
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,318
Come on, lets drink.

150
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:16,969
One beer for him.

151
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,982
Bhati listen, Bhati.

152
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,036
First listen to me

153
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:23,260
This decision that you're taking now

154
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,147
Will change your future.

155
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:27,229
You know what I mean.

156
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,935
No!! No!! No!! You didn't get me.

157
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,640
I will resign right now.

158
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:32,261
I will call him right now.

159
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,344
-Have you gone mad?
-I will resign right now, I don't give a F**K.

160
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,656
-Listen to me.
-I will call him right now.

161
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:39,684
-Listen to me.

162
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,441
Bhati, I am beer Bhati, let me flow.

163
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,750
Bro, don't flow so much!

164
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,439
Listen to me, just listen.

165
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:47,919
You have to serve the notice period.

166
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:49,200
Do you think, I'm scared?

167
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:50,810
Am I a coward?

168
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,458
When did I say that...

169
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:53,567
I will show it to you.
I will prove it to you.

170
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,973
I will show it to you, right now.
-Navin. Listen, listen. This a very odd hour, right now.

171
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:01,426
You think I can't get out of the bottle?
I am a beer and I will flow...

172
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:03,716
Rajat?

173
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,185
Rajat, I am so sorry
that I am calling you this hour.

174
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,028
There's something very important, I want to tell you!

175
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,146
Rajat you're an a**hole!!!

176
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,710
And your department

177
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,271
Infact your whole company, is an a**hole.

178
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:23,974
So you and your company are fired from my life.

179
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,614
Good night, Jai Hind.

180
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,241
And F**K you.

181
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:28,271
F**K YOU!!!

182
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:35,397
That's my drink!!!

183
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:36,741
Sorry...

184
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,080
Really? Are you from IIM?

185
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,286
Whose this?

186
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,577
Yaa Chatty, tell me

187
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:19,551
But NasCom conclave's result where supposed to be
out next week, weren't they?

188
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:20,723
Akhil, who?

189
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:21,740
Ohh the hostel 4 guy.

190
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:22,870
Is he in Nascom?

191
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:24,255
OK.

192
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,704
So..What did he say?

193
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,229
You've got to be kidding me!

194
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,473
Are you sure?

195
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:33,520
Confirmed?

196
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,232
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

197
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:38,419
F**K!!!

198
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:40,286
What luck!

199
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:42,482
Are you sure?

200
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,107
Thanks, thanks, thanks dude...

201
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:45,970
Ok then, I'll tell the others as well

202
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,894
No, no.. Let it get official first. I'll update my status after!

203
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,099
OK.

204
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:51,625
I'll talk to you in the evening, alright?

205
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:53,433
Ok. Take care. Bye.

206
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:55,482
Naveen.

207
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,222
You are so irresponsible man.

208
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,669
This was lying behind your commode.

209
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,005
What do I do with it?

210
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,072
Now do one thing Mandal.

211
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,026
This? Throw it into the garbage!

212
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,876
(TVF Pitchers Theme Song)

213
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,761
He called me in the office and started yelling at me!

214
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,354
I said, "Sir,

215
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:39,177
..if you have so much problem with me sleeping..

216
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,443
..then tranfer me to HR department..

217
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,220
They even get an extra bonus for sleeping, there"

218
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:50,943
Jeetu bro!

219
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,572
Jeetu bro!

220
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:54,931
Congrats...

221
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,213
Do you have an extra?

222
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:57,080
No, it's the last one.

223
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,536
No issue. Blow it on my face.

224
00:13:58,615 --> 00:13:59,513
Passive will also do!

225
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:00,623
Congrats for what?

226
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,372
Now don't pretend!

227
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,412
You were amazing in the appraisal!

228
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,708
By the way, did you watch last night's Nach Baliye??

229
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:07,760
Chetan bhagat was awesome. He just..

230
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:09,009
How did you get to know about it?

231
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,521
Saw it last night. The 9pm show.

232
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,388
And then again, the 11:30 repeat telecast.

233
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:16,187
No, I mean about the appraisal.
How do you know about that?

234
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:17,391
Appraisal ?
Ohh!!!

235
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,708
Joshi sir showed it to us.

236
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:22,260
Even the 'Acheivement box' wasn't big enough.

237
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,982
Though I didn't really get one thing!

238
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:27,674
Why did you gave yourself 4 out of 5 in the self evaluation?

239
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,786
I knew it! I should've given myself 3.5...

240
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:30,575
3.5?

241
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,122
You should've given yourself 5 out of 5.

242
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:33,607
What more could you possibly do?

243
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,724
No tell me, what more can you do?

244
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,001
Jeetu, can I tell you something?

245
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:39,515
Whenever we get a code written by you

246
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:41,381
We forward it, without even testing it

247
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,057
Why waste time, by running it?

248
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:44,942
And Joshi sir keeps praising you always.

249
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,707
Oh, Divya from the marketing team?

250
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:47,373
It's her engagement today.

251
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:47,512
Will you come?

252
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,075
What was Joshi sir saying?

253
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,286
Joshi sir said, he will come!

254
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,134
Actually what happened was...

255
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,620
No!!! No!!
I meant what was Joshi sir saying about me?

256
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,135
You said something...

257
00:14:58,642 --> 00:14:59,055
Ohh

258
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:01,052
Not only Joshi sir,

259
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:02,540
But the whole department says this.

260
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:05,626
"Whether or not someone else does...
you are defintely getting promoted"

261
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,119
And there's no two ways about it.

262
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,686
OK!!! I should be going, I have work to do.

263
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:09,725
Take a chewing gum.

264
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:11,082
-No!!! No!!
-Its mint flavoured.

265
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,115
No, no.. You can have it.

266
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:15,139
Ok!!! I will also leave after a couple of hours,
I have to rest.

267
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,205
Too much work to do...

268
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,763
<i>And remember the mithaee kachori  for tommorow!</i>

269
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:21,806
And greetings to your wife.

270
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,203
Dude, did you see that guy?

271
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:23,683
Amazing

272
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:24,162
Just a second...
Pass me the cigarette

273
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,849
Sir, the staff has requested the lunch time to be
extended from 15 minutes to half an hour.

274
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:24,583
Denied

275
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,404
Let them stay hungry and stay foolish.
Next.

276
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,893
The laptops that were given to
the TechSupport team are faulty.

277
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,018
The batteries drain out in half an hour!

278
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,732
Give them 10 of these and get them energized

279
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,500
Sir, but they need to charge their laptops.
not phones.

280
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:39,716
Well then tell the f**king tech support to help tech support,
in all the matters of tech support. Next.

281
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:40,857
Sir, marketing research report.

282
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,543
Don't give numbers, give me graphs and pie charts.

283
00:16:43,998 --> 00:16:44,622
You!!

284
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,575
Give me the graphs on this by tommorow.

285
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:48,927
But I am from Legal.

286
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:00,097
Objection Overruled.

287
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:01,707
Next.

288
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,667
Sir, all the new sales interns are waiting for their induction

289
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:06,357
Assemble them in conference room.

290
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:08,762
But sir, the AC in that room is not working.
It's very hot in there.

291
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,074
Good, it's the first day they need to feel the heat.

292
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:13,320
Sir, but what about your hair loss appointment?

293
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,290
<i>Let's give a big round of applause for chacha.</i>

294
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:32,272
So, you guys are the company's future sales team.

295
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:35,083
And you guys will be dealing with the client directly.

296
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,044
-Are you guys excited?
-Yes sir.

297
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:38,974
OK!!!

298
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,007
So guys, let me tell you.

299
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:45,008
Impressing your client is like impressing a girl,

300
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,372
that every man in the town is after.

301
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,872
And this girl, doesn't even want to meet you.

302
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,106
Doesn't want to pick up your calls.

303
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:55,016
Infact, she doesn't even know you.

304
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:57,055
She f**king hates you.

305
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,079
Now, what will you do to impress such a girl?

306
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,485
Sir, I will threaten to slit my wrists, sir.

307
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:07,173
Yeah, maybe, as a last resort to meet the targets.

308
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:09,775
But, what will you begin with?

309
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,299
You will never give up!!!

310
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,120
You will never quit!!!

311
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,633
You have to treat your client, like your girlfriend.

312
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:17,984
Show them your loyalty.

313
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,091
Take them out for coffee.

314
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,177
Call them thrice a day.

315
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:22,372
Remember their birthdays.

316
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:25,203
In fact, fantasize about your client every night.

317
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,023
I do sir. EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.

318
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,209
OK!!! Excellent.

319
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:33,607
Anyways..

320
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,585
Guys remember.

321
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:36,656
Whatever happens..

322
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,990
Whatever the situation may be.

323
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,146
Just like me...

324
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,422
You should never quit.

325
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,954
Can I hear that aloud? You should...
-never quit.

326
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:46,133
You should...
-never quit.

327
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:47,783
You should...
-never quit.

328
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,098
You should...
-never quit

329
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,154
You should...
-never quit

330
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,011
You should...
-never quit

331
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,434
You should...
-never quit

332
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:55,689
Guys!!!

333
00:18:57,308 --> 00:18:58,308
I quit!!!

334
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:13,327
You should...

335
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:19,550
But the news is confirmed, isn't it?

336
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,673
Yaa, Akhil works at NasCom itself.
He was in hostel 4

337
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:25,240
Hostel 4 guys are very nice. Very helpful.

338
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:27,823
Last year, when I slapped Ruchi's father

339
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,073
Hostel 4's G.sec bailed me out.

340
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:32,636
No, no. I bought it already.

341
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,089
I've bought babycorn as well.

342
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:35,182
Hey Jitu.

343
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:36,349
yaa, yaa...

344
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,820
No, I still didn't get any gooseberry.

345
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,200
Yaa, I will look for them...

346
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,361
I'll be home in an hour. OK?

347
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,230
OK!!!   OK!!!

348
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:46,922
OK!!!   OK!!!

349
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:51,331
Dude, vegetables are SO expensive!!!

350
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:53,700
Do you know how much babycorn costs?

351
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,781
100 gram for 100 Rupees. 1000 per KG.

352
00:19:56,888 --> 00:20:00,513
We need money in life, dude! What do people keep going
on about, real estate being expensive in Bombay?

353
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,490
Jitu I quit the job.
-Don't eat the apple dude. They put a sticker of 30 on it but sell it for 50...

354
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,078
What did you leave?
What are you saying?

355
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,279
I quit my job, last night.

356
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:10,318
Why?

357
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:11,202
-And Brazil?

358
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:13,376
-They are sending someone else.

359
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,576
What now?

360
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,484
New job? What?

361
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:20,460
No dude, our idea is going to
get selected in the conclave.

362
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,219
Now let's just begin with the start-up

363
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,340
We've only been talking about it since 3rd year.
-Naveen we've already discussed this.

364
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:25,493
What did we discuss?

365
00:20:26,197 --> 00:20:27,814
That by the time you come
back from Brazil, after a

366
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,455
year and a half, Yogi will
make some contacts here.

367
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,172
But that we can do...
-And even I have to settle down with Somya.

368
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,281
Guys try to understand, I can't leave my job right now.

369
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:37,119
There's finally something good happening for me in the company

370
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,507
People are realizing my potential.

371
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:40,301
I’m a valuable employee to the company.

372
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:43,470
Won't be able to leave the job.
- Listen to me.

373
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:45,886
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here!

374
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:48,406
And you're still writing codes on Python.

375
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,812
This the the opportunity.
This is the time. We should start now.

376
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,594
And don't worry at all dude.

377
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:59,093
Once we get the funding,
we'll ensure, you get your salary even if we work for free.

378
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,824
Jitu, all the core work is tech related.

379
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:03,181
How will we manage without you?

380
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,172
All he's trying to say is, if we want to be the 'stud' enterpreneurs,

381
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:09,427
and want our company to be as big as Apple...

382
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:10,865
Then he needs to be Steve Jobs

383
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,286
You need to be Steve Wozniak

384
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,719
and I need to be a Sean Parker.

385
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:15,705
Sean Parker's from Facebook.

386
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,957
Yaa, we'll leave our jobs and become entrepreneurs.

387
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,894
Can you even spell entrepreneurship?

388
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:19,921
E

389
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:20,659
N

390
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:22,036
T

391
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:27,928
To be an entrepreneur, you don't need the spelling but the spirit.

392
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,397
Naveen, its now that finally something good's happening in my life!

393
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:32,424
I've got an appraisal with such difficulty!

394
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:34,589
I got scored 5 out of 5 in my evaluation!

395
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:38,712
Thats what I am saying, 5 is the limit of your job.
What after then?  You won't score anything above 5.

396
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,609
Do you want to get through life, only scoring 5 out of 5?

397
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,645
Listen, I will explain it to you...

398
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,323
What are you?

399
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:52,211
What are you?

400
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:55,349
What am I?
I am Jitu, married and what else?

401
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,142
No!!No!!1
What ARE you?

402
00:21:57,554 --> 00:21:57,630
What are you?

403
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,980
Are you out of your mind , Naveen?

404
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,234
You're Coffee.

405
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:05,904
-What?

406
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,204
You're coffee, Motherf**ker.

407
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:09,943
You are coffee...

408
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:12,191
And this cup is your company.

409
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:15,012
Now you think you'lll have fun getting into the glass...

410
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,044
But you don't want to leave the cup.

411
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:21,039
Now if you want to flow into the glass,
you have to get out of the cup first.

412
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,377
Easy. Easy.

413
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:24,185
What do you want to say exactly?

414
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:28,527
All I'm saying is, once you're out,
you can go into this glass...

415
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:31,465
You can get into this glass.

416
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:32,619
Or this...

417
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:35,312
Now you might think, "This is a sugar bowl,

418
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:37,120
but I am coffee. How can I get inside this?"

419
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:38,505
Won't you?

420
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:41,944
But how do YOU know?
You're coffee...

421
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,726
Dude, what are doing?

422
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,777
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry...

423
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:47,990
What are you doing dude?
My phone...

424
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:51,729
It happened so well, with a beer!

425
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:56,988
So, what I was trying to say is...

426
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,579
Whatever you want to say,
tell it to someone else

427
00:22:58,637 --> 00:22:59,668
You've left your job and let go

428
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:01,540
What do you think, you're Steve Jobs?

429
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:04,150
What I was trying to say is...
-First, figure it out for yourself, what you want to do...

430
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,368
We'll then sit and talk it down

431
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,711
But where are you going?

432
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,683
To buy gooseberry!

433
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,353
I understood...

434
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:19,350
Yeah.

435
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,138
The f**ker called me the other day and said,

436
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:36,856
"Why do keep joking about the H.R. team?

437
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,994
Do you know how much talent it takes, to be an H.R. manager?"

438
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:39,854
I said, "Sir,

439
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:42,154
To sleep for 22 hours a day...

440
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:43,552
definitely takes a lot of talent!"

441
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:45,715
Your fly's open!

442
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:47,958
He took the bait!

443
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:55,813
Jeetu bro!

444
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:57,376
Jeetu bro!

445
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,821
Congratulations! Congratulations!

446
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:04,740
I was so glad, I took a selfie with a printout.

447
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:05,873
Kudos!

448
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:06,271
So...

449
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,558
Mr. Jitendra Maheshwari!

450
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:10,269
Mr. Senior Developer!

451
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:11,674
Won't you offer me a cigarette?

452
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:12,815
But this one's almost done...

453
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,514
Just give me whatever's left of it.

454
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:20,018
Tomorrow onwards, I won't be able to even see you!

455
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:20,417
A big position!

456
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,507
A big salary! The works!

457
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,416
Did you tell your wife about it?

458
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:25,889
Not yet. I'll tell her once I get home!

459
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:26,407
Ahaan!

460
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,732
Someone's gonna get lucky tonight!!!

461
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:30,482
Jeetu bro...

462
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,506
Can I tell you something?

463
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:32,419
Amazing job!

464
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,375
Your life's now absolutely set!

465
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:36,070
Within the next 5 years, you'll be

466
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:36,804
Principal Developer

467
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:37,874
Then within the next 10 years

468
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:38,538
Associate Divsion Head

469
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:42,008
And 15 years down, I'm sure, you'd have replaced Joshi Sir!

470
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:43,995
Joshi Sir!!!

471
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:46,819
I was just praising you!

472
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:47,941
No, genuinely!

473
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,088
Joshi Sir.

474
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,411
Will you have a chewing gum?

475
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:05,442
Chewing gum?

476
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,179
No. I've to go back.
I've work to do.

477
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:09,926
I brought the 'Advance mint' flavoured ones,
especially for you.

478
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:12,991
Mint or advance mint. I just told you, I don't want any!

479
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:14,639
I'll take a leave. I've work to do!

480
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,595
Alright then. Anyway, new work starts today for you!

481
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:19,685
<i>Let's meet at Pandeji's stall in the evening for some mithaee kachori.</i>

482
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:20,996
6 PM!

483
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:22,677
Ok!!! I'll let you know...

484
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:25,036
Don't think about it! It's final, OK?

485
00:25:25,676 --> 00:25:26,168
What's up?

486
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,207
I just got back, these PR guys really suck the life out of you!

487
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:51,708
Rajat, can I come in?

488
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,740
How would I know, it'll take till 7?

489
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:56,436
Rajesh!

490
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,590
OK.. I'll... I'll be there, I'll be there.
Just give me a couple of minutes.

491
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:01,988
OK?

492
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:03,632
Bye.

493
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:11,224
So, Naveen.

494
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,810
How many drink did you have that night?

495
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,263
I am really sorry, Rajat.

496
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:19,581
I'm... I'm really embarassed about it.

497
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:20,949
For whatever happened.

498
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,388
After Brazil project, I was really upset,
so I got drunk and I...

499
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,715
But anyway I think leaving the job was the right decision.

500
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:31,378
But I sincererly apologize for the things that I said.

501
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,824
Obviously I didn't mean any of that.

502
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,629
It's OK!!! It happens...

503
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,954
We've been working together for three years now. It's OK!!!

504
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,125
Don't stress more. Chill

505
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,007
Thank you.

506
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,552
I brought my resignation.

507
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:42,344
I just thought...

508
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,684
Officialy, I would...

509
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:46,565
What next, then?

510
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:48,187
Just that. Want to do a start-up, Rajat.

511
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:51,535
Our B-Plan is in the final round of the NasCom Conclave

512
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:54,841
Infact, there's a 99% chance, that it's going to... get selected

513
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,224
So I am just keeping my fingers crossed.

514
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,255
Wow! Full time start-up, then!

515
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:58,951
Wow

516
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,911
Then you may have thought about the...

517
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:04,851
The liquidity preferences of the Angel Investors.

518
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:05,601
Yeah?

519
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:08,447
You must've also thought about the ESOP pool allocation?

520
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:08,672
Right?

521
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,324
No. Not exactly!!!

522
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,061
But I am sure with time we will get into it.

523
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:18,118
You know Rahul Sharma was my batchmate in college.

524
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:20,274
Rahul Sharma!!!

525
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:22,449
The co-founder of Micromax.

526
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,688
Ohh, of course! I've read a lot, about him. Really?

527
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:27,310
Of course! Of course!
You're the entrepreneur.

528
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,740
He'd started exactly like this... With a start-up

529
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:31,344
Look where he is today!

530
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:33,957
Last year his company was valued at...

531
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,322
...more then a billion dollars.

532
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:36,368
Billion dollars, I know, I know.

533
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:38,596
Have you heard about Harshit Kothari?

534
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:41,180
He too, was my batchmate.

535
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:43,271
Harshit?

536
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:44,322
No?

537
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:44,865
No...

538
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:49,065
Anyway, even he began with the start-up like this

539
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:51,046
What was it's name again...

540
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,147
Anyway!

541
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,411
Unfortunately...
It was a good idea, but it didn't do so well.

542
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:57,775
He had to return...

543
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,921
To his job, in a couple of years.

544
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:02,530
There were many more, in my batch...

545
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,347
Manoj Agarwal...
His brother, Vishal Agarwal

546
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:07,557
Saurabh Vahi, R.K. Paee...

547
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,910
Krishnamurthy

548
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:11,591
Have you heard about them all?

549
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,312
Saurabh Vahi...

550
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,822
I don't think so.

551
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:19,205
Of course. You're in the big league now!

552
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:21,879
You're going to win a prestigious competition!

553
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:24,482
Is this competition held every year?

554
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:27,181
Yeah, it's been happening for the last 7-8 years now.

555
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,419
Wow! 7-8 years!

556
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:33,668
So how many of the previous winners have made it big?

557
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:36,418
Previous winners!!!

558
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:42,127
I don't know actually.

559
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,391
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

560
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:51,330
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

561
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:53,193
MBA

562
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:54,685
IAS

563
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:57,152
or Start-Up.

564
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,039
Go out and take a look, Naveen.

565
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,381
There are start-up founders sitting in 2 out of 3 cabins, out there.

566
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:05,776
Naveen...

567
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,356
Do you really think your idea is one in a million?

568
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:12,967
Look!

569
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,810
You think this is your passion...

570
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,194
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

571
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,424
But, this is not your passion, Naveen.

572
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,315
If this was your passion, then you would've left this job...

573
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:23,217
A long time back.

574
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:27,218
You wouldn't have waited for being rejected from the Brazil project.

575
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:27,668
No...

576
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:29,844
No...I don't

577
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,304
I think....

578
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,166
Beijing.

579
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:42,554
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

580
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,520
Apointment within a week.

581
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,591
We need someone smart over there...

582
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:47,185
Like you.

583
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,997
You have to leave for your... Visa appointment, in Delhi in...

584
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:54,073
The next 20 mins.

585
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,755
That night when you called me.

586
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:01,891
You did not make a choice.

587
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,808
You were simply reacting to a rejection.

588
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:07,334
Now is the real choice.

589
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,919
Think about it, Naveen.

590
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:16,371
One in hand is obviously better than
one not-so-sure in the bush.

591
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:17,127
No?

592
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:51,249
Yes, Naveen.

593
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:55,325
In my bathroom.

594
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:58,098
How will I use your bathroom, after you've asked me not to?

595
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:01,657
Yeah, tell me?

596
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:08,970
How strange is this?

597
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:11,493
Naveen didn't get promoted, so he quit his job.

598
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,317
And now you're thinking of quitting, after you've been promoted.

599
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:17,062
Human brain is a mystery, bud.

600
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:18,435
-You wanna order something?

601
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:20,062
What do you want to order?

602
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,208
Let's do chilly babycorn.

603
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:23,631
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

604
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:26,542
People planning to quit their job, don't eat babycorn!

605
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,962
Dude, I was told there's going to be an influx of money, ok?

606
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:30,670
I'm going to get a salary and hence, I'm ordering babycorn!

607
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,044
-Let's order something for Naveen too.

608
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:34,084
Yeah, he must be on his way.

609
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:36,227
Naveen's not going to be able to make it.

610
00:32:36,303 --> 00:32:37,288
-Mandal?

611
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:39,430
Where is he?

612
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:40,927
Actually...

613
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,543
He's the one who requested me to come here.

614
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:47,977
He...

615
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,773
... had to leave urgently.

616
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,397
But where?

617
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,532
Airport please.

618
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:05,208
It was a very tough decision for him.

619
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:06,739
He was very sad.

620
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:06,780
He waas even crying.

621
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:09,249
Are you serious? He was crying?

622
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,464
I mean, you can't really tell on the phone, can you?

623
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:13,324
But his voice...

624
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:14,485
... sounded heavy.

625
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,880
But why didn't he call us?

626
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:20,154
He was in a hurry. So called up his best friend.

627
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,162
He must be feeling really bad about facing you guys.

628
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:25,510
He must be feeling very guilty.

629
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:28,271
Could you please drive a little faster?

630
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:30,050
Or else, I'm going to miss my flight!

631
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,544
Sir, you see how there's so much traffic here!

632
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,368
<i>There's this one other way via Chandivali</i>

633
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:34,763
Should we try that?

634
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:37,240
Will it get us to the airport on time?

635
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:38,719
There won't be any traffic there?

636
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,349
We can find that out, only once, we take that road.

637
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,092
But if we stay stuck here, in this traffic...

638
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:45,091
Then you'll definitely miss your flight!

639
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,575
Alright then, let's try that one, then.

640
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:48,245
He's not answering his phone.

641
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,442
He won't.

642
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,483
He must've even checked in, by now.

643
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:54,525
You can talk to him, when he gets back from Delhi, day after.

644
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:56,533
Come on, cheer up guys!

645
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:58,911
Trust me. He loves you.

646
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:01,391
He always spoke to me about the two of you.

647
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,491
Excuse me! Our pitcher?

648
00:35:06,122 --> 00:35:07,166
Drink guys!

649
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,454
Yogi, you've quit your job.
Isn't that going to be a problem now?

650
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:39,902
I'll go back tommorow.

651
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,982
I'll tell them, I went through some hormonal problem!

652
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,518
I have done this before.

653
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,895
What about your phone?
It got spilled on, with coffee, didn't it?

654
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,808
Forget the phone. He burned my leg.

655
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,143
It's become all red!

656
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,568
Have to keep applying burnol, without
letting Soumya know about it!

657
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,677
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

658
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:55,762
It won't burn, even if it spills.

659
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:57,372
You're back!!!

660
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:59,074
I knew it, you'd come!

661
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,534
This motherf**ker's been talking as if you've died!

662
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:03,440
You missed your flight?

663
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,220
Didn't miss it. Left it!

664
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,504
Why? Aren't there any bars at the airport?

665
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,294
You think I let go off Beijing for beer?

666
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,583
I came back for the start-up.

667
00:36:10,716 --> 00:36:12,182
Don't worry. Sit down.

668
00:36:12,684 --> 00:36:14,128
Waiter, one more glass please.

669
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,086
What'd happened Naveen?

670
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:19,860
Rajat asked me if I was sure, that our idea is "one in a million"?

671
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,913
It's just that, I wasn't sure.

672
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:23,682
So you're sure, now?

673
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:28,115
No, not sure even now.

674
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:33,023
But then I thought, if we quit our jobs and try,
we might succeed, or we might not.

675
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:36,254
But if we don't try, then we'll definitely not succeed.

676
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,241
So basically, the moral of the story is...

677
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:42,433
We're all beers, motherf**kers!

678
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,430
OK, time to safeguard your phones!

679
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:46,887
Lets bottoms up first.

680
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:48,214
But I don't have a glass, Yogi!

681
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,519
-Take this one.
-And what about you?

682
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:51,463
I'll drink from the pitcher!

683
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,806
Cheers! Cheers!

684
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,161
Give me a second guys.

685
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:03,139
- So you're quitting your job tomorow?

686
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:04,036
Yes Chatty, tell me?

687
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,114
Not really tomorrow, becasue I still
have to discuss it with Soumya!

688
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:09,222
Why would you get married, dude?

689
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:12,063
It's not cumpolsory, to get arrange married, for sex?

690
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,122
Yogi, it's not really for sex

691
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,393
Soumya's also a very good person!

692
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:24,348
What happened?

693
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:26,646
Chatty just called.

694
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:29,055
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

695
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:31,812
Our name's not on the winner's list!

696
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:32,442
I knew it!

697
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:35,557
Hostel 4 guys are the biggest douchebags!!!

698
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,375
Motherf**kers ate bread savouries all night long

699
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,828
And then added their bills to my canteen account!

700
00:37:41,618 --> 00:37:42,587
I hate hostel 4 guys.

701
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:42,684
But wait...

702
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:48,381
What about my salary now?
