Oh, and lots of heart -- both in the sentimental sense, and in the gory literal sense.", "Following Popclaw's tip, the Boys find a Triad hideout, housing an imprisoned Japanese woman, the Female, whom Frenchie frees. After she kills her guards and runs off, Milk finds evidence the Female was a test subject. When Hughie meets Starlight while bowling, Butcher has him bug her phone. With the Compound-V supply compromised, A-Train has Popclaw go into hiding, while he searches for the Female. Stillwell sends Homelander and Queen Maeve to save a hijacked airliner, but Homelander casually abandons the plane when the plan fails, forcing Maeve to choose her survival over the passengers. Frenchie finds evidence leading to Penn Station, and makes a momentary connection there with the Female, but loses her in the crowd. They corner her on the tracks, but A-Train arrives and tries to kill her. Frenchie attracts a crowd to distract A-Train, allowing the Female to escape. The Boys corner her again, and Frenchie tries talking to her. She still attacks, so Butcher uses knock out gas. Stillwell is pleased seeing Homelander use the tragedy to push for militarized supers, rousing the crowd with a speech while Maeve grieves for those she allowed to die.\u2014Aaron Kyle"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8100950", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 18704, "number_of_episodes": 40}
