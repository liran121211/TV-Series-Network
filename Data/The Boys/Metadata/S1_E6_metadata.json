Vought Studios. Genre: Reality. Starring: Homelander, Queen Maeve, Black Noir, The Deep, A-Train, Starlight, Tara Reid, Billy Zane.", "Now informed, The Boys know Vought has used super charities to smuggle Compound-V (disguised as Polio vaccines) to make super-babies since 1971. Annie learns that Ashley was fired, and Stillwell demands she comply with her designed image. Annie refuses, remarking that firing her after reporting a sexual assault would hurt Vought. Stillwell, aware it was Deep, has him apologize publicly and transfers him to Sandusky, Ohio for a sabbatical. Butcher brings Hughie to a collateral damage survivors support group, but leaves after yelling at them for doing nothing to get justice. Alone, Butcher explains to Hughie that Homelander raped his wife and she went missing shortly thereafter. Frenchie and Milk get help from Mesmer, a telepath, to see into the mind of the Female. Mesmer reveals the Female was kidnapped along with her brother by the Shining Light Liberation Army terrorist group, and her name is Kimiko. They learn that Vought is making Compound-V boosted terrorists to push militarization of supers. Butcher tells Raynor, but when she refuses to target Homelander, he calls the whole deal off. Meanwhile, Mesmer gives Homelander surveillance photos of the Boys. Hughie and Annie share a kiss, but Butcher finds out, warning Hughie not to fraternize with the enemy and threatens to tell her about Translucent.\u2014Aaron Kyle"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8100954", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 16991, "number_of_episodes": 40}
