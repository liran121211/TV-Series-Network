Butcher turns to CIA Dept. Director Susan Raynor for the \"Mallory files\", but she refuses. Vought VP Madelyn Stillwell tells Seven leader Homelander about the evidence Deep found incriminating him for the plane crash, so she handles it while he talks to Deep. The night Starlight teams-up with the Deep, she promises to kill him if he ever tries to sexually assault her again. Stillwell blackmails Oklahoma Senator Calhoun into allowing a vote that could enable Vought to contract superheros to the military. Annie stops a rape, unaware she is being recorded. Her agent, Ashley, rages at her because of the negative exposure and legal implications. While Homelander searches for Translucent, Frenchie decides to place C-4 in Translucent's colon, who then fearfully reveals A-Train was with his girlfriend Popclaw before he killed Robin. They learn Homelander is nearby, and cannot risk killing Translucent. Frenchie and Butcher cause an explosive distraction.\u2014Aaron Kyle"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8100946", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 19754, "number_of_episodes": 40}
