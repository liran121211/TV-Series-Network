1
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,230
"A fine reward is
offered for the return

2
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,758
of a slave woman stolen...

3
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,967
or absconded from
the house of Claudius Appius.

4
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,805
The following noblemen
returning from Greece

5
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:35,507
have received pardon of Caesar
and must not be harmed:

6
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,881
Publius Servilius Casca,

7
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,944
Marcus Tullius Cicero,

8
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,855
Gaius Cassius Longinus

9
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,453
and Marcus Junius Brutus.

10
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,828
The traitor Pompey
has fled to Egypt.

11
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,992
Glorious Caesar follows."

12
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,922
Shoulder arms!

13
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,368
Forward!

14
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,835
Forward face!

15
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,406
Forward march!

16
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,853
Behold, Ptolemy,

17
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,091
he of the two ladies,

18
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,860
he of sedge and bee.

19
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,861
Behold Ptolemy,

20
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,872
Son of Ra,

21
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,239
Ptolemy the Divine.

22
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,114
Greetings--

23
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,473
How long may we hope
for the blessing of your presence?

24
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,985
Not long.

25
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,919
Oh, we are desolated.

26
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,789
If His Glorious Honor cares
to divulge his purpose here,

27
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,350
the servants
of the Mighty Lion

28
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,863
would be ecstatic
to help you

29
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,956
in any way
whatsoever.

30
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,126
That is most kind of you.

31
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:49,034
How goes your
preparation for war?

32
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,407
War?

33
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,412
We have no war prepared.

34
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,414
I'm misinformed then.

35
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,416
I was told the sister
of the Mighty Lion

36
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,283
disputes his right
to the throne.

37
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,844
Do not speak of her.

38
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,620
I piss on her!
I shit on her!

39
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,627
It is true
our beloved princess

40
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,722
has listened to ill counsel
and raised some absurd claim.

41
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,326
But... she has no support,

42
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,805
none but traitors
and barbarians.

43
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,609
What was that name?

44
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,201
Deilogos of Pergamum.

45
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,838
He can raise 10 legions.

46
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,848
Deilogos of Pergamum

47
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,045
can raise
10 legions for her.

48
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,454
A petty bandit. I assure you,
you have no problem,

49
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,687
no fears at all
about Cleopatra.

50
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,250
Where is she?

51
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,263
Well, nobody knows.

52
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,562
Somewhere in the south,
we believe.

53
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,330
He lies.
They have her.

54
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,396
This dispute between
you both must end.

55
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,568
Rome desires Egypt
to be at peace.

56
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,636
Your grain ships
must keep sailing.

57
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,648
We are in absolute
control of the country,

58
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,809
from the lighthouse
to the Cataracts.

59
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,411
Good, in that case
you should have no trouble

60
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,546
in handing over
Pompey Magnus.

61
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,523
I do not like his tone.

62
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,115
He can go.

63
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,320
Eh--

64
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,627
Master, do you remember
what we spoke of before?

65
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,758
Of crocodile and fox?

66
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,668
Let us show him
our surprise!

67
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,503
All right, go on.
Show him.

68
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,176
Ahem...

69
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,874
We have a gift for you,
Glorious Excellency,

70
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,817
that we think you will
be very pleased with.

71
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,720
We were going to
make him a body,

72
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,319
moving arms and legs, and do a mime
show with real animals and everything--

73
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,022
Silence!

74
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
Shame on the house
of Ptolemies

75
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,174
for such barbarity.
Shame.

76
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,873
But... you are enemies.

77
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,644
He was a consul of Rome!

78
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,452
A consul  of Rome.

79
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,221
To die
in this sordid way--

80
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,132
quartered like
some low thief--

81
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,329
shame!

82
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,034
Where is
the rest of him?

83
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,237
Eh, um, he has been
cremated...

84
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,509
with all proper
funeral rites of course.

85
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,415
With all decorum.

86
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,442
I shall return
tomorrow,

87
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,751
at which time
you will give me

88
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,087
the man that took
Pompey's life.

89
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,220
Captain says
the wind is fair.

90
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,488
- Good.
- We can leave whenever you like.

91
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,861
You will take half the men,
return to Rome immediately.

92
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:43,232
You shall have the honor
of announcing Pompey's death.

93
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,466
I shall follow you...

94
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,268
when I've settled
things here.

95
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,677
Settled things?
Settled what things?

96
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,345
Civil war is
in the air.

97
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,650
It must be
prevented.

98
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,656
Why?

99
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,786
Let the wretches
fight it out.

100
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,456
War will disrupt
the grain supply.

101
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:15,661
Without Egyptian grain,
Rome goes hungry.

102
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,933
It would be... unwise
not to intervene.

103
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,874
And how will you intervene
with only half a legion?

104
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,810
I do not intend to fight.

105
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,942
I shall merely arbitrate
the various factions.

106
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,474
You make it
sound so easy.

107
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,218
Those various factions are united
only by their hatred of Rome.

108
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,987
He's right.

109
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:46,555
Ptolemy might use you to rouse
the people against a common enemy.

110
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,568
I have conquered Gaul.

111
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,797
I have defeated
Pompey Magnus.

112
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,863
I think I can handle
a small boy and a eunuch.

113
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,808
A small boy
with 100,000 men.

114
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,743
I am aware of that!

115
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,872
He's still
a boy nonetheless.

116
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,613
You seem to forget that
our war is not over yet.

117
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,553
Cato and Scipio
are still at large.

118
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,648
Given time, they will
raise another army.

119
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,659
And when they do
I shall crush them.

120
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,923
I'm glad
you're so confident.

121
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,659
Some would
call it hubris.

122
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,327
It's only hubris
if I fail.

123
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,270
Remember, she is
a princess of ancient blood.

124
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,874
When you find her you will treat
her with the utmost respect.

125
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,409
You must obey her in all
things, within reason.

126
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,920
Understood, sir.

127
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,355
I'm counting
on you, Vorenus.

128
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,790
You have something
to say?

129
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,061
Regarding Pompey Magnus,
sir, I wish to apologize.

130
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,967
It was my actions that
brought him here to this end.

131
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,072
- If I had done my duty--
- lndeed.

132
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,566
Dismissed.

133
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,829
Pompey's murderer.

134
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,466
Alas, he has run away.

135
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,943
Find him.

136
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,281
In the meantime...

137
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,217
these instruments tabulate
the money that was borrowed

138
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,053
by His Majesty's
illustrious father, Ptolemy Xll.

139
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,787
In the name of the Republic,
I have come to collect.

140
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,694
17 thousand thousand drachma.

141
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,933
17?

142
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,996
Absurd!

143
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,667
Four, perhaps.

144
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,304
The tabulation includes
all monies borrowed from Pompey

145
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,077
and other agents of the
Republic now unable to collect.

146
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,517
That is not just!

147
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,247
Post-mortem interests
of this type

148
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,483
are legally entailed
to the presiding consul,

149
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,321
i.e. Gaius Julius Caesar.

150
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,351
- It's law.
- Roman law.

151
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,661
Is there some
other form of law...

152
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,826
you wretched woman?

153
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,929
1,000 apologies.
Forgive us.

154
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,543
There!

155
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:53,278
- There's for your payment.
- So sorry...

156
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,415
His Majesty forgets
he is a vassal to Rome.

157
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,014
Vassal?

158
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,288
Vassal?
I am no vassal!

159
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,795
- I am king! I am--
- Sit down!

160
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,702
Thank you.

161
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,402
When can I expect payment?

162
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:22,176
Your Honor, we have little enough
ready coin for our own needs.

163
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:26,412
Our tax farmers have not been
working as they should because...

164
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,147
Because?

165
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:34,250
Cleopatra's foolishness has
stirred unrest in some parts.

166
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,591
Nothing serious.

167
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:42,901
Well, I do not wish
to appear unreasonable.

168
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:47,167
I will accept 10 thousand
thousand drachma.

169
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,266
Even that amount will
take many days to collect.

170
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,801
In that case, I shall have
ample time to adjudicate

171
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,111
your dispute with
Princess Cleopatra.

172
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,117
Excellent notion.

173
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,915
But alas, who knows where
Princess Cleopatra is?

174
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,922
Oh, do not worry
about that.

175
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,514
I shall find her.

176
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,097
Blood and fire!

177
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,538
It's as hot
as Vulcan's dick!

178
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,913
What a dump.

179
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,644
Gyppo gods must be right
wasters to make a place like this.

180
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,120
Don't speak ill of the gods
in their own country.

181
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,921
Gerrae.
I've seen their gods.

182
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,724
Titus Pullo isn't scared of any
bastard with a dog's head on him.

183
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:48,392
More fool you. These gods
are old and powerful.

184
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,732
Egypt was a great nation
long before Rome.

185
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,668
Was it?

186
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,536
Mumped it up now,
then, haven't they?

187
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,644
Why are we here, anyhow?

188
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,377
Waiting.

189
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,214
Yeah, I know we're waiting, but for who?

190
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,084
I'll know
when I see them.

191
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,250
Heh. Be like that.

192
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,263
"Vassal," he says!

193
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,424
Barbarian scum!

194
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,659
It's simple extortion.

195
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,229
If we do not pay him, he will
put Cleopatra on the throne.

196
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,739
If...

197
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,708
if he could find her.

198
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,711
He is a resourceful man.

199
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,213
He will find her.

200
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,342
She should have died
when we first caught her.

201
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,081
Now it must be done.
She must die.

202
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,647
I agree.

203
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,191
My men could be
with her by nightfall.

204
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,068
Tell him "Wait."

205
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,175
Cleopatra.

206
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,683
Queen Majesty?

207
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,279
Hutto asks to
speak with you.

208
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,789
Slap me.

209
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,067
- Night or day?
- Night.

210
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,569
He may enter.

211
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,045
Majesty...

212
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,454
fresh word has come
from Alexandria.

213
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,193
Speak, worm!

214
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,789
I am most deeply
sorry to say

215
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:44,359
Majesty must prepare herself
for her journey to the afterlife.

216
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,606
When?

217
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,904
Now.

218
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,664
Say your words.

219
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,175
Hello, ladies.

220
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,548
Attack Caesar?

221
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,651
Are you serious?

222
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,657
Why not?

223
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,989
He only has
a few hundred men with him.

224
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,393
How many men
could you rally?

225
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,468
You would be
the liberator of Egypt.

226
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,836
Your name would
live forever.

227
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,841
My mortal flesh should
be less fortunate.

228
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,002
Rome does not
forget an injury.

229
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,274
Oh, forget Rome!

230
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,611
Rome is doomed.

231
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,551
Her people tear at
their flesh like mad dogs.

232
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,522
In 10 years the city
will be a forgotten ruin.

233
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,424
Maybe so, but what
of next year?

234
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,428
Perhaps you're right.

235
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,796
Ergo,
caution is best, yes.

236
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:32,736
Perhaps... you don't
have enough influence

237
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,239
among the people.

238
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,206
And Caesar has
so few men.

239
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,637
I could raise the
whole city with a word.

240
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,150
Think on it.

241
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:56,860
Oh, do you think I could
borrow Septimius for a little while?

242
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,193
I'd be most grateful.

243
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,790
Of course.

244
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,646
Messenger from
Ptolemy Xlll begs entry, sir.

245
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,731
"Ptolemy the Water Bringer,
he of the two ladies,

246
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,966
he of sedge and bee,
King of Kings, Son of Ra,

247
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,033
informs His Most
Grand Honor, et cetera,

248
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,842
that him who bears this message
is him that killed Pompey."

249
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,983
He's handsome enough.

250
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,386
Good, strong chin.

251
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,948
Looks like a mean
old man to me.

252
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,422
More.

253
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,761
Divinity's mortal flesh
turns green.

254
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,324
Give it here.

255
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:13,920
She will look like a reptile
when she arrives at Alexandria.

256
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,867
Weak, I call it.

257
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,216
Weak, am l?

258
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,723
She knows how to beat
her slaves well enough,

259
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,591
but she cannot
throw away that pipe,

260
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,529
- and she knows it.
- lnsolent dwarf.

261
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,293
You know nothing.

262
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,430
Throw it out.

263
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,002
Throw... it out.

264
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,216
Weak, am l?

265
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,628
That Gyppo princess,
now that's good cunny.

266
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,690
Her father's people
rode with Alexander.

267
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,567
- You can't speak of her like that.
- She is, though,

268
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,628
and she wants me badly.

269
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:07,077
Should've seen her when
I done that Nubian. Wet as October!

270
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,581
Pullo, look at me.

271
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,207
She is a princess
of royal blood.

272
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,717
You touch her,
you die.

273
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,720
I'm not stupid.

274
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,483
I'm just saying
she wants me.

275
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,823
Lovely. Lovely.

276
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,889
Nothing like cold,
stinking sweat to seduce a man.

277
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,793
Caesar will think himself
on Olympus with Aphrodite.

278
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,328
Hush, piglet!

279
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,371
What do you know
of seduction?

280
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,107
As long as Caesar
is a man,

281
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,115
I will have him.

282
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,607
She seems very
sure of herself.

283
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,316
I have him...
or I die.

284
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,256
So I will have him.

285
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,888
May it be so, lsis.

286
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,649
I only wish
he were here today.

287
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,484
My womb is
between the flood.

288
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:02,486
A child would come
as sure as spring.

289
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,651
Come.

290
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,158
You, come.

291
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,300
Ahh-ooh...

292
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,606
So red!

293
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,738
Your Highness, how can
I be of service?

294
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,244
Leather. Olives.
Not so bad.

295
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,127
- He will do.
- Majesty commands you will enter her.

296
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,133
I do not understand.

297
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,068
You have coitus with her.

298
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,197
You have it wrong.
Coitus means to make babies.

299
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,731
Exact!
So, make babies.

300
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,212
Don't be scared.

301
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,913
I'm not scared, I just
cannot do what you ask!

302
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,923
It is not--
it is not in our custom.

303
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,950
Roman men are not used
by women in this way.

304
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,827
Come, you will enjoy it.

305
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,423
My queen is
an excellent lover.

306
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,556
What is he waiting for?

307
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,933
He must do
as he is told!

308
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,939
- Let me give you a hand.
- Get off!

309
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:33,467
I must ask forgiveness of
Your Majesty, but I cannot comply!

310
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,741
I am no slave
to be commanded so!

311
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,443
- With all respect--
- He refuses?

312
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:45,855
This... insect
refuses me?!

313
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,519
You dare refuse
the daughter of a sun god?

314
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,223
Pullo, report immediately to
Princess Cleopatra and do as she says!

315
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,235
- Eh?
- You heard!

316
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,432
- What's going on?
- Just go.

317
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,444
Legionary Titus Pullo
reporting for duty, ma'am.

318
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,756
Whooh.

319
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,159
- Gods, that was something--
- I don't want to know.

320
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:42,036
If you value your life,
you won't speak of it again.

321
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:46,635
Why? I was only obeying orders.
Bloody good orders, too.

322
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,111
What do you think Caesar
will do if he hears of it?

323
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,717
I'm not stupid.

324
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,549
I promised the princess.
I shall not speak of it.

325
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,748
You can't keep a secret
to save your life.

326
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,383
You've got a mouth
like a drain.

327
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,359
Whooh.

328
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,970
Princess Cleopatra, sir.

329
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,374
Daughter of
the Two Rams,

330
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,709
mistress of
sedge and bee!

331
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,083
Oh!

332
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,456
Well done, Majesty!

333
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,983
Oh!
Thank you.

334
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,370
Is something wrong,
little husband?

335
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:54,361
How funny you look
in Father's chair.

336
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,663
- I never wanted to harm you.
- Shh.

337
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,899
Of course you did not.

338
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:05,875
It was your gelding
led you astray, no doubt.

339
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,004
- Mistress--
- It must not speak.

340
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,409
It must die!

341
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,925
It was him...

342
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,202
not me.

343
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,400
He led him astray,

344
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,411
not me.

345
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,471
It was him!

346
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,426
Get in formation!

347
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,104
And you, Pullo.

348
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,750
Calpurnia...

349
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,455
She's your third wife?

350
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,825
She is.

351
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,894
Has she given you a son?

352
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,131
She has not.

353
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,240
How sad.

354
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,735
A man without sons is
a man without a future.

355
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,248
I never thought
of it that way.

356
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,682
Sad.

357
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,780
Never mind.

358
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,655
Have you secured
the upriver ports?

359
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,391
You must do so
immediately.

360
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,992
Whoever controls
the ports controls Egypt.

361
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,931
Good advice, no doubt,

362
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,999
- if I wanted to control Egypt.
- Of course you do.

363
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,978
Why else are you here?

364
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:59,449
And why save me so
heroically from death...

365
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,180
if not to use me as your...

366
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,780
puppet queen?

367
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,495
Do you dislike
the notion?

368
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,623
My wishes
are immaterial.

369
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,134
You redeemed me
from captivity.

370
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,468
I am your slave.

371
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,653
Testudo!

372
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,404
- Are you well?
- Well enough,

373
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,633
though I do not sleep.

374
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,234
I write very bad poetry
through the night

375
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,439
and in the morning I give it
to the cook to stoke the kitchen fire.

376
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,970
It's a form of magic.

377
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:54,472
My ill conscience
is transformed into

378
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,486
roast birds
and pastries.

379
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,250
You should have
no ill conscience.

380
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,951
We only did what
we had to do.

381
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:05,792
No doubt Saturn said something
of the sort after eating his children.

382
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:10,399
The question is...

383
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,902
if Caesar does not
return from Egypt--

384
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,166
Oh, Caesar has escaped
tighter traps than this.

385
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,936
He has been besieged in
Alexandria the better part of a year.

386
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,069
Perhaps his luck
has run out.

387
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,636
Well, what fools
we shall look

388
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,945
if we have kissed
the feet of a dead man.

389
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:30,977
With Caesar dead,
that bastard Marc Antony

390
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,989
will be unleashed
to do as he wants.

391
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,857
Very likely, but it isn't
a concern of mine.

392
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,759
I am done with politics.

393
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,264
Self-pity is
all very well.

394
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,029
I'm not unashamed myself.

395
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,128
But we are still senators.

396
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,606
We have responsibilities.

397
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,269
I remind you we swore
an oath of loyalty.

398
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,404
To Caesar,
not to Antony.

399
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,914
Cato and Scipio have
raised an army in Numidia.

400
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,920
If we were to
communicate with them,

401
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,922
we might-- we might--

402
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:09,050
If it isn't Cicero.

403
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:13,620
How strange. I was just
now thinking of you.

404
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,933
I've received
some happy news,

405
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,663
and my first thought was
to come and tell you two.

406
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,668
And here you are.

407
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,610
What a coincidence!

408
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,239
It's amusing how often
that happens, eh?

409
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,249
So I was walking
across the Forum

410
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,217
and thinking of
this particular woman,

411
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,981
who should arrive
right in front of me

412
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,920
but the thing herself.

413
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,715
Savage little
Spanish creature.

414
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,091
Hair down
to her ass. Huh!

415
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,392
Everyone misjudges me,
you know.

416
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,098
I'm a merciful man.

417
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,107
I know that's not
my reputation,

418
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,938
but I am.

419
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,847
Now, everyone's entitled
to a few mistakes.

420
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:09,717
Gods know, I made
one or two myself.

421
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,347
I've done things...

422
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,584
things I'm ashamed
to think of.

423
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:24,930
We are, all of us,
imperfect in our way.

424
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,868
Exactly.

425
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,772
We are, all of us,
imperfect.

426
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,777
Give me your hands,
brother Cicero.

427
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,817
With all my heart...

428
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,347
I forgive you.

429
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,258
I don't know
what you mean.

430
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,658
Nothing escapes me.

431
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:02,998
If a pigeon dies on
the Avantine, I hear of it.

432
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:10,040
So be assured,
brother, if I ever again...

433
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,880
hear your name connected

434
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,715
with murmurs
of treachery...

435
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,394
I will cut off

436
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:28,626
these soft, pink hands,

437
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,692
and nail them
to the Senate door.

438
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,881
- Antony?
- Hmm?

439
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,585
You said you had
happy news to tell us.

440
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,423
Oh. Yes.
Of course.

441
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,397
A courier came
from Alexandria.

442
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,229
Caesar has
lifted the siege

443
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,030
and massacred
the armies of Ptolemy.

444
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,970
He is safe and sound,

445
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,201
and master of all Egypt.

446
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,845
The man is
a damn prodigy, eh?

447
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,600
Atten-hut!

448
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,666
Hail Caesar!
