1
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,861
It's quite good,

2
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,227
but they are far more handsome
in real life.

3
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,586
What are you doing?

4
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,319
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.
Just taking your likeness, sir.

5
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,327
Taking my likeness?

6
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,921
What do you mean?
Speak, thief!

7
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,104
Sir, Aventine Cloth Dyers
Association

8
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,106
are paying me

9
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,108
to do a mural of you

10
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,940
and Lucius Vorenus
in the arena, sir.

11
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,907
Explain yourself.
Why would anybody do that?

12
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,917
Why, sir?

13
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,681
You're famous, sir.

14
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,688
There's paintings of you
all over.

15
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,885
Not good accurate ones
like I'm gonna do, sir.

16
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,197
- Famous?
- Certainly.

17
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,631
- Me?
- The whole city loves you, sir.

18
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,261
You and Magistrate Vorenus

19
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,668
are symbols of brotherly love
and redemption.

20
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,173
If you were in Rome today,
I doubt there's a lady in the city

21
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,573
wouldn't open her doors
for the mighty Titus Pullo.

22
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,376
- Would you let me go, please, sir?
- Hmm? Oh.

23
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,349
Hmm.

24
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,514
Beautiful, hmm?

25
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,516
We own all of it,
as far as the river.

26
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,541
Lovely.

27
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,644
Best get used to it.
Caesar might well

28
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,656
exile me
from the city.

29
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,716
- Just for saving Pullo?
- We'll live off the land like peasants.

30
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,421
- He wouldn't be so mean.
- He might do far worse.

31
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,692
- Like what?
- Nothing.

32
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,699
I'm joking.

33
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,846
I don't suppose we can
lay down a blanket.

34
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,848
I shouldn't think so.

35
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,850
Well, if we ever
do this again,

36
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,852
I'm not wearing my best.

37
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,683
Too soft,
you city girls.

38
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,190
Hush you, I'm down
here, aren't l?

39
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,818
Get on with it
before I die of cold.

40
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,298
How long like this?

41
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,300
Um, till the priest
rings his bell.

42
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,963
Juno help me.

43
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,701
- It's good earth, this.
- It's wet earth.

44
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,712
Dark, loamy,
not much clay.

45
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,714
You can grow anything
in soil like this.

46
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,716
Where should we build
the farmhouse?

47
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,583
That ridge over there. Close
to the water and wood,

48
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,587
good command
of the valley.

49
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,589
In case we get
attacked by Gauls?

50
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,614
You never know.

51
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,528
You're meant
to be pretending.

52
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,530
I am.

53
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,555
You're not.

54
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,532
Shh shh.

55
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,558
Come to Papa.

56
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,864
Bitch.

57
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,048
Well, how was the farm?

58
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,415
Oh, Clarissa, wait till you see it.
It's beautiful.

59
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,887
Oh, it's very fine,
I'm sure.

60
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,890
What's wrong?

61
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,892
- You'll never guess.
- We'll never guess.

62
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,985
- Pullo ran away from the hospital.
- What?

63
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,929
Some carters found him
lying half dead by the Appian.

64
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,899
- He asked to be brought here.
- Here?

65
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,925
He's inside.

66
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,745
Gods beneath us.

67
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,977
He should not have been on his feet,
never mind on a horse.

68
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,314
All his wounds have opened
up, fresh as flowers.

69
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,513
- Poor stupid thing.
- I've given him

70
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,079
henbane to dull the pain
and immobilize him.

71
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,091
If by any chance
he lives,

72
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,150
he shouldn't move
on any account

73
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,594
for at least
10 days and nights.

74
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,900
I'll send him back to the country
as soon as he is mobile.

75
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,427
He won't cause any trouble,
not like this.

76
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,736
Like old times.

77
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,750
Pullo.

78
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,615
Pullo.

79
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,760
Lucius Vorenus, sir.

80
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,126
What are you doing here?

81
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,757
- Where am l?
- Rome, in my house.

82
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,030
You should be
in the hospital at Avernum.

83
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,266
And miss all the fun?
Why am I tied up--

84
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,831
What fun is that?

85
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,810
We're famous, aren't we?
Heroes.

86
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,507
Songs, plays,

87
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,016
pictures on walls, eh?

88
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,518
Damn foolish fuss.
What of it?

89
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,181
You are a slow one,
aren't you?

90
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,690
Women.

91
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,715
Women.

92
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,961
They like nothing better
than a man with a big name.

93
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,397
Please. You are lucky
to be breathing.

94
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,993
Even if you survive your wounds,
Caesar will probably

95
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,800
throw you back in the arena,
and me with you.

96
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:38,566
Do you think he'll do that?
Throw us back in?

97
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,048
I'll find out tomorrow.
I've been summoned.

98
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,380
Oh.

99
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,818
"Women," he says.

100
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,650
If you took
a woman now,

101
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,316
you'd come apart
like an old sack.

102
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,382
Ow!

103
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,093
Just like old times.

104
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,435
I don't mind.

105
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,466
It's good to hear your father
laughing for a change.

106
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,941
Eirene,

107
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,966
it's good to see you.

108
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,976
Fair enough.

109
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,825
If you can't do it,

110
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,832
that's all right too.

111
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,959
Eirene,

112
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,165
- what are you doing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

113
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,901
Don't lie.
What's that in your hand?

114
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,603
We were just talking.

115
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,841
- Talking?
- Catching up.

116
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,610
You fool! What if you killed him?
What then?

117
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,618
Everybody would know
it was you.

118
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:03,952
A freedwoman who killed
her old master-- very nice!

119
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,184
And where would
you go, hmm?

120
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,625
- What would you do with yourself?
- She has a point.

121
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,858
Go to bed. We'll say
no more of this.

122
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,639
She's looking well.

123
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,572
Good night, Pullo.

124
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,422
Juno protect you.

125
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,452
Don't worry.

126
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,296
I can't keep
Caesar waiting.

127
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,408
Eirene, when you finish that,
check on Pullo's dressings

128
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,817
- and change them if need be.
- Me?

129
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,515
You.

130
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,547
And feed him
some porridge.

131
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,764
Thank you.

132
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,287
As of this day,

133
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,948
the Kalends
of February,

134
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,617
our beloved
father dictator...

135
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,127
Gaius Julius Caesar
has decreed

136
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,629
that 100 new men
be raised

137
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,724
to the Senate
of the Republic.

138
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,294
The third day
before Nones,

139
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,862
a public banquet
will be held

140
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:05,138
to celebrate
those senators.

141
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,544
Slaves and freedmen
are not eligible.

142
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,244
Any repetition
of recent disorders

143
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,253
will be punished
with severity.

144
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,755
I shall divert
the river here, you see,

145
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,229
by digging a canal
to the Vatican hills.

146
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,233
Splendid. You shall
divert the river.

147
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,929
Splendid and useful,
I have no doubt.

148
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,938
Indeed. It will
prevent flooding

149
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,135
and give easier access
to the Fields of Mars.

150
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,575
And on the reclaimed land
I shall build

151
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,512
new civic offices
for the courts.

152
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,515
I shall also construct

153
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,517
a temple
to Venus Birthgiver.

154
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,519
Another temple--
excellent.

155
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,783
But if we might
for the moment speak

156
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,588
of this expansion
of the Senate?

157
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,617
- We might.
- Ah.

158
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,629
Gauls and Celts,
old boy.

159
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:01,064
Long-haired Gauls
and blue-faced Celts.

160
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,864
You're joking,
of course.

161
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,598
He is not joking.

162
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,505
Gauls and Celts?
In the Senate?

163
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,168
From the tribes that have
served Rome longest,

164
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,111
- the best of their nobility.
- I'm astonished.

165
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,047
Good.
Astonishment is my intent.

166
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,449
Ah, here comes
the hero of the hour.

167
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,818
What, no wreath
of oak leaves?

168
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,846
Shh.

169
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,827
Well now, Vorenus,
what am I to do with you?

170
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,562
Defying my express orders,
you dared interfere

171
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,500
in a legally sanctioned
execution--

172
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,266
an act of gross criminality
and disobedience.

173
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,143
I humbly apologize, sir.
I have no excuse.

174
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,613
You present me
with a dilemma.

175
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,014
By right, I could have you
thrown off the Tarpeian rock.

176
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,546
But the people, simple souls
that they are,

177
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,217
have made great heroes
out of you and Pullo.

178
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,227
If I were to punish you,

179
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,753
the people would be made
extremely angry.

180
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,891
I do not wish to make
the people angry,

181
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,265
ergo, I cannot
punish you.

182
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,361
If I cannot punish you,
I must reward you,

183
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,271
else I shall seem weak.

184
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,104
Listen to this now,
Cicero.

185
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,407
By popular acclaim,

186
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,880
I shall name
Lucius Vorenus

187
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,042
a Senator of Rome.

188
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,955
Good, eh?

189
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,085
Now you're all
astonished.

190
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,357
Vorenus, you look like you've
seen the Gorgon.

191
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,364
Excuse me, sir,

192
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,127
I'm stunned.

193
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,102
What do you say? Will you speak
for your people in the Senate?

194
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,001
I'd be honored to do so,
if you think me worthy.

195
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,009
There's none worthier.

196
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,137
You shall make
an excellent senator.

197
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,376
Very touching.

198
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,351
For the first few weeks,
you will stay close by me.

199
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,981
- Learn the drill.
- Thank you, sir.

200
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,082
Forgive me, but really
I must, as a friend--

201
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,719
I must protest!

202
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,492
A lowly pleb
in the Senate?

203
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,499
That's going too far.

204
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,467
No offense to you,
Vorenus.

205
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,596
I do not wish to jump
in any arenas, Cicero.

206
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,833
I must please the people
in some other fashion.

207
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,399
Build yet another temple.
Kill someone.

208
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,240
The people are
easy to please.

209
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,246
- Not this.
- I wish the Senate

210
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,714
to be made of the best
men in ltaly,

211
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,411
not just the richest
old men in Rome.

212
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,682
An intriguing notion.

213
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,844
You'll make a lot of men
very angry

214
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,846
with your Gauls
and your Celts

215
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,848
and your plebs and such.

216
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,850
I'll have to double
your guard.

217
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,318
That's what I told him.
Will he listen?

218
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,821
Guards can keep my enemies away.
They can do nothing

219
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,087
- about my friends.
- You don't mean me, do you?

220
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,186
I can assure you,
I have no ill intentions.

221
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,197
I know.

222
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,199
Not that you were not
perfectly capable

223
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,360
- of any manner of wickedness.
- Thank you.

224
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,462
But if you were going to betray me,
you would have done it long ago.

225
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,201
Don't think
I wasn't tempted.

226
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,835
So, no more guards then.
You will trust Fortune.

227
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,505
- Very good. Very pious.
- Stop your grizzling,

228
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,946
you old woman.

229
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,348
Who will dare
raise a hand to me

230
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,717
with the ferocious
Lucius Vorenus at my side?

231
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,154
Ah. Clever.

232
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,354
All these years together,
and it still surprises you

233
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,386
I can tie my sandals.

234
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,127
Sleep sound, little man.

235
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,081
Your mother and l
have been thinking

236
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,447
about finding you
that husband.

237
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,452
Hmm?

238
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,454
A senator'sdaughter

239
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,718
cannot be running
around unattached.

240
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,725
Oh, there's no hurry.

241
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,592
Don't worry, we'll find you
a good rich old man

242
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,597
you can wrap
around your little finger.

243
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,599
Beauty like you
can have your pick.

244
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,124
I told you, I don't want
a rich old man.

245
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,569
Of course you do.
Just think of all those

246
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,096
fine dresses and jewels
and slaves you'll have.

247
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,371
I don't care about
such trivial things.

248
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,901
Trivial?

249
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,914
When I was your age,

250
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,382
I had to eat bones
from the gutter.

251
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,544
Dresses and jewels
are not trivial.

252
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,554
They show others
that your people

253
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,056
are rich and powerful
and that you are

254
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,389
Ioved and protected
and valued.

255
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,055
But I want to marry
someone I love.

256
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,828
Love doesn't come unbidden,
you have to work for her.

257
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,065
Strange marriage it would be
if you loved him from the start.

258
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,334
That's right. It takes a while.
Now you be a good

259
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,864
virtuous wife,
and love will come.

260
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,543
Your mother and l, we had our
troubles, didn't we?

261
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,913
- Look at us now.
- Happy as you like.

262
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,679
I suppose.

263
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,209
So...

264
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,779
a good rich old man
it is then.

265
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,620
Hmm?

266
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,468
I was about to wake you.

267
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,481
Wherever you were,
you were not enjoying yourself.

268
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,818
It was another
dream of omens.

269
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,310
You're becoming
quite the oracle.

270
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,324
Shall I send
for some willow water?

271
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,020
- You'll sleep better.
- I was in the country.

272
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,622
Please, I have had
such dreams for years.

273
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,156
Bloody rain,
black dogs,

274
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,692
hooded ferrymen--
for years.

275
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,898
Here I am,
still alive and well.

276
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,533
I've never had
such dreams before now.

277
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,639
What am I to do?

278
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,876
Should I quit Rome
and hide

279
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,850
because you have
bad dreams?

280
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,512
Why not?

281
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,249
I'm serious.

282
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,992
Are you not weary
of this toil?

283
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,592
I am. I am
extremely weary.

284
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,928
But there is
much more to be done,

285
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,532
I'm afraid.
Much more.

286
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,134
There's always
more to be done.

287
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,974
To what end?

288
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,518
What end?

289
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,986
Good question.

290
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,717
I shall ask Posca.

291
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,457
Go to sleep, my dear.

292
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,861
Ancestors of the Junii,

293
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,873
we ask for your blessing

294
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,671
on this man
of your blood.

295
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,105
Let his arm be strong.

296
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,776
Let his aim be true.

297
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,821
Let his heart be filled
with sacred rage.

298
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,631
Good boy.

299
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,543
Hello.

300
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,057
Hello.

301
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,740
Hey, Venus,

302
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,765
I have a question
for you.

303
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,343
Guess who I am.

304
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,035
Thanks very much.

305
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,503
It was nice
to meet you.

306
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,529
I can manage from here.

307
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,520
Wait.

308
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,589
So, where is everybody?

309
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,158
I'm sure I saw that one
selling fish in the Forum.

310
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,563
At leasthe Roman

311
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,261
A good Roman fishmonger
is a fine nobleman

312
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,327
compared to some of these
Belgian and Celts

313
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,134
that call themselves
chiefs.

314
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,697
There's one over there
with earrings.

315
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,577
It's good to see you.

316
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,585
It's the end, eh?

317
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,452
The Gauls have invaded.

318
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,652
Well, don't be so glum.
They will return

319
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,126
to their ghastly
mountain hovels soon enough.

320
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,924
Caesar will only
summon them back

321
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,363
when he needs their support
for some fresh outrage.

322
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,299
The red man
shadowing Caesar is

323
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,632
the famous Lucius Vorenus,
one assumes.

324
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,162
- lndeed.
- Affectionate, aren't they?

325
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,174
Might be father and son.

326
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,473
Caesar would have
the humble people think so.

327
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,310
He keeps the wretched man
by his side constantly.

328
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,648
This beast of the fields
is a Senator of Rome!

329
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,348
Do not fret so, Casca.

330
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,414
We timid subjects
of King Caesar

331
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,154
must learn to be
tolerant, hmm?

332
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,530
I believe I shall go home

333
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,532
and stupefy myself
with wine.

334
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,591
Good day to you all.

335
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,631
Old fool.

336
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,886
He knows, I'm sure of it. He knows.
You saw how he looked at us.

337
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,456
Be calm, Cimber. If he knew,
we would be dead already.

338
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,695
He's playing the blind man.
He's waiting for us

339
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,704
- to betray ourselves.
- Exactly.

340
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,798
He's not worried about us!
He thinks we are cowards.

341
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,809
Well, in any case,
we must act soon.

342
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,778
Today he brings in Gauls
and Celts and low plebs.

343
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,906
Tomorrow it'll be Belgians
or freedmen, and he won't rest

344
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,112
until he's turned the Senate
into a bawdy house!

345
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,483
We good noblemen will be
outnumbered by foreign rabble.

346
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,355
We will be degraded,

347
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,156
powerless.

348
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,220
- We must act soon.
- What about bloody Lucius Vorenus?

349
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:50,001
- Lucius Vorenus is a son of a whore.
- You know him personally, it seems.

350
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,161
I know him.

351
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,227
I know him.

352
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,836
Who is Lucius Vorenus?

353
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,571
You remember, Mother,
the low soldier

354
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,875
that jumped into the arena
to save a comrade?

355
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,347
I remember something
of the sort.

356
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:08,375
Well, Caesar's pandered to the mob
and made him a senator.

357
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,786
And when Caesar's
in the Senate,

358
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,847
the dog never leaves
his master's side.

359
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,223
And  a fearsome dog  it is.

360
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,423
So, if we are to reckon

361
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,931
with Caesar
on the Senate floor,

362
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,866
we must reckon
with Lucius Vorenus also.

363
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,699
Kill him as well.
What's it matter?

364
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,705
He is a popular man.

365
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,766
- So? I'll kill him.
- It is most important

366
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,176
that we keep the people
on our side.

367
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,180
We cannot kill
one of their heroes.

368
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,648
That would sully
the whole business.

369
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:42,779
- Only the tyrant dies.
- Kill Caesar in his bed then. He

370
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,312
- doesn't sleep with this man, does he?
- Quintus.

371
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,052
It's not such a bad thought.

372
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,891
We could bribe
some of his slaves.

373
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,126
Buy off his cook. Buy off his taster.
Poison him.

374
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,657
Gentlemen, this is not
some cheap murder!

375
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,340
It is an honorable thing

376
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:08,072
that we do,
and it must be done honorably.

377
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,842
In daylight.

378
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,145
On the Senate floor.

379
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,174
With our own hand.

380
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,219
With my hand.

381
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,528
You're right, of course.

382
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,124
Forgive me.

383
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,295
That's all very well,

384
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,827
but how?

385
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,340
How?

386
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,255
What's wrong?

387
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,158
Are you still awake?

388
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,901
You were worrying
very loudly.

389
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:18,412
I feel like everything
seems to be moving so fast.

390
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,440
It feels like--

391
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,925
I'm--

392
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,325
I'm scared sometimes.

393
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,468
- Lucius Vorenus, was that his name?
- What?

394
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,442
The low soldier
that Caesar made a senator.

395
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,445
Was that his name?

396
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,777
Lucius Vorenus.
Why?

397
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,306
I have heard
the name before.

398
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,354
"My dear friend,

399
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,050
I regret I have not seen
you or yours for some time.

400
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,116
Two families
as entwined as ours

401
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,127
must not be strangers.

402
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,129
Would it be
convenient for you

403
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,858
to come and
visit me tomorrow?

404
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,732
With great affection,
Servilia."

405
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,236
How strange.

406
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,239
Is it?

407
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,241
Why would she want to see me?
She hates me.

408
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:54,177
So do l. It's no bar
to friendship.

409
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,180
What is she thinking?

410
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,205
Nothing to your benefit.

411
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,684
- What will you do?
- I shall accept, of course.

412
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,018
- Is that wise?
- Probably not.

413
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,024
Her rage amuses me.

414
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,652
You shall come
with me.

415
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:13,721
- Why?
- To be my protector, of course.

416
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,733
Who knows what the mad
old turtle will do?

417
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,234
Please don't
speak of her so.

418
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,828
Well she is
a mad old turtle.

419
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,466
Anyway, I thought you were above
such petty emotions nowadays.

420
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,238
I am.
I try to be.

421
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,245
Oh...

422
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,747
you still have
feelings for her.

423
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,182
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- I feel nothing

424
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,651
but pity for her.
And for myself as I was then.

425
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,746
And for you.

426
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,780
Me?

427
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,692
You silly goose.

428
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,105
- Why are you dressed so?
- I'm going to the country--

429
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,339
just for the day,
to get some fresh air,

430
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,347
stretch my legs.

431
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,442
I was thinking of stopping
by the shrine of Sacred Rusina,

432
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,114
asking her if she'll forgive me
for all the bad things I've done.

433
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,090
You think she might?

434
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,958
Forgive me?

435
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,759
Who knows
what the gods will do?

436
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,734
Come along,
if you like.

437
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,975
Senate in session today.

438
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,273
No assemblies
in the vicinity.

439
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,007
No gaming.
No prostitution.

440
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,744
May all the gods
bless our sacrosanct father

441
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,945
Gaius Julius Caesar.

442
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,061
- Good day, Senator.
- Good day.

443
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,893
Sir, sir, a moment
of your time!

444
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,899
Read my petition!

445
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,424
Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar!

446
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,437
My dear Atia,

447
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,133
how wonderful to see you.

448
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,142
Wonderful indeed.

449
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,610
And  Octavian!

450
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,613
You're practically
a man!

451
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,615
I like to think so.

452
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,641
And so handsome.
Come in, come in.

453
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,855
It's looking lovely here.

454
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,880
Have you redecorated?

455
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,927
Pull!

456
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,355
Pull!

457
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,525
Senator Vorenus,

458
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,754
I come about your
grandson Lucius.

459
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,295
...Servilia of the Junii,
and what I tell you now

460
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,393
is the truth.

461
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,349
You're alive!

462
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,114
Answer me,
what child is that?

463
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,203
Where is Vorenus?

464
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,205
He was with us
a moment ago.

465
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,207
Never mind.

466
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,471
Mark Anthony, why don't
you give us a moment?

467
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,413
You must be wondering
why I invited you here today.

468
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,439
I am rather puzzled.

469
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,248
Well, it's important to me

470
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,778
that I be the first
to tell you

471
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,722
what has happened.

472
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,250
Why?
What has happened?

473
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,990
- Trebonius.
- Great Caesar.

474
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,055
I know, Barca, I know.
I have not forgotten.

475
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,157
If I may,
gracious Caesar,

476
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,638
you were going to consider
revoking my brother's exile.

477
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,333
I'm still considering it.

478
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,533
Take your hand off me.

479
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,317
What are you waiting for?
Now! Now!

480
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,820
- Now.
- Now!

481
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,202
- Wait!
- Get off me!

482
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,032
Do it.

483
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,009
Stop it!

484
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,413
What's wrong?

485
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,354
- Where is he?
- Who?

486
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,380
Your son!

487
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,295
Tell me it's not true.

488
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,302
Tell me!
Tell me!

489
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,302
Tell me!
Tell me!

490
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,331
Tell me.

491
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,341
I thought you were dead.

492
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,675
Oh Lucius.

493
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,710
Lucius.

494
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,865
Lucius,

495
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,895
the boy is blameless.

496
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:39,026
Thus ever
for tyrants.

497
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,656
No!

498
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,665
So you see,

499
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,497
the tyrant is dead,
the Republic is restored,

500
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,526
and you are alone.

501
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,900
Would you like
some honey water?

502
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:04,510
I won't, thank you.

503
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,914
Please don't be afraid.
I won't harm you.

504
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,010
Not yet.

505
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,021
Harm?

506
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,421
Why would you
wish us harm?

507
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,425
We've always been
great friends.

508
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,622
- Politics is for the men, I always--
- Not yet.

509
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,529
I will make you
suffer slowly.

510
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,090
Slowly and deeply,

511
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,102
as you made me suffer.

512
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,037
First, I want
to see you run.

513
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,041
Run for your life.

514
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,043
Run to some rathole

515
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,671
in Greece or lllyria,

516
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,910
wherever you like.

517
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,850
I shall come
and find you.

518
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,385
Thank you for the visit.
