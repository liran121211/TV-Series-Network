1
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,376
Dear me,

2
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,879
I've never seen
so many long faces.

3
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,212
It is customary
to be sad at a funeral.

4
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,549
Well, the Republic
is old and infirm.

5
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,249
Death can be a merciful
release in such cases.

6
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,053
You do not mean that.

7
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,822
You don't believe that.

8
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,955
You of all people
shouldn't lay jokes

9
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,056
- about tyranny.
- Oh, I am deadly serious.

10
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,067
It is in all our
interests

11
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,433
to be reconciled
with Caesar now,

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,904
for the good of Rome.

13
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,373
The good of Rome indeed.

14
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,309
As soon as this...
farce is done,

15
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,313
I shall retire
to the country

16
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,941
and wait for the city
to come to its senses.

17
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,349
It is the only
honorable thing to do.

18
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,353
My dear friend,

19
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,355
we have no honor.

20
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,357
If we had honor,
we would be

21
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,121
with Cato and Scipio
in the afterlife.

22
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:15,685
First, Senate will hear
Marcus Tullius Cicero.

23
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:26,304
On this eve of his
most glorious triumph,

24
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,365
I move that
Gaius Julius Caesar

25
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,377
be made lmperator

26
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,141
and granted absolute
power over Rome

27
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,205
for a period
of 10 years.

28
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,871
As some of you know,

29
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,312
Caesar and I have
had our disagreements.

30
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,591
However that may be,

31
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,787
he has shown himself

32
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,626
to be as wise
and merciful in victory

33
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,724
as he was
invincible in battle.

34
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,236
Let this be an end

35
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,037
to division
and civil strife.

36
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,238
I willingly pledge
my loyalty to him,

37
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,079
and I urge you all
to do the same.

38
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,050
I heartily commend

39
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,052
the motion proposed

40
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,714
by Marcus Tullius Cicero.

41
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,336
The motion
is carried unanimously.

42
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,609
Many of you here today

43
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,053
fought against me.

44
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,252
Many of you
wished me dead.

45
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,591
Many of you
perhaps still do.

46
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,393
But I hold no grudges

47
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,128
and seek no revenge.

48
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,332
I demand only this--

49
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,809
that you join with me

50
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,641
in building a new Rome,

51
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,079
a Rome that offers

52
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,675
justice, peace and land

53
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,686
to all its citizens,

54
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,450
not just
the privileged few.

55
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,356
Support me
in this task,

56
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,020
and old divisions
will be forgotten.

57
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,291
Oppose me...

58
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,566
and Rome will not forgive
you a second time.

59
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,939
Senators...

60
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,670
the war is over.

61
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,017
Domina.

62
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,026
Mmm?

63
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,688
Atia of the Julii
is here.

64
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,891
Atia?

65
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,665
Here, now.

66
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,400
She wishes
to see you.

67
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,035
Atia...

68
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,067
in my house?

69
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,380
My dear Atia.

70
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,554
How lovely to see you.

71
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,321
Bona dea.

72
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,502
My poor friend.

73
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,412
What have they
done to you?

74
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,414
You're so sweet.

75
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,382
Come sit down.

76
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,886
I'm very sorry
I haven't visited sooner,

77
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,048
but to be honest, I was far
too upset to face seeing you.

78
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,355
The very idea, it's--
it's too sinister.

79
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,658
A noblewoman stripped
naked and beaten on the streets--

80
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,756
horrible. Horrible.

81
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,858
Tell me truly,
how are you now?

82
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,199
I'm recovering
very well.

83
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,831
Have they found
the culprits yet?

84
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,468
They have not, but justice
will find them eventually.

85
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,501
I'm quite sure
of that.

86
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,474
Would you have
some lemon water?

87
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,182
That would be lovely.

88
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,348
- Brutus is well, I hope.
- He is.

89
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,793
It's so wise of him to choose
submission to my dear uncle.

90
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,354
I was very afraid
he might try

91
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,333
some foolish act
of bravery.

92
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,471
Men are so silly
about their honor. No?

93
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,036
I've come to ask you

94
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,477
if you will sit with me
at the triumph.

95
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,141
Even though I'm being
besieged by sycophants

96
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,446
asking for space,
I thought, "No,

97
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,453
if someone were
to have first choice,

98
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,455
it should be
my dear friend Servilia

99
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,219
who's been
through so much pain."

100
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,693
That is very
thoughtful of you...

101
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,025
but I think I shall not
be well enough.

102
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,002
Well, that's a pity.

103
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,663
- Are you sure?
- I am.

104
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,764
- Well, if you change your mind--
- I will let you know.

105
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,078
People tell me that
Octavia's left the city,

106
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,342
but no one knows where.

107
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,474
I hope there's
nothing amiss.

108
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,452
Not at all.

109
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,920
She's staying at my
cousin's villa in Paestum,

110
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,050
mooning over some young
fool of a poet she's met there.

111
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,458
She'll be back
in time for the triumph.

112
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,418
Brother.

113
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,420
What are you doing here?

114
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,319
I've come
to take you home.

115
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,416
- This is my home.
- This? This is not your home.

116
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,984
I'm happy here.

117
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,331
I don't believe you.

118
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,266
In any case, your
place is with your family.

119
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,895
Bad enough
to run away,

120
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,100
but to these people?
This isn't the healthy way of life.

121
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,131
You call
our family healthy?

122
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:47,009
Our corruption stinks
in the nostrils of Mother Earth.

123
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,742
This is your
foreign priests talking.

124
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,413
They are frauds.
They only want your money.

125
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,320
Priests are nobody.
They are just servants here.

126
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,688
This is
the Great Mother's house.

127
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,159
The Great Mother
wants nothing from me.

128
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,856
- I'm a worm in her sight.
- You are not a worm.

129
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,331
You are a daughter
of the Julii.

130
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,063
It looks very ill,
you running away like this.

131
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,071
Reflects badly
on the whole family

132
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,800
if it were known publicly.

133
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,375
For a moment I thought
you wanted me back

134
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,245
- because you missed me.
- Don't be silly.

135
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,511
We've missed you
terribly.

136
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,518
Your mother
has missed you.

137
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,520
I believe even
the servants and animals

138
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,216
- have missed you.
- And you?

139
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,755
And I.

140
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,897
I've missed you.

141
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,833
I can't go back.

142
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,842
What's done is done.

143
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,538
I forgive you.
Your mother forgives you.

144
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,449
You forgive me?

145
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,973
Mother forgives me?

146
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,384
What if I don't forgive?

147
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,854
Whatever you think
she may have done,

148
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,857
consider the possibility

149
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,587
she did it
out of love for you.

150
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,595
I'll never forgive her.

151
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,065
Be that as it may,
your forgiveness is irrelevant.

152
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,091
You must come home.

153
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,237
I'm sorry,

154
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,000
I will not.

155
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,736
I don't want
to use force.

156
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,076
The priests
will protect me.

157
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,207
They won't.

158
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,217
I've bought them.

159
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,242
Quite cheaply.

160
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,289
I beg you,

161
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,314
Iet me stay here.

162
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,760
What have you done?

163
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,230
Fellow citizens
of the Aventine!

164
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,008
Fellow citizens!

165
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,274
Fellow citizens
of the Aventine!

166
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,745
My name is
Lucius Vorenus,

167
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,090
tribe of Stellatina,
veteran of the 1 3th Legion.

168
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,595
Some of you
may know me.

169
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,266
I bring you
good news.

170
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,895
Caesar has put an end
to patrician tyranny,

171
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,337
and will ensure
that the common people

172
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,809
- be heard once more.
- Go back to Gaul, ginger knob.

173
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,637
I'll not deny it, friend,
I have a Gallic look about me,

174
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,945
but I'm as solid Roman
as you are.

175
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,281
I've shed blood
for Rome.

176
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,287
My father shed blood
for Rome,

177
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,915
as did his father
and his father before him.

178
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,449
My wife-- my wife was
born here in the Aventine!

179
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,622
I am as solid a Roman
as any man here!

180
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,734
If I am elected
as your local magistrate,

181
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,137
I promise
on Jupiter's stone

182
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,505
to strive to make this
an era of peace,

183
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,510
prosperity and justice

184
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,512
for all Aventine.

185
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,639
Tomorrow

186
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,583
Caesar holds a triumph,

187
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,052
a symbol of his love
for the people of Rome.

188
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,681
- Cac!
- Why don't you shut up, you--

189
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,691
Ladylike, madam,
ladylike.

190
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,353
Five days
of feasting and games

191
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,488
as appreciation
for the trust and support

192
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,499
the people of Rome
have given Caesar.

193
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,525
Freedom, more like!
We've given him our freedom

194
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,969
and our honor!

195
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,667
I would not be standing
here on Caesar's slate

196
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,233
if I did not believe,
if I did not know

197
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,802
that he has
only the Republic's

198
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,939
best interests at heart.

199
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,520
"A new era."

200
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,317
"Tomorrow's triumph,
a new era."

201
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:54,417
With tomorrow's triumph,
a new era begins.

202
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,952
For all Aventine.
For all Rome.

203
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,863
- It was good. You did well.
- Thank you.

204
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,117
King of all the Gauls.

205
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,628
Makes you think,
doesn't it?

206
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,524
It does.

207
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,907
Goodbye, old friend.

208
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,417
Do your best to tidy him up.
He looks dead already.

209
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,139
Found you at last,
you bastards.

210
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,903
I've been through
the whole damned army.

211
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,639
The famous Titus Pullo.
To what do we owe this honor, citizen?

212
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,442
Do you come to wish us luck?

213
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,609
Listen, I've got most of my kit,
but I've lost my crest.

214
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,948
Surely someone's got
a spare, you think?

215
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,857
It's only a crest.
It's not like I lost my sword.

216
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,722
Well, you can't
march with us.

217
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,228
You've left the Legion.
You signed yourself out.

218
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,628
I know, but...
13th forever, eh?

219
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,326
It's enlisted men only
in the triumph. You're a civilian.

220
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,835
Civilian?

221
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,997
I'm the hero of the whole
mumping Legion, I am.

222
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,566
I saved your skin more than once.
Shouldn't have to remind you of that.

223
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,736
If you want to sign up
for a few more years,

224
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,645
that's a different story. You can
march with us till your feet are nubs.

225
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,511
Haven't I spilled enough
blood for the 13th?

226
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,312
Don't be like that.

227
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:36,014
I don't fucking make
the rules, do l? I follow them.

228
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,990
It's enlisted men only.
Don't push it.

229
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,492
If you come by after,
I'll stand you some drinks, eh?

230
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,860
Stand me some drinks?

231
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,422
I've got better things
to do than go drinking

232
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,697
- with the likes of you.
- Well, walk on then, citizen.

233
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,363
Walk on!

234
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,240
Right, ladies,
on your feet!

235
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,266
Time to look
like soldiers!

236
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,791
Is this too much?

237
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,885
- Just enough, I'd say.
- I don't know.

238
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,726
I think it's too purple.
I want to suggest purple

239
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,732
without actually
wearing it.

240
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,496
It will look less loud
in direct light.

241
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,333
- What do you think?
- Jupiter in life.

242
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,397
Resemblance is uncanny.

243
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,841
What do you find
amusing?

244
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,850
It's absurd, isn't it?

245
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,717
Dressing up,
playing at being God?

246
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,721
Playing?

247
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,723
I'm not playing.

248
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,850
This is not a game.

249
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,326
As you wish.

250
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,355
It is not a game.

251
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,900
Something more red.

252
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,839
- Is the canal around the circus filled?
- It is.

253
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,775
It was not last night.

254
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,472
- I saw to it at first light.
- Very good.

255
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,141
Make sure the elephants are
given their emetics in good time.

256
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,844
I don't want my chariot
slowed by giant turds.

257
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,925
You are looking
much better.

258
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,691
I am not better,
however.

259
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,590
Well, I must get you
out to the country, perhaps.

260
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,867
Some fresh air and sunshine
would do you good.

261
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,770
This lying abed
is not healthy.

262
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,870
I rise when I have
reason to do so.

263
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,343
Don't loiter here
pretending to be solicitous.

264
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,384
Go to your friend's
obscene display.

265
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,415
Mother...

266
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,787
Go.

267
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,230
Go.

268
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,915
Do you want some color
on your cheeks?

269
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,337
Please, darling,

270
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,862
say something.

271
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,443
This horrid
silent business,

272
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,468
it's most upsetting.

273
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,115
- What did they do to you?
- They did nothing.

274
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,448
She speaks.
There's a start.

275
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,424
They were
very kind to me.

276
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,483
Kind enough to let you
hack away at yourself

277
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,961
Iike a side of pork.

278
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,225
My poor little grump.

279
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,499
Oh, I didn't realize
until now how much I missed

280
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,008
your gloomy presence
around the place.

281
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,131
Domina...

282
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,801
there's a beggar at the door
who says he is Quintus,

283
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,901
natural son of Pompey.

284
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,412
He asks for your son's
protection.

285
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,438
Send him away.

286
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,851
- Take your hands off me!
- Get out!

287
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,445
Brutus!

288
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,013
Scared to talk to me,
eh, coward?

289
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,025
You're a coward,
Brutus!

290
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,721
I swear by Janus,

291
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,230
Jupiter and Juno,

292
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,529
I swear on the grave
of my father,

293
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,902
I, Quintus Valerius Pompey,

294
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,908
I'm going to kill
that son of a whore tyrant!

295
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,910
I'll get Ajax

296
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,912
to deal with him.

297
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,971
- He's a bastard traitor to Rome...
- Wait.

298
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,915
and you're
a traitor too, Brutus!

299
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,199
Pompey's
natural son, eh?

300
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,703
I am.

301
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,070
I gather at least you're
still no friend to Caesar.

302
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,270
I'll burn him alive.

303
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,438
- I will pluck out his eyes, l--
- Shh shh.

304
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,345
Be calm.

305
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:40,351
You're among friends.

306
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,890
All will  be well.

307
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,778
Have him washed and fed.

308
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,289
Caesar! Caesar!

309
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
Glorious Caesar!

310
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,120
The gods
favor you, Caesar!

311
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,930
Caesar! Caesar!

312
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,280
"Tables for 5000 men

313
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,013
will be set up
in the cattle forum.

314
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,487
Slaves and freedmen

315
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,922
are not eligible.

316
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,017
Those citizens
that cannot find

317
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,927
a proper seating place
must leave

318
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,955
when ordered
by the civic officers.

319
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,365
Gaius Julius Caesar

320
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,370
has decreed

321
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,100
in tribute
to their virtue,

322
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,007
each and every
citizen of Rome

323
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,069
will be issued
from the public treasury

324
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,707
the sum
of 100 denarii."

325
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,953
"Further,

326
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:59,218
20,000 deserving
families

327
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,225
will be given farms

328
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,387
on the public lands
around Capua."

329
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,763
"Further,
for the coming year,

330
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,894
all rents--
all rents

331
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,370
on low dwellings
in the city

332
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,373
will be paid in full

333
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,138
by Gaius Julius Caesar."

334
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,145
Very noble

335
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,547
and very nicely expressed,
if I may say so.

336
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,551
Might I have
a quiet word?

337
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,576
Of course.

338
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,483
A quiet word.

339
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,492
Oh, you may speak
in front of Quintus.

340
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,494
As you wish.
It is of Quintus I speak.

341
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,520
The good man has been here
several days now.

342
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,092
Perhaps he grows weary of
entertaining us with his happy presence.

343
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,204
Do not mind him, Quintus.
He has no manners.

344
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,637
He shall stay
as long as it pleases me.

345
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,111
Well, that's
the thing, Mother.

346
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,114
I do not see
in what way he could

347
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,616
possibly please you.

348
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,085
What is his purpose?

349
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,612
Does he help you
to write poetry?

350
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,319
- He has a good ear.
- lndeed? Hmm.

351
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,193
- You surprise me.
- He has fire in him.

352
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,528
It warms me.

353
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,056
Light more lamps
if you are cold!

354
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,867
It looks very ill to keep
a son of Pompey in our house.

355
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,397
And we should strike
such fine figures otherwise!

356
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,781
So you see,
the fourth clause

357
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,848
of the previous statute only
applies in cases of fire and flood,

358
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,087
unless otherwise stipulated
in the appendix.

359
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,425
- Do you see?
- Not clearly.

360
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,092
I'm not sure I can
explain it in simpler terms.

361
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,328
Surely this can wait
until after the election.

362
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,894
There's no point
learning all this if I lose.

363
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,735
You will not lose.

364
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,708
You're very sure of that.
There are other candidates.

365
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,276
I believe I warned you
about mocking me.

366
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,044
Forgive me, sir. I had thought
you understood the system.

367
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,053
The other candidates
are straw men.

368
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,078
Straw men?

369
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:14,353
It saves a great deal
of useless strife

370
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,883
if there's no opposition,
but it would look ill

371
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,453
if Caesar's man was
the only one standing.

372
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,731
These facts
disturb you somehow?

373
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,761
The elections are sanctioned
by Jupiter Capitolinus.

374
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,602
They are sacred.

375
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,803
Caesar also is sanctioned
by Jupiter, is he not?

376
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,745
By augury,
by triumph,

377
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,407
by acclaim
of the people.

378
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,610
Anything he does
is sacred.

379
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,643
In a way,
he is a demigod.

380
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,020
For one day only.

381
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,220
For the rest, he is
a mortal man like you and me.

382
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,524
Mortal or not, he is trying
to save the Republic.

383
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,689
By corrupting
the elections?

384
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,700
The Roman people are not
crying out for clean elections.

385
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,702
They are crying out
for jobs.

386
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,931
They are crying out
for clean water, for food,

387
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,440
for stability and peace.

388
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,341
You can do great things
for your people.

389
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,368
You can help

390
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,813
save the Republic.

391
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,818
Or you can go back to your shop
and resume selling mutton and pig,

392
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,755
have dirty hands
but a clean conscience.

393
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,192
So what do you say?

394
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,472
Say to what?

395
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,701
You haven't heard
a word I've been saying.

396
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,733
Is everything all right?

397
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,768
Forgive me.

398
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,014
So what was it
you needed?

399
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,348
I want to free Eirene,
take her off to the country,

400
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,414
- if you'll lend me some money.
- Of course.

401
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,052
And I'll need you to come
with me to the slave registry,

402
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,689
- to vouch your name for my ownership.
- Slow down. Why are you freeing Eirene?

403
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,857
- Can't marry her otherwise.
- Marry her?

404
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,570
Look, I've--

405
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,630
I've been feeling
strange and low

406
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,666
and empty
these last months, and...

407
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,244
anyway, I've puzzled it out,
and I realized what it was.

408
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,818
I love Eirene.

409
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,287
I love her, and I want her
to bear my children

410
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,313
and be my wife, and...

411
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,460
Congratulations,
I suppose.

412
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,966
So you'll be going
to the country, you say?

413
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,973
Leaving Rome?

414
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,975
Rome's no place for me.

415
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,705
I need clean air,
room to move.

416
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,543
And what will you do
when you get there?

417
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,106
There's always work
for a good man with a sword.

418
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,052
Well, as long
as you're sure.

419
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,847
Oh, I've thought it
through.

420
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,486
I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

421
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,825
I'm happy for you.

422
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,799
I hope you find
your path.

423
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,268
Still here?
I thought you were

424
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,709
retiring to the country
as a point of honor.

425
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,372
You do right
to mock me.

426
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,608
You make me feel small.

427
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,982
A joke, old man, a joke.
I'm always happy for your company.

428
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,182
So, why didn't you
tell me beforehand?

429
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,190
I could have been
of assistance perhaps.

430
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,784
What are you
talking about?

431
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,294
Everyone is reading it!

432
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,093
I saw some temple
prostitutes with a copy.

433
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,533
"A call to virtue."

434
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,867
The writing is... adequate,
which is something

435
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,963
we should talk about,
but the sentiments are

436
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,974
full of grace
and bravery.

437
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,841
"Sons of the Republic,
the blood of our forefathers

438
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,642
calls you to honor the memory
and emulate the deeds

439
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,082
of Porcius Cato,
the last true Roman."

440
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,085
Who wrote this?

441
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,110
You did.

442
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,018
Gods beneath us!

443
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,729
Mother!

444
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,758
Mother, have you seen this?

445
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,771
This lunacy?

446
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,365
Of course I've seen it.
It's not lunacy.

447
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,002
It is a cogent defense
of Republican principles

448
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,672
against the forces
of tyranny.

449
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,682
I am rather
proud of it.

450
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,707
You wrote this?

451
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,719
In my name?

452
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,085
Cassius contributed

453
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,090
several nice
turns of phrase.

454
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,092
You know Cassius,
of course.

455
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,754
Of course.
Delighted.

456
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,127
Quintus.

457
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,462
It's lovely
to see you again.

458
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,866
- It's been too long.
- lndeed.

459
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,870
You will excuse me

460
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,668
if I speak
with my mother privately?

461
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,379
I'm deeply sorry
you feel I have failed you,

462
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,851
but this--
this is going too far.

463
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,218
My name is not yours
to be used--

464
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,223
You haven't failed me.

465
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,225
You can't fail me,
I'm your mother.

466
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,353
- You have failed the Republic.
- Dear gods!

467
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,733
Bring me a pen and paper.
It's bad enough

468
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,395
that you keep that little
madman Quintus in this house,

469
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,200
but this-- this!

470
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,507
- I don't know what to tell him.
- Why don't you

471
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,069
fall on your knees and
kiss his feet and beg for mercy?

472
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,604
- It served you in the past.
- But not you.

473
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,015
Eh? Perhaps you did not
beg hard enough.

474
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,989
You...

475
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,231
you do understand...

476
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,339
he might have me
killed for this?

477
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,981
Rome has fallen into
the hands of a corrupt monster.

478
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,350
You, direct descendant

479
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,719
of the father
of the Republic,

480
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,554
what do you do?

481
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,691
What would you
have me do?

482
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,703
What would
your father have done?

483
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,604
What would his father have done?
Would they bend their knees

484
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,800
- to a tyrant?
- They would take account

485
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,742
of the specific
circumstan--

486
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:43,076
They would chase him
out of the city like any mad dog.

487
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,105
Chased him out?

488
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,847
And how am l
to do that exactly?

489
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,252
You would not be alone.

490
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,518
Ah, these fine men
in the house

491
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,525
are very very good.
I am reassured.

492
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,392
They are good men.
And there are many others,

493
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,556
men of rank and wisdom.

494
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,590
It is not
a dog gone mad.

495
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:07,764
I would rather be mad
than disgrace our name.

496
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,796
No more!

497
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,138
You send your fool
henchmen away...

498
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,137
and forget
this insanity.

499
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,089
- Brutus.
- Ah, Cassius, it's lovely to see you,

500
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,023
but, as you can see--

501
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,288
Of course,
forgive the intrusion.

502
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,693
Perhaps I may visit
another time.

503
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,721
Good. Certainly.

504
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,466
On Jupiter's stone,
you're a full Roman citizen,

505
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,370
and you attest to this man's
ownership of listed property?

506
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,499
I am. I do.

507
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,801
Sign here.

508
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,972
Any kind of mark
will do.

509
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,418
I can write my name
as good as the next man.

510
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,753
Done.

511
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,500
42. 42 up.

512
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,670
Eirene.

513
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,873
Come over here.
I want to talk to you.

514
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,407
I'll leave you to it.

515
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,215
I've been to the registrar
of slaves. You're no longer my slave.

516
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,693
You've sold me?
Oh, please don't sell me.

517
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,696
Don't send me away.
I beg you.

518
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,324
I'm setting you free.

519
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,961
You're free.
It says so here.

520
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,174
Thank you.

521
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,699
Thank you.
You're the kindest man alive.

522
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,204
I love you, sir.
I love you, sir.

523
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,479
Here. Here.
It's a dress.

524
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,509
Um, go try it on.

525
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,851
Let's see
how it looks.

526
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,444
Titus Pullo, sir.
I cannot thank you enough.

527
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,176
Thank me? What are you
thanking me for, boy?

528
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,674
For freeing her. We have
been saving to buy our freedom,

529
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,552
but we never--
to happen so soon.

530
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,557
I cannot tell you
what a gift it is.

531
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,559
You've both been saving?
You and Eirene?

532
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,754
We thought to take
the Vorenus name as ours

533
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,990
when we became freedmen,

534
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,499
but Eirene says
it must be under your name

535
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,865
she becomes my wife.

536
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,068
Wife?

537
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,074
Legal wife, I mean.

538
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,235
We are already married
in our hearts.

539
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,041
Eirene?
My Eirene?

540
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,071
Sir?

541
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,912
Sir!

542
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,747
- Dead?
- Looks like.

543
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,217
- What happened?
- I killed him. I did it.

544
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,981
I can see that, but why?
Why did you do this?

545
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,251
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, though.

546
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,885
It matters to me.
This boy was my property.

547
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,327
- He angered me.
- He angered you?

548
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,160
He-- he and Eirene,
they were--

549
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,661
So what does that matter?
Did you think she was a virgin?

550
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,670
She's still yours
to use as you wish.

551
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,672
I love her.

552
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,674
This is
how you prove it?

553
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,109
This is no charnel house
to kill people as you want.

554
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,545
This is my home.
My home!

555
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,250
Shh.

556
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:17,276
You do this violence
before my children?!

557
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,186
I'm sorry.

558
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,919
- Shh, shh.
- Silence!

559
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,726
I'll pay you back.

560
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,790
Pay me back with what,
you damn fool?

561
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,700
You've got no money
but what I've given you.

562
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,727
But please...

563
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,941
do not call me a fool.

564
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,341
I'll call you what I like.
You're a damn fool.

565
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,345
I don't care
about the money.

566
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,847
It's the disrespect.

567
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,873
Look at what you did!
Look at him!

568
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,509
Shh.

569
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,520
Maybe you're right.

570
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,545
Probably am a fool.

571
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,457
Never was a clever one
like you.

572
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,326
Never demoted, you,
never flogged, never locked up.

573
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,729
Straight to the top.

574
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,733
And here you are,

575
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,167
with your nice, clean,
white toga.

576
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,171
Lovely cloth, that.

577
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,173
Stays clean
no matter how much

578
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,198
you wade in the filth.

579
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,208
- Speak your mind.
- As you will.

580
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,113
Time was, you said Caesar
was a rebel and a traitor.

581
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:23,414
And now, today, he tosses
you some coin and some farmland,

582
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:27,857
and he's savior of the Republic,
and you're kissing his royal ass.

583
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,359
You stand up.

584
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,363
Stand up! Stand up!

585
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,559
I'll not fight you.

586
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,804
Then go.

587
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,829
Go and do not
come back here.

588
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,883
Go. Go! And do not
come back here.

589
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,614
Eirene, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

590
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,724
Stay away from her.

591
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,752
Right.

592
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,556
Sorry.

593
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,307
I had no idea.

594
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,536
I must go now.

595
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:22,443
You-- you do
believe me?

596
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,447
My dear friend,
of course I believe you.

597
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,449
You have never
lied to me.

598
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,610
Besides, why would you
put your name to a thing

599
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,916
- and then deny it?
- Well, exactly.

600
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,684
And anyone-- anyone may
forge my name to a thing

601
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,692
to give it weight.

602
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,524
We shall just have
to become used to it, no doubt.

603
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:42,658
I wonder who it was
that wrote it.

604
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,690
I wish I knew.

605
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,634
Someone of talent.
Anyhow, I've seldom seen

606
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,640
a bad case so well put.

607
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,437
I shall have
to write a reply.

608
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,071
Well, as long as you
and I know where we stand.

609
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,377
Where do we stand?

610
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,851
I hope we are the best
of friends. Are we?

611
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,853
We are, we are.

612
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,856
Brutus, I have
never doubted

613
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,881
your friendship
or fidelity.

614
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,885
Even when
we were enemies.

615
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,995
Titus Pullo.

616
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,997
You look tired,
my friend.

617
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:04,523
- I'm drunk.
- These are hard times for war veterans.

618
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,968
You're right there.

619
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,939
Too many soldiers
back in Rome.

620
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,874
Not enough work to go round.
It's a sad situation.

621
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,877
But it's a crime

622
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,005
to see a man of
your ability unemployed.

623
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,174
I'm doing fine.

624
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,411
I have plenty
of irons in the fire.

625
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,787
Well, if your prospects
don't work out,

626
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,952
you can ask on any street
in the Aventine

627
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,985
for Erastes Fulman.

628
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,226
I will always have
a job for you.

629
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,827
I'm a soldier,
not a murderer.

630
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:45,172
These days, Pullo,
is there really any difference?

631
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,138
Have a drink on me.

632
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,512
When you've sobered up,
come and see me.

633
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,540
We'll talk
a little business.
