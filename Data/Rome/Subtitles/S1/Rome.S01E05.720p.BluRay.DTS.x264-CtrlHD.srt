1
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:03,755
"My dear friend Gaius,

2
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,054
how are we come

3
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,959
to this absurd position?

4
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:15,434
In the interests
of peace and equity,

5
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,767
- I accept--"
- The Senate and People of Rome

6
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,797
have authorized me
to accept.

7
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,503
"...the Senate
and People of Rome

8
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,377
have authorized me
to accept a truce--"

9
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,074
No, not truce.
That would imply

10
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,709
that he is a sovereign
rather than a criminal entity.

11
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,686
Quite right.
A criminal.

12
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,849
"...have authorized
me to accept

13
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,054
a cessation of hostilities...

14
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:45,793
on the terms offered
in your last letter.

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,062
I await your answer."

16
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,160
- Good enough.
- Good enough?

17
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,195
This abject humiliation
is good enough?

18
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,037
We are not men.
We are worms.

19
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,066
Worms is harsh.

20
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,740
Worms cannot run away
as speedily as we do.

21
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,341
Caesar has not
even left Rome,

22
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,181
Gods know why not,

23
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,120
yet his legions
chase us

24
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,090
from town to town
with great ease.

25
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,855
We're more like sheep
than worms.

26
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,022
If our levies had not failed,
if we had money to pay troops--

27
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,726
Yes, but they have
and we don't.

28
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,429
Let us cleave to the matter at hand.
Pompey, you must give

29
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,937
some notion of when you will agree
to meet him in person.

30
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,440
- Never.
- There is no reason for them to meet.

31
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,408
The dispute is between
Caesar and the Senate.

32
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,537
- It is the proper form.
- I'll not meet the man.

33
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,674
Never. Like a son,
he was to me.

34
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,877
What he was like
to you is immaterial.

35
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,079
It is only
by Jupiter's mercy

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,089
that he has not already
put our heads on pikes.

37
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,115
Mercy? Jupiter has
no mercy for cowards.

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,425
- Cato, be careful.
- You'll accept abject surrender--

39
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,658
This is not surrender!

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,397
Pompey Magnus
does not surrender.

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,208
I need time.

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,007
A truce gains us
that time.

43
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,362
Verrus Horta sends
three jars of amber

44
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,060
and informs us he has
left the standard of Pompey.

45
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,127
He entrusts his living
to your abundant mercy.

46
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,401
- Horta?
- Pederast, waxy skin, red hair,

47
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,068
- estates in Tusculum.
- I have him, the wretch.

48
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,136
Send a small bag of money
with a fulsome letter

49
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,976
and make him
a Quaestor or something.

50
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,677
Show such mercy
to every man that deserts Pompey,

51
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,686
you will pauperize yourself.
There's dozens of them coming every day.

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,917
Judicious use of mercy
is worth 10,000 men.

53
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,393
And if my last coin buys
me a throne, it's a fair price.

54
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,157
- A throne?
- Poetic license. What else?

55
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,096
Atia invites you
to dinner tonight.

56
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,157
Again?  Bona  Dea.

57
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,200
- Not tonight in any case.
- What excuse shall I give?

58
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,934
- None.
- This is the second time

59
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,669
you have refused
an invitation from her.

60
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,836
I need not account
for myself to Atia.

61
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:16,076
As you say. Not a sapient choice,
perhaps; but brave, sure.

62
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,448
They say slaves talk of bravery
as fish talk of flying.

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,113
They say that, do they?
How very witty of them.

64
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,783
"Seeking only justice
and peace

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,956
and to avoid the unnecessary
shedding of Roman blood,

66
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,093
Gaius Julius Caesar
has publicly implored

67
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,659
the renegade
Gnaius Pompey Magnus

68
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,071
to accept truce
and lay down his arms."

69
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,673
What are you doing?

70
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,704
It's rather fun, and there's
quite an art to it.

71
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,272
Strange boy.

72
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,615
I have just heard
a very strange tale

73
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,485
about you
from the kitchen staff.

74
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,183
For what possible reason
I wonder,

75
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,852
would you and Caesar
be skulking about in a cupboard?

76
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,760
What? We were--
it was nothing.

77
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,957
Nothing? It doesn't
sound like nothing.

78
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,831
You seduced him,
you sly little fox.

79
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,029
- I did not.
- I am not clear it is decent,

80
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,436
him being your great uncle,
but who's to say what's

81
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,375
decent in times like these?
In any case, well done.

82
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,073
Let's see Servilia compete
with a soft young boy like you.

83
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,413
- What power we shall wield.
- You have it wrong.

84
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,941
A good lover
is a discreet lover.

85
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,716
He was taken ill. I was helping him
to recover, that's all.

86
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,748
Of course he was, my dove. Now in the
future you must not appear too eager.

87
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,851
A man likes it if you
play hard to get.

88
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,556
- Why don't you leave him alone, mother?
- Now, I have invited

89
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,656
Caesar and Mark Antony
for dinner tonight.

90
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,166
We'll be sure you look especially
handsome--

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,565
I am not his lover!

92
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,570
Do not lie to me.

93
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,129
- You know I detest it.
- I am not lying.

94
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,300
He has an affliction.
A terrible affliction.

95
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,537
Affliction? What affliction?
By whom?

96
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,106
I-- I will speak no more
of it. I swore an oath.

97
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,048
Oath be damned!
I am your mother. Tell me.

98
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,108
Excuse me.
I will not.

99
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,120
Well, that's
very disappointing.

100
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,530
Caesar sends to say
he cannot come this evening.

101
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,264
No matter.

102
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,930
- Why not?
- He doesn't say.

103
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,963
Titus Pullo is sleeping
on the stairs again.

104
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,694
- Has he nowhere else to go?
- He won't be in Rome much longer.

105
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:53,398
Tell me, when is the youth
returning? Your husband.

106
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,340
- Crito.
- When does he return from his droving?

107
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,139
- November. Why?
- I'm selling my slaves today.

108
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,203
There'll be money enough
spare for your dowry.

109
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,977
So when Crito comes home,
you and Lucius can go to him

110
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,678
- and start your married life proper.
- Thank you, Father!

111
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,346
- Thank you.
- We'll be sorry to see you go.

112
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,184
November?
It's so soon.

113
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,691
- They have to go at some time.
- Of course, of course,

114
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,319
- but November.
- It's hard, but it has to be done.

115
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,921
They'll be so far away.
You know how these drovers live.

116
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,330
But Mama, I want to go.
I want to be with my husband.

117
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,027
I know. I know.
Of course.

118
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,933
You must go.

119
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,767
It's just hard.

120
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,300
Morning.

121
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,243
Trouble you
for some water?

122
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,041
Sit down.

123
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,045
- You should be in camp.
- Nothing to do there.

124
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,020
- It's boring.
- Take some bread.

125
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,147
I'll not, thanks.

126
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,488
I'm not feeling too well.

127
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,495
You're drinking too much.

128
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,554
No, it's not that.

129
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,124
I ate some
depraved oysters.

130
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,692
- Where's your girl?
- Girl?

131
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,670
Cac!

132
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,805
I know it's one of these.
I know it!

133
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,340
Stop worrying.

134
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,512
Even if we can't find her,
you can get another.

135
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,615
I don't want another.
I want Eirene.

136
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,353
You'll be off south after Pompey
before long.

137
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,917
You can't take her
soldiering.

138
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,020
Maybe I won't
go back to camp.

139
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,031
My time is
nearly done anyway.

140
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,760
Leave the 1 3th? Why?

141
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,700
- You did.
- You are not me.

142
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,466
You have no talent
for peace.

143
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,701
I can't just leave her.

144
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,972
- You think with your penis.
- It's not like that.

145
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,445
- I've not touched her.
- Then what purpose does she serve?

146
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,938
I just like to look at her.
Makes me calm.

147
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,517
Here she is.

148
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,355
Thank you, Apollo.

149
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,286
The girl is his.

150
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,525
No trouble.
Pay what's owed,

151
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,830
- and the girl is all yours.
- What's owed?

152
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,996
You should be paying me to drink
the pond filth you serve here.

153
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,001
Pullo!

154
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,802
How much?

155
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,375
I'll pay you back
soon as I can.

156
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,907
Do that.

157
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
So what will
you do with her?

158
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,152
- I don't want her.
- Say again?

159
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,290
I don't want her. It's nice of
you to think of it--

160
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,232
But you want a slave.
You keep asking for one,

161
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,259
and here she is. Pullo can't keep her,
and it costs us nothing.

162
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,896
Can't I have one of
your Gaulish slaves?

163
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,566
I've told you,
my Gauls are unseasoned.

164
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,370
Cut your throat as soon
as sweep your floor.

165
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,036
This one's trained up
nice and docile.

166
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,806
What is wrong with her?

167
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,648
- She has strange eyes.
- You drive me insane!

168
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,718
The girl stays.

169
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,597
Keep calm, sweetie.
Keep calm.

170
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,761
How can I be calm when Pullo's
put that little witch to spy on me?

171
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,896
He knows, Rissa,
he knows.

172
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,496
Big simple brute
like that?

173
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,405
If he even
suspected anything,

174
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,967
he'd go straight to Vorenus
and tell him, wouldn't he?

175
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,911
- Course he would.
- You really think?

176
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,312
- He doesn't know nothing.
- Really?

177
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,080
Sure of it. So he saw Evander
round your house.

178
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,984
So what? He's family.
He's allowed.

179
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,286
- That's true.
- You're getting worried over nothing.

180
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,826
Gods, let it be so.

181
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,759
Poor sad wretch gives
everything you asked for.

182
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,358
The Senate
will ratify your status,

183
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,891
you get your triumph,
stand for consul,

184
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,666
and Pompey
shall withdraw to Spain.

185
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,698
He'll suck Posca's cock
if asked nicely.

186
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,142
Too generous by far.
I never thought for an instant

187
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,079
- Pompey would accept such terms.
- You think it's a stratagem?

188
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,514
I doubt it.

189
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,950
He and what few forces
he has are trapped.

190
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,818
He's weak and growing
weaker every day.

191
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,119
We might
crush him at will.

192
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,092
But now that
he has offered truce,

193
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,858
I will look like the
worst kind of tyrant if I attack him.

194
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:16,334
Posca here thinks
I should accept the truce.

195
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,233
- Make peace.
- In exchange for what?

196
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,535
- Peace is it's own reward.
- Snivelry.

197
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,805
The ram has touched
the wall. No mercy.

198
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,642
Pompey has no great army,
but he has the Senate with him.

199
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,843
- He has legitimacy.
- In Rome they are the Senate.

200
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,374
Beyond the walls
they are just 300 old men.

201
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,944
As you say, Antony,
but others will agree with Posca.

202
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,286
They have made
this shameful surrender public.

203
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,224
It will be read
all over ltaly.

204
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,853
If I am not a tyrant,

205
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,658
if I merely seek legitimacy,

206
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,222
why would I not accept
such favorable terms?

207
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,534
He refuses
to meet us...

208
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,266
in person?

209
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,908
Very good. Simple.

210
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,915
Hoi polloi can understand
a reason like that.

211
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,474
He refuses to meet me
face to face.

212
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,487
Man to man.

213
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,853
He refuses to meet me.

214
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,450
Right, that's it.

215
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,518
No truce.
Let's be after them.

216
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,291
Patience.

217
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,992
He's well caught.

218
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,732
We'll leave when
the time is right.

219
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,996
When?

220
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,833
When the time is right.

221
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,073
But we should have
left Rome long ago.

222
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,775
The apple is ripe
for the plucking,

223
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,649
and we just sit here
doing nothing?

224
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,748
Pompey is not an apple

225
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,724
and I am not a farmer.

226
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,693
Call for my guard.

227
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,172
First Spear Centurion
Lucius Vorenus.

228
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,912
I have been looking
for your return.

229
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,579
I'm no longer
in the army, citizen.

230
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,383
I've come
to sell my stock.

231
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,413
Ah, well...

232
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,541
Black blood flux.
Nothing to be done.

233
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,107
- Flux?
- I kept 'em here despite the stink

234
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,584
so you'd know I'd done
you nothing dodgy.

235
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,713
Nobody to blame.

236
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,383
Fortune left you
one at least.

237
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,724
- Auspicious boy that is.
- How much will he fetch?

238
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,526
Oh, a respectable price.

239
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,432
More than enough
to pay the feed bill.

240
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,301
- Feed bill?
- They didn't starve to death.

241
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,107
Move!

242
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,146
- Nothing?
- Not nothing. The boy will fetch

243
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,215
- a good price when he's healthy.
- What's that?

244
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,921
Your father brought him back from
Gaul. What will we do till then?

245
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,088
To keep?

246
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,620
We're selling him as soon
as he gets some color.

247
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,929
- What will we do after that?
- What's his name?

248
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,662
He hasn't got one!

249
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,636
We'll call him Rubio
after my pigeon that died.

250
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,332
We've nothing saved.

251
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,602
Don't worry. I will
think of something.

252
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,468
And  again.

253
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,997
This is a rout.

254
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,377
Shall I be merciful?

255
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,715
I think not.

256
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,989
How will you pay
your debt?

257
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,559
All that I have
is already yours.

258
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,037
What else can I give you?

259
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,040
Don't leave me again.

260
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,509
I never left you.

261
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,396
The men are going
mad from boredom.

262
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,872
Just today I had to cut the hands off
a perfectly good Legionary

263
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,931
for murdering a civilian.

264
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:27,776
Then I had to listen
to a jumped up freedman

265
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,179
raving for hours

266
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:35,050
about one of my centurions seducing his
daughters.

267
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,285
- It all sounds very tedious.
- It is your uncle's fault.

268
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,589
He should've taken
the legions south after Pompey.

269
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,462
The men know it,
and it makes them restless.

270
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,899
Of course...

271
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,270
he pretends
it is a stratagem.

272
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,137
But every dog in camp

273
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,240
knows that Servilia
has unmanned him.

274
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,616
He will not
be parted from her.

275
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,050
I...

276
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,355
as you can tell,

277
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,419
am not unmanned.

278
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,076
Intolerable.
Intolerable!

279
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,640
Calm yourself, Mother, please.
You've become unbalanced.

280
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,653
Why care so much who
he beds? It is trivium.

281
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,951
How you take after
your father-- simple as milk.

282
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,686
If he were not mewling in bed with that
witch he would be chasing down Pompey.

283
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,025
It is not trivium.
The Republic is at stake.

284
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,497
Since when do you care
about the Republic?

285
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,523
I care deeply
about the Republic.

286
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,797
It would be very unwise
to cause trouble about this.

287
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,739
Of course.
I wouldn't lower myself.

288
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,639
Such sordid couplings have
a way of turning out badly anyhow...

289
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,580
by no one's special doing.

290
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,949
- Tutor has arrived.
- Oh good.

291
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,119
Your tutor has arrived
and waits in the rear yard.

292
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,853
Tutor?
What tutor?

293
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,021
It's high time you learned
the masculine arts.

294
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,589
How to fight and copulate
and skin animals and so forth.

295
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,067
There's plenty of time yet
for all that.

296
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,696
Plenty of time for you to bury yourself
in worthless scribbles.

297
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,638
You may read
those old Greek fools

298
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,608
until blood runs from
your eyes, you'll be none the wiser.

299
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,510
I cannot agree. The Greek
philosophers have much to teach us.

300
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,912
Well, here's a Greek
philosopher for you.

301
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,344
I've engaged
that soldier of yours.

302
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,820
- Vorenus?
- Was that it?

303
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,517
Not the sullen Catonian one,
I don't like him.

304
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,652
- The cheerful brutish one.
- Pullo.

305
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,152
That's it. What extraordinary
names these plebs have.

306
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,632
Pullo.

307
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,898
Defend! Shield.

308
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,529
Shield.

309
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,096
Don't wave it about.

310
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,502
Shield.

311
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,512
Enough!

312
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,649
Water.

313
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,523
This is absurd.

314
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,362
I have no soldiery
stuff in me.

315
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,595
And this exertion
brings on a fever.

316
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,934
- I feel it in my spleen.
- You're just not used to it.

317
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,601
It takes time.
I've seen you kill.

318
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,770
- There's plenty of soldier in you.
- It's not the killing.

319
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,372
It's the waving about
of swords I find tedious.

320
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,279
I dare say I can kill
people readily enough,

321
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,943
as long as they're
not fighting back.

322
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,545
Never fear, young Dominus.
We'll make a regular terror of you.

323
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,487
At best I will be
a middling swordsman.

324
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,490
- It's better than nothing.
- There you are wrong.

325
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,049
The graveyards are full
of middling swordsmen.

326
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,029
Best to be no swordsman
at all than a middling swordsman.

327
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,262
Don't do that.

328
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,963
Excuse me.

329
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,908
Young Dominus...

330
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,778
I need your advice
on a delicate matter,

331
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,839
- if you'd be willing?
- I am.

332
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,080
Suppose you saw something
which made you suspect something--

333
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,917
something terrible.

334
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,185
Would you tell the husband
of the suspicious article?

335
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,749
Suppose suspicion of what?

336
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,453
- Another man.
- Ah.

337
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,693
We are speaking of Vorenus
and his wife, I presume.

338
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,724
I never said that.

339
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,299
It seems to me that suspicion alone
is not enough to speak.

340
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,504
Once spoken out, the suspicion
of such depravity

341
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,978
is real enough to do
the work of truth.

342
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,140
And what if
you are mistaken?

343
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,151
Then Vorenus is
dishonored by error.

344
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,382
Facts are necessary.
Without facts, you must remain silent.

345
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,848
I knew you'd hit
the jugular.

346
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,548
Refuses truce.

347
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,712
What now?

348
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,380
What now?

349
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,854
How happy, eh?

350
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,159
To be a slave.

351
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,996
To have no will.

352
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,934
To make no decisions.

353
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,164
Driftwood.

354
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,174
How very restful
it must be.

355
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,414
- Erastes Fulmen.
- Centurion.

356
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,885
I have come
to seek your counsel.

357
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,158
Always happy
to help a friend.

358
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,028
I need to borrow
some money

359
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,557
and I am told you have
friends in the lending trade.

360
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,695
I do.

361
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,468
I do. I only hesitate
because I'm surprised.

362
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,772
You was well found.

363
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,211
My slaves were taken
by the black flux.

364
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,307
But once I raise capital,
I'll go up North and buy some more.

365
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,250
I have good contacts
in Narbo.

366
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,480
- Be needing a big chunk then?
- I will.

367
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,613
I cannot.

368
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,821
Wrong to lead a citizen
like yourself down that path.

369
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,364
Rough business,
moneylending.

370
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,662
Man can't pay,
he may have to suffer.

371
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,827
Was I to introduce you
to a lender,

372
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,430
I would be putting
two wolves into one cage.

373
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,498
To neither's benefit.

374
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,909
You're right.
You're right.

375
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,276
Thank you for your time.

376
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,077
Centurion, there are other
ways to make money.

377
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,516
Man like you,
there's situations

378
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,315
his simple presence
would be valuable.

379
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,878
- A man like me.
- A hard man.

380
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,949
First Spear Centurion
in Caesar's mighty 13th.

381
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,926
- I'm no longer in the army.
- No matter.

382
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,929
Your bearing is enough.

383
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,625
You would lend dignity and
strength to business transactions.

384
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,898
If you like,
I could use you myself.

385
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,871
Show you the onions.

386
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,203
That's good of you,

387
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,539
but I still don't see
what I would do exactly.

388
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,471
You would come with me
to discourage trouble.

389
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,917
No one's going to mess with
a First Spear Centurion.

390
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,421
I'd be a bodyguard.

391
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,751
Good money.

392
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,489
I told you!
I told you!

393
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,195
I'm sorry, I couldn't
help it. I can't--

394
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,034
Damn you! Damn her!
I am your wife.

395
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,666
Me. I am your wife.

396
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,539
Lyde!

397
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,993
That's lovely.

398
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,227
It's not too army-like?

399
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,236
Like a man
of deep business.

400
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,431
I'm no business man.
I'm just a bodyguard.

401
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,397
It's a start.

402
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,789
Please please,
just for me.

403
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,302
What is the matter
with everybody?

404
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,347
Lock him up, girls!
Lock him up!

405
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,375
Ohh! Oy, Calpurnia!

406
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,978
Ooh, yes!

407
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,195
- Calpurnia--
- Do not trouble yourself with denial.

408
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,759
- I did not intend to.
- Be rid of her and we'll say no more.

409
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,500
- Let us not--
- Or divorce will follow.

410
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,969
Perhaps that is not
enough to deter you.

411
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,774
Be that as it may,
I am indifferent.

412
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,017
We cannot divorce now.

413
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,780
Her family's influence will be critical--

414
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,515
I know it.

415
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,490
Bring me out
the smaller scales.

416
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:10,119
- Centurion, you're right on time.
- Citizen.

417
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,721
Why do we not meet
in the Forum?

418
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,893
Forum's only for closing deals,
putting a hand on it public-like.

419
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,636
Enough of that
Teuton droning!

420
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,908
If you want to whistle
like someone's bum boy,

421
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,938
whistle a good Roman
song at least.

422
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,812
And she complained
I was like an elephant.

423
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,482
Tanjit, my honey duck,

424
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,957
- you're looking well.
- Erastes Fulmen.

425
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,358
I kiss your mother's feet.

426
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,727
Please, sit.

427
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,426
Would you like
something to eat, drink?

428
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:52,129
- Wine will do.
- We do not have wine. Milk, perhaps?

429
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,434
Milk?!
Run out of piss, did you?

430
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,267
Humor.
Very good.

431
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,471
I'm sad to have
to come here, Tanjit.

432
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,743
I'm very depressed.

433
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,545
I thought we were
businessmen.

434
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,881
I thought we understood each other,
yet here we are.

435
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,285
Here we are.

436
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,915
I'm only going
to ask once.

437
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,857
Where's my money?

438
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,360
Where's my truffle pigs?

439
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,419
50 pigs you have
as ordered.

440
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,091
50 diseased
and scrofulous pigs.

441
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,965
- And one knows how to find truffles.
- Tricky beasts.

442
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,266
Haven't been eating
acorns, have they?

443
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,329
Fucks them for truffling,
too much acorns.

444
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,035
I will give you one quarter price.
Out of friendship.

445
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,977
You'll give me
every mumping denarius

446
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,242
- you cac-faced cunny!
- Really,

447
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,272
there is no call
for rudeness.

448
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,750
I'm told Hindus live on
after death. Is that true?

449
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,652
Our bodies die
and decay as yours will.

450
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,781
But our souls
live on eternally.

451
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,815
Well, that's nice
arrangements.

452
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,419
- You're not afraid to die then?
- Not at all.

453
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,198
Break his arm.

454
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,968
Break his arm.

455
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,439
Give me my money,
you monkey's cunt.

456
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,498
Kiss my ass.

457
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,543
Cut his throat.

458
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,609
Cut it!

459
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,737
What are you doing?

460
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,488
What happened?

461
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,520
What's wrong?
Tell me.

462
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,230
Erastes Fulmen asked me
to kill a man.

463
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,364
You refused him?

464
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,566
What else was I to do?

465
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,600
- I am no bandit.
- Of course you're not.

466
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,475
You couldn't do
other than you did.

467
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,038
But how are we
to pay the rent?

468
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,777
How are we
to feed the children?

469
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,955
He's here!

470
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,190
I'm so glad!
I thought you might not--

471
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,861
I regret
I cannot stay.

472
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,595
I've come
to say goodbye.

473
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,772
Goodbye?

474
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,539
I'm going south
in pursuit of Pompey,

475
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,569
and we shall not
see each other again.

476
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,916
- What, never?
- Never.

477
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,021
Don't joke so.

478
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,216
I am not joking.

479
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,158
Is this because of some
foolish graffi--

480
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,287
Servilia,
we are done.

481
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,062
How can you say that?

482
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,913
We love each other.

483
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,938
Be assured,

484
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,473
it is not that l
do not love you.

485
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,383
I do this against
my own inclination.

486
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,617
There are, however,
larger issues at stake,

487
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:09,093
and I must do what is right
for the Republic.

488
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,822
The Republic?!

489
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,623
Why so happy, Mother?

490
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,635
No reason.

491
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,136
None at all?

492
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,900
No clever little plan
bearing fruit?

493
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,930
None at all, my poppet.

494
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,375
Nor should you
suggest otherwise...

495
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,275
to anyone.

496
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,679
What's all the fuss?

497
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,484
- We go south tomorrow.
- Excellent.

498
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,685
If we move fast, Pompey will
be eating dust by the Kalends.

499
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,160
You'll remain here
with the 1 3th to keep the peace.

500
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,992
Keep the peace?

501
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,557
The city will be in your charge.
I'll leave Posca to assist you.

502
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,398
That's ridiculous! I'm a soldier,
not a peacekeeper.

503
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,427
You will follow orders,
damn you.

504
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,724
I was considering...

505
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,719
I'm sick and tired--

506
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,392
...I have a farm near here.

507
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,901
Lovely at this time
of year.

508
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,134
I was considering
that I might go there.

509
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,109
Stay for the harvest.

510
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,012
Perhaps you'd like
to join me?

511
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,575
That is very kind,

512
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,610
but I think
I will stay here.

513
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,392
No good will come
of staying.

514
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,420
I don't know.

515
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,398
The sea air is
bracing at least.

516
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,267
If you do not go then
I cannot go, I suppose.

517
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,294
It would look cowardly.

518
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,806
What matter? You would
know it were not so.

519
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,173
Oh, I would know,
certainly.

520
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,169
But I do not have

521
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,478
a grand shining
old name like you.

522
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,312
I must keep my name
well-polished,

523
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,480
else it looks very dull.

524
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,396
- I must stay then
- I'm sorry, old man.

525
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,678
Soldier!

526
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,753
You're on duty.

527
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,784
The general
will see you now.

528
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,503
Copy this.

529
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,631
What do you want,
citizen?

530
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,362
I've reconsidered
my position, sir.

531
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,532
I wish to accept
your offer.

532
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,735
My offer?

533
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,335
Of entry into Evocati.

534
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,370
If same terms
still apply.

535
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,578
I said you could
join Evocati?

536
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,511
With respect, sir,
you did.

537
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,926
What terms did I offer?

538
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,935
Evocati Prefect
first grade,

539
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,960
10,000 sesterces.

540
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,172
That's a generous offer.
One which you declined.

541
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,574
Normally, I would never
make the same offer twice,

542
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,610
but you're lucky.

543
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,645
Cesar is away,

544
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,680
and I am here alone.

545
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,751
And I shall need
good men.

546
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,320
So I give it you,

547
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,162
promotion to Prefect

548
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,930
and 9,000 sesterces.

549
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,973
Thank you, sir.

550
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,740
In return
for my generosity,

551
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,906
Lucius Vorenus,

552
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,314
I expect loyalty.

553
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,341
Loyalty unto death.

554
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,812
Unto death, sir.

555
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,055
Welcome home.

556
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,698
Dismissed.

557
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,344
Put him here.
Domina...

558
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,648
this is one of them that drew
the filthy pictures.

559
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,678
Didn't take long
to make him speak.

560
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,247
Eh?
Creature!

561
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,282
Who hired him?

562
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,022
Timon,
the Horse Jew.

563
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,997
Atia's  man.

564
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,692
Dress me.

565
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,777
- It's done.
- They'll have you back?

566
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,808
They will.

567
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,669
Evocati Prefect
first grade,

568
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,704
9,000 sesterces.

569
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,142
I've sold myself
to a tyrant.

570
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,517
It had to be done.

571
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,254
Thank you.

572
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,466
Gods of the Junii,

573
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,968
with this offering
I ask you to summon

574
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,881
Tyche, Maegara
and Nemesis,

575
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,442
so that they witness
this curse.

576
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,449
By the spirits
of my ancestors,

577
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,483
I curse

578
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:40,896
Gaius Julius Caesar.

579
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,798
Let his penis wither.

580
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,827
Let his bones crack.

581
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,330
Let him see his legions
drown in their own blood.

582
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,570
Gods of the inferno,

583
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,910
I offer to you
his limbs,

584
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,938
his head,

585
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,974
his mouth,

586
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,009
his breath,

587
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,044
his speech,

588
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,080
his hands,

589
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,217
his liver,

590
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,696
his heart,
his stomach.

591
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,721
Gods of the inferno,

592
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,859
Iet me see him
suffer deeply,

593
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,893
and I will rejoice

594
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,064
and sacrifice to you.

595
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,198
By the spirits
of my ancestors,

596
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,803
I curse Atia
of the Julii.

597
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:05,042
Let dogs rape her.

598
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,073
Let her children die

599
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,108
and her houses burn.

600
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,179
Let her live
a long life

601
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,020
of bitter misery
and shame.

602
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,494
Gods of the inferno,

603
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:22,056
I offer to you
her limbs,

604
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,090
her head,

605
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,796
her mouth, her breath,

606
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,398
her speech, her heart,

607
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,933
her liver, her stomach.

608
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,879
Gods of the inferno,

609
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,973
Iet me see her
suffer deeply,

610
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,246
and I will rejoice

611
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,276
and sacrifice to you.

612
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,093
- Here we are then, friend.
- What do you want?

613
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,033
- Tell us what's between you and Niobe.
- Eh?

614
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,969
Niobe?
Nothing. Never.

615
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,632
I swear by Jupiter,
never!

616
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,471
Furies tear my eyes out
if I lie!

617
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,444
What were you doing
when I saw you with her?

618
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,845
My wife--
we were fighting.

619
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:48,318
I went to Niobe
for advice, that's all.

620
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,582
I was crying, if you want
to know the truth,

621
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,816
and Niobe
commiserated with me.

622
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,915
I would never--
I would never--

623
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,198
- Maybe he's telling the truth.
- Lying.

624
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,029
I'm not!
I'm not!

625
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,366
Lying.

626
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,634
If he says you're lying,
then I believe him.

627
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:13,109
This boy is clever
like you don't know what.

628
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,974
- No, please, I beg you!
- Hush.

629
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,003
Don't embarrass yourself.

630
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,855
We know you're lying.
We know it, you understand?

631
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,884
We have to kill you.

632
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,796
- I never touched her.
- Evander, move forward.

633
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,494
Your life is over.
The only question is,

634
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,196
how do you want to die?

635
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,704
We need to hear the truth.

636
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,037
If you persist in lying
to us, we'll torture you.

637
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,202
You'll die only after many hours
of agony and horror.

638
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,145
But give us honesty now,
and you'll go swiftly, painlessly.

639
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,445
- Please.
- Evander, tell the truth.

640
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:01,913
- Torture him.
- Juno's cunt, but you're salty.

641
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,790
And I was worried
about bringing you.

642
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,954
Go on then.

643
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,964
I've never actually
tortured anyone.

644
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,298
- I don't know how.
- You don't know how?

645
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,931
- They have specialists!
- Why not cut off his thumbs?

646
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,134
That's good enough.
It's a start.

647
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,009
Niobe and I were lovers.
I confess it.

648
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,108
Kill me if you must.

649
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,876
Hold.

650
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,356
What else?

651
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,656
Nothing else.
Kill me.

652
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,924
You're lying again.

653
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,490
You stand at Pluto's door.
Will you sully his threshold with lies?

654
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,968
- I am done talking.
- Cut off his thumbs.

655
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,813
The child!

656
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,151
- The child is mine!
- Child? What child?

657
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,021
Lucius.

658
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,821
The baby.

659
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,055
Please, kill me now.
Please.

660
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:49,361
- Lucius, Vorenus' son?
- Niobe's son.

661
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,390
My son.

662
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,174
It's mine.

663
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,763
We have buried
this evil now.

664
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,828
You must never speak
of it again.

665
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,703
Vorenus must never know.

666
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,571
Never.

667
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,770
Never.

668
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,810
Father Mars Strider,

669
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,809
this man has done
faithful vigil for you.

670
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,755
We therefore ask you
to take him under your protection.

671
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,249
May his enemies flee
from him.

672
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,161
May their
city walls crumble.

673
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:30,257
May their cattle
and women be taken.

674
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,200
This man...

675
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,669
is now Evocati.

676
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,359
Sir, they've sailed
for Greece.
