1
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,509
-What's wrong, Mother?
- Ruined.

2
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,137
Ruined!

3
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,080
That idiot
has ruined us all!

4
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,811
We shall have
to leave Rome!

5
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,217
Caesar has crossed
the Rubicon.

6
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,813
He's on ltalian soil
under arms.

7
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,790
It's an act
of gross treason.

8
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,088
With a single legion,
if you please.

9
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,291
So not merely treason,
but suicidal treason.

10
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,826
Will that be all, Domina?

11
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,301
- Have you heard?
- Mmm. Strange.

12
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,138
Afoolishthingtpdo.

13
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,041
One legion.

14
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,842
I wonder what
he's thinking.

15
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,215
I remember back when I destroyed
the lllyrian pirates,

16
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,050
there was one particular
old sea snake--

17
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,817
a Liburnian,
if I recall.

18
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,517
Never mind
the lllyrian pirates.

19
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,355
What is to be done?

20
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,258
I have already
given word.

21
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,762
My legions
are gathering.

22
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,593
And you'll
crush him, yeah?

23
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,226
Without question.
The poor man is dead.

24
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,968
You are to take
our Ubian cavalry and scout

25
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,874
all roads and defensive strongpoints
between here and the city.

26
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,605
Advance until
resistance is met.

27
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,340
If and when civilians
are encountered,

28
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,371
deliver the enclosed
proclamation.

29
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,876
If you encounter no resistance,
go directly to the Forum

30
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,115
and nail it
to the Senate door.

31
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,850
Sir.

32
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,257
There will be no rapine,
pillage or burning.

33
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,889
- Any questions?
- None, sir.

34
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,421
That will be all.

35
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,240
What makes your man
Vorenus so morose?

36
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,141
He is stonewall Catonian.

37
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,271
He thinks we've committed
a terrible crime,

38
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,145
a mighty sacrilege,

39
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,207
and shall be severely
punished by the Gods.

40
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,913
- He may be right.
- It's a crime if we lose.

41
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,888
If we win, it isn't.

42
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,686
I am merely pursuing
my legitimate rights, Antony.

43
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,693
- Of course.
- Do you think we can trust him?

44
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,854
- Who?
- Lucius Vorenus.

45
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,525
Oh.
Deep 13th, him.

46
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,399
He'd follow the eagle
up Pluto's ass.

47
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,085
I told you
not to come here.

48
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,727
I had to see my son.

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,166
You've seen him.
Now go.

50
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,409
And stay away.

51
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,811
Help me, Niobe.

52
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,112
I'm going insane.

53
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,708
You can't forsake me.

54
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,185
I do.

55
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,983
I won't give up.
Don't think I will.

56
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,786
You loved me once,
you will love me again.

57
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,022
I never loved you.

58
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,461
Lie to yourself if you want,
but don't lie to me.

59
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,124
Stay away.

60
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,326
You know you will never
see your husband now,

61
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,994
you know that, eh?

62
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,129
Him and all the rest
of them are doomed.

63
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,230
You don't know that.

64
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,764
Everybody knows that.

65
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,404
That may be,
but I made a vow.

66
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,980
Go.

67
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,208
Go.

68
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,383
I swear to Dis,
if you don't go--

69
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,092
It's all right.
He's going.

70
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,926
Just go.

71
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,760
You promised you would
never see him again.

72
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,169
I didn't want him here.
I told him to go.

73
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,139
It didn't look like that.

74
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,979
You could tell Papa the truth.
It's not your fault.

75
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,004
If you and I spoke to him--

76
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,141
Never.
You have sworn.

77
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,379
You thought he was dead.
Papa will understand.

78
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,149
He will kill us all.

79
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:13,704
You-- you often say that you are
adept with women.

80
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,605
No idle boast neither.

81
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,542
There are girls from Nabo to Thebes
that scream my name by night.

82
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,375
I have no need
of your coital expertise.

83
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,042
My question more concerns
their... affections.

84
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,813
I'm your man
for that to boot.

85
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,216
My wife, she...

86
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,560
You heard what she said,
she hates me.

87
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,859
What's your question?

88
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,230
How do I stop her
from hating me, obviously?

89
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,859
It's not obvious.

90
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,302
I thought you were making her
hate you with a purpose.

91
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,533
That was not my intent at all.
Why would I do that?

92
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,541
I don't know.
You're the clever one, you.

93
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,475
There might have been
1,000 reasons.

94
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,945
I love her,
and I require

95
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,414
that she love me also,
else I am merely her slave.

96
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,474
I cannot tolerate that.

97
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,653
Well, what care you
what she feels for you

98
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,655
if we're all going
to die this week or next?

99
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,022
And so we are, but who will honor
my name when I am gone?

100
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,789
Who will pay Proserpina
and Pluto for my keep?

101
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,593
Who will pour wine
upon my grave?

102
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,066
If it comes to that,
I shall do the honors.

103
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,194
It's the least
I could do.

104
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,466
Thank you.

105
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,030
But it's not
the same thing.

106
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,133
Besides...

107
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,441
you'll be dead too.

108
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,978
I'm planning on having a small party
this evening and I'll need you to--

109
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,782
Are you wearing perfume?

110
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,795
Just a dab.

111
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,297
It's horrid.

112
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,265
Horseshit suits you
much better.

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,292
Now I need you to get more men
to stand guard outside

114
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,600
to greet my guests
when they arrive.

115
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,198
A party? Is that wise,
given how things are?

116
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,801
Perfume, advice--
whatever next?

117
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,039
I'm just saying Pompey's mob
is out for blood.

118
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,639
- It's best to lay low.
- Lay low?

119
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,344
I'm not a lizard.
I will not be intimidated.

120
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,978
As you like.
Cost you extra though.

121
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,853
You've been paid
quite adequately already.

122
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,721
More men cost more.

123
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,725
I will tell Castor
to speak with you.

124
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,390
I don't want more money.

125
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,026
Well, what do you
want then?

126
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,729
You know what I want.

127
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,574
Something like that.

128
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,067
- You forget your place.
- My place is with my family.

129
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,376
Say the word,
and I'll go to them.

130
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,722
Do your job
to my satisfaction and...

131
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,551
I'll see that
you're properly rewarded.

132
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,956
Thank you, Domina.

133
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,772
Pompey's outriders.

134
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,443
His legions
won't be far behind.

135
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,921
Us and the rest of the 13th
will be on crosses by market day.

136
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,686
Thank the Gods my father didn't
live to see his son die a traitor.

137
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,522
Best to die now then, eh?
Go on.

138
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,586
Wait!
We're not here to fight.

139
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,859
"Advance until
resistance is met."

140
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,763
That is our orders.
That is what we do.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,768
Why not? The boys are ready,
aren't you, boys?

142
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,134
Let's have a go.
Come on!

143
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,731
No fight!

144
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,107
No! No fight now!
Damned idiot!

145
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,175
Form up and defend!

146
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,815
Remember your training!

147
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,287
Shields!

148
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,123
- Hold your ground!
- Stand tall!

149
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,393
- Hold positions!
- Stay in place, you cowards!

150
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:20,550
Caesar's scouts are
only 30 miles from Rome.

151
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,520
30 miles?

152
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,682
His speed is uncanny.

153
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,784
Of course, he has
only a very few men,

154
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,421
which makes
a fast pace easier.

155
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,796
He is not leading an army
so much as an armed gang.

156
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,291
It is all highly irregular,
unethical even.

157
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,736
Gods, it is not even
the war season.

158
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,105
Surely he does not think
to attack Rome directly?

159
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,769
I think that is
exactly what he will do.

160
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,437
How can he hope
to succeed?

161
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,106
The problem is,
at this moment,

162
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,083
we have only three legions in arms
for the defense of the city.

163
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,109
Surely, three
is more than enough.

164
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,314
Normally that would be true,
but most of the men

165
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,222
are raw recruits like those
who fled from the scouts.

166
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,351
The rest
are veterans of Gaul.

167
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,328
Caesar's men--
not reliable.

168
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,829
Rome is undefended!

169
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,595
My legions are mustering
as swiftly as possible,

170
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,900
but it will take
at least four days

171
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,931
to assemble a force capable
of defending the city.

172
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,945
Caesar is
two days away.

173
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,313
You touch it
with a needle.

174
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,284
What do we do now then?

175
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,411
We must make a tactical
retreat to the south.

176
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,012
A tactical retreat,
mind you.

177
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,546
Leave the city?

178
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,148
Juno's cunt!
Do you run mad?

179
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,853
You cannot speak to me
in that tone.

180
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,362
My friends, let us cleave
to the matter at hand.

181
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,990
Is there no alternative
to retreat then?

182
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,001
None. We shall
withdraw to Corfinium

183
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,662
and rally
my legions there.

184
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,899
Once they are gathered
and in good order,

185
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,430
we will simply retake
the city.

186
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,036
Caesar has no hope
of reinforcement until spring.

187
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,173
The towns of ltaly will
close their gates to him.

188
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,948
We will have an unassailable
advantage in men and resources.

189
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,786
So in fact, this is not
a humiliating defeat at all

190
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,951
but a rare species
of victory?

191
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,155
Calm yourself, Cato. You lack
understanding of things military,

192
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,788
else you would see
that my actions

193
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,891
have been perfectly correct
at all times.

194
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,233
You have lost Rome
without unsheathing your sword.

195
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
You have lost Rome!

196
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,018
Pompeian scum
at our very door!

197
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,887
It's intolerable.

198
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,757
If Timon and his men weren't here,
they'd be burning down the house.

199
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,591
Oh, they are not
that energetic.

200
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,030
This suicidal rebellion
has turned everyone against us.

201
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,398
I swear,
if Caesar were here now,

202
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,266
I would stab him
in the neck.

203
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,703
- He has ruined us.
- I'm not so sure of that.

204
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,572
But I think Pompey's position
is deceptively weak.

205
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,874
Think think think-- that's all
you do, you silly boy.

206
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,107
All our friends
have abandoned us,

207
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,117
cowards that they are.
We Julii are lepers now.

208
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,349
Let us not exaggerate, not all of
your friends have deserted you.

209
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,788
Andthatwill be remembered.

210
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,724
You are good loyal people.

211
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,023
It's very tempting
to abandon Caesar,

212
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,723
but to do so now, well, that would
look like we're mere...

213
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,925
slaves to fashion.

214
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,199
You're staying
to protect the house

215
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,004
but don't think for a moment that
your master and I will not return.

216
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,273
We will be back by the Calends
at the latest.

217
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,906
And when I do return,
those of you I find

218
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,143
have not done their utmost duty
will pay with their lives.

219
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,047
General,
your escort is ready.

220
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,817
- Gnaeus.
- Mmm?

221
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,125
Durio,
is the escort ready?

222
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,323
- Ready, sir.
- Away then.

223
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,798
Husband,
the treasury?

224
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,461
Yes, of course.

225
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,302
Durio.
You must secure

226
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,899
as much of the treasury gold
as possible.

227
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,969
Take a detachment and open up
the Capitoline vaults.

228
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,344
There's not much time,
so do what you can.

229
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,157
Let's pretend we're
Odysseus and his friends,

230
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,788
creeping out
of the Cyclops' cave.

231
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,492
We must be quiet
as little mice, all right?

232
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,630
Come.

233
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,338
- Sorry about all this.
- Do not say so.

234
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,005
I don't mind
a little excitement.

235
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,504
All will be well,
I assure you.

236
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,347
I have no doubt.

237
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,891
Let's away.

238
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:00,365
And remember, nosound

239
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,064
Break it down!

240
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,174
Here's a mercy.

241
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,837
Instead of living out our lives
in shame and disgrace,

242
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,175
we are to be raped
and beaten

243
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,909
and torn limb from limb
by a raving mob.

244
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,888
These brutes will not
let you pass, I think.

245
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,823
You may stay
the night if you want.

246
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,053
We would be delighted,
thank you.

247
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,543
Wait wait.
Wrong way.

248
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,612
The Appian gate
is to the right.

249
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,487
We're not going
to the Appian.

250
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,321
What?

251
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,705
Of course, your best method
for pleasing a woman

252
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,712
is the warm, beating heart
of an enemy.

253
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,237
Women will say they don't like
it, but they do.

254
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,805
It makes them wet
as October.

255
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,477
That doesn't answer.

256
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,009
Well, failing that,
talk to her.

257
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,851
Talk.

258
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,949
- But of what?
- That doesn't matter.

259
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,755
It's all about
the tone of the voice.

260
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,820
You pretend like you're putting
a saddle on a skittish horse.

261
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,458
"There, honey.
Shh, come now."

262
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,229
You know,
that sort of thing.

263
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,101
- That's all?
- What else?

264
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,767
Oh! Tell her she is
beautiful all the time.

265
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,743
Tell her she's beautiful
every time you see her,

266
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,405
even when she's not.

267
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,414
And what else?

268
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:34,078
Oh! Also,
very important...

269
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,714
when you couple with her, there's
a spot just above her cunny--

270
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,053
it's like a little button.

271
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,559
Now, attend
to that button,

272
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,993
and she will open up
like a flower.

273
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,054
How do you know this
of her?

274
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,495
Allwomen  have them.

275
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,332
Ask anyone.

276
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,805
Ho ho ho, very pretty.
Come up behind!

277
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,039
- Come with us!
- Sit up here!

278
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,071
You can make me happy!

279
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,278
It'll make me happy.

280
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,879
Here you go.
Up you go.

281
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,550
Come on!

282
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,700
I will kill Octavia,
and Merula tends to me,

283
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,438
but if she cannot, and I am
taken alive, then you must kill me.

284
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,174
And then you must
kill yourself.

285
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,614
Your survival
would be inappropriate.

286
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,549
I would not think
of living, Domina.

287
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,348
Octavian, who would you
prefer kills you?

288
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,286
I am old enough
to take care of myself.

289
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,018
Oh, that's
my brave little man.

290
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,787
Servilia...

291
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,317
can my people be
of any assistance to you?

292
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,956
Thank you but I'm sure we
can manage by ourselves somehow.

293
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,363
Very well.

294
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,492
Mother, I would rather
it were not you killed me

295
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,400
if you have
no objection.

296
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,962
Why ever not? You can't still
be angry with me.

297
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,701
- Is that an order?
- Bona Dea!

298
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,231
I feel like you have
never listened--

299
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,541
Cerberus is howling for us,
and still you plague me

300
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,240
with your
ridiculous feelings?

301
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,146
If you had only let
Glabius and I remarry--

302
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,810
Oh, always Glabius!

303
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,048
I spit on Glabius!
I piss on the wretch!

304
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,113
Oh, that's right, Mother,
die as you have lived--

305
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,057
- poison brimming in your soul.
- Listen!

306
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,220
I'll not argue with you. Castor,
be sure to cut Octavia's throat

307
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,322
- before you cut mine.
- Please, Castor, let Mother do it.

308
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,196
I won't deny her
one last pleasure.

309
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,066
- It would be undaughterly.
- Listen!

310
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,768
Consul Gnaeus Pompey Magnus
has left the city.

311
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:17,544
He commands all noblemen
and knights to do likewise.

312
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,284
Those that remain
will be considered

313
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,289
- enemies of Rome.
- Cowards!

314
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,345
You heard, then.

315
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,178
Don't know what good
that will do.

316
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,116
Anyone wants to get in,
they'll get in.

317
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,051
Give us a hand,
will you?

318
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,316
So your man will be back
after all, looks like.

319
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,292
It looks like.

320
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,156
You don't sound
too happy about it.

321
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,630
- Of course I'm happy. He's my husband.
- If you say so.

322
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,133
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,797
I was just talking.

324
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,966
I talk too much.

325
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,943
I don't know, Rissa.

326
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,845
I try my best
to love him, I do.

327
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,918
I don't know whether
I want him to come back.

328
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,390
I would not credit it
if I had not seen it myself.

329
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:37,122
Pompey's men deserting
the city, deserting Rome,

330
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,629
half the Senate ahorse.

331
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,598
A comical sight
no doubt.

332
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,759
Gods.

333
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:48,103
We are in a damned
awkward position.

334
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,971
If we stay...

335
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,273
we are declaring
for Caesar, for rebellion.

336
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,715
And if we go, we-- we are
with Pompey and the Senate.

337
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,309
- There is no middle ground.
- So what is the answer?

338
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,844
Caesar is our dearest friend,
but what he is doing is--

339
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,687
I do not know.

340
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,357
You must decide.

341
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,406
Pompey then.

342
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,138
We must go with Pompey.

343
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,669
The Republic is more important
than any friendship.

344
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,773
- Do you agree?
- It's your decision.

345
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,841
Pompey then.

346
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,351
Pompey then.

347
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,514
We have no time to lose.

348
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,855
Tell your women to be ready
to leave as soon as possible.

349
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm not leaving.

350
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,295
What do you mean?

351
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,560
I've waited eight years
for Caesar.

352
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,863
I cannot leave now.

353
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,267
You cannot stay,
not if I go.

354
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,363
Of course I can stay.

355
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,203
I can do as I wish.

356
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,699
Mother, all who stay
are enemies of Rome.

357
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,213
- Pompey has declared it.
- Caesar might prevail.

358
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,944
Yes, he might rule Rome for a week,
a month, a year even,

359
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,214
but then some other
ambitious man

360
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,118
will kill him
and take his place,

361
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,680
and you then will be
the mistress of a dead tyrant.

362
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,284
Mother, we know
what happens to them.

363
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,885
That is
for the gods decide.

364
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,919
I cannot help
loving him.

365
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,625
A va, Mother!

366
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,792
You-- you are blinded
by untapped lust.

367
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,395
I'll get you a good big Cyrenian
at the market and have done with it.

368
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,809
You'd better go.

369
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,343
Don't be angry with me.

370
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,740
We may be parted
for a long time.

371
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,380
Come.

372
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,442
Goodbye, Mother.

373
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,540
Goodbye, my love.

374
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,590
Your daughter left.

375
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,033
When?

376
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,435
Just now. I put a boy
to following her.

377
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,339
I'll put a stop
to this nonsense.

378
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,982
- Fetch your men.
- What?

379
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,006
Now.

380
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,461
Why have you not
left the city?

381
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,231
I could not leave
without seeing you.

382
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,568
It's not safe for you. Everyone
knows you're with Pompey.

383
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,268
Don't fret.
I'll be gone by sunrise.

384
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,179
- That's all I have.
- Thank you,

385
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,085
but this is not
a robbery.

386
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,653
- Atia.
- I'll give you a moment,

387
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,822
if there are gods
you'd like to speak to.

388
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,198
One favor--
let my men live.

389
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,601
Sorry.
It's orders.

390
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,603
Give me your sword.

391
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:54,403
What are they,
the stars?

392
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,109
Stars? Holes in
the celestial spheres.

393
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,949
Holes through which the light
of the heavens shine.

394
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,454
How big
are these holes?

395
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,183
They're big.

396
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,590
They only seem small to us because
they're hundreds of miles away.

397
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,720
Big enough for a man
to climb through?

398
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,320
I suppose.

399
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,594
But man would never be able
to get up there in the first place.

400
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,035
- I don't see why not.
- How?

401
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,506
He could hold
onto a giant bird.

402
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,474
It doesn't work
like that.

403
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,038
- Why not?
- It's philosophy.

404
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,175
It's hard to explain.

405
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,657
Really, Numa,
that's quite unnecessary.

406
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,691
I beg you stand.

407
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,327
There shall be
no formality here,

408
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,928
not between
old friends like us.

409
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,837
A thousand gratitudes
Atia.

410
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,173
We humbly seek the protection
and friendship of your family.

411
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,110
Sadly, there are some
people who say

412
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,307
that I am
of the Pompeian faction.

413
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,679
Are you not?

414
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,014
All of Pompey's faction
have long since fled.

415
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,419
You stay for fear your factories
and storehouses will be looted.

416
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,616
I assure you,
that's not true--

417
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,625
Castor.

418
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,064
- 5,000 denarii.
- That much?

419
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,328
- l-l--
- Please, let us not be vulgar.

420
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,302
I'll make the arrangements
immediately.

421
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,987
Where is your man Durio?

422
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,889
He is long overdue now.

423
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,826
Durio is
the best man I have.

424
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,453
He won't fail.

425
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,555
But if not, what then?

426
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,294
How do we pay the legions?
How do we feed them?

427
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,428
I have not the least idea.
You fret like a woman, Cato.

428
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:04,306
Durio will return with more than
enough gold to feed and pay the legions.

429
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,368
By any road we'll be back
in Rome before spring,

430
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,812
so stop worrying.

431
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,319
It makes no sense.

432
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,087
We should have been
stopped by now.

433
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,186
Why is Rome
not defended?

434
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,958
Our boys
scared 'em off, eh?

435
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,965
Soldiers of the Republic
do not run,

436
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,526
- so it must be a stratagem or trick.
- Then it's a good trick.

437
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,094
Unless the gods
have abandoned Rome.

438
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,107
If Mars was watching,

439
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,166
he would not allow
such a disgrace.

440
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,575
Well, maybe he was having
a crap and missed it.

441
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,241
It's that sort of disrespect that has
led us to this sad pass.

442
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,911
If the gods are not respected,
then why should they help us?

443
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,849
Still no troops.

444
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,292
They will have flanked us,
I expect.

445
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,318
Perhaps these drovers
know something.

446
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,237
Whoa.

447
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,710
- Salve, citizens.
- Captain.

448
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,010
- You come from the city?
- We do.

449
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,608
- How goes it there?
- You're Caesar's men.

450
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,279
- We are.
- Fortune spreads her legs for you.

451
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,914
Pompey has fled.
The city is yours.

452
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:28,016
- Why would Pompey flee?
- You boys were too fast for him.

453
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,391
He couldn't raise
his armies quick enough.

454
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,090
Him and his men are retreating south,
and the Senate with 'em.

455
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,826
See?
Wrong for once.

456
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,232
Well, uh, enjoy
your victory boys.

457
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,260
- How much do you want for the girl?
- Not for sale.

458
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,569
What's in the wagon?

459
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,939
- Grain.
- Show us, soldier.

460
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,705
There's no soldiers here.

461
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,541
My mistake. You all wear
the soldier's boot,

462
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,707
so I assumed you are
soldiers, but I'm wrong.

463
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,740
But why would nine good
soldiers be guarding a grain wagon?

464
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,776
I don't have
to show you nothing.

465
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,367
Hyah!

466
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,134
My fidelity always,
Domina.

467
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,244
I do not like
to doubt you, Proculus,

468
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,942
but it's an age since I have seen
you at my morning levy.

469
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,416
Perhaps you have been unwell.
Goiters is it?

470
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,885
Ah, uh--
goiters, as you say.

471
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,651
Fat, greedy men
often find it so.

472
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,716
I shall kill an owl that
your good health continue.

473
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,794
Speak sense,
you creature.

474
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,180
What vile trade is this,
bringing corpses to honest doors?!

475
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,050
Take it away!

476
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,885
See what you have done?

477
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,908
The city's unguarded.

478
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,576
It's true then.
The Republic is fallen.

479
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,983
Yet the sky is still above us,
and the earth still below.

480
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,954
- Strange.
- The gods are in no hurry.

481
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,889
They will take their time
in tormenting us.

482
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,188
Let's go back and see what's in
that wagon. Untie that girl.

483
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,251
Not our concern.
We follow orders.

484
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,956
Advance until
resistance is met.

485
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,989
- But that poor girl--
- You will do your duty.

486
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,399
You are a mean bastard,
that's your problem.

487
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,232
You've no love in you.

488
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,535
You can talk sweet as you like to
Niobe, it won't do you any good.

489
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,439
She won't believe a word.

490
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,978
Ercule,
you wake at last.

491
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,041
I was worried.

492
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,984
Water?

493
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,587
My poor baby.

494
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,616
Oh, it was
not a dream then.

495
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,329
Glabius is dead.

496
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,854
He is.

497
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,329
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,509
Why do you look
at me like that?

499
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,107
Like what?

500
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,745
As  if I--

501
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:19,086
- Did you?
- How can you ask me that question?

502
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,886
Did you?

503
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,386
I did not!

504
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,421
And I'm tortured
that you would harbor

505
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,263
- such a horrible notion.
- Look at me!

506
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:41,939
Daughter, I swear on the masks
of all my ancestors

507
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,209
that I had nothing--

508
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,081
nothing to do with the
killing of Glabius.

509
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,447
Who do you think
did it, Mother?

510
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,790
The streets are full
of corpses.

511
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,624
It could have
been anyone.

512
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,587
"These are the words
of Gaius Julius Caesar,

513
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,293
direct descendant of Venus,
Proconsul of Gaul,

514
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,531
Glorious lmperato
of the northern legions.

515
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,095
Citizens,
I have returned to ltaly

516
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,133
with the sole intention of claiming
my legal and moral rights.

517
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,078
I have no desire
for unlawful powers.

518
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,274
I will name
no man an enemy

519
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,681
who does not
so declare himself.

520
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:57,984
Even so, the property of
those enemies will not be appropriated

521
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,149
and their person
will remain inviolate

522
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,751
as long as their opposition
be peaceful.

523
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,921
Moreover, to any man that
has taken arms against me

524
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,831
and now regrets it,
I gladly offer total amnesty.

525
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,335
However, those that continue
to use violence

526
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,338
to oppose my legal rights,

527
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,603
they shall receive that
which they seek to give.

528
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,110
Under the auspices
of Jupiter Capitolinus,

529
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,910
these are the words
of Gaius Julius Caesar."

530
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,313
What are you doing?

531
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,249
I have done my duty
and I have sinned enough.

532
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,912
I resign.

533
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,853
That's desertion.

534
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,288
I am a traitor and a rebel,

535
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,349
why not
a deserter as well?

536
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,190
You can't just leave
the 13th.

537
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,860
Goodbye, Pullo.

538
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,445
To Venus, the birth giver,
I make this sacrifice.

539
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:02,314
I am Lucius of the Vorenian
clan, tribe of Stellatina,

540
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,288
formerly First Spear Centurion
to the Prime Cohort

541
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,188
of the 13th Legion.

542
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,488
I have a wife.

543
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,325
Her name is Niobe.

544
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,824
Venus, let her love me
as I love her.

545
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,973
I give my blood
to make it so.

546
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,587
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

547
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,004
You're very beautiful.

548
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,544
I've come to see that
it may be, through ignorance,

549
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,682
that I have not
treated you as I should.

550
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,123
- As I should treat you.
- Please, don't.

551
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,957
When we married
you had only 13 summers,

552
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,758
and soon enough
I was gone.

553
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:25,193
But now you are a woman,
and I know nothing of women.

554
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,636
Soldiering is all I know.

555
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,971
Which is not useful.

556
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:35,911
I have been sullen
and untrusting and cold.

557
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,642
But I am not made
of stone.

558
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,647
I can change.

559
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,713
I will swear on the life
of my daughter's son.

560
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,089
I will change,
if you would have it so.

561
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,060
Please, speak if you
would not have it so,

562
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,563
and I will leave
without rancor.

563
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:01,026
- It is I have done wrong.
- How so?

564
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,101
I am...

565
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,942
I have not been...

566
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,119
The past is gone.

567
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,522
Can we start again?

568
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,638
Ha!

569
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,306
I applaud you.

570
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,041
You're about to enter Rome
as a bloodstained conqueror,

571
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,278
and yet you look as calm
as a cup of water.

572
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,081
I am glad I appear so.

573
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:19,163
Gracchus,
something more cheerful.
