1
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,439
Perhaps if we retreat
to the coast via Thessaly

2
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,611
we could hold out
until the rains come.

3
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,679
If we go eastward,
they'll be able to cut us off here.

4
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,747
Oh, of course.

5
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,622
It will not do.

6
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,925
Ready.

7
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,430
Mmm.

8
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,092
Maps never
redraw themselves,

9
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,999
if that's what
you're waiting for.

10
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,869
He's right.

11
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,772
We shall just have to fight the wretches
here where we stand.

12
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,673
And  beat them.

13
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,679
Oh, we shall crush them, doubtless.

14
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,711
Dinner for worms,
the whole damn lot of 'em.

15
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,911
Dinner for worms.

16
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,937
Try to avoid
bloodshed this time.

17
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,272
Wait a while and
Pompey can shave you instead.

18
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,903
Torquatus should
have something, no?

19
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,936
A Praetorship perhaps.

20
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,915
If Torquatus is
given high office,

21
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,747
then Varro must be given same,
else we'll see no end of trouble.

22
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,151
But then what
do we give Labienus?

23
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,817
- Macedonia?
- Bythnia. Macedonia to Libo.

24
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,055
Plums for your people and
porridge for the rest, eh?

25
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,759
Macedonia and Bythnia
are not yet ours to bestow.

26
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,791
You are cooking rabbits
that have not been caught.

27
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,396
Our particular rabbit
is cornered, starving,

28
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,271
and has lost
near 2,000 men.

29
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,004
I think
we may safely say

30
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,706
that here is a rabbit
ready for the pot.

31
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,943
- Why so melancholy, Brutus?
- Oh, do I seem so?

32
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,577
- Mmm.
- Forgive me.

33
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,350
No, Caesar's defeat
is a glory--

34
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,486
we cannot endure tyrants--
but I cannot celebrate it.

35
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,792
He was
as my father to me.

36
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,459
I feel for you.
When do we strike?

37
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,492
Strike?
We have already struck.

38
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,766
We have him down,
but he is not dead yet, eh?

39
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,968
- When do we strike the final blow?
- There will not be one.

40
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,375
If we simply keep him bottled up
a month or so more,

41
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,348
the remains of his army will
disintegrate and disappear,

42
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,373
- at no cost to us.
- Is that honorable?

43
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,818
- Mmm?
- Caesar has driven us from Rome,

44
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,345
chased us out of ltaly,
killed our friends,

45
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,290
usurped our Republic.

46
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,591
Surely, dignity and honor demands
we walk in his blood.

47
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,153
Certainly, knee deep.

48
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,755
But you would have hunger
do our work for us!

49
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,462
We must attack Caesar
and kill him under the eyes of Mars,

50
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,335
- else our victory is empty.
- He has sense.

51
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,068
It will look better
at home if we win by force.

52
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,303
You are Pompey Magnus.

53
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,644
You conquer and crush your enemies
as if they were insects.

54
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,082
People will be disappointed
by anything less.

55
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,155
News from Greece.

56
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,489
Mark Antony is safe,
but most of the ships in his fleet

57
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,657
sent in aid of Gaius Julius Caesar
have been lost at sea.

58
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:10,658
Caesar is now surrounded
and severely outnumbered.

59
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,898
The forces
of the Republic and Senate

60
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,464
and of Pompey Magnus
confidently expect

61
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,000
a decisive victory
to follow shortly.

62
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,616
- There you are.
- Here I am.

63
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,586
I ask Timon
for protection,

64
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,784
and he sends me a bunch
of half wits and clowns!

65
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,883
- Dear me.
- Caesar will soon be dead

66
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,019
by every account,
and we shall be undefended.

67
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,428
We may as well be lying
naked in the street!

68
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,456
You must go to Servilia
and ask for a few of her men

69
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,992
- to stand outside for us.
- Why?

70
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,267
So that they can guard
our doors in her name, silly.

71
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,240
I mean why must I go?

72
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,266
Well, as if I would
go begging to Servilia.

73
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,938
- I think not.
- I'll not go begging for you.

74
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,380
Oh, don't be so childish.
It's not as if she'll refuse.

75
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,543
- You think?
- Why would she?

76
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,109
Those lovely gifts
I gave her?

77
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,424
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

78
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,951
- Nothing.
- She said something.

79
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,054
She said nothing.

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,998
You're very arrogant,
that's all.

81
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,934
Think you can buy her friendship
with stud slaves and tortoises?

82
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,459
And  six barrels of ice.

83
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,335
I'd rather not go.

84
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,568
You'd rather not go.

85
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,838
You'd rather be gang-raped
by slavering proles

86
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,708
while your mother's house
burns down around you.

87
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,236
Frankly, I'm past caring.

88
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,216
One day Caesar is winning
and you crow happily,

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,878
next day he is losing,
and I must go a-begging?

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,185
I just want this vile war
to be over,

91
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,056
- one way or the other.
- Octavia, it is over.

92
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,356
That is why you must go
to Servilia's house.

93
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,455
It's a bore, I know,
but there we are.

94
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,472
Lyde.

95
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,753
Very nice.

96
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,383
Don't.

97
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,320
I'm glad to see you.

98
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,422
I've been worried
about you.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,500
No need.

100
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,730
I'm doing very well.

101
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,000
Not as well
as you, obviously.

102
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,209
Do you need money?

103
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,403
I've got money
if you need some.

104
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,415
I'm sure you have.

105
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,145
Turns out your man
backed the right horse.

106
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,383
Fortune loves you.

107
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,389
I don't know if Vorenus
is alive or dead.

108
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,733
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,339
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,241
I didn't want
to be like this.

111
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,305
I'm so tired, Niobe.

112
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,648
I'm tired
of being angry.

113
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,587
I'm tired of...

114
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,613
hating you.

115
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,726
You're all I've got.

116
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,429
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,405
Do you want
some honey water?

118
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,904
You're wasting
your time!

119
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,438
We'll die of thirst
long before we die of hunger.

120
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,748
We could drink
their blood.

121
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,727
- Repeat?
- All these dead men,

122
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,253
we can drink
their blood.

123
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,664
Too salty.

124
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,998
Only make you
more thirsty.

125
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,370
Putrid by now anyway.

126
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,643
Doesn't matter.

127
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,238
Everything will be fine.

128
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,977
This is where we die.

129
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,183
What are you writing?

130
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,622
A message to Niobe.

131
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,649
All  right.

132
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,160
Good idea.

133
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,187
Send my best to Eirene,
will you, while you're at it?

134
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,667
If there's space.

135
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,611
Graces,
don't we look lovely.

136
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,516
If I am to be a beggar,
I will not look like one.

137
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,383
Oh, I am not
objecting, my honey,

138
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,822
though you will remind Servilia of
what an old trout she has become.

139
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,792
I'm just happy to see you
looking so pretty for once.

140
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,193
You do so often insist
on playing the frump.

141
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,314
- I hope your mother thrives.
- She does.

142
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,942
- And your son?
- Also.

143
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,593
- My mother sends me to ask a favor.
- Mm-hmm?

144
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,494
She fears
the consequences

145
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,296
of this last battle
in Greece.

146
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,133
Understandably.

147
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,834
She has enjoyed her ascendancy
a little too well.

148
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,875
She asks you
to lend her some men

149
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,348
to protect our door
in your name.

150
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,413
Of course.

151
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,048
Eleni, send Ajax
and three or four others,

152
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,117
- whoever he thinks best.
- Thank you.

153
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,961
It's very kind of you.
I told my mother

154
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,057
- she should not presume--
- Please.

155
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,159
She shall have
what she needs.

156
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,440
Forgive me.
You are so good to us.

157
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,452
- We do not deserve it.
- Don't.

158
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,560
I mu-- I must look
a fright.

159
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,459
Mmm.

160
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,692
No, not really.

161
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,725
You look lovely.

162
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,673
I better go home.

163
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,144
So soon?

164
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,444
My mother
will be worried.

165
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,116
Well, if you feel
you should.

166
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,325
Octavia...

167
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,831
Thank you.

168
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,277
Send to Rome.

169
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,148
Tell them...

170
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,155
the decisive battle

171
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,657
begins today.

172
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,298
Sir! Pompey's legions
are in the field in battle array!

173
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,704
Thank you, Fulvio.
Have you forgotten how to salute?

174
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,709
I haven't, sir.
No excuse, sir.

175
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,143
Gracchus,
sound assembly!

176
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,409
- Have Xeno saddle my horse.
- Sir!

177
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,716
We will accept battle?

178
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,551
Certainly. Why not?

179
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,717
We are outnumbered

180
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,525
three to one on foot
and five to one on horse.

181
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,689
What uninjured men
we have

182
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,063
are scared
and hungry and desperate.

183
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,864
That is the advantage
we must press home.

184
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,428
I was not aware
irony had military usage.

185
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,532
We must win or die.

186
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,578
Pompey's men
have other options.

187
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,152
Goodbye, Posca.

188
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:10,619
Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar!

189
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,475
Send to Rome.

190
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,500
Tell them
Caesar has won.

191
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,680
Sir! Caesar's men
are coming!

192
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,777
I've cut my hand.

193
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,312
We have to go, sir!
They'll catch you.

194
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,191
It's not deep,
but it hurts.

195
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,594
They will kill you!

196
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,566
It's of no consequence.

197
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,565
Our forces are routed.
What are we to do?

198
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,602
We shall fight again
another day I do not doubt...

199
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,638
- And prevail!
-...and prevail.

200
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,010
But for the present
we must look to our safety.

201
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,747
Our safety is nothing.

202
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,915
We must leave Greece
and look to fresh levies.

203
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,517
- And may one ask where?
- Africa.

204
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,528
We must rally
the cities of Africa.

205
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,621
Africa. Dear gods,

206
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,359
we are fast running out
of continents.

207
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,866
And  coin!

208
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,664
We have taxed
every last coin from Greece

209
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,136
and spent it all.

210
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,298
What shall we use
to buy Africa's loyalty?

211
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,638
- Seashells?
- We need buy nothing!

212
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,166
We are
the Senate of Rome!

213
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,372
We are old men
with mud on our shoes!

214
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,608
We are not beaten
until we are dead.

215
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,412
The Republic lives
as long as we do!

216
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,078
You may fight on
as you wish.

217
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,087
As for me.

218
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,750
I will go from here
and surrender myself to Caesar.

219
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,420
Have you no dignity?
No honor?

220
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,258
Some little I hope.

221
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,730
Not so much
as you of course.

222
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,928
- Caesar will kill you.
- That may be.

223
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,302
I'm not afraid to die.

224
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,399
I'm tired.

225
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,637
I want to go home.

226
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,579
Yes. My feelings exact.

227
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,419
Brutus, without the force of your name,
the cause of the Re--

228
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,655
Do not! Do not talk
to me of the Republic.

229
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,561
If I had known
what wretched company

230
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,497
and rotten food
I would endure,

231
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:11,400
if I had known what
an old fool is Pompey,

232
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,166
I would never
have left Rome.

233
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,344
Forgive my anger.

234
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,180
- I am not myself.
- Think nothing of it.

235
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,120
I merit
your disappointment.

236
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,750
I propose we make
for Amphipoli.

237
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,658
I have men
and money there,

238
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,424
and we can go
by sea to Egypt.

239
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,591
Ptolemy's children are
loyal friends of mine.

240
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,897
Perhaps...

241
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,938
Perhaps it's better

242
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,669
we do not travel together.

243
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,674
Perhaps you're right.

244
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,776
Better.

245
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,245
No doubt.

246
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,488
I don't understand it.

247
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,150
Something should have
turned up by now.

248
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm not meant
to die this way.

249
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,527
- You were misinformed.
- Doesn't seem right.

250
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,601
Still...

251
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,264
it'd be good
to see my mother again.

252
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,274
Do you think
they have a system

253
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,276
- for finding people?
- What?

254
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,074
In the afterlife-- how do you
go about finding people?

255
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,674
- There must be millions of them.
- Must be.

256
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,982
She won't recognize me,
probably.

257
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,858
I was very young
when she died.

258
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,234
Probably give her
a big scare though, huh?

259
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,941
Big, ugly brute coming along
and giving her a hug.

260
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,251
- Look at that.
- What?

261
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,116
That corpse.

262
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,416
See how high it rides
in the water?

263
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,427
The plutonic aether
inflates him.

264
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,452
What of it?

265
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,156
You've not been drinking
seawater, have you?!

266
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,278
- Husband, eat.
- Oh, yeah.

267
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,821
Over here, my dear.

268
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,345
Here.

269
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,893
- Little salty.
- Not at all. It's good, neh?

270
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,863
Delicious, Mama.

271
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,627
Bona Dea,
look at your faces.

272
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,904
Oh, sillies.

273
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,084
Helen?

274
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,676
Helen!

275
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,314
Husband, wake up!
Our people are leaving.

276
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,367
Now now, my darlings.
Don't be scared.

277
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,369
We're on
an adventure, eh?

278
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,031
The first one
to see the sea and cry out

279
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,404
will have a peach
when we get to Amphipoli.

280
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,552
You, your name again?

281
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,713
Eh...

282
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,553
- Lysandros.
- Lysandros, how far to Amphipoli?

283
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,559
Oh, very close.
Close.

284
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,562
We will continue there
as planned.

285
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,726
You're not to announce my identity
to those that we meet.

286
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,359
And if they ask?

287
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,405
Mella.

288
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,101
- Aeneas Mella.
- Hear and obey, Captain.

289
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,110
And who'll pay?

290
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,044
Pay?

291
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,047
You've been paid already.

292
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,481
For guiding,
not for protection.

293
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,485
I have many men
and supplies

294
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,612
and ample coin
in Amphipoli.

295
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,680
- You will be paid there.
- None with you now? Coin?

296
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,818
None! I'll tolerate
no more of your impudence!

297
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,488
No disrespect, Captain.
Only asking.

298
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,363
We go.

299
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,338
You drive me insane
with your wretched muttering.

300
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,365
What is wrong that you must
harass the gods so?

301
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,867
Nothing.

302
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,880
Well, stop it then.

303
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,008
Servilia sends to invite you
to weave with her tomorrow.

304
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,643
Oh.

305
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,814
- I cannot.
- Of course you can.

306
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,619
- I've already accepted.
- I cannot!

307
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,750
I know she's tedious.
I mean really,

308
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,055
weaving,

309
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,086
but we must keep her happy
for the time being.

310
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,097
But--

311
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,208
The sea!
The sea!

312
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,912
Unison. You shall
both have a peach.

313
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,257
Look, Mama.
Dead people.

314
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,017
It's good, huh?

315
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,583
Where do you come from?

316
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,924
Brindisi.

317
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,157
Romans?

318
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,727
I know you.

319
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,294
Where do I know you from?

320
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,442
I have not
seen you before.

321
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,444
I'm sure I've
seen you somewhere.

322
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,673
Leave them water and bread,
we need to be going.

323
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,274
Leave them?
Weak as they are?

324
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,649
I have no time to waste.

325
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,785
Soon be dark anyhow.

326
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,383
We camp here, get to Amphipoli
in the morning.

327
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,394
I insist we go on.

328
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,861
Relax, old man.

329
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,887
We get there.

330
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,737
You rest easy now, boys.

331
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,239
Eat, drink,
get your strength back.

332
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,174
You and me
will be good friends.

333
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,077
Hey! You want
my cock up you

334
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,083
or are you going to
build a damn fire?

335
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,779
I told you
we'd be all right.

336
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,614
There's no pleasing some.

337
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,102
We stop here?

338
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,933
Why so early?

339
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,963
Best to, I think.
It'll be dark soon.

340
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,936
- Who are they?
- How should I know?

341
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,105
Who cares who they are?

342
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:59,116
Sorry. Sorry.

343
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,050
I--

344
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,053
all will be well,

345
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,749
I assure you.

346
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,781
All  will  be well.

347
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,895
Pompey Magnus.

348
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,401
That man looks exactly
like Pompey Magnus.

349
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,403
That's why I thought
I'd met him.

350
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,462
Don't point.

351
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,911
- Never.
- It's hard to believe, eh?

352
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,937
His wife
and sprouts too.

353
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,280
Caesar's going
to drown us in gold.

354
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,478
Thank you.

355
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,115
Cac!

356
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,360
What do we do?

357
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,630
I don't know yet.

358
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,002
Thank you for coming.

359
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,735
Mother insisted.

360
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,439
I understand you want me
to do some weaving with you.

361
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,484
I'm sorry you are upset.

362
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,487
The last time
we saw each other--

363
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,853
It's of no consequence.

364
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,187
Are you fond of weaving?

365
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,193
So did l.

366
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,074
And how is your brother?

367
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,099
- Is he still in Mediolanum?
- He is.

368
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,409
Lovely town,
so I'm told.

369
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,709
- Healthy air.
- Domina?

370
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,740
What is it, Eleni?

371
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,188
Word from Greece.

372
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,714
Caesar has won.

373
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,952
And Pompey's armies
are completely destroyed.

374
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,738
And my son?

375
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,232
No word.

376
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,598
Don't cry.

377
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,392
Oh.

378
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,860
Halt!
In the name of Rome!

379
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,269
Calls himself Rome, now,
does he? Shameless.

380
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,671
Who are you
and what's your purpose?

381
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,675
We are Rome, boy,

382
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,677
what's left of it.

383
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:24,738
Come to surrender
to your chief.

384
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,858
Brutus!

385
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,865
Cicero!

386
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,424
How happy I am
to see you.

387
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,993
I thought
you were dead.

388
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,006
Sir, l--

389
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,907
I am come here
honorably,

390
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,571
with no request
for mercy,

391
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,479
to surrender my arms
and my horses

392
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:02,384
- as is--
- Ssh. We'll have no talk of surrender.

393
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,412
We've merely quarreled a little.
Now we are friends again, eh?

394
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,687
That is
most generous of you

395
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,921
and natural
to your manly nature,

396
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,863
- but I cannot--
- My poor boy.

397
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,866
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

398
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,868
Not at all.

399
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,767
It is I am sorry.

400
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,103
I presented you
with an impossible dilemma.

401
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,439
You did only
what you thought honorable,

402
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,672
I'm sure.

403
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,704
I kiss you for it.

404
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,385
Thank you.

405
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,387
I will not forget
this grace.

406
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,413
- As I was saying, a most generous--
- But what of Pompey?

407
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,323
Tell me he lives.

408
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,019
He lives.

409
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,223
Thank the gods.
Where is he?

410
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,424
He...

411
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,235
He does not plan
to surrender.

412
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,208
That is insane.

413
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,473
He cannot escape.
Where can he go?

414
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,480
Is Scipio with him?

415
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,845
Cato?

416
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,408
They have fled
to Africa.

417
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,412
What am I thinking of...

418
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,392
asking you questions
when you must be

419
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,451
so hungry and thirsty?

420
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,463
Come.

421
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,796
I, uh...

422
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,825
- I think I would rather--
- I insist.

423
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,862
Come.

424
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,210
So with this hand,
otherwise engaged

425
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,372
I had to take
that worm and beat him

426
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,712
with my fists
over and over

427
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,649
and over again!

428
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,332
His father King Ptolemy
Auletes the 1 2th

429
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,600
was a close
friend of mine.

430
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,573
I was always assured
a loving welcome

431
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,042
in Egypt. I remember
on one occasion

432
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,739
I was out hunting
with the King.

433
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,873
We were hunting lions,
you see.

434
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,383
Only the King
was rather a poor bowman,

435
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,390
and we couldn't tell

436
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,554
if the lion
was wounded or dead.

437
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,745
Hello, friends.

438
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,940
Feeling better, neh?
Strong?

439
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,972
Strong enough.

440
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,081
Tell me something.
What's the name of that Roman?

441
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,090
His name is, uh,

442
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,024
Aeneas Mella.

443
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,027
Aeneas Mella.

444
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,859
That's what he said.

445
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,560
What do you hear
of Caesar and Pompey?

446
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,660
They fought,
I heard.

447
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,939
And?

448
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,771
You know who won.

449
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,801
Tell us.

450
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,114
Pfft!

451
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,116
I was going
to let you in anyway.

452
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,881
- What's he talking about?
- You boys are clever fellows, I bet.

453
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,889
Know how to fight.

454
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:03,155
Me and my boys can't take
his people alone.

455
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,754
Us and you together,
no problem.

456
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,492
We go down middle
on the reward.

457
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,500
Not a bad idea.

458
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,502
You can have
the wife and children,

459
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,527
I take the slaves.

460
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,576
Walk away...

461
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,408
- and do not speak of this again.
- I see.

462
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,414
Think you don't
need me, eh?

463
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:27,246
Think you can keep
the reward for yourself?

464
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,684
- Fuck you. Not going to happen.
- Don't.

465
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,486
Fuck you! I gave you
your lives back,

466
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,492
I can take them
away again, easy.

467
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,496
When I am
finished speaking,

468
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,158
you will turn
and run

469
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,167
- that way.
- That way?

470
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,691
What about
this way?

471
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,704
Do not stop until
you are out of my sight

472
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,229
and do not delay,
or I will kill you.

473
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,443
What is wrong
with him?

474
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,672
I am finished speaking.

475
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,991
A bit harsh,
isn't it?

476
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,828
Fair enough deal
he was offering, I thought.

477
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,993
- What is the meaning of this?
- Sir--

478
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,060
Speak up! This man
was in my employ!

479
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,163
- He planned to assault you.
- How do you know?

480
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,174
He asked us
to participate.

481
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,405
You refused, stabbed him
to death on my behalf.

482
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,571
A good friend to me
on such short acquaintance.

483
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,411
- What is your name?
- I am Lucius Vorenus.

484
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,408
Prefect and Evocati of
the 13th Legion of Galius Julius Caesar.

485
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,421
Titus Pullo,
legionary of same.

486
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,423
Salve, Lucius Vorenus.

487
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,085
I am...

488
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,095
Aeneus Mella...

489
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,120
of Pergamum.

490
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,792
Aeneus Mella.

491
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,403
You must consider yourself
under my charge.

492
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,409
I do not understand.

493
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,343
Consider yourself
a prisoner

494
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,869
of the 13th Legion.

495
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,882
I'm just a merchant.

496
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,908
We know
who you are, sir.

497
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,890
I own you now!
Understand?!

498
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,892
You, you,
bury him.

499
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,053
The rest of you...

500
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,553
- don't let them leave.
- Lucius Vorenus.

501
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,590
I must speak
with you alone.

502
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,529
Stay here.

503
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,241
Of course
I do not say I am

504
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,765
who you think I am,

505
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,404
but I have spent
some years in the army.

506
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,574
Perhaps we met
on some campaign or other.

507
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,244
Perhaps that's why
I seem familiar.

508
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,980
Perhaps.

509
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,856
I recall the 13th...

510
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,655
- was at Alesia.
- We were.

511
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:55,756
There's a battle I've always
wished to have seen.

512
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,097
25 miles of works,
wasn't it?

513
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,603
- Nearer 30.
- 30?

514
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,765
- How many men did you have?
- 60,000.

515
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,206
Against--
whoa--

516
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,234
almost double
the Gauls.

517
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,404
At least double.

518
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,812
The best men
of every tribe in Gaul.

519
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,817
Ah.

520
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,819
Caesar can fight.

521
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,480
I'll give him that.

522
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,489
I remember...

523
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,491
when he was
not much older than you.

524
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,016
I sent him
to winter Quarters in--

525
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,393
in, uh...

526
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,422
Oh, where was it?

527
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,399
No matter.

528
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,428
Long time gone.

529
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,878
I must ask you, sir,
if I may.

530
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,850
How did you
come to this road?

531
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,921
Surely...

532
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,423
Pompey had Caesar
at greater disadvantage.

533
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,426
He did.

534
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,428
He did.

535
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,453
It didn't seem
possible to lose.

536
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,057
That's always a bad sign.

537
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,202
The battlefield
was on a plain

538
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,366
by a river,
at the foot of some...

539
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,878
Iow hills.

540
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,880
Like this, you see.

541
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,542
The lines met here.

542
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,383
My men held
their ground well,

543
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,513
so I sent my horses

544
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,524
at his right flank.

545
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,083
Which is
perfectly correct,

546
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,719
- you'll agree.
- I do.

547
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:35,220
Only the cowards
were repulsed.

548
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,723
Repulsed by a single cohort
of reserves.

549
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,738
Turned and fled,
200 horses.

550
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,900
Crashed directly
into my left flank.

551
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,070
Rolled up my line

552
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,080
Iike a carpet.

553
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,277
Put the whole
damned army to flight.

554
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,753
And  here  I  am.

555
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,755
That's how Pompey Magnus

556
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,849
was defeated.

557
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,656
That's how
the Republic died.

558
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,402
- Good night, sir.
- Wait.

559
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,568
I will not...

560
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,883
I will not ask favor

561
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,885
or mercy for myself.

562
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,910
But I beg you...

563
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,080
consider the fate...

564
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,283
of my wife
and children.

565
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,898
Let me
take them to Egypt

566
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,299
where they
will be safe...

567
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,295
among friends.

568
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,100
Consider them.

569
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,039
Go back to sleep.

570
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,856
Unwise and unfriendly,
I call it.

571
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,870
Unwise and unfriendly.

572
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,872
And for why?

573
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,874
Why?

574
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,899
We had him.
We had him.

575
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,046
Horses.
Never mind, horses.

576
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,048
Never mind gold.

577
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,710
Caesar would have
given us farms

578
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,051
and fields and orchards
and great flocks of slaves

579
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,056
and cattle
and Dis knows what--

580
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,083
'Sist! Pompey Magnus is no
damn slave to be sold for money.

581
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,264
- Don't see why not!
- There's a great deal you don't see.

582
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,902
There's a great deal
he doesn't see neither.

583
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,876
You and only 1 2 other men
survived that storm.

584
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,220
Out of 5,000.

585
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,225
You're being kept alive

586
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,786
- for some great purpose, no doubt.
- Ah, well.

587
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,820
You know, sir...

588
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,636
- He has some interesting news.
- lndeed?

589
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,639
Sir, in course
of our journey here,

590
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,198
we encountered
Gnaeus Pompey Magnus with his family

591
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,211
- and a party of servants.
- Where?

592
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,179
On the road to Amphipoli,
with a mule train.

593
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:47,547
A mule train.
It's priceless.

594
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,882
He intends to take ship
for Egypt, sir.

595
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,286
Family and servants,
you say.

596
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,290
- No soldiers?
- None, sir.

597
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,121
Not one man left,
not one.

598
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,990
Oh, poor wretch.

599
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,758
Why then,
be that so,

600
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,426
- did you not apprehend him?
- Now here's the onion.

601
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,894
I thought it would be
wrong to do so.

602
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,771
Explain yourself.

603
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,578
His hands trembled, sir.

604
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,011
His clothes were dirty,

605
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,744
there was water in his eyes--
he is broken.

606
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,752
I saw no need
to apprehend him.

607
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,754
I'd like to add
that Legionary Pullo

608
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,653
took no part
in my decision, sir.

609
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,616
You saw no need.

610
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,926
Do you not see
that Pompey may be broken

611
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,695
Iike a Dacian catamite
and still be dangerous?

612
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,361
If he is still living,

613
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,530
he will be a standard
around which

614
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,301
our enemies will gather!

615
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,639
As long as he can be
propped on a horse,

616
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,644
he's dangerous!

617
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,704
- But you saw no need to apprehend him?
- I did not, sir.

618
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,876
Who by the sons of Dis gives you
the right to make such judgment?

619
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,886
Sir, I am aware that
I have not done my duty,

620
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,388
and I respectfully ask
your pardon.

621
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,118
My pardon, he asks.

622
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,254
I ought to have you
scourged and crucified.

623
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,571
In future you will remember
that it is l

624
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,203
that offers mercy.
No one else.

625
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,371
Clear?

626
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,246
Clear, sir.

627
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,979
Dismissed.

628
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,380
I do not like
to disagree with you,

629
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,791
but you are being
far too lenient with him.

630
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,457
He let Pompey go
and you let him live?!

631
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,762
The man should be made
an example of!

632
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,428
Any other man,
certainly.

633
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,768
But those two...

634
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,773
they found
my stolen standard.

635
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,638
Now they survive a wreck

636
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:56,669
that drowned an army and find
Pompey Magnus on a beach.

637
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,773
They have powerful gods
on their side,

638
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:05,811
and I will not kill any man with
friends of that sort.

639
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,821
Posca.

640
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,488
Tell Fulvio to start
breaking camp.

641
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,520
We're going to Egypt.

642
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,250
General Pompey, sir.

643
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:10,344
Remember me? Lucius Septimius.

644
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,356
Centurion Septimius,
as was.

645
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,187
I was with you in Spain.

646
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,852
Fourth legion,
third cohort.

647
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,862
Lucius Septimius,
of course.

648
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,864
What are you doing here,
of all places?

649
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,957
- Working for the Gyppoes, sir.
- Huh?

650
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,628
I know, sir. It's not
the fourth by no means.

651
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,230
- A man's got to earn his salt, eh?
- True enough.

652
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:32,002
What's all this then,
soldier?

653
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,010
Not much of a welcome party.

654
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:38,344
Oh, you know Egyptians, sir,
it's just their way. Funny people.

655
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,406
That they are.
Well...

656
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,350
onward friend.

657
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,233
I'm sorry, sir.
