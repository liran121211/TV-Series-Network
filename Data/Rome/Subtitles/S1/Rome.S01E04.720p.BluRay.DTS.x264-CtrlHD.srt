1
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,085
The day was hot,

2
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,861
but the night turns chilly fast,
it seems, for the time of year.

3
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,562
Day after tomorrow,
we shall be in Capua

4
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,163
and you will sleep
in a good warm house.

5
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,173
Though goatskin
has its virtues.

6
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,267
Here we are, refugees
in our own land.

7
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,406
We are not refugees.
We are maneuvering.

8
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,713
As you say,
here we are maneuvering,

9
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,219
while the tyrant sits
in Rome.

10
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,586
Yes, in my tent,

11
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,887
I sleep sound
and deep as a child.

12
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:45,421
- Though perhaps not tonight.
- I'm sorry it bothers you.

13
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,695
He'll be finished
soon enough.

14
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,464
Quintus has a knack
for this kind of thing.

15
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,471
Well, I hope so.

16
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,805
Your son Quintus,
I did not know he was with us.

17
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,743
Arrived this morning
from Brindisi.

18
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,111
Ah, that better.

19
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,314
Screaming makes poor sauce,
I find.

20
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,481
Quintus has
his faults,

21
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,390
but he is loyal
and fearless.

22
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,020
A fatjer cannot ask more.

23
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,998
I've never heard
nor thought otherwise.

24
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,491
The dog confessed at last.

25
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,266
- Torn up good and red.
- Blood on your face.

26
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,297
Wash yourself.

27
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,741
Where is Durio?
Where is the gold?

28
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,739
He killed Durio
as you suspected.

29
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,743
And they took the gold north
on the Via Flaminia,

30
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,552
ran slap into
Caesar's scouts.

31
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,616
\Pair of Romans,
20 head of Ubian.

32
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,752
Too many for our boys.

33
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,457
They ran, the filth
that they are.

34
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,465
Left the gold
to the scouts.

35
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,627
Can't be so. I've heard
from Rome this last hour.

36
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,637
Caesar has not
got the gold.

37
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,072
My man Volpe always
gets the truth, Father.

38
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,771
If Caesar does not have it, then his scouts
must have kept it for themselves.

39
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,780
- Go find these scouts.
- I will.

40
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,510
Now!

41
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,614
You see,
the tide turns already.

42
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,523
Without the gold,
Caesar will find Rome

43
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,652
a little harder
to subdue.

44
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:26,495
Without the gold, we're not
very well placed, either.

45
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,194
Without gold,
he will have to use violence.

46
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,829
Once he starts
spilling blood,

47
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,671
the people will turn
on him with a vengeance.

48
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:40,145
Without the people,
he has nothing.

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,656
"Martial law
is in effect

50
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,820
for the safety
of all citizens.

51
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,626
Groups of more than
three men

52
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,499
shall not congregate
in public spaces.

53
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,867
A curfew is  in  effect.

54
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,340
Any person found
on the street after dark

55
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,899
will be subject
to summary judgment.

56
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:15,607
Long live
General Gaius Julius Caesar,

57
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,209
savior of our Republic."

58
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,984
Order, halt!

59
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,671
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

60
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,665
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

61
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,202
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

62
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,807
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,753
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

64
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,952
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.
Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

65
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,697
Name yourself, citizen.

66
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,867
Gaius of the Julii,

67
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,739
called Caesar.

68
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,245
Speak then.

69
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,440
I humbly ask that
auguries be taken

70
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,780
that Rome might know

71
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,876
that the gods favor
my actions.

72
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,548
You've entered the city
under arms.

73
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,787
I must warn you
that seldom augurs well.

74
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,818
The gods know my
intentions are peaceful.

75
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,388
The people must
know it also.

76
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,805
So be it.

77
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,704
Auguries will  be taken

78
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,370
on the first clean morning.

79
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,609
Let the birds fly
where they may.

80
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,626
How be, paisan?

81
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,293
Miserable.

82
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,302
Slave of a rebel.

83
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,668
A successful rebel
at least.

84
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,673
The jury's still out.
And you, my child?

85
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,676
For true misery,
try bondage

86
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,075
to a bloody-minded woman.

87
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,080
This dinner tonight,
Caesar asks no shellfish.

88
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,849
Here is a guest list.

89
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,560
I hope your lady
is aware

90
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,562
of the honor done to her.

91
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,997
She's very aware.

92
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,160
Caesar's hostess
is first woman

93
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,194
- of the city, in effect.
- Excepting Caesar's wife.

94
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,004
Calpurnia. Caesar requires
that she's still and handsome

95
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,602
and dignified and...
no more.

96
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,580
She is a species
of statue.

97
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,917
A very fancy list
of people.

98
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,254
Every aristo and optimate
left in the city.

99
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,652
He's not planning
on killing them, is he?

100
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,257
I shouldn't think so.

101
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,495
My mistress doesn't
like surprises.

102
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:30,237
Servilia--
why invite her?

103
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,369
Can there still be
something between them?

104
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,710
A rattled old sandal like her?
Surely not.

105
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,444
Some juice in her yet.

106
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,578
I'll not let that woman
get between me and Caesar.

107
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,718
Why is Servilia invited
to the party?

108
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,885
Hmm?

109
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,158
Servilia of the Junii,
why is she invited?

110
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,361
On account of her son,
obviously.

111
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,995
For this, you wake me?

112
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,371
Of course. He needs to keep Brutus
as his symbolic friend.

113
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,569
That's all.

114
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,306
It would look ill with the people
if Brutus were his enemy.

115
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,782
There's no love there.
It's just politics.

116
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,752
Dear gods, woman,
would you let me sleep?

117
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,012
The goat's testicles,
domina.

118
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,913
Not for me, fool,
for Octavian.

119
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,975
Fetch Demeter.

120
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,988
Eat them while
they're warm, my dear.

121
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,547
- It puts oak in your penis.
- I'd rather not.

122
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,423
Nonsense, you must.

123
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,758
You've been developing
a distinctly feminine anima,

124
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,957
and I do not like it.

125
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,966
I am only a boy.
It is entirely natural--

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,833
When my mother's father was your
age, there was not a slave girl safe.

127
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,464
The men of the Julii are masculine men.
Now do as I say

128
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,474
- and eat them.
- I will not.

129
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,533
You'll not leave
this room until you do.

130
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,570
Demeter, the banquet
this evening,

131
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,345
no shellfish. And be sure
the lampreys are not overcooked.

132
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,319
Boil them long enough
to kill them, no more.

133
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,447
I'm waiting.

134
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,557
That's my brave boy.

135
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,705
- Brother.
- Hmm?

136
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,344
Did Mother have
Glabius killed?

137
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,946
Of course not.

138
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,956
You're sure?

139
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,458
Well, I cannot prove a negative,
but I'm sure as can be.

140
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,018
You swear on
Jupiter's stone?

141
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,491
I swear on
Jupiter's stone.

142
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,528
If she did,

143
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,733
if she did kill him,

144
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,938
by the furies, I'll open her throat
with my teeth.

145
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,974
In Narbo, I can buy
10 feasts for this.

146
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,107
Narbo isn't full of
corpses and soldiers,

147
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,983
and decent people too scared
to come out of their houses.

148
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,385
No time to throw a do
if you don't mind me saying.

149
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,483
I cannot start a business
without a feast, can l?

150
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,292
Today is auspicious,
and it's perfectly safe.

151
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,197
I remember the last time when Sulla
had soldiers in the city.

152
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,498
- Blood, you could paint houses with it.
- Caesar's not Sulla.

153
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,632
He's declared martial law, not
to spill blood, but to keep the peace.

154
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,573
We'll see, won't we?

155
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,305
I invoke Ceres and Bacchus,
you'll not be dissatisfied.

156
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,404
You find me a pig, and I'll
make you a feast,

157
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,415
in Hades, if need be.

158
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,475
- And charge according.
- Musa, the oilman's wife,

159
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,079
served whelks instead of oysters
at her womb funeral,

160
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,316
and nobody would
let her forget it.

161
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,416
Laughed at in the street.

162
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,431
Divine Janus, we offer
this feast to you.

163
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,602
I humbly beg that you
will be gracious

164
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,078
and merciful
to me and my house,

165
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,104
and you will smile upon
this new business venture

166
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,877
I begin today.

167
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,949
Lucius Vorenus, his honor
Mark Antony orders your presence.

168
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,186
- Now?
- Of course not. Next year.

169
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,292
Vorenus, my dear comrade.

170
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,063
Barely recognize you without
a bloody sword in your hand.

171
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,593
Off with you now, Cato.

172
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,736
Amusing,  eh?

173
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,370
- Cato.
- As you say.

174
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,041
Of course you don't all
find it amusing.

175
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,277
So...

176
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,412
how is civilian life
treating you, huh?

177
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,184
Well enough so far,
sir.

178
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,249
You know, of course,

179
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,386
I could have you nailed
to a cross for desertion.

180
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,227
I am no deserter.
My time was served.

181
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,062
I abided my sacrament.

182
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,728
It is you that...

183
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,829
It is I that what?

184
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,502
Once over the Rubicon,
Romans are citizens, not soldiers.

185
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,374
I could not legally do
other than I did.

186
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,208
Foolish.

187
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,842
Like a priest
blinded by a cowl.

188
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,408
Since the founding
of Rome--

189
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,182
Oh, please, spare me
the founding, Vorenus.

190
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,314
Things change.

191
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,382
Life is water, not stone.

192
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,393
Then I suppose
I will drown.

193
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,487
Do you not see that
your precious Republic

194
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,122
has long since died?

195
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,760
Do you not see that Caesar
is trying to save Rome from ruin?

196
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,292
I do not see that.

197
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,764
Enough.

198
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,738
And  what wretched  trade

199
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,111
is it you intend
to follow then?

200
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,946
Imported goods from Gaul.
Slaves, truffles, wine.

201
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,612
- That sort of thing.
- A grocer?

202
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,623
An honest fighting man
like yourself

203
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,251
counting cartons,

204
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,659
scribbling accounts?

205
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,960
- You will swift go mad.
- That may be.

206
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,503
I need you, Vorenus.

207
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,199
Caesar needs you.

208
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,006
There is no better man in the legion,
none more respected by the men.

209
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,309
- We have hard fighting ahead.
- Hard fighting against Romans.

210
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,110
Blood is blood.

211
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,117
Would you really have
the 13th

212
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,552
fasten their crest
without you?

213
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,148
You come back
to the legion,

214
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,684
you shall be inducted
into the Evocati as a prefect.

215
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,198
Of the first grade,
with a signing bonus.

216
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,499
Say, uh...

217
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,597
10,000 sesterce.

218
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,846
I chose this path.
I will follow where it leads.

219
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,820
You grieve me, Vorenus.

220
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,052
You grieve me deeply.

221
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,992
Go on.
Off with you.

222
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,496
Good day, citizen.

223
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,021
Vorenus...

224
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,736
next time I see you,
I may not be so kind.

225
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,351
What does it say?

226
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,412
Shh.

227
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,784
It's not certain,

228
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,389
but I'd say your
secret's safe.

229
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,627
Not certain?

230
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,965
The signs are mixed.

231
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,436
What good is that?

232
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,440
Tell me what
it is you're hiding

233
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,534
and I can be
more precise.

234
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,637
There's a child involved.

235
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,682
A male child

236
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,780
The baby.

237
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,916
Never mind.
Best leave it.

238
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,949
As you please.

239
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,897
If it's any help,

240
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:51,528
it does say your husband
is going to be rich.

241
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,097
Rich as Croesus.

242
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,440
Well, that's something,
isn't it?

243
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,678
Thank you.

244
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,527
Good. Done.

245
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,032
Water.

246
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,421
What did I look
like eight years ago?

247
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,451
Just the same.

248
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,694
- Eight years.
- Eight years...

249
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,758
of leathery
Gallic trollops.

250
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,464
When did he last see
a real lady, hmm?

251
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,564
And such
a beautiful one?

252
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,150
- Flowers.
- In bloom?

253
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,625
50,000 to each of
the magistrate's clerks.

254
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,863
So much?

255
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,032
I wish to buy their
allegiance outright, not lease it.

256
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,371
Have them sign
for the money.

257
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,276
And how much for
the sub-praetors?

258
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,973
Nil.

259
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,711
When they hear how much
the clerks got, they'll come begging.

260
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,413
And leave us penniless without
means to run the city.

261
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,048
We must kill some rich men
and take their money very soon,

262
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,457
else the well
will run dry

263
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,086
very soon.

264
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,427
I plan on killing no one
unless absolutely necessary.

265
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,058
A fine  novel  strategy,

266
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,261
an element of surprise
no doubt.

267
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,601
Later you may nag me.

268
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,308
I believe this is
appropriate.

269
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,376
Exactly right, my dear.

270
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,220
Regal, but not
excessively so.

271
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,192
Fine start to a business
this'll be if nobody comes.

272
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,491
Don't worry.
They will come.

273
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,602
Maybe I should have
waited as you said.

274
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,628
They will come.

275
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,068
And mind now,
when they do come,

276
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,672
try to smile occasionally.

277
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,707
And don'tbark at them.

278
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,719
Who's this?

279
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,984
Erastes Fulmen. Remember?
Our guest of honor.

280
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,457
Building trades,
fire insurance, olives.

281
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,586
Lucius Vorenus.

282
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,121
Niobe.

283
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,156
Thank you for your coming, honest
neighbor.

284
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,896
I know it can't be easy
on such a day.

285
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,200
What's a few
soldiers, eh?

286
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,103
Wife, \Phyllis.

287
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,903
Please.

288
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,173
- Sit down and take a cup of wine.
- I will.

289
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,770
Thirsty road, eh?

290
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,541
Sister.

291
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,347
All  right?

292
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,484
All's right.
Don't worry.

293
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,926
- Thank you.
- This can't be little Lyde.

294
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,125
- Surely not. Long time, eh?
- Salve, Lucius.

295
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:44,465
- This is my husband, Evander \Pulchio.
- Evander, welcome.

296
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,471
- Honored, Lucius Vorenus.
- Thank you for the pig.

297
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,065
With all the shops shut,
we would have whistled for meat.

298
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,098
Happy to be of service.

299
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,679
- Thank you so much for inviting me.
- My pleasure.

300
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,478
My pleasure, Servilia.

301
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,349
I insisted you come.

302
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,116
Whatever misfortune
befalls you,

303
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,783
we're still friends, neh?

304
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,628
She has a good cosmetics slave,
I'll grant you.

305
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,800
But a lover for Caesar?
Absurd.

306
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,184
Make way for the pro-consul
Gaius Julius Caesar,

307
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,219
Son of Venus,

308
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,460
Imperator of
the Gallic Legions.

309
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,094
Stand aside and open up.

310
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,412
\Please, you mock me. It's
only your Uncle Gaius. Lift your heads.

311
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,459
All of you,
lift your heads.

312
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,324
My dear niece.

313
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,197
Revered uncle,

314
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,260
welcome, welcome home.

315
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,388
Servilia of the Junii,
a pleasant honor it is.

316
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,490
Delightful.

317
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,930
Your pleasure is mine.

318
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,902
I am very sorry your son
is not here with you.

319
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm sorry also.

320
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:40,206
I hope you will forgive
his absence.

321
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,908
He is ever your friend.

322
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,646
I understand completely.

323
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,179
\Please send Brutus
my best regards

324
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,454
and assure him he will
never have reason

325
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,394
to regret our friendship.

326
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,125
Nor will any of you,

327
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,929
regardless of where
your allegiances

328
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,096
may have lain
in the past.

329
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,708
- Any weapons?
- None, sir.

330
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,217
- Where you coming from?
- Come from Aternum, dominus.

331
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,948
- In what trade?
- Corpse collectors, bone grinders.

332
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,683
Dead business in general.

333
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,021
You've come
to right place then.

334
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,525
What people are they?

335
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,428
Scythians, chief.
They don't speak our language.

336
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,864
On your way then.

337
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,600
Please let me in!

338
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,707
You!

339
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:48,611
Tell your brutes to stay away from decent
women.

340
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,774
I'll do that.

341
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,620
Fine bit of plunder and rapine you
made off them bloody Gauls,

342
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,954
- I bet.
- I'll not complain.

343
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,960
Handy to have cash
in these uncertain times.

344
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,053
A man can't flee with
his house and fields

345
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,087
if he's chosen
the wrong side.

346
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,100
True.

347
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,102
Who do you reckon will
come out on top?

348
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,104
It's hard to say.

349
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,800
You'll be hoping it'll be
your man though, eh?

350
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,502
If you mean Caesar,
he's not my man anymore.

351
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,571
So your spoils,

352
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,413
you'll be lending
the proceeds, I expect.

353
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,248
I won't.

354
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,414
I am buying back this
insula so I'll not have spare cash.

355
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,153
I plan to take over the trading
space for an import business.

356
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:39,152
- Slaves mostly.
- Slaves?

357
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,995
Well, listen,

358
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,331
I have friends,

359
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,394
bona friends.

360
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,636
If you want any help,
you come to me, eh?

361
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,009
More wine here, sweetie.

362
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,978
There are even
those unwise men

363
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,455
who say that a white bird
in the southern quadrant

364
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,686
is neither indicant
nor negation.

365
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,594
Such are the barbarous innovations of our
day.

366
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,325
Barbarous.

367
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,925
We might as well
be Syrian.

368
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,959
- \Point to pommel, I agree.
- Syrians, indeed.

369
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,972
Scythians even.

370
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:25,170
As Chief Augur,
I'm gratified to hear you say so.

371
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,202
It was heard
you are a man

372
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:32,376
- of modish opinion.
- Oh, that's pure scandal.

373
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,944
I believe that religion
is the province of our worthy priests.

374
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,445
Mere soldiers like myself
best not interfere.

375
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,857
That's very gratifying.

376
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,952
Octavian, don't sit there
like a prole.

377
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,725
- Say something witty.
- I have nothing such to say.

378
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,733
You know I cannot
talk small, Mother.

379
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,997
You then.

380
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,129
Some poetry, neh?

381
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,402
She can rattle off pages
of the stuff.

382
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,010
"Easy it is to go
down into Hell.

383
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,277
The gates of death
are ever open.

384
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,842
To climb back out again,
that's the difficulty."

385
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,188
It's a touch dark,
my love, but never mind.

386
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,754
She lost her husband,
you know.

387
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,524
Best get your sister gone.

388
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,049
I told you it was a mistake
to let her come.

389
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,561
I had to let her come.

390
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,893
It would look odd
if she wasn't here.

391
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,731
Speak to Evander,
will you?

392
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,365
Butcher man, time
to take your wife home.

393
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,397
She doesn't want to go.

394
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,432
Best make her
go then, eh?

395
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,842
- Time to go.
- Not yet.

396
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,318
- I like it here.
- Time to go.

397
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,981
- Let me go, my love.
- Lyde, please.

398
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,990
Let me go

399
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,754
or I'll tell our brave soldier
such a good tale.

400
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,490
Kill us all?
Is that what you want?

401
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,962
I love you.
Why don't you love me?

402
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,931
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

403
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,739
- Lyde, please.
- I'm your wife.

404
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,748
We had an agreement!
You vowed to \Persephone.

405
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,511
You vowed you would
hold your peace!

406
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,417
- Have I not held my peace?
- If my husband--

407
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,684
Your husband is
a blind fool!

408
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,658
Did you hear me?
He's a blind fool!

409
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,691
Get off me!
Get off me!

410
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,966
Get off me!

411
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,174
Wife?

412
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,814
Caecilia.

413
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,262
Tell me,

414
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,595
how is Caecilia?

415
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,760
- She's healthy, I thank you.
- Good.

416
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:41,465
I recall I forgot
her last birthday.

417
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,772
- Her birthday?
- Remiss of me, I know.

418
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,575
\Perhaps she would forgive my rudeness
were I to send her a gift.

419
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,138
Really,
that's not necessary.

420
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,912
Hard to find the right
gift for a woman, neh?

421
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,386
What one loves,
another scorns.

422
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,151
\Perhaps she would accept
some money.

423
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,124
There's an idea.

424
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,493
100,000 sesterce, say?

425
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,430
Oh, that's very kind
of you.

426
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:11,492
I'm afraid my wife is
a woman of expensive tastes.

427
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,663
The best women
often are.

428
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,297
1 50,000.

429
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,640
She would dress her slaves
in silk if I would let her.

430
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:24,444
She eats oysters
for breakfast daily.

431
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,811
She should be
most careful.

432
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,583
\People often choke
on oysters.

433
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,319
200,000.

434
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,987
That is a very generous,
and I may say,

435
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,723
appropriate gift.

436
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,866
She would be under great
obligation to you.

437
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,165
To think well of me would
be her only obligation.

438
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,661
She's always
thought well of you.

439
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:53,234
It is not unethical
she continue to do so.

440
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,311
We understand
each other.

441
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,311
Make a note of it.

442
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,847
200 to the Chief Augur.

443
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:11,089
Thinks he's Midas,
the loon.

444
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,565
- Go past the cloth works.
- Thank you very much.

445
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,230
We'll go to the priests of
Janus tomorrow first thing,

446
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,300
and have the day absolved.
It's costly, but--

447
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,574
An omen is an omen. And
this is as bad as they come.

448
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,706
No point throwing
money at it.

449
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,178
Your sister and her husband
can never come here again.

450
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,881
As you say.

451
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,686
Must not bend.

452
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,716
Salve, pleb.

453
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,857
Centurion Lucius Vorenus?

454
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,196
Who asks?

455
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,258
His honor Quintus \Pompey.

456
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,361
You best have good reason
for this insult.

457
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,840
Tell me where the gold is,
and quick about it, dog.

458
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,865
What gold?
Speak sense.

459
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,006
- Sense enough?
- Not near.

460
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,882
- I ask again, what gold?
- Stubborn is he?

461
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,720
This trollop we can
assume is your wife.

462
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,057
Hold her.

463
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,100
I cannot speak
what I do not know.

464
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,624
I do not know of any gold.

465
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,967
You know very well
I seek the treasury gold

466
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,838
you took
from my father's men.

467
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,968
I took no gold from any man.
You are misinformed.

468
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,980
Misinformed.

469
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,609
You are not chief
of scouts 13th legion?

470
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,743
I was.

471
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,254
And last week, did you
not stop a grain wagon

472
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,655
- on the Via Flaminia?
- We did.

473
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,819
Driven by soldiers disguised.

474
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,160
We chased the soldiers
and left the wagon.

475
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,824
You never thought
to look inside?

476
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,164
There was no time.
We had orders.

477
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,897
Your wagon is still there
for all I know.

478
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,739
Lies. Cut her.

479
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,935
Come on, give it to me!

480
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,674
Boys, a clamor for my
beloved friend Lucius.

481
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,215
Why so glum and gloomy?

482
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,063
Who's this then?

483
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,328
His noble honor Quintus \Pompey,
commander of Tyrrhenian fleet.

484
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,358
Neptune's scourge.

485
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,132
Oh, Neptune's scourge.

486
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,767
Looking for a wagon
of treasury gold.

487
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,800
Treasury gold?

488
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:43,041
How exciting!

489
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,107
Do not test
my patience, peasant.

490
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,311
You be off now,
short ass.

491
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,876
Take these scum
with you.

492
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,570
The way I see it,

493
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,074
we put little Quintus here
in the Tiber right off,

494
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,307
get us a wagon, sneak out
to where the gold's buried.

495
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,247
Dig it up, ride like
Zephyrus for the coast,

496
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,718
- and get the first tide for Spain.
- I'm trying to think.

497
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,516
- What was wrong with that?
- What's wrong?

498
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,319
Even if it were not
a monstrous sin

499
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,918
to steal sacred property
of Rome...

500
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,895
I wasn't to know, was l?

501
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,159
...you then ride through
the streets on a litter,

502
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,361
shouting and singing
and broadcasting your theft

503
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,198
to all and sundry.

504
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,798
By sunrise, everyone in Rome will know
what you did and where you are.

505
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,899
Here, in my house.

506
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,179
So what's to be done then?

507
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,205
You will have to
give it back.

508
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,514
If you go direct
to Caesar now,

509
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,113
bring him \Pompey's son as a
sweetener, he might show mercy.

510
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,784
Give it back?
I don't think so.

511
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,850
That's not advice.
That's an order.

512
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,226
Here's me come to share
a god-sent gift--

513
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,663
An  order!

514
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,256
Damn you.
My home was invaded

515
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,792
and my wife near killed
on your account.

516
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,507
All  right.

517
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,103
All  right.

518
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,976
But you'll come
with me though, eh?

519
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,415
This is your mess.
You get yourself out of it.

520
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,614
Fine then.

521
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,047
I'll be off then.

522
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,055
Good luck to you, sir.

523
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,617
Forgive me. I will try
to return swiftly.

524
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,119
Excuse me, my dear.

525
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,510
\Pullo, you scoundrel.

526
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,441
What have you done now?

527
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,110
Your honor, uh...

528
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,675
Lucius Vorenus said
I should come to you and--

529
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,085
Easy, soldier.

530
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,055
Who is this?

531
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,785
Quintus, son of \Pompey.

532
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,919
So it is!

533
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,790
Quintus, my old cock,

534
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,130
how good to see you so.

535
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,759
Explain.

536
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,771
Well, it's like this,
your honor.

537
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,773
He, this one
come to find the gold.

538
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,604
What gold?

539
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:02,773
The gold that \Pompey's boys
stole from the treasury, sir.

540
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,490
Pompey does not have it?

541
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,187
He doesn't, sir.

542
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,131
Now I meant no disrespect,

543
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,759
and had I known the gold
was from the treasury,

544
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,635
I'd not have touched it. But there was
this girl here, sir--

545
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,436
Never mind the girl.
Speak to the point.

546
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,669
Where is the gold?

547
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,645
It's all safe, sir.

548
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,205
I buried it

549
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,809
deep in the woods

550
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,911
a couple miles
from the Flaminian gate.

551
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,492
Thank you.

552
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,589
You will pay for this!

553
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,927
- Surely you can do better than that.
- Leave him be.

554
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,627
I'm sorry we meet
like this, Quintus.

555
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,263
I have only deep respect for
your father and his family.

556
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,706
Kiss my ass,
you traitorous dog.

557
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,801
Elegant little fellow,
isn't he?

558
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,013
You need not fear.
Your life is yours still.

559
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,845
I'm sending you back
to your father

560
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,374
- with an offer of truce.
- A truce?

561
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,011
Quiet.

562
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,215
Are you run mad?

563
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,020
When we have them on
their backs in the sand?

564
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,050
Be quiet.

565
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,722
An offer of equable truce
on good terms.

566
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,065
If violence continues,

567
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,367
it will not be my doing, but
that of your father and his allies.

568
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,603
My father needs no truce.

569
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,305
Two full moons will see you
on a spike in the Forum.

570
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,747
- You wretch!
- \Put him on a horse.

571
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,748
You naughty woman.

572
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,725
Never told me Caesar had
such a passion for you.

573
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,824
Not so.

574
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,598
I saw the way
he looked at you.

575
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,835
Like the bull that
tupped Europa.

576
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,571
I can't blame him.

577
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,603
Such...

578
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,445
beauty.

579
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,283
Such beauty.

580
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,552
Too kind.

581
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,856
Far too kind.

582
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,522
Caesar has no
inclination to me.

583
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,089
Nor I to him.

584
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,728
And such modesty.

585
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:18,238
Is she not beautiful,
Calpurnia?

586
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,573
She has none
of the goatishness

587
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,602
one normally sees
in women her age.

588
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,149
She has some secret
potion perhaps.

589
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,050
You are attempting levity,
I believe.

590
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:33,045
Forgive me if I do not indulge
in such talk.

591
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,724
You're sure to regret
letting that one live.

592
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,065
He has a malevolent
spirit.

593
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,766
There's many left undead
I'll regret before I'm done.

594
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,075
Take \Pullo
and retrieve the gold.

595
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,171
Legionary \Pullo.

596
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,546
You are a thief.

597
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,352
A foolish,
incompetent thief.

598
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,551
But you have served
us well in the past.

599
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,186
So we will pretend your foolishness
is a species of honesty,

600
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,560
and let you go unpunished.

601
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:17,897
In fact, I think we
shall reward you.

602
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,733
I do not like to quarrel
with Fortune,

603
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,331
and clearly she's
taken you for a pet.

604
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,105
When you find the trove,
give him 100 gold pieces.

605
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,135
Thank you, sir.

606
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,170
As you wish.

607
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,285
By the by, Antony,
never question my judgment

608
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,554
in the presence
of our enemies.

609
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:46,552
You have a good memory,
so you will remember that.

610
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,088
- I will remember.
- Dismissed.

611
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,958
Men, horses!

612
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,767
- Quick about it!
- Forward!

613
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,410
Why do you frown,
little owl?

614
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,505
Marc Antony speaks sense.

615
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,109
Truce now does not seem
tactically correct.

616
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,585
Depends on terms.

617
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,485
- Ah.
- Ah.

618
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,649
You offer terms that
\Pompey cannot accept

619
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,886
but Cicero
and the Senate can.

620
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,394
Swift--

621
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,963
Hold up, dominus,
there's people watching.

622
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,798
Sir, take us somewhere
none can see us.

623
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,248
What's in him?
Is he poisoned?

624
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,944
He has the Morbus Comitialis.
It will pass in a moment.

625
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,954
\Please, dominus,
shut the door.

626
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,989
Should we not
fetch a doctor?

627
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,654
We should not.

628
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,357
At all costs, he cannot
have his affliction known.

629
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,628
No one will follow a man

630
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,364
whom Apollo has cursed
with the Morbus.

631
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:58,388
Vow to Orcus,
never speak of this.

632
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,900
Are you quite well,
husband?

633
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,994
Nothing serious.

634
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,032
Come.

635
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:49,602
Atia, I'm growing tired.
I think we shall leave you.

636
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,274
Oh, well.

637
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:56,412
- As you wish, of course.
- Good night, my dear.

638
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,352
Did you have
a pleasant evening?

639
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,226
I did.

640
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,824
Your niece Atia
is most polite,

641
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:13,530
and the Chief Augur made
many edifying remarks on religion.

642
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,132
I regret I will not be coming home
with you immediately.

643
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,608
But you're not well.

644
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,611
Really,
I am quite recovered.

645
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,580
I have urgent business
with my marsupial clerks.

646
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,574
Business at night?
It is not proper.

647
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,645
Not proper, but necessary.
I have to be ready to leave the city

648
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:35,488
and pursue \Pompey as soon
as he refuses truce.

649
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,494
He will refuse?

650
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,792
I believe so.

651
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,168
What's wrong, Mother?

652
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,056
I'm alone.

653
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,752
I'm all alone.

654
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,920
- What does he say?
- Ridiculous!

655
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,656
- What does he say?
- Nothing.

656
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,994
Nothing worth repeating.

657
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:32,964
But he offers a truce.

658
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,937
On what terms?

659
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,463
Truce with that scum?
Are you women?

660
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,634
I'll have them raped
by dogs!

661
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,337
Silence.
Get out!

662
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,676
Excuse him.
He's been ill-used.

663
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,739
But he is right.
There can be no truce.

664
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,272
Of course not.

665
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,377
But Caesar does not ask
for so much.

666
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,322
- Legal immunity. Mutual disarmament.
- I must disarm? I?

667
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,521
I am lawful Consul of Rome.
He is a criminal.

668
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,961
There is nothing mutual
in it.

669
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,692
He may be a criminal,
but he has the city.

670
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,792
- We must deal with facts.
- Fact is, he is a traitor!

671
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,030
Let us be fair.

672
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,837
Consul, he has been
remarkably peaceable.

673
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,242
He has not killed your allies
or violated your property.

674
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,940
We should look
on this offer seriously.

675
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,949
Do you not see
his stratagem?

676
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,747
He is trying to drive
a wedge between us.

677
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,187
- A truce would buy us time at least.
- Quintus is right!

678
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,418
You are women!

679
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,684
Fools.

680
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,111
Tell me you love him.

681
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,410
Tell me that
and I will go away,

682
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,144
and I will never
come back.

683
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,779
I love him.

684
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,915
On the souls of my children,
I love him.

685
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:08,792
Titus \Pullo, what joy!

686
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,800
- They let you go alive then?
- They did.

687
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,359
Where's Vorenus?

688
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:17,066
He's gone to make amends
at the shrine of Janus.

689
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,100
You know Evander \Pulchio,
my brother-in-law, my sister's husband.

690
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,243
Evander, you say?

691
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,874
Good health, soldier.

692
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,149
And you.

693
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,259
Will you take water?

694
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,659
- I will.
- Sit you down.

695
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,777
Great Jupiter, graciously
give us clear signs

696
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:00,044
within the bounds
I have traced.

697
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,077
The auguries are good.
