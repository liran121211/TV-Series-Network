1
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,322
We should go.

2
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,689
Night is coming.

3
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,559
They sleep
standing up, you know.

4
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,065
Elephants.

5
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,927
On account once laid down,
they cannot rise again.

6
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,769
Is that so?

7
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,939
I was not aware.

8
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,348
We should go.

9
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,516
Where?

10
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,987
Utica is not far.

11
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,189
Utica.

12
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,560
What's there for us?

13
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,036
Shelter. Food.

14
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,061
I need neither.

15
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,436
Sleep, then.

16
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,671
Sleep would be pleasant.

17
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,840
So...

18
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,217
Utica then.

19
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,503
Dear me.

20
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,336
Really, Aquinas, is this
the best we can do?

21
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,537
No matter.
No matter.

22
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,977
Bring water
for washing.

23
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,538
And bread...
and wine.

24
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,978
I think I shall make
myself drunk tonight.

25
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,389
Perhaps just this once
you will join me.

26
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,689
I think not.

27
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,226
Cheer up.
We live.

28
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,028
We do.
We live.

29
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,057
And where there's life,
there's hope.

30
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm afraid if we have
done anything, old friend,

31
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,871
we've disproved
that proverb.

32
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,568
Aquinas, this bread
is stubborn.

33
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,406
Give me your knife.

34
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,611
Scipio...

35
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,379
you have
a tolerant spirit.

36
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,150
If you can,
you should...

37
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,521
make your peace
with Caesar.

38
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,992
Oh, I don't know about that.
I shall do whatever you do.

39
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,586
I wouldn't do that.

40
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,189
- Go your own way.
- In any case, let's not discuss it now.

41
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,429
There'll be plenty of time
for such sad talk.

42
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,404
If you'll excuse me.

43
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,907
I need to urinate.

44
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,034
There's a pisspot
through there, I believe.

45
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,961
Help! Help!

46
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,394
Send them away.

47
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,244
Do it now.

48
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,989
Cut deep, boy.

49
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,817
Goodbye, sir.

50
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,395
We thank you so much.

51
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,993
We hope you have enjoyed
our humble efforts

52
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,004
on this happy day!

53
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,677
Happy day on which our
glorious father has returned!

54
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,978
Happy day on which
the Julian sun has risen

55
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,975
and banished
Pompeian night forever!

56
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:46,422
Happy day on which
our brave soldiers

57
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,451
have come home
to their families!

58
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,056
Happy day!

59
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,700
- Salve.
- Welcome back.

60
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,165
- Are you home for good now?
- I am. I am.

61
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,174
No more soldiering for me.

62
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,583
Bona Dea.

63
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,888
It's nice, isn't it?

64
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,520
It is.

65
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,356
- Who are these?
- I bought them last year.

66
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,469
Four slaves we have now?

67
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,529
They were a good price.

68
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,541
On a soldier's wage?

69
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,036
The butcher shop paid
for them with plenty to spare.

70
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,671
The butcher shop?

71
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,274
Me and Lyde have made
a nice business out of it.

72
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,945
Five hundred head
a week sometimes.

73
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,446
Pigs mostly, but some sheep
and cows for the religious trade.

74
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,005
Eirene!

75
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,470
- It's very good to see you.
- It's good to see you too, master.

76
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,074
- You speak our words!
- If it pleases you.

77
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,346
Oh, it does.
Of course it does.

78
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,046
Can I get you anything?

79
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,853
A bit of water
would be nice.

80
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,253
Ah!

81
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,165
I brought you something.

82
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,948
Here, let me.

83
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,351
Lovely.

84
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,427
"Parentalia begins
on the ldes.

85
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,437
Temples will be shut,

86
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,564
and no wherein
celebrated.

87
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,372
Public festivals shall be
at the fifth hour in the circus.

88
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,311
Wine to be provided
by the Capitoline fraternity,

89
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,782
and cakes by
the Guild of Millers.

90
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,876
The Guild of Millers uses
only the finest grains--

91
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,015
True Roman bread,
for true Romans."

92
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,965
The fat old bitch
herself eh?

93
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,490
Must be good
to be home.

94
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,295
What is it, two years
you've been gone?

95
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,870
Are you still
fucking my mother?

96
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,037
When she'll have me.

97
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,377
That would explain
your excessive familiarity.

98
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,142
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

99
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,518
I was merely curious,
and you're correct.

100
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,614
It does feel good
to be home.

101
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,435
My darling boy.

102
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,569
Oh!

103
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,276
So handsome.

104
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,217
- Sister, I hope you're well.
- Let me hug you.

105
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,289
Come inside and wash.

106
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,884
Let's get rid of the stink
of horse off you.

107
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:52,057
Timon, I'll, uh...
see you later.

108
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,539
Please, Mother,
we will be late.

109
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,974
Oh, we must not be late.
That would never do.

110
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,910
I do not want to go to dinner
any more than you do,

111
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,210
but Caesar has treated me
extremely well,

112
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,079
and we must go if asked.

113
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,084
- Honor demands---
- Honor?

114
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,882
- Honor.
- Not honor then,

115
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,650
common sense.

116
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,352
I cannot ask mercy
of Caesar,

117
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,451
accept rank
and favor from him,

118
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,189
and then refuse
his friendship.

119
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,791
What sort of man asks
for mercy in the first place?

120
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,495
I assure you, Mother,

121
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,970
I am not proud
of myself.

122
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,496
I am not proud at all.

123
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,600
In lieu
of a noble suicide,

124
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,009
you shall have to
be content with that.

125
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,247
Bring me my shawl.

126
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,014
Please, do not come.

127
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,419
I shall make
your excuses to Atia.

128
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,856
Certainly not.
I will go.

129
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,986
Not to be there
would be seen as weakness.

130
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,537
Perhaps it will
do you good to see him.

131
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,941
See that he is
just a man.

132
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,669
The loss of his affection
is not worth

133
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,012
this endless
raging sorrow.

134
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,382
I feel neither
rage nor sorrow.

135
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,321
My objection to Caesar
is purely political,

136
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,790
not personal.

137
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,491
The Pontic troops
ran so fast

138
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,497
I don't know
if they ever stopped.

139
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,999
It is no wonder Pompey
took Pontius so readily.

140
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,865
A child with a stick
might have done so.

141
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,803
What next, sir?
Germany perhaps?

142
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,103
I'm afraid I must put on
a triumph this next month,

143
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,406
and they're damnable
beasts to organize.

144
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,742
Still, the people
love a good parade

145
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,407
and we must not
disappoint them.

146
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,848
How lovely to see you both.

147
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,149
- It's been far too long.
- We are joyful to be here.

148
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,156
- Joyful, indeed.
- Is this a mourning shawl?

149
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,023
It's very pretty.
Has someone died?

150
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,324
A great  many have died.

151
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,922
How true.
But it's all over now,

152
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,694
and we're
still alive, neh?

153
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,293
It's not possible.
Octavian?

154
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,337
Gods, you make me
feel old.

155
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,605
Come.

156
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,856
It is the height
of four men,

157
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,721
with a long neck
like a goose,

158
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,887
spots like a leopard,
and the speed of a horse.

159
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,454
I don't believe it.
A new Chimera.

160
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,329
I assure you,
it is quite real.

161
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,062
With any luck, you may
see one at my triumph.

162
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,070
I have been trying to bring
one over for months now,

163
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,072
but the wretched creatures
keep dying on the way here.

164
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,904
- They do not like the sea.
- It all sounds very tiring.

165
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,206
After this
infernal triumph is done

166
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,543
- you must go to the country and relax.
- I should like that,

167
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,481
but then my work
begins in earnest.

168
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,950
I must set about putting
the Republic to rights.

169
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,716
Splendid notion. How shall
you proceed, do you suppose?

170
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,385
I have a few ideas,
but I am open to suggestion.

171
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,691
Yesterday, I saw Malchio
the baker in a litter.

172
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,289
A baker! I'd put a stop
to that sort of thing immediately.

173
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,061
I shall have it
looked into.

174
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,897
- Octavian?
- Hmm?

175
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,267
How would you proceed,
were you me?

176
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,671
- Uh, proceed with?
- Putting the Republic to rights.

177
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,575
Ah.  Um...

178
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,909
how to proceed.

179
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,938
I would start a large program
of public works--

180
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,417
employ citizens
and free men,

181
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,852
repair the aqueducts,
levee the river-- that sort of thing.

182
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,322
I would create at least
100 or so new senators,

183
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,053
that I could be sure were my creatures
rather than my secret enemies.

184
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,856
What is your point,
Octavian?

185
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,125
I did not mean you, Brutus,
you're a man of honor.

186
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,155
I believe that your
capitulation is sincere.

187
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,461
How nice of you
to say so.

188
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,263
I just had a thought.

189
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,760
Did not your man
Aelius Siculus die recently?

190
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,673
I'm afraid he did.
In Thapsus, in fact.

191
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,166
Just so. You shall take his seat
at the pontiff's table.

192
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,180
Pontiff? So young?

193
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,841
I was not so much older

194
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,350
- when I entered the college.
- Very true, but--

195
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,012
I believe I have
the authority

196
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,782
- to appoint whom I like.
- lndeed, yes.

197
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,188
This is a great honor.
Kiss your uncle's hand.

198
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,125
I kiss your hand, Uncle,
but truly I would make an ill pontiff.

199
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,390
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll make a lovely pontiff.

200
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,329
You'll see to it, right?

201
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,992
I had rather thought to concentrate
on my poetry for a while.

202
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,867
- He'll make a lovely pontiff.
- Poetry can wait.

203
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,064
It should not wait
too long.

204
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,075
Poetry is
a young man's calling...

205
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,872
don't you think?

206
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,582
There's us with the walls
of Thapsus at our backs

207
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,820
and your father
was just here.

208
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,988
Now coming towards
us on the plain

209
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,964
with all their
legions, cavalry

210
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,400
and 900 war elephants,

211
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,495
Scipio and Juno.

212
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,372
"Hold fast," says General Caesar,
"let the bastards come!"

213
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,342
- I'll do it.
- Please, don't, master.

214
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,470
This is my work.
Lady will be angry.

215
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,310
Who's master, eh?

216
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,249
...ballistas on the city walls,
and the front line thinks

217
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,253
they've heard the order to advance,
so before the officers can stop it,

218
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,188
the whole fucking army charges
on Scipio's men double tempo.

219
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,713
Now, the elephants--

220
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,352
elephants see us
come running and screaming

221
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,227
and they turn tail and charge
on their own lines--

222
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,061
boom! Chaos!

223
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,200
Oh, don't cry,
it was just a game.

224
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,933
You must be bored,
sitting around here all day.

225
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,909
I don't mind it.

226
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:42,209
- You've been discharged a month.
- I know.

227
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,808
I mean, there's no hurry. We're
all right for money and everything--

228
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,842
But I can't be loafing
around here forever.

229
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,653
So you don't want to take up
the butchering trade?

230
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,055
Shopkeeping?!

231
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,356
It will give you
something to do.

232
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,847
This is fine work
for a prefect, eh?

233
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,544
- Smells like old times.
- It does that.

234
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,246
You remember that little
siege at Avaricum?

235
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,277
You'll not learn a trade
sitting on your pugas.

236
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,187
There's plenty more
carcasses to be hung.

237
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,168
Tomorrow! You'll have
your money tomorrow!

238
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,107
- Let's take his nose off.
- No, not me no--

239
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,700
- Don't-- don't fuss.
- Hey, stop that!

240
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,675
Take your business
elsewhere.

241
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,876
- What's it to you, you bastard?
- It's bad for trade.

242
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,578
And who the fuck are you,
little man?

243
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,450
- I am Lucius Vorenus,
- I know you.

244
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,355
Soldier boy, isn't it?
Up by the dyeworks, tasty wife.

245
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,983
Do not speak of my wife.

246
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,994
Get gone.
That's an order.

247
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,825
No no no. Orders?
Orders? No no no.

248
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,128
You're not a soldier now.
You're a fucking shopkeeper's clerk.

249
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,367
- You're dead, you are.
- Walk away now

250
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,205
and do not let me see you
on this street again.

251
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,707
Both of you...
dead.

252
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,255
Get back
to your business.

253
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,087
You shouldn't
have done that.

254
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,759
Those were
Erastes Fulmen's people.

255
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,665
He won't take disrespect
like that.

256
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,103
- You hit him.
- It was nothing.

257
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,074
Erastes Fulmen
will kill you.

258
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,043
- He's just a crook.
- He used to be.

259
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,512
Since Pompey's gangs left
he's had the run of the hill.

260
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,572
He's a big man now.

261
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,379
He kills whoever he wants!

262
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,908
I'm no prole
to be abused!

263
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,785
I was prefect
in the Evocati!

264
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,120
Caesar himself
gave me a horse.

265
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,267
Thank you, sir.

266
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,815
I hope that dinner was
not too painful for you.

267
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:39,313
Oh, I'm used to pain.
I don't mind it.

268
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,165
I wish you didn't care
for him so much.

269
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,094
I wish I didn't care
for you so much.

270
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,197
Stop.

271
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,291
That brother of yours
has become quite the pretty man.

272
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,558
Caesar seems
very fond of him.

273
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,224
Very much.

274
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,062
Mother claims Caesar
took him for a lover.

275
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,694
Really?

276
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,138
The cook said she heard them
going at it in a closet.

277
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,506
Octavian insisted
it was not so.

278
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,511
He said the noises
she heard were

279
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,536
some terrible affliction
of Caesar's.

280
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,242
Mother wouldn't have it.
Once she gets an idea--

281
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,012
Affliction?
What affliction?

282
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,148
- I don't know.
- Did he not say?

283
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,851
He was sworn to secrecy.

284
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,486
But he said terrible?
He said terrible affliction?

285
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,395
You must find out exactly
what this affliction is.

286
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,162
You must find out
which god has cursed him.

287
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,635
How can I do that?
It's a secret.

288
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,366
You must find it out.
This is the weapon I seek.

289
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,966
With the god's help,
I can destroy him.

290
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,704
Please don't talk this way.

291
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,075
Would you rather
I lied to you?

292
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,239
I would rather that
you think of something

293
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,442
other than the destruction
of my uncle.

294
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,946
I have never lied to you.

295
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,548
He still has
some terrible hold over me.

296
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,755
I wish it were not so,
but he will not let go.

297
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,764
Will you ask your brother?

298
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,895
Would that make you happy?

299
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,428
Yes, it would.

300
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,604
What are you reading?

301
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,849
A guide to the
interpretation of prodigies.

302
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,444
Is it good?

303
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,250
It's dull
beyond conception.

304
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,917
If I am to be a pontiff, I must be familiar
with their ludicrous jargon.

305
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,792
- Mustn't let down Uncle.
- Mustn't let down Uncle.

306
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,421
I'm bored.

307
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,800
- I could read to you.
- If you like.

308
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,702
"Little sparrow,
my love is love,

309
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:13,575
with whom she plays,
permits to lie within her lap,

310
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,775
to nip her finger,
biting quickly with that bill,

311
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,478
I should like to play with you as
she and soothe my troubled heart."

312
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,112
- Very nice.
- You do not like it?

313
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,454
No, you recite well,
but...

314
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,824
I'm tired of poetry.

315
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,599
- Tell me a secret.
- A secret?

316
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,229
Something shocking
and dangerous that nobody knows.

317
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,501
I don't know
any secrets like that.

318
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,273
I know.

319
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,584
What about Caesar
and his mysterious affliction?

320
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,985
What affliction?

321
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,357
Don't lie. The one
you told Mother about.

322
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,023
Oh, it was nothing.
I was just making it up.

323
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,828
- So you were lovers?
- Of course not.

324
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,564
Either you were lovers, or some
god has cursed Caesar, which is it?

325
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,198
- Sister, there are no gods.
- Don't be horrid.

326
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,835
There is doubtless
a Prime Mover of some sort,

327
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,210
but a community of beings that
look like us and meddle in our affairs?

328
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,080
- Highly improbable.
- You don't trust me.

329
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,141
I do trust you.
You are my dearest friend.

330
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,312
- Then tell me!
- Why this in particular?

331
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,219
Why do you care
if Caesar has an affliction?

332
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,986
I don't care
the slightest bit.

333
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,290
Only that it would be a terrible
secret and something worth hearing.

334
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,492
And I doubt very much that
you have any terrible secrets

335
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,159
of your own worth telling.

336
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,202
- You'd be wrong.
- Oh please, like what?

337
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,673
- I've tortured and killed a man.
- Liar.

338
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,078
Do you remember
Lucius Vorenus?

339
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,378
One of the soldiers
who rescued me in Gaul?

340
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,179
- You killed him?
- Of course not.

341
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,152
He has a wife
who deceived him.

342
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,315
A child he thinks is
his daughter's son is in fact

343
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,087
his wife's child
by a low half-Greek butcher.

344
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,094
How sordid.

345
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,497
It was the butcher I killed.
Helped kill, anyway.

346
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,901
Oh. Bravo, I suppose.

347
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,928
You asked
for a terrible secret.

348
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,311
Try again.

349
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,194
What?

350
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,823
Get out of the way!

351
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,834
Centurion!

352
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,927
Centurion!

353
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,996
Lucius Vorenus!

354
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,734
Lucius Vorenus!

355
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:08,945
Niobe, looking
as lovely as ever.

356
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,922
Phyllis sends
her best regards.

357
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,289
Very pretty family
you have.

358
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,093
It's good to see you
again after so long.

359
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,796
So, back from the wars.

360
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,271
Civilian life, eh?

361
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,830
Must be hard to adjust.

362
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,570
Different rules.

363
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,204
Different fucking rules!

364
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,076
My man Urbo here says
you slapped him in the face.

365
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,417
- Did you do that?
- I did.

366
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,913
Perfect example--
different rules.

367
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,917
You see, I'm allowed
to chastise my people.

368
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,162
Regular citizens like
you are not allowed to touch them.

369
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,899
If someone does touch them,
they have to be punished.

370
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,770
Rules.

371
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,434
Get to your point.

372
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,105
This is the second time
that Lucius Vorenus

373
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,376
has shown me disrespect.

374
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,474
Next market day
at noon,

375
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,816
he will find me
in the Forum.

376
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,322
He will kneel down
before me.

377
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:22,258
He will kiss my feet
and he will apologize to me.

378
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,359
If he does not do this,
I will come here and kill him.

379
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:32,226
But before he dies, he will
see his wife and daughters raped.

380
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,830
And then I will burn
down this building.

381
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,738
Hold.

382
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,312
- You've said your piece?
- I have.

383
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,179
Then leave now.

384
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,809
Good day to you.

385
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,427
So the wife of this Lucius Vorenus
is a whore. What's that to me?

386
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,300
I'm sorry,
that's all he told me.

387
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,464
- He swears Caesar has no affliction.
- He's lying.

388
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,564
Is it not enough then?

389
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,939
If Caesar has
an affliction,

390
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,604
he has it and suffers,
whether you know it or not.

391
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,615
He suffers,
but he is not destroyed.

392
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,140
You must go back to your
brother and get the truth from him.

393
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:23,120
- How? I tried.
- Try again.

394
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,520
Promise him something.

395
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,152
You do have
something he wants.

396
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,027
What do you mean?

397
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,397
A young man will tell
his lover anything.

398
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,805
You can't be serious.

399
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,743
How can you...?

400
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,871
You know he wants you.

401
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,008
I would be betraying
my brother.

402
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,315
I would be betraying
my family.

403
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,878
Your family is a nest
of snakes.

404
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,583
You have no
obligations to them.

405
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,888
They are my family!
They love me, l--

406
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,359
As I love you.

407
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,693
You call this love?

408
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,023
I can't.

409
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,831
- Where are you going?
- Home.

410
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,531
Don't go.

411
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,732
Your mother
killed Glabius!

412
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,505
My people caught
one of the men that did it.

413
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,639
One of Timon's men.

414
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,088
I'm sorry.

415
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,431
- Do as Lyde says.
- Please, Mama, come with us.

416
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,271
My place is here
with your father.

417
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,039
But what
if you're killed?

418
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,206
Then you must stay in the country,
don't come back to the city.

419
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,307
You understand?

420
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,911
Don't come back!
You'll be country girls. Mm-hmm?

421
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:40,516
Your cousin will find you good
handsome farmers to marry.

422
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,697
Go ask the gods
for blessing.

423
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,027
Can't you get Vorenus
to do as Erastes asks?

424
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,869
If you begged him--

425
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,875
To kiss a man's feet?

426
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,037
I'd never ask such a thing,
and he'd never agree to it.

427
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,604
Always remember that you
are children of the Vorenii,

428
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,377
an old and respected name.

429
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,078
And always remember
that we love you.

430
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,282
I love you very much.
Now go on.

431
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,829
Go, go.

432
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,597
Goodbye, sister.

433
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,387
Eirene, are you going to
leave this mess on the table?

434
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,029
Please, Niobe,
please, go with them.

435
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,725
I will not
and stop asking.

436
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,795
Good bread this.

437
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,564
I bought the better kind.

438
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,833
Hang the expense, eh?

439
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,977
Get back.
Make way there.

440
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,815
Run and hide.

441
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,423
Here comes the Consul
Gaius Julius Caesar,

442
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,022
Son of Venus, lmperator
of the Gaelic Legions.

443
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,595
Salve, Lucius Vorenus.

444
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,598
Your wife is
very beautiful.

445
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,866
Her name?

446
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,897
Niobe, sir.

447
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,910
Rise, Niobe.

448
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,249
Would you honor us
by drinking our water, sir?

449
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,483
I'm happy to do so.

450
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,514
Please, sit.

451
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,693
I have always held you
in high regard, Vorenus,

452
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,997
and I am told you are a man
of respect among your people here.

453
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,369
- I hope so.
- That being so, I've come to ask you

454
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,806
to stand for magistrate
of Lower Aventine...

455
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,002
on my slate.

456
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,602
Thank you.

457
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,177
Well?

458
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,585
I am deeply honored by your
presence here, sir, deeply honored.

459
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,083
But... respectfully,
I must decline.

460
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,495
So you still disapprove
of my actions?

461
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,126
Sir, with respect,

462
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,601
your politics
are not mine.

463
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,103
I am aware of that.

464
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,037
Were I a magistrate,
I would have to speak.

465
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,041
And you will not speak

466
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,942
in favor of a tyrant?

467
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,503
I will not speak
against my beliefs.

468
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,674
Delicious.

469
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,014
You misjudge me.
I am no tyrant.

470
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,815
I have taken dictator's
powers legally.

471
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,880
And I will return those powers
to the people and the senate

472
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,789
as soon as I am able.
I will not rest

473
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:46,195
until Rome is as it was
in the golden age.

474
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,495
I cannot succeed alone.
Will you join me?

475
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,314
Hail Caesar! Hail!

476
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,014
Hail Caesar!

477
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,884
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

478
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,947
A little  more,  I think

479
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,353
No, the sleeves are fine,
leave those alone.

480
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,881
You just be careful what
you're doing with that pin.

481
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,326
Yes. Now, if you could
go around the side--

482
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,954
at the hem,
at the bottom--

483
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,090
that needs taking up
a little bit there.

484
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,760
There.
No, that's fine.

485
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,965
I don't know.
That just isn't working for me.

486
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,747
Were you looking
for anything in particular?

487
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,849
Oh... not really.

488
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,602
Do you have
anything comical?

489
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,940
Um, I don't think so.

490
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,379
You.

491
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,153
Why send him away?
It's hot.

492
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,819
I don't like that one.
He looks at me.

493
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,625
Does he?
Have Castor beat him.

494
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,494
Maybe I will.

495
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,202
- I'll call for another one.
- Don't.

496
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,297
It's nice to be alone.

497
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,468
Isn't it?

498
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,843
- I suppose.
- Come lie down with me.

499
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,647
Lie down with you?
Why?

500
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,881
I would like it.

501
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,516
- Why?
- Why not?

502
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,651
I can think
of several reasons.

503
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,856
When you were little, you would
come to my bed every night.

504
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,128
Not every night.
Only when I was scared.

505
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,828
You were scared
a great deal.

506
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,836
I'm not scared now.

507
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,270
- Pretend.
- I have no skill at pretending.

508
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,483
I'm embarrassed now.

509
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,052
I thought you wanted me.

510
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,759
You're a man now,
aren't you?

511
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,399
You can take
what you want.

512
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,995
Brother,
tell me something...

513
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,991
Ah.

514
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,265
What do you mean, "Ah"?

515
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,998
Now comes the price.

516
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,170
- What do you mean?
- You're a virtuous woman,

517
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,977
so you must know that seducing
your own brother is wrong.

518
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,850
You and I are above such
petty social convention.

519
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,252
But incest is not merely
wrong by convention.

520
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,156
It's wrong in essence.
It must be,

521
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,524
else why so many idiots and
monsters among the children of incest?

522
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,827
- Don't.
- Don't worry.

523
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,856
It's unlikely
I've seeded you.

524
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,266
Not with the moon
in transit.

525
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,704
The point is, you're not the woman
to do such wrong out of mere lust.

526
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,866
Ergo, you must
have another purpose.

527
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,173
I suspect you shall renew your
strange interest in Caesar's health.

528
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,707
Wha-- what have I done?
What have I done?

529
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,556
What have I done?
What?

530
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:21,055
What have you done?
Tell me.

531
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,259
Promise.

532
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,066
Promise you won't
tell Mother.

533
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,485
Look at you.

534
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,753
You look like laundry.

535
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,522
There.

536
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,898
- Does it look well?
- Very well.

537
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,562
It feels strange.

538
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,004
No, don't,
you'll dirty it.

539
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,874
Does it hang properly
at the back?

540
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,242
I think so.

541
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,371
Calm down,
Mother, really.

542
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,068
Calm down? I have not
even begun to get angry!

543
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,074
Enough!

544
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,013
I am your son
but not your child.

545
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,018
- You will not strike me anymore.
- Will I not?

546
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,719
You fucked your sister,
you little pervert!

547
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,087
Don't tell me what
I will and will not do!

548
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,354
- Be quiet!!
- You wouldn't dare.

549
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,135
How could you
do this to me?

550
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,577
My own child.

551
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,240
- You killed my husband.
- I told you, didn't l?

552
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,944
- I told you I didn't kill him!
- You're a liar.

553
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,646
Servilia caught one
of the men that did it.

554
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,315
- One of Timon's men.
- And where is this man?

555
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,790
Did you speak to him?

556
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,056
Look at me.
Look at me!

557
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,523
I swear on the spirits
of my ancestors,

558
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,662
on the stone of Jupiter,
I did not kill your husband!

559
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,001
You abased yourself
for a stupid lie!

560
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,603
- I don't know.
- Servilia is the liar, you fool!

561
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,976
She lied to turn you
against me.

562
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,026
My poor lamb.

563
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,286
Eirene?

564
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,991
Eirene?

565
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,688
Eirene?

566
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,754
Eirene!

567
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,061
Coming, master.

568
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,134
Sit down.
Have a drink with me.

569
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,657
My mother
had hair like yours.

570
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,700
Grey eyes though.

571
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,606
Big grey eyes.

572
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:32,072
Slave... on one
of those farms up north.

573
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,384
Smelled of pine trees.

574
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,252
Worked in
the wood yards, probably.

575
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,416
That's what I think.
Explains the pine smell.

576
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,253
Don't know
who my father was.

577
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,789
Just another slave probably.

578
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,328
Some timid cunt shoveling shit
with a collar around his neck

579
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,739
because he didn't have
the courage to die like a man.

580
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,141
I'd cut my fucking heart
out of my chest

581
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,079
and eat it before
I knelt down to anybody!

582
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,809
- Cunt!
- Quiet!

583
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,908
Keep it down!

584
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,078
Suck my cock,
the lot of youse!

585
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,680
I'm Titus Pullo, right?

586
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,856
Right?

587
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,633
Right, master.

588
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,970
You're a good girl.

589
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,336
You don't smile
much though.

590
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,603
You want me to smile?

591
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,546
I want you
to be happy.

592
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,644
That's better.

593
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,387
Have some wine.

594
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,567
Come here.

595
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,212
Closer.

596
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,394
Take off your dress.

597
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,023
What's the hat for?

598
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,925
Yom Kippur.

599
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,759
Oh, is that today?

600
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,458
You call yourself a Jew?

601
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,262
What, are you
my Rebbe now?

602
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,341
- Move! Move!
- Vos!

603
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,675
No!

604
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,120
Quick, grab her!

605
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,647
Strip her!

606
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,922
No! No!

607
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,952
Somebody help her!

608
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,301
...keep and protect me.
Keep and protect me.

609
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,977
Keep and protect me.
No!

610
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,507
Let's go!
