1
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,070
Three more gone
this morning.

2
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,477
Outcasts and idiots.

3
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,712
They all get restless.
With the fighting done,

4
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,982
they want to be home with
money in their pockets,

5
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,218
not sitting
in this dismal cold and wet.

6
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,351
None of the good men
have run.

7
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,122
Nor will they.

8
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,426
Nor will they
follow you to Rome.

9
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,193
Not yet.

10
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,133
Time is running out.

11
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,830
We cannot wait
here forever.

12
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,272
This is a very
precarious position.

13
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,607
What happens in January
when your term runs out

14
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,340
and we're
still sitting here?

15
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,616
The business of motivating men to fight
is a tricky matter, Posca.

16
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,488
I would not expect a slave
to understand the subtleties.

17
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,655
I trust an education in these subtleties will
begin shortly.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,900
500,000?
What's this?

19
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,426
I put Mark Antony up for election
as People's Tribune.

20
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,406
There were a lot of votes
needed buying.

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,466
Mark Antony
for People's Tribune?

22
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,444
But he is--

23
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,879
- um...
- You may speak.

24
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,884
I had understood the Tribune
to be a sacred office

25
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,079
with the power of veto
over the Senate.

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,519
So it is.

27
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,716
An office of great dignity
and seriousness.

28
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,215
Perhaps you're right.

29
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,663
We shall send Strabo along
to make sure Antony behaves himself.

30
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,110
How far now?

31
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,444
Three hours at pace.

32
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,575
Ah-hi!
Here I come, girls.

33
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,552
I'm going to drink all the wine,
smoke all the smoke

34
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,283
- and fuck every whore in the city.
- Show some dignity.

35
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,053
- You're under the standard.
- Well, talk to him.

36
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,818
He's not
under the standard.

37
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,799
Three hours away from a wife
he hasn't seen in eight years.

38
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,859
- The man's terrified.
- Surely a reunion is a happy event.

39
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,734
- Talk of something else.
- Terrified.

40
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,604
What if she's lost her teeth?
What if she's gotten skinny?

41
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,768
What if she's been letting
other men between her legs?

42
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,437
Silence!

43
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,406
- They love him, eh?
- No matter.

44
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,848
We are all men
of substance.

45
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,978
Let them have the love of the plebs
and the proles.

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,628
This won't take long,
will it?

47
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,725
We can hope, Dominus.

48
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,896
- Vorenus, you may dismiss the men.
- Sir.

49
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,735
And then you may dismiss yourself
until I send for you.

50
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,241
Have some fun.

51
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,767
But first, take the boy
back to Atia.

52
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,803
Get your reward, eh?

53
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,214
Boy, tell your lovely mother
I will see her later.

54
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,314
Let's get this over with.

55
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,256
Shh!

56
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,505
You, leave this house
this moment.

57
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,508
I will not.
Octavia is my rightful wife.

58
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,170
- You defy Caesar?
- A fig for Caesar!

59
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,236
By the five furies,
if I were not a genteel woman,

60
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,807
I would have you flayed
and hung from a bracket at the door!

61
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,374
- Castor?
- Domina?

62
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,249
Fetch the dogs!

63
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,487
Insolent wretch!

64
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,359
I tell you, my honey,
you are well rid of that one.

65
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,795
I hate you.

66
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,765
I hate you!
I hate you!

67
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,291
Silly girl.

68
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,742
I'm only trying to do my best for her.
Why can't she see that?

69
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,307
She is young.

70
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,649
- Master Octavian!
- Baby boy!

71
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,155
My poor rabbit!

72
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,214
Oh!

73
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,452
So thin.
Was it very horrible?

74
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,260
Of course it was,
I can't even imagine.

75
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,856
We shan't even
talk about it.

76
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,368
We should just put it
totally out of our minds.

77
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,268
You're back
safe at home now.

78
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,875
But who are those?

79
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,207
You are to be very good
to them, Mother.

80
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,645
They are particular
friends of mine.

81
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,148
Friends?
In what particular?

82
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,378
These are the men
that took me from captivity.

83
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,388
First Spear Centurion
Lucius Vorenus.

84
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,218
And LegionaryTitus Pullo.

85
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,422
So, we embrace you.

86
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,589
Good fearsome
specimens you are.

87
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,657
I wonder it took you so long
to subdue those odious Gauls.

88
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,395
There was a great many
of them, ma'am.

89
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,132
Great many-- very good.

90
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,662
We'll be away then, sir.

91
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,674
Oh, but you must be
rewarded before you go.

92
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,006
- Castor, bring me my purse.
- That won't be necessary.

93
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,978
Will it not?
I don't want to break any regulations--

94
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,480
They shall stay
and eat, Mother.

95
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,573
Of course! There shall be bread
and meat put out in the kitchen.

96
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,208
I mean,
they shall eat with us.

97
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,118
Obliged, sir,
but I must go to my wife.

98
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,521
Your wife has waited eight years.
She can wait a little longer.

99
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
Caesar has given them
honorary horses,

100
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,426
and they ride
with the standard.

101
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,056
It's perfectly acceptable
to eat with them.

102
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,292
Splendid idea.

103
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:52,327
It's symbolic. We shall
all dine together as equals.

104
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,741
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just your sister.

105
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,042
- Is she all right?
- Women's troubles.

106
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,048
Nothing a good leeching
won't cure.

107
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:16,354
Jupiter Fulgor, we ask you to guide
and protect this man,

108
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,422
Marcus Antonius,
newly elected Tribune of plebs,

109
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,093
champion of the people.

110
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,035
How many dead
altogether?

111
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,802
I don't know.
I lost count ages ago.

112
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,433
Lots though.

113
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,205
And you, Lucius?

114
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,271
309 fighting men.
I don't keep count on civilians.

115
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,475
- You're very exact.
- The war temple requires

116
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,678
an exact number
when you make an offering.

117
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,687
That's a lot
of wine and goats.

118
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,090
The priests offer
a discount when you pass 100.

119
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,320
Priests!
Crooks, many of them.

120
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,057
I just talk direct to whatever God
I'm doing business with.

121
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,065
Bugger the priests!

122
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,397
Too few people can be
bothered to do things

123
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,527
the proper,
all-Roman way.

124
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,835
- I commend you, Lucius.
- Vorenus is a strict Catonian.

125
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,670
I believe in the divinity
of the Republic.

126
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,610
If Cato believes the same,
then I suppose I am a Catonian.

127
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,841
But Cato represents
the rights of the nobility.

128
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,112
Surely a plebian like yourself
would like to see some changes made.

129
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:16,110
It should remain as it was
at the founding of the Republic.

130
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,417
Why should that change?

131
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,048
Because the Roman people
are suffering.

132
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,389
Because slaves
have taken all the work.

133
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,292
Because nobles
have taken all the land,

134
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,991
and the streets are full of the homeless
and the starving.

135
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,193
Well, I had no idea my son
was such a firebrand.

136
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,395
The nobles say
that Caesar is a war criminal.

137
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,927
They say that he wishes to march on Rome
and make himself king.

138
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,873
That is sacrilege.
No man of honor would follow him.

139
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,605
Well, I'm no man of honor then, 'cause
I say that Caesar should ride in here

140
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,581
with elephants and squash Pompey
and Cato and anybody else that wants it.

141
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,243
Never mind the law.
That's what I say.

142
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,081
You say that because
you govern your reason

143
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,780
no better
than you govern your tongue.

144
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,518
Forgive me, it's my fault
for mixing politics and wine.

145
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,755
More tench?
A dormouse perhaps?

146
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,387
Thank you, I won't.

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,489
Don't mind my saying it,

148
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,762
but you two make
unlikely friends.

149
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,269
We are not friends.
I am his superior officer.

150
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,793
By virtue of rank,
if nothing else.

151
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,272
That is enough
from you!

152
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,205
Please forgive
our vulgar ways, madam.

153
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,109
We are not fit
for your presence.

154
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,614
Not at all. I've enjoyed
your company immensely.

155
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,549
It's been most refreshing.

156
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,575
And with your permission,
we shall...

157
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,451
Ieave you.

158
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,687
Do come
and visit us again.

159
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,819
Octavian needs
reliable friends.

160
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,726
He may depend on you,
I trust.

161
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,230
As you say, madam.

162
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,340
- Say again?
- I did not speak.

163
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,345
I go this way.

164
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,143
My home is behind the street
of the cloth dyers, if you--

165
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,445
Go with fortune, sir.

166
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,580
The cleaner brothels
are in the Suburra,

167
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,920
next to
the Venereal Temple.

168
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,213
Niobe.

169
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,236
You're alive.

170
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,603
What child is that?

171
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,142
Answer me.

172
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,580
What child is that?

173
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,009
He's your grandson.

174
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,283
Speak sense, whore.

175
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,347
Wait, now.

176
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,224
Your grandson--
the son of your daughter.

177
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,854
- My daughter is only--
- She's 13, near 14.

178
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,956
- A son by who?
- Crito, a Drover's boy.

179
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,332
His name is Lucius.

180
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,429
Niobe, stop.

181
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,374
I order you to stop!

182
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,142
Your father's home.

183
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,048
Girls,
this is your father.

184
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,393
Daughters, I'm very pleased
to find you healthy and good looking.

185
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,231
A benefice you favor
your mother, eh?

186
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,136
Now you see how ugly
your father is.

187
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,867
Come here.

188
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,542
She's not simple,
is she?

189
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,446
Greet your father properly
as you've been taught to do.

190
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,089
Your pay stopped coming
a year ago.

191
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,927
The paymaster said
you must be dead.

192
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,862
They said they don't
make mistakes.

193
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,932
Damned fools!
I'll have it seen to.

194
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,003
A bit of a surprise
to see me then?

195
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,334
A bit surprised
to be called "whore."

196
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,839
That was... wrong.

197
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,349
I am sorry for it.

198
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,749
- A whore in front of everybody.
- I said sorry.

199
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,901
- Is it as you like it?
- Less salt next time.

200
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,573
So, how did you manage
for money?

201
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,607
My sister Lyde
and her husband helped us out.

202
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,285
Well, you won't need
their help anymore.

203
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,282
The big phallus is off
a Suevi I killed in the Rhinelands--

204
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,854
a very strong
and fierce people.

205
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,059
Nice.

206
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,332
My official spoils
I've put into slaves.

207
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,601
They're at the market.

208
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,234
I should clear
10,000 denarii.

209
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,268
That's good news.

210
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,423
Come with me, sir.

211
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,659
By grace of Roma,
for twelve moons hence,

212
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,994
thou art Tribune
of Plebs.

213
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,898
Abouttime.

214
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,199
- I need a drink.
- lndeed, sir.

215
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,432
Perhaps after the meeting.

216
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,134
Cicero.

217
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,770
My dear Atia,
a pleasure.

218
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,077
Forgive us for imposing
at such a ludicrous hour.

219
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,381
Not at all, I adore it. The secrecy,
the intrigue-- it's most thrilling.

220
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,855
Comprehend, woman,
this meeting is invisible.

221
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,120
Be assured, Cato,
I do not see you.

222
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,997
General Antony, we are--

223
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,593
Oh God,
your beauty is painful.

224
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,468
You are the crucifix
of Venus.

225
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,897
Let me die in your arms.

226
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,934
'Sist, Antony.

227
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,674
- Good evening to you all.
- General Antony.

228
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,148
Tribune Antony,
if you please.

229
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,981
You're inside the sacred
precincts of Rome,

230
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,955
but yet you wear
the bloody red cloak of a soldier.

231
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,287
Che brutta figura!

232
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,156
It completely fell
from my mind.

233
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,425
I'm most extremely sorry.
Will you forgive me, friend Cato?

234
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,728
Atia, please, will you
take this and burn it?

235
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,263
- That's not necessary.
- Is it not? Oh, bene.

236
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
Then let's stop all this blathering
and get down to business.

237
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,676
Blathering you say?

238
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,511
What a congerie of heroes.
Such vim!

239
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,812
I feel
like Helen of Troy.

240
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,148
Would you adjourn
to the courtyard?

241
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,053
Speak, young Marcus.
What have you to tell us?

242
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,752
I have been delegated by Caesar
to negotiate a compromise.

243
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,693
Caesar wishes
to avoid bloodshed.

244
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,220
He wishes to be seen
as a man of reason and probity.

245
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,393
Therefore, when his present term
as governor of Gaul has ended,

246
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,064
he is willing to accept command
of a single legion province.

247
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,403
Illyria, by preference.

248
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,172
- I don't understand.
- Command of a province--

249
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,236
so he will have
legal immunity.

250
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,717
So that none of you rascals
can go dragging him through the courts.

251
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,151
We're here
to discuss the terms

252
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,655
of Caesar's resignation.

253
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,190
He could have
avoided prosecution

254
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,387
by accepting
a few years banishment.

255
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,362
Banishment for what?

256
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,058
For fomenting a tyranny.

257
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,590
Illegal warfare,
theft,

258
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,431
murder, treason!

259
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,870
And what shall be
your punishment, Pompey,

260
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,805
for betraying a friend,

261
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,468
for deserting the cause
of your people,

262
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,501
for allying yourself
with these so-called noblemen.

263
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,571
- What punishment for you?
- lmpudent whelp!

264
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,745
The man's term of office
ends in two weeks.

265
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,653
- We say six months.
- Two weeks!

266
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,180
He sits alone in Ravenna

267
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,625
with one mutinous skeleton
of a legion

268
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,390
and he dares
to dictate terms to me?!

269
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,092
Caesar has many more legions
than the 13th.

270
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,226
On the far side
of the Alps.

271
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,168
Winter does not
last forever.

272
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,229
Spring comes,
snows melt.

273
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,741
- That's a threat!
- I assure you, it is no threat.

274
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,176
Snows always melt.

275
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,009
If he does not
get a province?

276
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,074
Caesar will take
all measures required

277
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,916
to protect
both his interests

278
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,683
and those
of the Republic.

279
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,850
I am grieved
and surprised.

280
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,658
I had hoped we would have
a rational negotiation.

281
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,630
If that is his last word,
we shall go.

282
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,297
Then we have
no more business.

283
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,965
Caesar is bluffing.

284
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,305
He wishes to appear
supremely confident.

285
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,539
Evidently he is desperately weak,
weaker than we'd thought.

286
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,037
This is a last ditch attempt
to frighten us into making concessions,

287
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,414
while he still has
the semblance of an army.

288
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,419
He's weak, Cicero.
Dying.

289
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,581
Is that not when all the proverbs
tell us to be wary?

290
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,889
Does not the dying serpent
bite deepest?

291
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,536
Let's play.

292
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,072
- Where are you from, friend?
- 13th.

293
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,516
Better keep that quiet.

294
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,282
This is deep
Pompeian territory.

295
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,290
So, we're all Romans, eh?

296
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,200
Come on, ladies,
hear me now.

297
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,034
Furies and River Gods
for five.

298
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,049
"You will be pleased
to hear

299
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,920
that General Antony was
as blithely arrogant

300
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,755
and provocative
as one could hope for.

301
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,593
And Pompey and Cato
were deeply offended

302
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,397
by your negotiating
position."

303
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,427
Wise Men and Graces
on four!

304
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,839
Those Graces don't like you,
I think.

305
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,641
- They piss on your face.
- They piss on my face?

306
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,308
- They piss on my face?!
- Calm, brother.

307
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,715
Man has an ill way
with him.

308
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,551
He's lost a lot of money.
He means no offense...

309
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,488
- do you?
- None at all.

310
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,424
Twin River Gods over two.

311
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,589
Come on,
you mumping cunnies!

312
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,907
Graces...

313
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,499
over four.

314
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,014
How do you feel now, soldier?
Feel good?

315
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,455
- Who is this man?
- Run and get a doctor!

316
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,827
I don't want
people dying in my house!

317
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,422
Do as I say, woman!

318
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,786
Oh!

319
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:22,176
There will be copious pus--
first putrid, then wholesome--

320
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,984
and mayhap
fits of the spleen,

321
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,389
but that will be
all to the good.

322
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,519
A purging of the malignancy
will follow.

323
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,122
This is brass.

324
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,031
Come.

325
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,831
When will he wake up?

326
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,169
Today, tomorrow,
maybe never.

327
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,044
You might try
an offering to Spes.

328
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,445
A white rabbit
often works.

329
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,940
I'll send my boy tomorrow
to check the dressings.

330
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,857
- What misery!
- It's only blood.

331
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,086
It'll wash.

332
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,856
Where are you going?

333
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,522
I have business.

334
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,691
Business?
What business?

335
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,594
I understand that you are upset,
but I will ask you

336
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,104
do not question me
in that tone.

337
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,508
Tone.

338
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,410
My father's cock!

339
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,210
How's that for tone?!

340
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,745
50, 50.
55.

341
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,779
55, 55.
60.

342
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,791
60, 60-- sold!

343
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:37,283
40.
40, 40, 45.

344
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,924
45, 45, 45.
50.

345
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,333
50.
50, 50. 55.

346
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:49,272
This is bona stock,
but it's all skin and bone, eh?

347
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,899
You want a good price.

348
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,207
Let us feed them up,
put some fat on them.

349
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,545
Couple weeks of easy living, and these
puppies will sell like duck hearts.

350
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,574
Is that expensive,
fodder and storage?

351
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,850
No! You'll recoup feed
and storage double.

352
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,930
Beautiful, neh?
A real showman.

353
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,626
I am no judge
of the sand,

354
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,159
but sure,
anyone can see

355
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,833
he is rare large
and aggressive.

356
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,207
When the Senate
meets tomorrow,

357
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:32,307
Scipio will propose
an ultimatum be put to Caesar.

358
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,717
I ask you as a friend
to support the proposal

359
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,416
and to enjoin your many friends
to do the same.

360
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,516
Oh, I have not
so many friends as all that.

361
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,925
Ah, the moderates
follow you like sheep.

362
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,760
- Your vote is critical.
- The ultimatum is?

363
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,266
Caesar's term
of office is over.

364
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,325
He must immediately
disband his men,

365
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,837
resign his command,
and return for trial--

366
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,399
else be considered an Enemy
of the Senate and People of Rome.

367
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,206
But he cannot accept that.

368
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,076
Not without dishonor.

369
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:06,140
Once declared hostile, he has nothing
to lose-- he will fight at any cost.

370
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,446
You are declaring war!

371
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:11,012
Caesar will not have to
accept or refuse the terms,

372
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,015
because Mark Antony
will immediately use Tribune's Veto.

373
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,550
But then,
what is your purpose?

374
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,562
If the Senate votes
against him,

375
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,087
Caesar will
finally understand

376
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,760
that he is alone
against all.

377
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,566
Of course, anything but
an overwhelming vote

378
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,368
encourages Caesar to think
he still has friends and hope.

379
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,710
I am no friend to Caesar,
nor any tyrant,

380
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,650
but I cannot vote
for a proposal

381
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,483
I do not wish to see realized.
It would be highly irreligious.

382
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,046
I have made
a vow to Jupiter.

383
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,117
Unless I get the full backing
of the Senate tomorrow,

384
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,561
I and all my legions
will sail for Spain

385
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,430
and leave you gentlemen
to your own defenses.

386
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,807
This is he?
Crito?

387
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,576
He's a good boy
from good family.

388
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,015
Good enough to seed
a child of the Vorenii

389
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,178
who fought
at Magnesia and Zama?

390
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,053
- I don't rightly know, sir.
- You don't rightly know?!

391
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,250
Do you know that
this girl is my property?

392
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,122
That you should have
asked my permission

393
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,821
before you coupled
with her?

394
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,092
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I am within my rights

395
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,860
to kill you
here and now.

396
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,958
- Papa, please.
- Don't you start sniffling.

397
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,697
You should have thought of this
before you spread your legs.

398
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,671
They meant you
no disrespect.

399
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,435
What they did
was only natural.

400
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,169
They're young
and they love each other.

401
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,733
That's no excuse.

402
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,372
His mother's family are well-found
in Ostia for many generations,

403
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,211
and his father is
a successful drover.

404
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,445
They have a house
in the southern crossroads.

405
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,851
A house built from
cattle dung no doubt.

406
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,652
It's very hygienic, sir.
There's no smell.

407
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,760
Huh!

408
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,285
There's money
in droving, at least.

409
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,887
Good money, sir.

410
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,195
I'm on the Capua run mostly--

411
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,633
that's 5,000 head
a week sometimes, sir.

412
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,896
He cannot be but what he is.
When are you a man?

413
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,875
- Next month, sir.
- Next month.

414
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,676
Very well,
you may marry my daughter.

415
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,617
Assure your good people that
the dowry will be appropriate.

416
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,228
He really is
a good boy.

417
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,131
You should be pleased.

418
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,398
My daughter's virginity
has been taken

419
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:43,567
and my first grandson spawned,
by an ill-favored prole.

420
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,599
How can I be pleased?

421
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,611
- He makes her happy.
- She's an idiot then.

422
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,636
What a brute you are!

423
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:31,021
The Senate will hear
Metullus Scipio.

424
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,421
Speak! Speak!

425
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:38,589
Conscript fathers,
I propose a formal motion.

426
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,224
Unless Gaius Julius Caesar

427
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,827
immediately lays down
his command,

428
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,896
disbands his legions
and returns to Rome for trial,

429
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,377
this sacred assembly
will declare him a public enemy

430
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,574
of the Senate
and People of Rome!

431
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,345
After which time
it will be the duty

432
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:04,185
and the obligation of every Roman
to do him harm

433
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,521
or to kill him
if they are able!

434
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,361
A motion is proposed.

435
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,373
Those in favor,
make it known.

436
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,006
The motion is carried
by clear numbers.

437
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,406
Antony!

438
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,974
Veto the motion!

439
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,249
Stand up!
Veto the motion!

440
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,320
I demand the floor!
I demand the floor!

441
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,558
- Give him the floor!
- I veto the motion!

442
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,588
Tribune vetoes
the motion!

443
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,861
Scipio's motion
against Caesar--

444
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,031
it doesn't stand,
does it?

445
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,870
Stands.

446
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,001
Entered in the annals.

447
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:37,276
Despite that Tribune
raised his veto?

448
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:41,718
Not heard,
not fully admitted.

449
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,085
No weight.

450
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,283
The motion stands.

451
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,258
Let me be clear
with you.

452
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,692
I do not wish

453
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,855
that a motion
as important as this

454
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,593
should stand
on a mere trick of procedure.

455
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,362
Trick, you say?

456
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,337
This is
a religious matter.

457
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,135
There are no tricks
in religion.

458
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:09,441
Session was not
formally ended, correct?

459
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,814
- Correct.
- So, when we reconvene,

460
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,649
it will formally
be the same session.

461
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,154
Mm-hmm.

462
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,454
Then Tribune Antony
may use veto on the motion.

463
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,187
Um...

464
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,822
That is so.

465
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,666
Juno lnferna!
Senile old fool,

466
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,536
why didn't you say so
to begin with?

467
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,567
Mark Antony must not be harmed
or hindered in any way.

468
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,010
- But--
- In any way!

469
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,037
It is vitally important
that he be allowed

470
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,709
to veto the motion.

471
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,548
If he does not,
Caesar is declared a traitor.

472
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,077
Then he has no choice
but to oppose me openly,

473
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,319
which means civil war.
Antony must not be harmed!

474
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,383
Dominus, good news.

475
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,453
The Senate
will reconvene tomorrow.

476
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,761
Formally,
it is the same session,

477
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,030
so you may yet exercise
your veto on the motion.

478
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,936
Hmm. Unless Pompey
tries to stop me.

479
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,464
True, he may
very well try.

480
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,534
Rally the men together.

481
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,273
Vorenus...

482
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,282
all of them.

483
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,351
Run and hide

484
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,411
Runand hide

485
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,720
The13tharecoming

486
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,058
And your men
are all dead!

487
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,591
I put extra nutmeg in,
as you like it.

488
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,999
Oh, marry me, goddess.

489
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,004
What, a porcine object
like you?

490
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,303
Besides, I am already wed,
thanks be to evil spirits.

491
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,140
You are wrong, friend-wife.
He is a good man, your man.

492
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,339
A good man you say?

493
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,280
For years and years,
I'd lie awake at night

494
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,943
and beg all the Gods
to send him home.

495
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,250
I'd hear of this battle
or that battle and...

496
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,188
I'd see him,
clear as a glass,

497
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,657
Iying dead and bloody
in the mud somewhere.

498
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,790
I was lonely.

499
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,696
I was so lonely.

500
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,167
For eight years I wept.

501
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,070
Every day, the girls asking,
"When is Papa coming home?

502
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,768
Is it today? When?"

503
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,442
And now he's home,
and I wish he was in Gaul.

504
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,311
He's a cold, mean brute.

505
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,612
Not one loving word
to me or his daughters,

506
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,448
not once since
he has been home.

507
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,580
He is no skilled hand
with the women.

508
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,058
But in all these years I fought
with him, he never took a woman.

509
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,323
"Pullo," he'd say to me,
"Pullo, my old friend,

510
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,557
I have a wife back home,
Niobe is her name

511
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,362
and she's worth more to me
than all the women of Gaul."

512
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,363
I thank you for your kind words,
but I know you lie.

513
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,965
Shh, shh.

514
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,532
He's no friend of yours.
He told me so.

515
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,307
Why, he has a--
an ill temper, him.

516
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,008
He'd say anything.

517
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,882
Antony needs every man.

518
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,910
If you can walk, we rendezvous
at the house of Atia.

519
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,691
This is all I have left.

520
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,995
There will be more
when I sell the slaves.

521
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,628
Get the girls indoors and stay indoors until
you know it's safe.

522
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,406
It saddens me
that you are unhappy,

523
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,472
because I have
a deep affection for you.

524
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,081
When I return,
we will talk.

525
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,366
Well, this is
a merry do.

526
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,772
Octavia, my honey,
look alive at least.

527
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,766
Poor Antony must think himself dead
and swimming in Lethe water.

528
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,905
Talk to the poor man,
ask him questions.

529
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,279
One would think she'd been
raised by Germans.

530
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:11,618
General Antony,
does my mother's screaming irritate you?

531
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,317
Excuse me?

532
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,917
When you and my mother
are in coitus,

533
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,894
there is
a deal of screaming.

534
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,158
I find it
extremely irritating.

535
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,859
I wondered
whether you did also.

536
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,458
Or perhaps you like it?

537
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,402
A testament
to your skills.

538
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,997
So spiteful,
and for what?

539
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,564
You shame only yourself.

540
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,465
She has you exact.

541
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,963
We show our strength.

542
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,906
We show them
who owns the Forum,

543
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,738
but we do not touch them.

544
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,676
Antony must not
be touched!

545
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,942
- Kill them all, I say.
- None of that!

546
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,811
Pompey's strict orders.

547
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,546
Him who starts trouble
will be on a cross at nightfall.

548
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,315
So no blood!

549
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,831
Make a lane there!
Make a lane there, I said!

550
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,730
Come on, you bastards!

551
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,996
Rally to me.

552
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,998
Rally to me.

553
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,057
Rally to me!

554
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,574
No blood!

555
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,130
You have
what you wanted, Cato.

556
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,862
Caesar has
no choice now.

557
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,769
Come the spring,
he will cross the Alps

558
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:44,536
with his legions
and march on Rome.

559
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,019
Five dead:
three from flux, two from fighting.

560
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,990
10 under medics.
Eight absent, believed fled.

561
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,994
- Sir.
- Fighting strength: 236 head.

562
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,225
Seventh Cohort.
12 dead:

563
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,164
six of flux,
six of fighting.

564
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,895
Three on the medics.

565
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,800
Three absent,
believed fled.

566
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,237
Fighting strength: 242.

567
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,935
Soldier, how far behind you
is Mark Antony?

568
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,035
No more than an hour, sir.

569
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,577
- Sound assembly!
- Sir!

570
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,348
By order of the Senate,

571
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,083
Gaius Julius Caesar

572
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,591
is declared
an enemy of Rome.

573
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,526
All good citizens
are bound

574
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,462
to do him harm
if they are able.

575
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,014
I've got him.

576
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,150
After all these years,
Pompey surprises me.

577
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,322
I had hoped to provoke
some kind of aggression, sure,

578
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,490
but to try
and kill a Tribune?

579
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,092
In the Forum?

580
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,069
The man's found some hard
black iron in his soul.

581
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm sure it was yon demented little worm
Cato who put him up to it.

582
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,872
It's excellent, this.

583
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,708
So, what next?

584
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,340
Let's see what the men
have to say.

585
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,615
Oh, don't do that!

586
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,381
You look just right
as you are.

587
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,551
Like Leonidas
at Thermopylae.

588
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,419
Attention!

589
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,729
Any of your people
I can mention?

590
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,538
Titus Pullo.

591
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,235
Took the head off
the first man that came at me.

592
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,982
Soldiers,
Pompey and the Senate

593
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,579
have formally declared

594
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,716
that Gaius Julius Caesar

595
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,453
is an enemy of Rome.

596
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,222
No!

597
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,959
They have declared that
I am a criminal.

598
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,899
They have declared,
in effect,

599
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,301
that all of you
also are criminals!

600
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,602
No!

601
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,575
The Tribune's veto
was not exercised.

602
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,942
Peoples Tribune
Mark Antony

603
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,504
and 50 men of the 13th

604
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,075
were assaulted by 1,000 head
of Pompeian scum.

605
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,177
No!

606
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:49,851
A Tribune of the plebs

607
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,418
assaulted on the steps

608
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,260
of the Senate House!

609
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,290
Can you imagine
a more terrible sacrilege?

610
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,826
Our beloved Republic is
in the hands of madmen.

611
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,930
This is a dark day,

612
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,407
and I stand at a fork
in the road.

613
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,468
I can abide the law
and surrender my arms to the Senate

614
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,480
and watch
the Republic fall

615
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,004
to tyranny and chaos!

616
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,517
Or, I can go home

617
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,883
with my sword
in my hand

618
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,751
and run those maniacs

619
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,757
to the Tarpeian Rock!

620
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,521
Yeah! Yeah!

621
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,401
Legionary Titus Pullo,
step forward!

622
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,669
Titus Pullo!

623
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,283
When 50 brave men
of the 13th

624
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,786
fought Pompey's 1,000
in the Forum

625
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,948
and saved the Tribune,

626
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,426
it was Legionary Titus Pullo
who drew first blood!

627
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,558
Here is 500 denarii!

628
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,064
Very grateful, sir.

629
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,831
Are you with me,
Titus Pullo?

630
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,703
- Will you come with me to Rome?
- Yes.

631
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,731
Yes, sir!
Certainly!

632
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,108
Titus Pullo
is with me!

633
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,511
And you?
Are you with me?!

634
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,678
Yeah! Yeah!

635
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,132
Ah, you're awake.

636
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,038
Water?

637
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,904
We're moving.

638
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,605
Mmm.

639
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,549
The whole legion, sounds like.
Where to?

640
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,847
It's a river.

641
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,751
What river?

642
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,718
- This is the Rubicon.
- Stay calm.

643
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,751
This is rebellion
and treason,

644
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,388
and I am no traitor!

645
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,489
It's too late now.
We're across. We're in ltaly.

646
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,364
You're a rebel whether
you like it or not.

647
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,892
Caesar. Caesar,
what have you done?

648
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,962
He had no choice,
had he?

649
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,906
Pompey did try to kill
Mark Antony after all.

650
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,034
You of all men should not dare
make that argument.

651
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,943
- How's that?
- You know who was being attacked.

652
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,174
I don't know
what you mean.

653
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,377
It doesn't matter now.

654
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,284
We are all
dead men any way.

655
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,017
We'll be hanging from crosses
in the Appian Way before the week's out.

656
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,581
We'll be all right.

657
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,025
- Have some more water.
- Better to die of thirst.

658
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,894
Don't be foolish.
Drink.

659
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,936
Caesar is in ltaly!

660
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,769
Caesar is in ltaly!

661
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,114
- Have you heard?
- I heard.

662
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,127
What's going to happen?

663
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,298
War is going to happen.

664
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,613
Who's my greedy
little piglet?
