1
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,319
-lwasthinking--
- Hmm?

2
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,617
I was thinking...

3
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,624
you and I might
go away to Baia.

4
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,650
Hmm? After
next market day.

5
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,254
It's supposed
to be nice there

6
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,027
- and seeing how crowded it's been--
- That's a lovely idea, but--

7
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,000
But what?

8
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,401
I can't leave Lyde alone.

9
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,428
- She needs me.
- She needs you.

10
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,771
Evander's been missing for two months.
Something bad has happened.

11
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,402
Very likely something
bad has happened.

12
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,936
Very likely he is dead!

13
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,387
Pullo, awake!

14
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,265
Wake up!
Mark Antony's waiting.

15
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,791
Mump off and die,
you pigfucker.

16
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,363
Right.

17
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,069
Aw, thank you,
my honey.

18
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,011
You shouldn't
thank slaves.

19
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,348
- No harm in it.
- It's bad for discipline.

20
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,376
Happy again
this morning?

21
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,422
Niobe, then?

22
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,220
- How's she going?
- I don't understand her.

23
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,625
All the hoo over her
sister's damn husband.

24
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,152
Women, eh? Maybe
she's-- she's--

25
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,188
She's what?

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,191
I don't know.
Women, eh?

27
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,987
Mighty vice-conqueror
of Gaul,

28
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,260
Mars and Bellona swell
with pride at your doings.

29
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:30,167
- And I say--
- Oh, good Juno, what cac you speak.

30
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,932
Would you just get on
with your point, man?

31
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,132
Immediately,
Your Honor. I--

32
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,573
Publius Servilius
is here.

33
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,203
Ah, good. That'll do
for this crowd then. Off with you.

34
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,271
- l--
- No, off with you!

35
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,875
Master of Horse and People's
Tribune Mark Antony

36
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,351
will receive
your petitions tomorrow.

37
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,889
Vorenus!

38
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,190
Out!

39
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,025
Cynthia,

40
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,930
a pear, my love, hmm?

41
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,234
Servilius,

42
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,178
my dear old friend.

43
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,176
- How are you?
- Healthy healthy, I thank you.

44
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,586
Forgive me,
have we met before?

45
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,557
Have we not?

46
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,354
No idea.

47
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,226
I always pretend so
with civilians.

48
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,424
It's more politic, nay?

49
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,395
And this must be
your beautiful wife,

50
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,598
whose name escapes me.

51
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,834
Poppaea.

52
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,739
A flower.

53
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,573
You'll excuse
all the bustle.

54
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,445
I found Pompey's taste
in decor rather dull.

55
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,074
I like a little more color.

56
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,553
- As you say.
- You shall make it lovely, we are sure.

57
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,612
You'll forgive me if I talk
business with your husband?

58
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,921
Of course.

59
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,928
- Pretend I am not here.
- lmpossible,

60
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,295
but I shall try.
Now then...

61
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,061
I'm sure you're
aware that Caesar

62
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,126
has left me in charge
whilst he is in Greece.

63
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,364
Yes.
Off having fun

64
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,272
chastising Pompey et al.

65
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,709
Left me here to scribble
and quibble like a damned civilian.

66
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,976
However, I am determined
to make the most of it.

67
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,812
I shall be
a good politician,

68
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,285
even if it kills me.

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,254
Or if it kills anyone
else for that matter.

70
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,781
So you are, it seems,

71
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,760
the most senior
senator left in Rome.

72
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,524
I have that honor.

73
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,828
- And a turnabout Pompeian to boot.
- l--

74
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,234
Which is why I thought

75
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,363
it could be amusing

76
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,137
if we made you consul
for this year.

77
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,303
Consul?

78
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,336
That's most kind--

79
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,348
Allow me to
finish speaking.

80
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,810
When the Senate
next meets,

81
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,082
there are a couple
of legislative items

82
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,112
I wish to see
enacted immediately.

83
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,388
I am sure you
will be happy to assist.

84
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,452
- l-- l--
- ltem one:

85
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,224
The Senate will ratify

86
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,825
Caesar's election as your
co-consul for the coming year.

87
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,434
But he is dictator
in any case.

88
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,832
It sounds so much
better if he is consul.

89
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,739
It's more amicable.

90
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,142
- You got that?
- l-- I do.

91
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,977
- l-- I have.
- ltem two: You will propose

92
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,074
the following law:

93
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,244
Forthwith, in every
province of ltaly,

94
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,256
one third of all
those employed

95
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,453
at laboring with
cattle or in agriculture

96
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,484
must be freedmen
or citizens.

97
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,462
I don't understand.

98
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,762
Too many slaves, you see?
They've taken all the work,

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,031
which causes unemployment
amongst the free populace.

100
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,597
Now, we need to create
more jobs for our citizens.

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,437
But it will be
hugely expensive!

102
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,341
Mmm. It will.

103
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,675
But only to
those few rich men

104
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,738
who own all the land.

105
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,340
And they shall
have the consolation

106
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,011
of having done something
eminently patriotic.

107
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,180
It seems rather...

108
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,157
extreme to say the least.

109
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,056
Ruinous even.

110
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,822
You may well be right.

111
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,228
But frankly, I do not care
whether it is the rich, poor,

112
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,960
or, indeed
both that suffer.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,592
Caesar wishes
this law to be made.

114
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,036
He is my friend,
I will have it made.

115
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,165
If you prefer, I could
always bypass the Senate,

116
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,266
call an Assembly
of the People

117
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,300
and you can put your
arguments to them.

118
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,075
A fine orator like yourself
might just persuade them

119
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
that Caesar is wrong.

120
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,579
- That won't be necessary.
- Good.

121
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,145
Good.

122
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,157
That's it then.

123
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,854
- I don't know what to say.
- Say nothing then.

124
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,829
It's often best.

125
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,232
You know Posca of course,
Caesar's creature?

126
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,099
He'll take
all the details.

127
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,796
Poppaea...

128
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,739
my dove, if your
husband should die...

129
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,777
come to me,
we will marry, neh?

130
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,358
So, keeping their
promises, isn't he?

131
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,301
What?

132
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,271
Caesar and Mark Antony,
doing right by the people.

133
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,206
That was your
worry, wasn't it?

134
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,607
That Caesar'd turn out to
be just another tyrant sort?

135
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,611
But here's him
and Mark Antony

136
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,613
getting jobs
for the unemployed.

137
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,115
You can't complain
about that now, can you?

138
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,618
He negotiates with a whore
and a dwarf at his side.

139
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,086
Think you Cincinnatus
or Marius or even the Grachii

140
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,589
- would demean themselves so?
- Who?

141
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,289
Mark Antony has his odd ways,
there's no denying that.

142
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,264
I'm not going home.
I need a drink.

143
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,103
- Drink? You?
- l. Drink. What of it?

144
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,133
I'll not argue.

145
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,744
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

146
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,774
- You need to calm down.
- How can I be calm? Two months of this.

147
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,913
- Aren't you done yet?
- Will you sit still?

148
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,022
Won't catch a pretty new husband
with a sour face like that.

149
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,358
I don't want a new husband.
I want Crito.

150
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,762
You can't stay
married to a drover,

151
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,698
not now that your
father's a prefect.

152
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,531
- It wouldn't be right.
- I told her.

153
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,367
Far too low. Fortune blessed you,
you haven't paid out dowry.

154
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,568
Don't worry, we'll find
you someone nice,

155
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,406
- and proper status.
- I don't want anyone!

156
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,379
You can't be unmarried.
It wouldn't be decent at your age.

157
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,645
- Decent she says.
- What's that supposed to mean?

158
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,084
You know what it means.

159
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,521
- You hold your tongue.
- Or what?

160
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,547
What will you do?

161
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
It's all right, sweetie.
It's all right.

162
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,262
I thought it was going
well for a while, but now...

163
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,803
Maybe I should beat
her, do you think?

164
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,049
I don't know.
That only works if you keep at it.

165
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,348
A good thrashing
once or twice a day

166
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,581
till they're docile.

167
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,489
But then they
don't look so good.

168
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,720
Be a shame to mark up
a beauty like her.

169
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,488
She is, eh?

170
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,097
She's a beauty.

171
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,661
She is that.

172
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,901
I give her slaves, money,
everything. What do I get?

173
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,772
Nothing, that's what.

174
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,438
I get a house
full of wailing.

175
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,811
My wife won't
even couple with me.

176
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,647
Why not?

177
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,812
Says she can't while
her sister stays.

178
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,685
What's her sister
to do with it?

179
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,123
What difference
should that make?

180
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,993
What is wrong with her?

181
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,130
What is wrong with her?

182
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,367
What is wrong with me

183
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,569
that I'm served this way?

184
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,373
You should
leave her, maybe,

185
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,573
seeing as she
makes you so unhappy.

186
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,980
No! I will
not leave her.

187
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,513
I'd rather die
than leave her.

188
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,430
It's all right, lamb.

189
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,465
It'll be all right.

190
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,678
Who, I say,

191
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,018
faced with the
overwhelming force

192
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,785
of the figures and the arguments
I have here marshalled

193
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,056
could resist their
overwhelming conclusion?

194
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,927
Therefore I ask you,

195
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,662
honored conscript fathers,

196
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,262
to support me in
this important and...

197
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,870
patriotic legislation
which will--

198
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,849
Does anyone wish to speak
against the motion?

199
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,750
No opposition voiced.
No division required.

200
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,660
Motion carried.

201
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,665
Empty.

202
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,677
Empty...

203
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,702
If there's no wine,
water will do.

204
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,582
Thank you, my dove.

205
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,656
So, Lyde, I was asking
around, you know,

206
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,757
about your man there,
Evander.

207
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,597
Asking  around?

208
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,399
See if I could find
out anything for you.

209
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,565
Only, I know a few
shady characters see?

210
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,576
Types that might know what's
what when a man's gone missing.

211
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,203
Anyroad,
they tell me

212
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,773
that he got himself
into some trouble

213
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,809
with some nasty Greek
boys across the river.

214
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,617
- Gambling debts they say.
- Gambling?

215
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,624
Evander never gambled.

216
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,626
Well sure, it's
the sort of thing

217
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,151
a man keeps quiet around
his wife, isn't it?

218
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,765
What are you saying?

219
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,963
I'm sorry to say it, but it looks like
he's not coming home.

220
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,338
Dead, looks like.

221
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,865
Are you sure?

222
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,741
So they tell me.

223
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,575
Dead. Killed.

224
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,343
It isn't true.

225
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
My advice,

226
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,180
best forget about him.

227
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,020
Best get on
with your life.

228
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,821
It isn't true.

229
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,260
It's not so bad.

230
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,161
You've still got
people that love you.

231
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,994
Look to them, eh?

232
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,228
Isn't that right Niobe?

233
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,133
Best she gets
on with her life.

234
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,604
Best she looks to
the people that love her.

235
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,811
Forget Evander.

236
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,676
Forget the past.

237
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,148
Well, I'm away.

238
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,122
Need a drop of wine
to set me up for the day.

239
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,374
Lyde, please don't.

240
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,346
Shh.

241
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,874
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,417
You're sorry?

243
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,320
It's too late for sorry, isn't it?

244
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,882
You weren't sorry when you
were fucking him, were you?

245
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,292
You weren't sorry then.
I piss on your sorrow!

246
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,125
- Shh!
- I will not shh. You shh!

247
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,688
You're a thief and a whore
and you stole my husband!

248
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,224
I stole nothing!
He came to me!

249
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,702
He came to me!
I never loved him. I love my husband!

250
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,366
And if you'd done--
if you'd been--

251
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,443
If I had done what?

252
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,908
If I had given him
a child. Is that it?

253
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,075
I am sorry. Please forgive me.
Please forgive me!

254
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,950
- Forgive me!
- I curse you, sister.

255
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,616
By grace of the Furies,
I curse you.

256
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,092
I'll keep your secret

257
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,599
for the sake of the child,

258
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,601
but don't you ever...

259
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,433
ever speak to me again.

260
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,155
Be careful!

261
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,009
Ah!

262
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,874
Bravo. Bravo.

263
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,941
A little blood lust
suits you, Octavian.

264
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,849
You look very handsome.
Does he not?

265
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,650
- He does.
- Titus Pullo is a good teacher.

266
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,180
Well it's a pity Caesar
isn't here.

267
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,318
He'd put you on his
staff immediately.

268
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,329
Perhaps you should go
and join him in Greece,

269
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,161
get some real Pompeian
blood on your sword.

270
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,963
- Don't be silly, Mother.
- Well why not?

271
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,970
If we are not quick, Pompey
and Cato and all those fools

272
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,973
will be dead before Octavian
gets his chance to shine.

273
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,668
- He's still a child.
- I am not.

274
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,904
He is not. He is quite
the little man now.

275
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,243
I should think there's more
to manhood than swordplay.

276
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,377
Octavian,

277
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,079
- have you penetrated anyone yet?
- Mother, please.

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,953
- Does that mean you have or haven't?
- Haven't, but--

279
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,981
Titus Pullo, didn't I tell
you to sort that out?

280
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,993
I'm sure I did.

281
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,621
I-- sorry, ma'am.
I'll see to it.

282
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,631
Do that.

283
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,065
Don't worry, darling.
There's really nothing to it.

284
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,695
Once you're in
the saddle, as it were,

285
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,331
it'll all come naturally.
Isn't that right, Pullo?

286
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,068
That's right ma'am.

287
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,077
And none of your sordid soldier's
she-wolves, mind you.

288
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,079
Something clean and pretty.

289
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,980
- Clean and pretty it is.
- Good.

290
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,814
I'll get Merula make you a toga.
What else?

291
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,581
Perhaps you can arrange
he kill someone.

292
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,316
Oh...

293
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,551
that will happen
in due course.

294
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,855
We Julii always have
the needful enemies.

295
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,465
Health to my child.

296
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,008
My daughter.

297
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,038
I wish for a son,
a healthy son.

298
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,874
- l, uh--
- Good night, then.

299
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,408
Good night.

300
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,109
Husband.

301
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,138
What's all this?

302
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,449
I thought it might please you
if we had some time alone.

303
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,590
I sent the girls
and Lucius to Clarissa.

304
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,056
- And Lyde?
- She's gone to a friend's.

305
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,398
- Please, sit down.
- I've already eaten.

306
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,104
Oh...

307
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,938
But--

308
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,967
I can have some more.

309
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,075
Excuse me.

310
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,813
Sit down with me.

311
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,817
- That's all right.
- Really, sit.

312
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,217
I can't finish
all this on my own.

313
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,960
The calendar is correct...

314
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,706
if you would like
to have me tonight.

315
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,170
I would.

316
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,810
I'd like that.

317
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,527
My dear Mark Antony,

318
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,431
I hope this finds
you in better health

319
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,527
than my hopes for victory.

320
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,095
I chased Pompey from one
end of Greece to the other

321
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,266
and he resolutely
refused to fight.

322
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,038
I thought this was
his usual obtuseness,

323
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,707
but the old man has
some sense left in him yet.

324
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,150
While avoiding battle,

325
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,815
he has gathered a good
10 legions from the east,

326
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,983
and I find myself
badly outnumbered.

327
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,432
Now the cat
barks at the dog,

328
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,401
and Pompey is chasing me.

329
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,411
I can outmaneuver
him for a while,

330
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,277
but not forever.

331
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,883
My men are tired
and ill-supplied,

332
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,082
and we shall soon
have to stand and fight.

333
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,648
I ask you to bring
the 13th here

334
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,092
as speedily
as you are able.

335
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,533
Damnation.

336
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,705
Shall I summon
the legion legates?

337
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,737
Hmmm.

338
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,944
No. Wait.

339
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,976
I must think on this.

340
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,723
This is lovely.

341
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,861
- Oh.
- Oh, it's just your coloring.

342
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,263
A little loud. I'd prefer
something plainer.

343
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,962
What's the point in plain?
We shall take it.

344
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,800
But this one...

345
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,364
Oh!

346
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,839
Divine. Oh, divine.

347
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,610
Antony will love this.
He likes me in Eastern styles.

348
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,414
- How much for both?
- 5,000.

349
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,513
- You are a thief.
- Four and a half then.

350
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,547
Three.

351
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,454
Can we afford such expense?

352
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,690
Things as they are
with Caesar in Greece,

353
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,596
surely we should
be more prudent?

354
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,430
Don't worry about
a thing my dear,

355
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,437
I'm thinking ahead.

356
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,905
Titus Pullo is here, dominus.

357
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,205
Oh. Tell him
I am unwell.

358
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,639
He may come back
next week perhaps.

359
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,114
Tell him nothing
of the sort.

360
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,743
Octavian will be ready
to see him in one moment.

361
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,082
And  give  him  a  purse

362
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,384
You've put off this moment long
enough, my dear.

363
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,912
Mother--

364
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,152
You will penetrate
someone today or I will

365
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,059
burn your wretched
books in the yard.

366
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,689
Off with you.

367
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,207
Coming through. Noble coming through.
Make way there.

368
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:17,158
Don't worry, young master.
There's nothing to it.

369
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,562
If there is nothing to it,
why is such a fuss made of the thing?

370
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,396
You'll soon find out.

371
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,005
Vai, vai!
Be off with you!

372
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,537
This isn't no infantry fuckhole,
thank you very much.

373
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,880
Now now, my honey,
calm your stomach.

374
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,886
We've come for
the young master here.

375
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,354
Andwe're well  coined.

376
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,483
Oh well,
excuse me, of course.

377
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,493
I meant no disrespect.

378
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,724
We're honored to service
you, young master.

379
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,460
And what would be
the young master's pleasure?

380
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,638
First timer.
Nothing too savory.

381
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm sure we have
just the thing.

382
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,686
Something exotic, perhaps?

383
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,658
Or else something young?

384
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,821
Light, simple.

385
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,264
Little bit skinny,
isn't it?

386
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,393
Won't know he's
been, will he?

387
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,166
Won't know you've been.

388
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,366
More substance,

389
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,774
yet still nymphlike,

390
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,473
graceful.

391
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,146
This one's fresh
off the boat...

392
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,813
- That will be fine.
- Hold on, young master.

393
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,719
No point hurrying.

394
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,690
Big decision, this.

395
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,319
- Let's have a look at--
- This one is perfectly adequate.

396
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,955
You will be utterly
satisfied, I assure you.

397
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,626
Egeria, go prepare yourself.

398
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,930
If we might dispense
with the pecuniary details...

399
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,563
Eh?

400
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,904
Oh, right.

401
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,342
- What's your price then?
- 1,000.

402
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,471
Gerrae!

403
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,482
I could have half the whores
in Narbo for that, and their mothers.

404
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,246
We're not in Narbo,
whatever that might be.

405
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,488
All  right,  my dove

406
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,649
We'll pay.

407
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,252
But the girl better fuck him
like Helen of Troy with her ass on fire,

408
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,354
or I'll know
the reason why.

409
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,840
- Speak.
- Gnaeus Pompey Magnus sends greetings.

410
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,871
He hopes you find
his house satisfactory.

411
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,608
It'll do.

412
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,880
- Get to his point.
- His point.

413
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,390
Caesar is doomed
and you with him,

414
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,292
- unless you make a separate peace.
- And?

415
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,299
If you do, Pompey will
be merciful and generous.

416
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,927
How?

417
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,267
He will give you your life.
A province.

418
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,499
Money enough to preserve
your dignity.

419
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,334
What makes him think
I value my life so high?

420
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,808
Why have you
not left for Greece?

421
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,010
Do not smile at me.

422
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,181
Return tomorrow. I will give
Pompey his answer then.

423
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,185
Not that way.

424
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,492
And  disguise yourself.

425
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,780
Dismissed.

426
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,558
You take clothes down?

427
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,671
That's an interesting accent.

428
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,471
No understand.

429
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,039
Where--

430
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,142
are you from?

431
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,052
Oh. Where from.

432
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,817
Don't know.

433
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,848
You don't know
where you're from?

434
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,055
Rome take me very young.

435
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,967
Kill mother, father,
brother,

436
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,904
take me.

437
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,999
Oh. I see. Sad.

438
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,788
Turn over, would you?

439
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,461
On your hands and knees.

440
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,804
Ah!

441
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,753
Nice place, this.

442
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,781
Clean.

443
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,795
I don't suppose,

444
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,732
seeing as I'm
with the quality...

445
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,759
Not a chance.

446
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,613
No no no. No, do it for real.
Fight.

447
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,586
Oh, come on, fight,
damn you! Fight!

448
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,715
That's better!

449
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,454
Mmm, good.

450
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,130
Brava, Cynthia! Brava!

451
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,101
Oh, don't be so silly,
it's just a scratch now.

452
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,910
There there.

453
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,881
Yes, Posca, what is it?

454
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,851
I am to remind you
of your dinner tonight

455
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,046
with Atia of the Julii.

456
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,079
Sons of Dis.

457
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,615
Now, run along.

458
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,161
Where is he?
Where can he be?

459
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,758
Busy man. Politics.

460
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,894
Politics? He promised
he would come.

461
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,701
Castor!

462
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,229
Send a man to Pompey's--

463
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,300
I mean, Mark Antony's villa
and enquire his whereabouts.

464
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,471
Antony's whereabouts,
immediately, domina.

465
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,811
Do not say it is
I who sends to ask.

466
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,714
Not you sends to ask.

467
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,775
Stay. He'll know
it is I who asked.

468
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,583
Send no one.

469
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,022
I will send no one.

470
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,117
If he comes,
he comes, I don't care!

471
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,139
Halt!

472
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,781
Welcome, dominus.

473
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,415
Sorry to be so horribly
late. Endless business.

474
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,716
- Will you forgive me?
- Of course.

475
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,122
I confess, I had quite
forgotten you were coming.

476
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,388
So this is
a lovely surprise.

477
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,089
Excuse me a moment,
I will go and dress correctly.

478
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,173
Mmm. Here he is,

479
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,182
young Apollo!

480
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,912
- How was it?
- It was pleasant.

481
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,444
Pleasant?
I should say so.

482
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,981
- How was he?
- Like bull.

483
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,421
What's wrong?

484
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,446
Nothing.

485
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,550
Tell me.

486
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,368
Mark Antony does not intend
to go to Greece to help Caesar.

487
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,870
I have sworn loyalty
to a man of no honor.

488
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,075
Well you don't have
to go to Greece then.

489
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,106
- We'll be together.
- It's true, but still.

490
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,118
Haven't you always said
Caesar's cause is wrong?

491
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,881
That is not the point.

492
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,860
There is a moral
principle involved.

493
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,598
What an idiot you are!

494
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,910
Not hungry?

495
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,080
Oh, after so many years of
soldier's porridge, I am easily sated.

496
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,724
Well, this last
news from Greece

497
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,727
cannot have improved
your appetite.

498
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,626
Hardly.

499
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,860
And is it really so bad? Caesar
always finds a way to win.

500
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,960
Pompey has gathered 10 men
for every one of Caesar's.

501
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,836
Arithmetic has no mercy.

502
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,205
I'd feared it was so.

503
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,608
What do you
intend to do then?

504
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,447
I don't know.

505
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,621
You've become a powerful man.
The people love you.

506
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,994
Only because
they don't know me.

507
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,626
You could be the first man
in Rome, if you wanted.

508
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,863
I hadn't thought
about it like that.

509
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,430
Well, you should.

510
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,273
You should
think about that.

511
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,841
I'm thinking about
something entirely different.

512
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,874
Mmm.

513
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,769
Water.

514
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,069
I could sleep for a week.

515
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,970
I've been thinking.

516
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,881
We should get married.

517
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,084
Married?

518
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,788
Why should we want
to do that of all things?

519
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,033
- Perhaps I love you.
- Ah.

520
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,400
You're joking.

521
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,065
For a moment there
you had me worried.

522
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,301
I am not joking with you.

523
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,837
Oh, my dear woman.

524
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,847
Please don't worry,

525
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,712
I'm not going
soft on you.

526
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,614
I'm thinking strategically.

527
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,279
If Caesar is defeated,

528
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,551
I can't very well form
an alliance with the Pompeians.

529
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,452
- I need protection.
- True.

530
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,860
What's in it for me?

531
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,596
If Caesar is defeated--

532
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,900
Then I will be defeated also.

533
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,372
Only if you join
him in Greece.

534
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,671
But if you stay in Rome,

535
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,506
you will be
very well situated.

536
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,638
You have the people
with you,

537
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,705
you have possession
of the city.

538
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,239
You only lack money.

539
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,650
And whilst your name
is perfectly respectable--

540
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,587
- I am no patrician.
- Exactly.

541
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,750
But allied with my house, you
would have both coin and nobility

542
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,919
to make yourself king
if you wished it so.

543
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,486
And you would be queen.

544
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,795
I would be your loving
and obedient wife.

545
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,561
If only I were willing
to desert a friend.

546
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,334
A man of your own blood.

547
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,274
- Oh, too honorable for that, are you?
- I like to appear so.

548
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,370
But I don't think you'll die
for the sake of appearances.

549
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,542
- Will I not?
- Caesar will die in any case.

550
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,482
But you are far too clever
to share his fate needlessly.

551
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,826
I had not
realized until now...

552
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,993
what a wicked old
harpy you really are.

553
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,212
Get out!

554
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,988
Get out!

555
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,733
Thank you, Pullo.

556
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,244
At attention!

557
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,377
Ow.

558
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,196
Abed in daylight,
what luxury.

559
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,764
Wickedness.

560
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,778
Father, that dwarf
is asking for you.

561
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,439
Excellency Mark Antony

562
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,951
orders 13th Legion to muster
on the Field of Mars.

563
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:25,284
- Why? Where are we going?
- Greece.

564
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,319
Tribune!

565
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,323
- What shall I tell Pompey?
- Oh!

566
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,849
Of course.

567
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,124
Excuse me.
I had forgot you.

568
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,857
His skin is a little dry.

569
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,724
Have him well-oiled
before he is presented.

570
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,285
Bona dea.

571
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,321
- I am afraid to ask.
- Gifts for Servilia.

572
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,835
How fine you look.
Let me see.

573
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,372
I am so proud of you. You're a
real man at last, eh?

574
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,141
Why are we giving
gifts to Servilia?

575
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,877
The old crow stands in
well with Cato and the rest.

576
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,908
- When Caesar and his dog Antony are
defeated--

577
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,442
- If they are defeated.

578
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,888
When they are defeated,
we'll need her good will.

579
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:10,291
- And this will buy it, you think?
- I do not see why not.

580
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,295
A large penis
is always welcome.

581
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,820
- You think it's not enough?
- After what you did to her?

582
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,562
- What I did? What did I do to her?
- Please! I'm not stupid.

583
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,593
It was you made
Caesar renounce her.

584
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,333
- What if I did? She doesn't know it.
- Does she not?

585
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,104
- She's not stupid either.
- Servilia has no guile in her.

586
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,704
If she knows it, we would certainly have
heard about it.

587
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,577
You know best,
I'm sure.

588
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,845
In any case, you will
take the gifts to her

589
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,318
and see what
she's thinking.

590
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,322
She's always been
very fond of you.

591
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,391
And you will
go to Mediolanum.

592
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,587
- Timon will take you.
- Mediolanum?

593
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,755
Yes, they have a very
good academy there.

594
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,265
- I don't understand.
- You're a man now.

595
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,927
Rome's not safe
for men of the Julii.

596
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,900
His toenails are ugly.

597
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,205
Have them cut and painted and
put some flowers on his head.

598
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,337
Oh, and send over some ice.
Six barrels, say.

599
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,472
Six barrels of ice.

600
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,287
Well, don't
look so foolish.

601
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,686
I know what I'm about.

602
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,590
Your mother's too kind.

603
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,062
To what do I owe
this generosity?

604
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,337
It's a gesture
of friendship.

605
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,038
Friendship.

606
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,482
Thank your mother
for her... friendship.

607
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,679
I hope one day
to reciprocate her...

608
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,619
friendship.

609
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,750
I will go then.

610
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,925
Excuse me.

611
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,662
Wait.

612
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,300
Please, forgive
my ill humor.

613
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,373
There's nothing
to forgive.

614
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,709
I have known you since you were
a little girl. You have a good soul.

615
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,943
I know that whatever
others might do,

616
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,475
you are blameless.

617
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,148
I know that.

618
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,589
I-- I do not--
that is, I cannot--

619
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,559
Shh shh shh shh.

620
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,823
It's all right.
There's no need.

621
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,692
Tell your mother

622
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,728
that I am grateful
for the gifts

623
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,173
and that I treasure her
friendship as always.

624
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,478
You must come and visit
me again. Will you?

625
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,884
- I will.
- Promise?

626
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,053
I want there to be no
ill feeling between us.

627
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,356
I promise.

628
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,800
You be a good girl.

629
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,333
Do as you're told.

630
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,616
I'll wait
for you outside.

631
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,647
Shh shh shh.

632
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,341
Bellona protect you.

633
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,176
And Juno keep you.

634
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,882
A fleet of ships

635
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,975
has set sail for Greece

636
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,578
carrying the army
of General Mark Antony.

637
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,024
This month's public bread

638
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,027
is provided by the Capitoline
Brotherhood of Millers.

639
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,497
The Brotherhood uses
only the finest flour.

640
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,228
True Roman bread,

641
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,259
for true Romans.

642
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,514
This is cac, this is!
I'm wet through.

643
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,491
We're perfectly safe.

644
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,550
A very good offering
was made to Triton!

645
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,825
If Triton can't keep me drier
than this, he can suck my cock!

646
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,427
Why can't you learn to
keep your fat mouth shut?!
