00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,600
<i>Man:
 COME ON!</i></i>

4
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,895
<i>
- THIS WAY!</i></i>

5
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,522
COME ON, QUICKLY!

6
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,525
MOVE!
MOVE!

7
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,240
YA-HA!

8
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,099
OUT OF THE WAY!
MOVE!

9
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,438
EVIL INSIDE.
EVIL--

10
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,858
VIE!

11
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,041
- GIVE US A KISS THEN.
- YOU SHAVE, I KISS.

12
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,424
YOU TALK TO HIM.

13
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,509
I SAID I WOULD,
AND I WILL.

14
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,428
WE CANNOT STAY
HERE FOREVER.

15
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,138
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

16
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,723
THIS PLACE IS
A HOUSE OF DEATH.

17
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,057
I KNOW.

18
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,143
WHAT IF WE MAKE
A BABY HERE?
GODS FORBID,

19
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,604
IT WOULD BE A MONSTER.

20
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,233
I SAID I'D
TALK TO HIM.

21
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,333
HEY, BROTHER.
GOOD DAY OUT.

22
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,503
GOOD DAY FOR A WALK
IN THE COUNTRY MAYBE.

23
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,546
NO.

24
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,508
SPRING'S HERE,
BLOSSOM ON THE TREES,

25
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,469
- LAMBS IN THE MEADOWS.


26
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,181
BROTHER, THE FULL MOON
HAS COME AND GONE.

27
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,559
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CUT OFF
THESE MOURNING BEARDS, EH?

28
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,979
LIFE MUST CONTINUE.

29
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,152
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,947
- YOU SHOULD GO.
- AND LEAVE YOU
 HERE LIKE THIS?

31
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,533
<i>- GOOD FRIEND I'D BE.
- I'M PAST NEED OF FRIENDS.</i></i>

32
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,326
NOW WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

33
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,663
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
YOU CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

34
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,290
I'VE CAUSED THE DEATH
OF MY WIFE.

35
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,960
I'VE CAUSED THE DEATH
OF MY CHILDREN.

36
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,379
I HAVE CAUSED THE DEATH
OF CAESAR.

37
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,840
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO NOW, HUH?

38
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,425
WHAT?
RUN A BUTCHER SHOP?

39
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,096
FINE, FINE.
SORRY I SPOKE.

40
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,224
EAT YOUR DAMN PORRIDGE.

41
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,147
WHAT SORT OF WOMAN IS SHE?

42
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,025
<i>- WHO?
- THE EGYPTIAN GIRL.</i></i>

43
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,820
OH, HER.
I BARELY MET HER.

44
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,365
SKINNY THING.
TALKS TOO MUCH.

45
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,242
WELL, SHE MUST
HAVE SOMETHING

46
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,494
<i> TO LURE A COLD</i>
 FISH LIKE CAESAR.</i></i>

47
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,496
SHE'S A QUEEN.

48
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,208
CAESAR WOULD'VE FUCKED
MEDUSA IF SHE'D WORN A CROWN.

49
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,419
YOU JEALOUS, FLOWER?

50
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,796
OF COURSE.
I DON'T MIND YOUR WHORES,

51
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,382
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
MAKING LOVE TO HER SORT.

52
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,509
MEANING YOUNGER WOMEN
OF HIGHER RANK THAN...

53
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,388
THAT'S A GOOD GENERAL RULE.

54
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,265
I SHALL REMEMBER IT.

55
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,392
I LOVE YOU.

56
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,690
<i> ANTONY?</i></i>

57
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,444
A WORD, IF I MAY.

58
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,654
WHAT IS IT, DEAR BOY?

59
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,740
ABOUT MY MONEY--
CAESAR'S MONEY.

60
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,950
YOU ASSURED ME
I'D HAVE IT BY NOW.

61
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,495
I'M SO SORRY.
IT SLIPPED MY MIND.
I WILL SEE TO IT.

62
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,915
GOOD, ONLY THAT IS WHAT
YOU SAID SEVERAL TIMES NOW.

63
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,459
WELL, THESE THINGS
TAKE TIME.

64
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,129
WE ARE TALKING
VAST SUMS OF MONEY.

65
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,300
IT'S A GREAT DEAL
OF PAPERWORK AND LAWYERING
TO BE DONE AND--

66
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,636
SO WHEN CAN I EXPECT
TRANSFER TO MY CONTROL?

67
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,515
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
SOME WICKED WOMAN GIVING
YOU THE SQUEEZE, EH?

68
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,227
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL SEE TO IT.

69
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,527
TOLERABLE VOYAGE?

70
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,613
<i>- IT WAS.
- MYSELF...</i></i>

71
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,075
I CANNOT ABIDE
SHIPS AND BOATS.

72
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,369
TOO MUCH LIKE CAGES, NEH?

73
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,414
WITH THE ADDED
RISK OF DROWNING.

74
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,669
YOU'VE CHANGED
SINCE WE LAST MET.

75
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,338
HAVE I SEEN YOU BEFORE?

76
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,591
YES.

77
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,512
IN ALEXANDRIA,
WITH CAESAR.

78
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,558
IT'S THOSE UNIFORMS YOU WEAR.
YOU ALL LOOK ALIKE.

79
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,726
<i> WHEN I SAW YOU THEN,</i>
 YOU SEEMED...</i></i>

80
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,395
HAPPIER.

81
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,939
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

82
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,568
A STRANGE QUESTION.
CAESAR IS DEAD.

83
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,280
HE WAS AS A HUSBAND TO ME.

84
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,200
<i>- I WAS AS A WIFE TO HIM.</i>
</i>

85
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,161
<i>- I AMUSE YOU.
- FORGIVE ME.</i></i>

86
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,789
IT'S AN ODD THOUGHT.

87
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,002
A ROMAN CONSUL WITH
A 'GYPTIAN WIFE.

88
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,422
<i>- WOULDN'T DO, YOU KNOW?</i>
- I FAIL TO SEE WHY.</i>

89
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,592
I BELIEVE WE MAY
BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS.

90
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,303
HERE IS THE TEXT
OF OUR PROPOSAL.

91
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,471
WE WOULD READ IT
INTO THE SENATE RECORD.

92
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,060
"I MARK ANTONY,
CONSUL OF ROME,

93
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,730
<i> GUARANTEE THAT OUR ARMIES</i>
 WILL CONTINUE</i></i>

94
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,608
<i> TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE</i>
 THE THRONE OF CLEOPATRA,</i></i>

95
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,110
<i> CHILD OF PTOLEMY,</i>
 QUEEN OF EGYPT,</i></i>

96
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,279
<i> MISTRESS OF SEDGE AND BEE,</i>
 ET CETERA, ET CETERA."</i></i>

97
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,616
<i>- WHAT IS YOUR PRICE?</i>
- HER MAJESTY WILL GUARANTEE</i></i>

98
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,035
<i> 10 GRAIN SHIPMENTS A MONTH</i>
 AT THE STANDARD RATE,</i></i>

99
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:17,372
FROM WHICH REVENUES
THE CONSUL WILL ACCEPT--
AS A PERSONAL GIFT--

100
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,000
48,000 DENARII A MONTH.

101
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,627
- 35.
- 45.

102
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,046
42.

103
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,675
42, DELIVERED
ON THE KALENDS.

104
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,350
ARE WE DONE THEN?

105
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,230
ONE MORE THING.

106
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,483
MY SON BY CAESAR
IS NEAR FOUR YEARS OLD.

107
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,736
HE HAS BEGUN TO ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FATHER.

108
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,905
HOW TOUCHING.

109
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,990
HE'S TOO YOUNG
TO UNDERSTAND NOW,

110
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,951
BUT SOON I MUST TELL HIM

111
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,204
THAT HIS FATHER'S PEOPLE
DO NOT ACCEPT HIM.

112
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,957
NOT AS A TRUE LEGAL SON.

113
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,210
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
THE PEOPLE WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

114
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,879
WE HAVE NO POLITICAL DESIGN,

115
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,924
MERELY THE HAPPINESS
OF MY BOY.

116
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,720
A SIMPLE PUBLIC DECLARATION

117
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,472
OF PATERNITY WOULD SUFFICE.

118
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,225
AND WHAT WOULD
I PROFIT BY THAT?

119
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,728
YOU WOULD HAVE
MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE.

120
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,996
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

121
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,884
DECLARE MY BOY
A LAWFUL SON OF CAESAR

122
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,635
AND WE SHALL BE FRIENDS.

123
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,512
<i>- YOU DON'T TRUST ME?
- NOT SO MUCH.</i></i>

124
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,890
YOU HAVE A CHANGEABLE
LOOK ABOUT YOU.

125
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,058
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

126
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,728
STEADY AS A PRIEST
OF SATURN, ME.

127
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,271
COME NOW.

128
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,276
<i> IT IS NOT PERMITTED</i>
 TO TOUCH.</i></i>

129
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,158
NICE MANNERS...

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,494
FOR A WHORE.

131
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,213
IF I MUST PROSTITUTE MYSELF

132
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,340
FOR THE GOOD OF MY COUNTRY
AND MY FAMILY,

133
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,676
I WILL.

134
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,679
BUT THE CUSTOMER PAYS FIRST,
DOES HE NOT?

135
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,682
YOUR SON WILL
EAT SHIT AND DIE

136
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,726
BEFORE I MAKE HIM LEGAL.

137
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,773
YOU SEE?
VERY CHANGEABLE.

138
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,152
SORRY WE COULDN'T AGREE.

139
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,988
PERHAPS YOU'LL
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

140
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,909
WE'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER
TOMORROW, I BELIEVE.

141
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,232
HE WASN'T APOLLO,
BY NO MEANS,

142
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,653
BUT WHEN ERASTES FULMEN
WAS ALIVE THERE WAS PEACE
ON THE AVENTINE.

143
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,197
NOW EVERY GANG
IN THE CITY

144
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,991
IS FIGHTING FOR
CONTROL OF THE HILL.

145
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,993
EVERY DAY
THERE'S VIOLENCE.

146
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,621
EVERY DAY
THERE'S... HOO-HA.

147
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,623
- IT'S KILLING COMMERCE.
- I WILL SEE TO IT.

148
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,793
AND IS NOT COMMERCE
THE ROOT OF CIVIC VIRTUE?

149
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:54,006
CAN ROME LONG SURVIVE
IF COMMERCE IS--

150
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,466
YOU MAY GO.

151
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,767
SOMETHING-- SOMETHING MUST
BE DONE ON THE AVENTINE.

152
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,562
YES, YES, I KNOW.
I HEAR OF NOTHING ELSE.

153
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,814
THE GANGS WILL NOT STOP
FIGHTING OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.

154
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,066
IT IS TOO RICH A PRIZE.
WHOEVER CONTROLS THE AVENTINE

155
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,110
CONTROLS THE DOCKS
AND THE GRAIN SUPPLY--

156
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,321
- I AM AWARE!
- THE VIOLENCE WILL SPREAD.

157
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,990
IF IT IS NOT STOPPED,
THE WHOLE CITY WILL
SWIFT DESCEND

158
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,619
INTO CHAOS AND
FAMINE AND YOU WILL
BE BLAMED, I'M AFRAID.

159
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:27,039
THOUGH IT'D BE NONE OF YOUR
FAULT, OF COURSE.  STILL...

160
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,790
<i> I WILL HANDLE IT.</i></i>

161
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,044
NOW...

162
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,337
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

163
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,215
- YOU SENT FOR ME.
- OH YES, THAT.

164
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,926
SHOW HIM.

165
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,353
IT APPEARS TO BE A LIST
OF EVERY DISHONEST RASCAL
IN THE CITY.

166
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,896
VERY DROLL.

167
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,440
IT IS A LIST OF CANDIDATES
FOR NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS

168
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,860
DRAWN UP BY OUR BELOVED
CAESAR JUST BEFORE HE
WAS TAKEN FROM US.

169
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,820
POSCA FOUND IT
AMONGST HIS PAPERS.

170
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,657
OH, ANOTHER LUCKY FIND?

171
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,492
YOU ARE PRODIGIOUS, POSCA.

172
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,328
I WANT YOUR ENDORSEMENT
OF THE NAMES.

173
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,749
FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY
AND AMITY, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA.

174
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,793
ISN'T THAT BEING JUST
A LITTLE TOO BRAZEN?

175
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,754
WHO WOULD BELIEVE THAT CAESAR
CHOSE SUCH WRETCHES?

176
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,383
SURELY YOU DON'T THINK
THOSE MEN PAID ME TO PUT
THEIR NAMES ON THE LIST?

177
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,719
NOT AT ALL.
I EXPECT THEY
HAVE PAID POSCA.

178
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,429
<i> SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?</i></i>

179
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,014
MY ENDORSEMENT WILL
BE WORTHLESS.

180
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,517
PEOPLE WILL MERELY ASSUME
I'VE BEEN INTIMIDATED BY YOU.

181
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,687
- ARE YOU NOT INTIMIDATED?
- NOT ESPECIALLY.

182
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,939
AT PRESENT,
YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO KILL ME.

183
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,399
YOU NEED ME
TO RUN THE SENATE.

184
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,027
TODAY, I NEED YOU.

185
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,905
- TOMORROW...
- THEN TOMORROW
 I WILL WORRY.

186
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,117
TODAY, I SUGGEST YOU
LET ME STRIKE THE WORST
SCOUNDRELS OFF THIS LIST.

187
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,785
THEN I WILL ENDORSE IT.

188
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,621
FINE, FINE.
DO AS YOU LIKE.

189
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,332
A PLEASURE AS ALWAYS.

190
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,006
NEXT THERE IS A DELEGATION--

191
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,050
NO, ENOUGH.
ENOUGH OF THIS.
CALL MY GUARD.

192
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,719
IMMEDIATELY.
BEFORE YOU GO,

193
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,930
IF I MIGHT RAISE THE
MATTER OF MY RECOMPENSE
AND COMMISSION?

194
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,725
NO! NO, YOU MIGHT NOT,
YOU WRETCHED GREEK THIEF!

195
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,768
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

196
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,438
I'M SURROUNDED
BY MONEYGRUBBERS.

197
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,862
MARK ANTONY, SIR!
IT'S ME SIR!

198
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,614
TITUS PULLO OF THE 13TH!

199
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,324
LEGIONARY PULLO?

200
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,950
HOLD IT.
LET HIM THROUGH.

201
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,827
SIR!

202
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,496
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

203
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,290
REQUIRING ADVICE AND COUNSEL
REGARDING LUCIUS VORENUS, SIR.

204
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,542
<i> GO ON.</i></i>

205
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,504
HE HAS GONE AWRY, SIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TO
BE DONE WITH HIM.

206
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,429
<i>Pullo:
 VORENUS!</i>
 OFFICERS AFOOT!</i></i>

207
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,516
CENTURION VORENUS.

208
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,518
AS WAS.

209
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,020
SIR?

210
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:00,150
LOOK AT THE FUCKING
STATE OF YOU.

211
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,486
<i>- IT'S MOURNING DRESS, SIR--
- MOURNING?</i></i>

212
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,947
YOU MAY WELL MOURN.

213
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,698
CAESAR IS DEAD,

214
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,326
AND IT WAS YOU AS
GOOD AS HELD THE KNIFE.

215
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,204
STAND AT FUCKING ATTENTION
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!

216
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,920
YOU KNOW THAT YOUR NAME
IS DISGRED FOREVER?

217
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,590
I DO, SIR.

218
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,343
"I DO, SIR."

219
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,056
WHY THEN ARE YOU
STILL ALIVE?

220
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,857
WHY HAVE YOU NOT DONE
YOUR DAMN DUTY

221
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,192
AND OPENED YOUR STOMACH?

222
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,196
I WOULD LIKE THAT
ABOVE ALL THINGS, SIR.

223
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,658
BUT DIS  MY MASTER,

224
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,244
AND HE WILL TAKE ME
WHEN HE CHOOSES.

225
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,791
AT PRESENT,
HE WISHES ME TO SUFFER
HERE ON THIS EARTH.

226
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,881
YOU ARE WRONG,
CENTURION.

227
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,968
DIS IS NOT
YOUR MASTER.

228
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,182
I AM YOUR MASTER

229
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,602
BY SACRED OATH
UNDER THE STANDARDS

230
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,604
OF THE 13TH.

231
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,023
SIR.

232
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,707
AND THIS, I TAKE IT,
WAS ERASTES FULMEN.

233
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,167
<i> I TOLD HIM TO GET RID,</i></i>

234
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,920
BUT IT CALMS HIM
TO LOOK AT THE THING.

235
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,797
NOT CONTENT TO LET
OUR GREAT FATHER DIE,

236
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,467
<i> YOU START A DAMN WAR</i>
 ON THE AVENTINE</i></i>

237
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,179
THAT THREATENS TO ENGULF
THE WHOLE FUCKING CITY.

238
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,398
NOW...

239
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,865
WOULD YOU LIKE
A CHANCE TO REDEEM
YOURSELF, CENTURION?

240
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,997
THERE'S NO REDEMPTION.

241
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,504
NO MAN IS BEYOND
REDEMPTION, LUCIUS.

242
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,178
NOT EVEN YOU.

243
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,659
AND SO?

244
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,661
THE EGYPTIAN GIRL.
TELL ALL.

245
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,621
<i> WELL, E WAS NAKED</i></i>

246
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,999
BEFORE THE PRIESTS
HAD LE THE ROOM.

247
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,042
I HAD TO CALL MY PEOPLE
TO PULL HER OFF ME.

248
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,128
SERIOUSLY.

249
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,130
SHE WAS IN MOURNING.

250
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,592
SHE WAS VERY GRAY
AND FORMAL.

251
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,343
SHE WAS QUITE
THE LITTLE MOUSE.

252
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,012
ON JUPITER'S STONE?

253
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,890
ON JUNO'S CUNT.

254
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,474
HMM, NO.

255
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,603
<i> NOTHING AT ALL</i>
 INTERESTING HAPPENED.</i></i>

256
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,856
OH, SHE DID ASK ME
TO FORMALLY RECOGNIZE

257
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,192
HER BASTARD
AS CAESAR'S SON.

258
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,194
BLESSED IMPUDENCE!

259
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,488
YOU REFUSED, OF COURSE.
OCTAVIAN IS THE ONLY--

260
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,200
YES, YES,
OF COURSE I REFUSED.

261
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,785
WHICH SET OFF A GREAT FLOOD

262
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,996
OF ROYAL WHINING.

263
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,499
NO.

264
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,792
NO, IT'S BEEN A PIG
OF A DAY, ALL AROUND.

265
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,630
RUNNING THIS DAMN CITY
ISN'T NEARLY AS AMUSING
AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

266
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,591
- MMM, MY POOR LAMB.
OH, GOD.

267
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:56,136
MORE TEDIUM
TO FOLLOW THIS DAMN
DINNER TOMORROW, NO DOUBT.

268
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,472
IS SERVILIA COMING,
BY ANY CHANCE?

269
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,182
YES.

270
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,810
GOOD.
GOOD.

271
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:11,026
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BITTEN
BY A MORAY EEL?

272
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,237
I SHOULD THINK NOT.

273
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,999
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

274
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,089
- SOMETHING WRONG?
- POSSIBLY.

275
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,014
- AH.
- JUNO'S MERCY.

276
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,891
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

277
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,476
I SUPPOSE ANTONY
WANTS A SHOW OF UNITY

278
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,353
FOR THE EGYPTIANS.

279
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,815
SERVILIA MY LOVE,
IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO COME.

280
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,069
I AM HERE UNDER PROTEST.
MARK ANTONY'S INSISTENCE.

281
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,071
HE'S A TERRIBLE
BULLY, ISN'T HE?

282
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,365
YOU MUST BE VERY SCARED.

283
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,659
NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.

284
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,204
WELL, YOU NEED
HAVE NO FEAR OF ME.

285
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,040
I WISH YOU NO HARM,
TRULY.

286
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,168
IT'S ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW
THAT I HAVE WON AND YOU'VE
BEEN HUMBLED.

287
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,170
WE'VE BOTH SUFFERED ENOUGH.

288
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,714
YOU ARE MOCKING ME,
I BELIEVE.

289
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,800
NOT AT ALL.
I'M OFFERING YOU FRIENDSHIP,

290
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,345
AND RECONCILIATION

291
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,223
<i> WHAT DO YOU SAY?</i></i>

292
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,100
TWO FRIENDS TOGETHER?

293
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,023
I CANNOT
HONORABLY REFUSE.

294
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,108
I'M SO HAPPY.

295
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,614
KISS ME, MY DEAR.

296
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,246
ENJOY THE PARTY.

297
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,213
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON HER FACE? PRICELESS.

298
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,924
I SAW TIMON AND SOME
OF HIS MEN IN THE YARD.

299
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,635
KNIFE-AND-HATCHET MEN.

300
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,096
- SO?
- I WAS WONDERING WHAT
 THEY'RE DOING HERE.

301
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,139
SECURITY, WHAT ELSE?

302
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,767
THE OBVIOUS PURPOSE
WOULD BE THE ABDUCTION
AND KILLING OF SERVILIA

303
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,019
- AS SHE LEAVES THIS EVENING.
- THAT'S ABSURD.

304
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,189
THERE'S A TRUCE
RATIFIED BY PRIESTS.

305
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,233
- YOU CAN'T HARM HER.
- A TRUCE? PRIESTS?

306
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,485
YOU THINK THAT
BITCH CARES?

307
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,321
MOTHER, THERE IS MORE
AT STAKE HERE THAN YOUR
DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE.

308
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,991
THE POLITICAL SITUATION
IS EXTREMELY DELICATE.

309
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,243
HER DEATH WOULD THROW
THE REPUBLIC INTO UPROAR.

310
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,745
- I DON'T CARE.
- YOU'RE BEING CHILDISH.

311
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,789
DOES ANTONY KNOW OF THIS?

312
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,292
OF COURSE HE DOES.

313
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,253
ALL RIGHT, HE DOESN'T,
OBVIOUSLY.

314
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,921
AND DON'T YOU
DARE TELL HIM.

315
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,716
I'M SORRY, MOTHER.

316
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,301
YOU LITTLE BASTARD.

317
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:38,358
I WON'T BE NEEDING YOU.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

318
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,906
WHERE IS YOUR
DAMMED EGYPTIAN?

319
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,159
IT'S TIME TO SERVE DINNER.
I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO CANCEL
THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

320
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,704
OH, DON'T SULK.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE WRONG.

321
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,218
JUST AS YOU
DESCRIBED HER--

322
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,970
QUITE THE LITTLE MOUSE.

323
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,896
CLEOPATRA PHILOPATOR,

324
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,483
MISTRESS OF SEDGE AND BEE,

325
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,902
QUEEN OF BOTH UPPER
AND LOWER KINGDOMS.

326
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,196
PLEASE...

327
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,490
WE SHALL BE INFORMAL.

328
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:31,537
<i> WE SHALL ACT AS IF</i>
 WE WERE ALL EQUALS.</i></i>

329
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,667
IT'S MUCH MORE FUN
THAT WAY, DON'T YOU THINK?

330
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,255
NOW, WHO ARE ALL THESE
LOVELY PEOPLE?

331
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:44,508
UH... OUR HOSTESS,

332
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,677
ATIA OF THE JULII.

333
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,929
ATIA.

334
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,639
YOUR HIGHNESS.

335
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,891
NICE--

336
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,977
JUST AS YOU SAID.

337
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,065
COME HERE, BOY.

338
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,238
THIS IS MY DARLING
CAESARION.

339
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,160
DOES HE NOT LOOK
EXACTLY LIKE HIS
NOBLE FATHER?

340
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,996
UNCANNY.

341
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,623
LOOKS NOTHING LIKE HIM.

342
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,919
SHALL WE EAT?

343
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,448
YOU'RE BACK.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE LATE.

344
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,575
- HERE I AM.
- YOU'LL NEVER GUESS--

345
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,790
- TEVYE!
- LEVI?

346
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,459
RELEASE ME NOW, CHILDREN.
LET ME HUG YOUR FATHER.

347
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:43,752
<i> WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i></i>

348
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,379
SO HAPPY TO SEE
YOUR BROTHER.

349
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,922
YOU GAVE ME A START,
THAT'S ALL.

350
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,341
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
YOU COULD'VE WRITTEN.

351
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,009
OH, FORGIVE ME.

352
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,345
I CAUGHT A SHIP
ON THE TIDE'S TURN.
HERE I AM.

353
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,889
LOOK AT YOU?
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?
EIGHT YEARS?

354
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:58,016
NINE.
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

355
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,936
OH, MY PARTNERS AND I ARE
SETTING UP A NEW BUSINESS.

356
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,021
<i> I'M TO RUN THE OFFICE HERE.</i></i>

357
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,440
<i>- YOU'LL BE STAYING
 A WHILE THEN?
- IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.</i></i>

358
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,150
OF COURSE.  OUR HOUSE
IS YOUR HOUSE.

359
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,152
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
MADE HIM DINNER?

360
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,196
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

361
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,698
WE'RE NOT KOSHER.

362
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,659
ALREADY WE'RE NOT
GOOD ENOUGH, EH?

363
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,202
WELL, HAVE SOME
WINE AT LEAST.

364
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,204
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

365
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,832
SO, YOU'RE STILL IN SPICES?

366
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,251
SPICES, CLOTH, OIL.
THANK YOU.

367
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,919
<i> GOES WELL, I HOPE?</i></i>

368
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:29,089
OH, UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN.

369
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,049
IT GOES.

370
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:34,428
MMM, AND YOU?
DEBORAH, TELLS ME
YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL.

371
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,555
OH, UP, DOWN.

372
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:42,186
HORSES?

373
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:45,189
HORSES.

374
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,029
CONSUL, FAREWELL.

375
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,615
YOUR VASSAL QUEEN
SHALL WEEP

376
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,325
UNTIL SHE SEES YOU AGAIN.

377
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,161
I SHALL SEE YOU SOON
THEN, I HOPE.

378
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:02,080
ATIA,

379
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,458
I HAVE MADE A FRIEND
FOR LIFE.

380
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,293
I FEEL IT.

381
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,629
INDEED.

382
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,840
KISS ME.

383
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:19,598
DIE SCREAMING,
YOU PIG-SPAWN TROLLOP.

384
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,978
SAFE JOURNEY,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

385
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,490
WHEW, I'M GLAD THAT'S-

386
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:40,661
PARTY'S OVER!
EVERYBODY CAN
GO HOME NOW!

387
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,225
SO TELL ME THE TRUTH NOW.

388
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,477
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

389
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,229
I TOLD YOU, I'M JUST
SETTING UP A NEW BUSINESS.

390
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:11,149
YOU HATE ROME.
YOU HATE ROMANS.

391
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,819
<i> HOW MANY TIMES</i>
 DID YOU TELL ME</i>
 WHAT SCUM THEY ARE?</i></i>

392
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,613
VILE OPPRESSORS,
BABYLONIAN WHORES.

393
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,407
AND HOW YOU'VE COME
TO LIVE AMONGST THEM.

394
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,200
I DON'T THINK SO.

395
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,370
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.
THIS IS WHERE THE MONEY IS.

396
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,129
THINGS WERE GETTING A LITTLE
HOT FOR ME IN JERUSALEM.

397
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,089
BETTER I LEAVE FOR A WHILE.

398
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:36,383
<i>- THINGS?  WHAT THINGS?</i>
- POLITICS.</i>

399
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,428
<i>- OH.
- NOTHING SERIOUS.</i></i>

400
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,471
MAYBE I SPOKE A LITTLE
TOO FREELY.

401
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,516
<i>- OH, BROTHER.</i>
- HOW IS A MAN
 TO STAY SILENT?</i>

402
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,519
OUR SO-CALLED LEADERS
LICK THE BOOTS OF
ROMAN SOLDIERS.

403
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,521
- THE PHARISEES ARE--
- LISTEN TO ME.

404
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,773
YOU'RE IN ROME NOW.
YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE.

405
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,650
I'VE GOT A WIFE
AND CHILDREN TO THINK OF.

406
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,694
YOU KEEP THAT CACK TO YOURSELF.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

407
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,907
I HEAR YOU.

408
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:05,954
ALL RIGHT THEN.

409
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,248
HOLD HIM DOWN.

410
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,761
TAKE HIM OUT.

411
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,727
<i> HE'S DEAD.</i></i>

412
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,793
WOULD YOU DO ME
A SMALL FAVOR?

413
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,295
GO BACK AND TELL
MY FRIEND

414
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,422
THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP
TRYING TO REASON WITH HIM.

415
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,467
<i> EVERYTHING ON THE AVENTINE</i>
 ABOVE PERSEPHONE'S OAK</i></i>

416
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,929
IS MY TERRITORY NOW.
IF HE TOUCHES ANY MAN
OF MINE AGAIN,

417
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,307
THERE'S A GRAVE DANGER
THAT I WILL BECOME IRATE.
AND IF I DO--

418
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,519
<i> CAPTAINS AND MEN</i>
 OF THE COLLEGIA:</i></i>

419
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,897
UNDER THE AUSPICES
OF MOTHER CONCORD,

420
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:16,900
A SANCTIFIED TRUTH
IS DECLARED.

421
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:21,530
VIOLENCE SHALL CEASE
UNTIL THE WAXING
OF THE MOON.

422
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,117
AT THE SIXTH HOUR

423
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,786
ALL CAPTAINS ARE SUMMONED

424
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,580
TO ATTEND A PARLEY

425
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,332
AT THE AVENTINE COLLEGIUM.

426
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,557
THE FUCK'S
ALL THIS THEN?

427
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:33,519
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHO CALLED A PARLEY?

428
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,480
- NOBODY KNOWS.
- THE PRIEST MUST KNOW.

429
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,398
YOU CAN'T TALK
TO A PRIEST OF CONCORD.

430
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,818
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T,
 YOU FUCKING SAVAGE.

431
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,822
FOREIGNERS.

432
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,389
MY NAME IS LUCIUS VORENUS.

433
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,684
I SPEAK TO YOU UNDER
THE AUTHORIZATION

434
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,103
OF MARK ANTONY,
CONSUL OF ROME.

435
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,606
CAPTAINS, FOLLOW ME.

436
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,068
YOU'LL HEAR SOMETHING
TO YOUR BENEFIT.

437
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:50,596
CONSUL MARK ANTONY
DECLARES YOUR CONTEST

438
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,598
FOR CONTROL OF THE AVENTINE
IS FINISHED.

439
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,434
<i>- ALL VIOLENCE WILL CEASE.</i>
- HE CAN DECLARE
 WHAT HE LIKES.</i>

440
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,894
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT SO.

441
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,645
AS KILLER
OF ERASTES FULMEN,

442
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,899
I CLAIM HIS CAPTAINCY
OF THE AVENTINE COLLEGIUM

443
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,234
AS MY RIGHTFUL SPOILS.

444
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,278
THE AVENTINE IS NOW MINE.

445
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,198
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- YET, HERE I AM.

446
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,284
YOU CAN HAVE THIS OLD
RAT'S NEST IF YOU LIKE,
BUT YOU'VE GOT NO MEN.

447
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:15,162
THEY'RE ALL DEAD
OR RUN AWAY.

448
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,707
I'LL FIND MEN.
 ROME HAS NO SHORTAGE
OF CRIMINAL SCUM.

449
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,958
MAYBE I'LL TAKE
SOME OF YOURS.

450
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,253
BROTHERS,
REMEMBER THE LADY.

451
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,965
<i> WE ALL KNOW OF YOU,</i>
 LUCIUS VORENUS.</i></i>

452
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,176
WE KNOW YOU'RE
A MAN OF GRAVITY

453
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,094
AND WE'RE DULY
RESPECTFUL.

454
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,555
YOU WOULD DO WELL
TO RETURN THAT RESPECT.

455
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:36,099
I CAN'T DO THAT, BUT I CAN
GIVE YOU COIN INSTEAD.

456
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,227
<i> ONCE ORDER IS RESTORED,</i></i>

457
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:42,189
<i> ALL COLLEGIA WILL</i>
 RECEIVE A MONTHLY STIPEND</i>

458
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:45,317
DIRECTLY FROM
CONSUL MARK ANTONY
UNDER MY SUPERVISION.

459
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,195
<i> IN RETURN, HE EXPECTS YOU</i>
 WILL LIMIT TO YOURSELF</i></i>

460
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,280
TO YOUR TRADITIONAL
LIBERTIES AND MALPRACTICES--

461
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,158
NOTHING THAT WILL
DISRUPT TRADE OR POLITICS.

462
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,618
ANYTHING ELSE?

463
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,162
NATURALLY, SHOULD THERE
BE CIVIL VIOLENCE,

464
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,998
YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE WILL
BE CALLED UPON

465
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,918
TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS
OF THE CONSUL.

466
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,170
I REQUIRE
YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

467
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:07,923
AND ACCEPTANCE
OF THESE TERMS.

468
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,593
5,000 DENARII--
THAT'S NOT BAD.

469
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,637
IN CASH OR GRAIN?

470
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,056
<i>- AS YOU LIKE.
- ARE YOU WOMEN?</i></i>

471
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:19,768
ONE BARK FROM THIS RED DOG
AND YOU BEND YOUR NECK.

472
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:21,103
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

473
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:23,689
GAIUS IGNUS ACERBO,

474
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,149
CAPTAIN OF THE OPPIAN
COLLEGES.

475
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,778
TELL US, WHY WOULD SANE
AND RESPECTABLE MEN

476
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,448
LIKE OURSELVES, DO BUSINESS
WITH A POOR, CURSED,

477
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,826
<i> HOUNDED BEAST</i>
 LIKE YOU?</i></i>

478
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:39,121
GAIUS IGNUS ACERBO,

479
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:42,166
YOU ASK A FAIR QUESTION.

480
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,751
THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL
NOT DO BUSINESS WITH ME

481
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,170
ARE MY ENEMY.

482
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,006
AND SO THEY WILL DIE

483
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,674
MUCH SOONER
THAN THEY EXPECT.

484
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,676
STEADY ON.
REMEMBER BLESSED CONCORD.

485
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:55,345
NO MENACES.

486
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:01,935
CONCORD.

487
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:44,061
I AM A SON OF HADES!

488
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:48,190
I FUCK CONCORD IN HER ASS!

489
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,956
- THE TRUCE IS RAISED!
- BROTHER!

490
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:13,006
ACERBO, WILL YOU
DO BUSINESS WITH ME?

491
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,722
YES, IT'S FUNNY,
ISN'T IT?

492
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,307
I WARN YOU, WOMAN.

493
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,893
ANOTHER WORD ABOUT
THAT DAMN GIRL AND I WILL--

494
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,229
YOU WILL WHAT?
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

495
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:32,150
FIGHTING AGAIN?

496
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,820
HOW TIRESOME.

497
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,781
I NEVER TOUCHED
THAT WOMAN!

498
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:39,992
SO YOU KEEP SAYING.

499
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:43,579
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING.

500
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,668
ALL RIGHT.

501
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,461
ANTONY, ABOUT MY MONEY--

502
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,839
OH, GODS BENEATH US.
I JU--

503
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:57,217
- NOT NOW, OCTAVIAN.
- HAS THE MATTER MOVED
 FORWARD AT ALL?

504
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,428
<i> TELL ME, BOY,</i>
 IF I DID GIVE</i>
 YOU THE MONEY,</i></i>

505
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:03,557
WHAT ON GAIA'S GREAT ASS
WOULD YOU DO WITH IT?

506
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,476
THAT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION,
BUT I'D CERTAINLY START
BY GIVING THE PLEBS

507
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,020
THE MONEY THAT
CAESAR PROMISED THEM.

508
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,439
<i> THEN YOU'RE A FOOL.</i></i>

509
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,691
BASIC POLITICS, LAD.

510
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:15,486
ONCE THEY HAVE THE MONEY
AND SPEND IT,

511
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,779
THEN THEY WILL
WANT MORE MONEY.

512
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,240
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO THEN?

513
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:22,618
I WAS AFRAID
YOU'D TAKE THIS ATTITUDE,
SO I'VE ENGAGED A LAWYER.

514
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,620
A LAWYER.
HMMM.

515
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,623
HE CAN HELP POSCA EXPEDITE
THE DELAY IN TRANSFERRING
THE MONEY TO ME.

516
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,958
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
ANTONY'S FAMILY.

517
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,002
HE'S NOT, ACTUALLY.

518
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:36,256
ALL RIGHT, BOY,
YOU CAN TELL YOUR LAWYER

519
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:40,344
TO SHOVE A TAPER UP HIS ASS
AND SET HIMSELF ALIGHT.

520
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,555
YOU'LL NOT GET ONE BRASS
OBOL OF THAT MONEY.

521
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:44,723
NOTHING.

522
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:47,267
COME ON, MY LOVE.

523
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,022
BROTHER, WILL YOU PASS
THE FRUIT SALAD?

524
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,196
SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

525
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,031
I'M SORRY IF I'VE
DISTURBED YOUR LOVE AFFAIR.

526
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,158
- I MERELY--
- OH, SHUT UP, YOU FOOL.

527
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,993
LOVE AFFAIR BE DAMNED.

528
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:09,206
YOU WILL APOLOGIZE
AND PROMISE TO STOP
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT MONEY.

529
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,291
TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE
PERFECTLY HAPPY

530
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,001
FOR HIM TO ADMINISTER
CAESAR'S ESTATE.

531
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,712
- BUT I'M NOT HAPPY.
- DO YOU THINK I AM?

532
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:17,673
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

533
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:20,425
DON'T YOU SEE WE'RE
DEPENDENT ON ANTONY NOW?

534
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,555
WHO WILL PROTECT
US IF YOU DRIVE HIM
AWAY FROM ME? WHO?

535
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,850
- I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE.
- OH, PLEASE DON'T.

536
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:31,353
MARK ANTONY BUGGERS
BOYS LIKE YOU FOR
A MORNING SNACK.

537
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:35,357
YOU WILL APOLOGIZE,
AND THERE'S AN END ON IT.

538
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,698
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
FIGS IN THIS SALAD.

539
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,553
HEY.
HEY!

540
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,388
THAT'S ENOUGH!

541
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,891
VAI.
VAI!

542
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:11,894
OFF WITH YOU!
VAI!

543
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,480
THANK YOU, SIR.

544
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:21,361
PLEASE, SIR, I NEED WORK.

545
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,197
<i> I'LL DO ANYTHING.</i></i>

546
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,992
I'LL SUCK YOUR COCK.

547
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,288
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ALL
THIS FUSS OVER THE MONEY?

548
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,832
IT WAS OBVIOUS HE WOULD
NEVER GIVE IT TO YOU.

549
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:37,127
ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS MAKING MOTHER ANXIOUS.

550
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,255
SISTER,

551
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:43,300
YOU MUST PROMISE ME
NEVER TO SPEAK OF WHAT
I TELL YOU NOW.

552
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,593
OH, GODS.

553
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,556
I PROMISE.

554
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,061
THE REPUBLIC IS ON
THE BRINK OF AN ABYSS.

555
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,480
ANTONY-- ANTONY'S
A DESTRUCTIVE BRUTE.

556
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,899
THE SENATE IS WEAK
AND COWARDLY,

557
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:02,277
AND THE PLEBS ARE ROILING
IN WANT AND ANGER.

558
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,112
ROME IS IN NEED
OF NEW LEADERSHIP.

559
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,281
I CAN PROVIDE
THAT LEADERSHIP.

560
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:08,283
NOW, I ALREADY HAVE
SEVERAL INITIATIVES ON--

561
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:26,134
<i>Pullo:
 IT'LL COME TO NO GOOD,</i>
 THIS HADES BUSINESS.</i></i>

562
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:29,888
WORKED THOUGH, DIDN'T IT?
THE BASTARDS FELL INTO LINE.

563
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,099
OH, YOU SCARED THE FUCK
OUT OF THEM RIGHT ENOUGH,

564
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,059
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

565
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,270
YOU'RE NO SON OF HADES.
YOU'RE A MORTAL MAN.

566
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,230
THE GODS DON'T LIKE
THIS SORT OF SHIT
FROM MORTAL MEN.

567
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,692
I'M FOLLOWING THE ORDERS
OF A CONSUL OF ROME,
MY MASTER BY OATH,

568
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,027
FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE
AND PUBLIC ORDER,

569
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,321
<i> FOR THE GOOD</i>
 OF THE REPUBLIC.</i></i>

570
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,492
ARE YOU WITH ME OR NOT?

571
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,663
I'M WITH YOU.

572
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:13,223
<i> BY GRACE OF JUPITER,</i>
 GAIUS OCTAVIAN CAESAR,</i></i>

573
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:16,059
LAWFUL SON OF GAIUS
JULIUS CAESAR,

574
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,103
MAKES THIS HIS PLEDGE:

575
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,856
THAT HE PERSONALLY
WILL FULFILL THE TERMS

576
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:25,527
OF HIS BELOVED FATHER'S
BEQUEST TO THE PEOPLE.

577
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:28,947
<i> IN THE FIELDS OF MARS</i>
 NEXT NINE DAYS,</i></i>

578
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:32,159
<i> ALL ELIGIBLE CITIZENS</i>
 AND SOLDIERS</i></i>

579
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:35,329
<i> WILL RECEIVE 300 SESTERTIA</i></i>

580
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:38,540
<i> FROM THE HANDS</i>
 OF OCTAVIAN CAESAR HIMSELF!</i></i>

581
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:40,626
<i>- LET IT BE KNOWN</i></i>

582
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,879
<i> THAT CAESAR'S SON</i>
 HAS SOLD AWAY</i></i>

583
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,923
<i> ALL HIS OWN PROPERTY</i></i>

584
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,175
<i> TO HONOR</i>
 HIS FATHER'S WISHES.</i></i>

585
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:52,054
<i> MAY SUCH PIETY</i>
 BRING BLESSINGS UPON HIM.</i></i>

586
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:57,684
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
- WAKE UP!

587
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,645
WAKE UP AT ONCE!

588
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,230
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

589
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,689
WHAT?

590
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,691
THE MONEY!  YOU'RE GIVING
THE PLEBS THEIR MONEY!

591
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,653
IS IT SO LATE ALREADY?

592
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,863
I'VE OVERSLEPT.

593
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:12,366
I DON'T CARE.
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?

594
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,493
I'VE PROMISED IT.

595
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,328
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU BEFORE NOW.

596
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,373
I KNEW YOU'D OBJECT.

597
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,458
<i> I'VE DECIDED TO ENTER</i>
 PUBLIC LIFE.</i></i>

598
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,753
THIS SEEMED THE BEST WAY
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF
TO THE PEOPLE.

599
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,672
<i>Antony:
 THAT WILL BE SEEN</i></i>

600
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,174
AS A DIRECT CHALLENGE
TO ME.

601
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:32,511
YES, BUT THAT ISN'T
MY INTENTION AT ALL.

602
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,056
I SUGGEST WE MAKE
A PUBLIC DISPLAY OF UNITY
TO QUASH SUCH NOTIONS.

603
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:38,725
A PUBLIC DISPLAY OF UNITY!
WHA--

604
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,436
IT MAKES SENSE.
OUR INTERESTS ARE CONJOINED.

605
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,898
WHILE YOU ARE CONSUL,
MY NAME WILL LEND
WEIGHT TO YOURS.

606
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,400
AND WHEN YOUR
CONSULSHIP IS OVER,

607
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,777
AND YOU RETIRE FROM POLITICS
AS YOU HAVE PROMISED,

608
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,988
I WILL STEP IN AS LEADER
OF THE CAESARIAN PARTY.

609
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,823
I SEE.

610
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:55,075
YOU WILL NEED PROTECTION
FROM YOUR ENEMIES
IN THE SENATE,

611
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,744
AND I CAN PROVIDE THAT.

612
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:03,375
JUST WHO THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

613
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,795
- I'M CAESAR'S RIGHTFUL HEIR.
- NO, JUST STAY CALM.

614
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,299
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY,
SO HE CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY,
CAN HE?

615
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,426
THIS IS ALL JUST
CHILDISH TALK.

616
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,219
THE MONEY IS LEGALLY MINE.

617
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,180
I WAS ABLE TO BORROW
AGAINST IT.

618
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,682
- BORROW?
- BORROW?

619
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:21,059
HOW MUCH DID YOU BORROW?

620
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:24,271
IT'S NOT SO MUCH
IN THE GREAT SCHEME
OF THINGS.

621
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,856
HOW MUCH?

622
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:27,900
THREE MILLION SESTERTII.

623
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,528
OH, JUNO'S CUNT!

624
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,369

00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:18,075
- APOLOGIZE!
- NO!

631
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:23,664
NO, ENOUGH.

646
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:08,625
YOU'RE NOT FIT

647
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,393
WHO ARE YOU THEN?

648
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:29,521
SLAVE OF THE COLLEGE BROTHEL

649
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,692
SORRY, LOVE,

657
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:52,419
FAIR ENOUGH.

658
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:55,047
I GET MY OWN ROOM,
I EAT WHAT I WANT.

659
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:58,592
EVERY 500 COINS THAT COMES

672
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,692
DIDN'T LIKE FARMING
MUCH ANYWAY.

673

IT'S A DARK ROAD WE'RE ON.

00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:10,622
COME THROUGH THE BACK
AND SAY HELLO TO VORENUS,

679
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:13,125
- CHEER UP THE OLD BASTARD.
- IS IT TRUE WHAT
 THEY SAY THEN?

680
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,502
<i>- ABOUT THE WIFE AND CHILDREN?</i>
- TRUE ENOUGH.</i>

681
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:18,422
NOT A FUCKING WORD.

682
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:32,519
<i>- BROTHER VORENUS.
- MASCIUS, HOW ARE YOU?</i></i>

683
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:38,317
I'M FAIR.  FAIR.

684
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,902
COME TO JOIN
OUR MERRY BAND.

685
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,654
YOU TRIED TO WARN
HIM OFF, DID YOU?

686
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:44,323
I DID.

687
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,450
THIS ISN'T THE ARMY,
BROTHER.

688
00:47:46,492 --> 00:47:50,037
WE'RE HERE WITH THE PIMPS,

689
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,788
KNIFEMEN, THIEVES.

690
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,707
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'VE SUNK SO LOW?

691
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,086
I WALKED HERE FROM CAPUA.
I SLEPT IN DITCHES.

692
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:01,632
WHEN I GET HERE,
I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING.

693
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,553
THEY SAY A BLACK-HEARTED
VILLAIN HAS TAKEN OVER
THE AVENTINE COLLEGE.

694
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:09,598
HE'S IN LEAGUE WITH THE GODS
BELOW, THEY SAY.

695
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,393
AND HIS NAME
IS LUCIUS VORENUS.

696
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:17,314
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"MASCIUS, OLD BOY,

697
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:19,233
<i> YOUR LUCK HAS CHANGED."</i></i>

698
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,445
SEE, PULLO, I TOLD YOU
I KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT.

699
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,989
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
THE GODS DON'T LIKE IT.

700
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,116
YEAH.

701
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,369
WHAT MORE CAN THE GODS
DO TO ME?

702
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:32,120
HOW CAN THEY PUNISH ME NOW?

703
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,790
DON'T KNOW.

704
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:37,793
DON'T WANNA FIND OUT.

705
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,131
<i> Servilia:
 HAVE YOU HEARD</i>
 THE GOOD NEWS?</i></i>

706
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,135
I HAVE.

707
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,221
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE END FOR THEM.

708
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:52,182
FROM YOUR LIPS
TO THE EARS OF THE GODS.

709
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,977
A FOOL LIKE ANTONY
WAS SURE TO BLUNDER.

710
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,813
THEY'LL FIGHT AMONG
THEMSELVES AND THEY'LL
DESTROY EACH OTHER.

711
00:48:57,896 --> 00:49:00,524
I DOUBT THE BOY
WILL BE MORE THAN
A NUISANCE TO ANTONY.

712
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,067
HE CANNOHOPE
TO RIVAL HIM.

713
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:04,528
CAESAR DID NOT
CHOOSE THE BOY ON A WHIM.

714
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:07,072
- HE'LL SURPRISE
 YOU, I THINK.
- WE CAN HOPE.

715
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,660
THE SENATE SHOULD ASK
MY SON TO RETURN.

716
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:14,163
THE TIME IS RIGHT.

717
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:16,290
BRUTUS RETURN?

718
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,419
NO.

719
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,296
NOT YET.

720
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,965
- NOT QUITE YET, I THINK.
- WHEN?

721
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:28,802
WE MUST WAIT AND SEE
HOW THINGS DEVELOP.

722
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,096
WAIT AND SEE?

723
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,684
A NOBLE STRATEGY.

724
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:38,228
NOT NOBLE, PERHAPS,
BUT SENSIBLE.

725
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,939
IN ANY CASE,
TELL YOUR SON THAT I--

726
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:44,401
NO, NOT I--

727
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:47,571
HIS FRIENDS IN ROME

728
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:50,157
LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
HIM AGAIN

729
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:54,620
AT SOME POINT
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

730
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,626
HMM.

731
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,628
I WILL TELL HIM.

732
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,974
<i>Octavian:
 "MY DEAR MOTHER,</i></i>

733
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:19,019
<i> I WRITE TO BID YOU FAREWELL.</i></i>

734
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,522
<i> I'M VERY SORRY YOU CHOSE</i>
 TO ACT AS YOU DID.</i></i>

735
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:26,819
<i> I HOPE IN TIME YOU WILL</i>
 UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY</i>
 OF YOUR MISTAKE.</i></i>

736
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:30,614
<i> BE ASSURED,</i>
 I'M AS DETERMINED AS EVER</i></i>

737
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,617
<i> TO PURSUE</i>
 A POLITICAL CAREER.</i></i>

738
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:37,120
<i> DO NOT BE CONCERNED</i>
 FOR MY SAFETY.</i></i>

739
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:40,207
<i> I'M ON THE ROAD SOUTH</i>
 TO CAMPAGNA</i></i>

740
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,959
<i> WHERE I'LL STAY</i>
 WITH MY FRIEND AGRIPPA</i></i>

741
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,794
<i> WHO IS WELL</i>
 ESTABLISHED THERE.</i></i>

742
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:49,716
<i> I REMAIN YOUR RESPECTFUL SON,</i>
 OCTAVIAN."</i></i>
