1
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:56,146
Where are the grain
provisioning figures?

2
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:58,918
This can't be right.

3
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,766
I've been talking with the men.

4
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:13,033
They had no idea
Greece was so large.

5
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:17,406
And they're sick of the endless
marching you put us through.

6
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:19,206
We were plotting our revenge.

7
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:21,336
We must find good ground.

8
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,076
They're quite an amiable lot, really,
when you get to know them.

9
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:27,051
Ravening potbellied whore scum.

10
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:29,020
Let's hope they fight as well as they eat.

11
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,614
If you will bury your nose
in quartermaster's accounts,

12
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:34,421
you must expect to be gloomy.

13
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,793
Look up, Cassius. Look around.

14
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,993
Is it not wonderful?

15
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:45,060
I see only 100,000 mouths to feed.

16
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,800
You have no poetry in you, Cassius.

17
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,200
We ride with these men to save the Republic.

18
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,039
Yeah, well, sorry to be prosaic,

19
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:55,772
before we do any saving of republics,
we have Octavian to defeat.

20
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,173
Indeed.

21
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:13,589
If we play this right,

22
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,863
we can take Brutus
and Cassius by surprise.

23
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:24,342
They will be expecting
to face only you and your troops.

24
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:29,404
So when both our armies
arrive in Greece they will be trapped.

25
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:32,349
And there will be
no time for them to flee.

26
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,527
Do you understand what I'm saying,
or shall I speak more slowly?

27
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:47,320
No, making use
of strategic surprise is obvious.

28
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,799
To that end, there is a list
of the most prominent friends

29
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,929
and supporters of Brutus
and Cassius left in Rome.

30
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,560
We should kill them

31
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,803
before they learn what we're about.

32
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:01,244
You are a ferocious little cunt...

33
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,338
with a pen.

34
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,178
These are among
the finest men in Rome,

35
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:05,640
some of them my good friends.

36
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,414
Their money will be useful as well.

37
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:10,922
General Antony, tell them.

38
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,225
Cicero is the cleverest bastard of them all

39
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:21,461
and he has the largest network of spies.
He must die first.

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,992
There are one or two names
I'd like to add myself.

41
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,698
I shall start back to Rome.

42
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,173
I'll muster my troops and
let it be known I intend to go east

43
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,176
to confront Brutus and Cassius alone.

44
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,237
Lepidus, you will remain
behind with a small force.

45
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:37,579
Keep the peace in Rome after we've left.

46
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:39,607
I'm pledged to agree with you.

47
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,176
But I must say, these killings...

48
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,657
Send the list ahead to Lucius Vorenus
at the Aventine Collegium.

49
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:49,752
Add instructions telling him
to divide the names among the gangs.

50
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,990
I have a name while you're at it.

51
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,826
Not Servilia. We cannot kill women.

52
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,892
Not Servilia.

53
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:59,563
- Rufus Tranquillus.
- Who?

54
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:02,369
Isn't he father to Octavia's friend Jocasta?

55
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,272
Why do you want him dead?

56
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:08,142
I don't like the girl.
She's a bad influence.

57
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,671
This is not a game, Mother.

58
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,274
Her father is immensely rich.

59
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:15,719
True. Stone quarries.

60
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,487
Woe unto Rufus Tranquillus, then.

61
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:27,394
Make sure Vorenus knows
that he and Titus Pullo

62
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,799
should deal with Cicero personally.

63
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,427
All right.

64
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,529
Tell them...

65
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:35,039
to cut off his hands

66
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:38,532
and nail them to the Senate door.

67
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:42,069
I told the old fool I'd do it
if he ever crossed me again.

68
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:45,843
Nobody can possibly say
that I don't keep my word.

69
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,965
Goodbye, my love.
I shall miss you.

70
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:07,460
We're forever saying goodbye.
It's becoming tiresome.

71
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:11,374
One little campaign in Greece
and we shall never be parted again.

72
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,038
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

73
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:18,211
That would make me very happy.

74
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:23,822
When you return you must bring me
Brutus' head as a wedding present.

75
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,847
Yes, a wedding.

76
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,892
Yes, we must think
about that when I return.

77
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:34,558
Now, don't keep your darling boy waiting.

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,898
It's a long way back to Rome.

79
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:40,267
And you be careful with Octavian.

80
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:43,200
Of course. I know how to handle him.

81
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:44,867
That's what I'm afraid of.

82
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,882
There, see? Brings out your eyes.

83
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:03,085
What are you doing?

84
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,223
Wash that off at once.

85
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,201
Yes, Father.

86
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:18,000
What's the problem? A little blush.

87
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:20,601
Paint yourself as you wish.

88
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:22,443
You stay away from my daughter.

89
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:26,440
Mascius, tell the collegia
captains we meet here today.

90
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:28,919
Tell them it'll be
in their interest to attend.

91
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:30,979
- Will do.
- Thanks.

92
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,553
Standing up for me like that.

93
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,689
Shut up. He's captain.
She's his daughter.

94
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:42,700
He says don't paint her.
Don't fucking paint her.

95
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:45,202
Spoken like a true third man.

96
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,737
I like you.

97
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,675
You know I do.

98
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,506
But be careful, slave.

99
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,377
I have my limits.

100
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,764
Each of you's been given a list.

101
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,607
On it are ten of the richest men in Rome.

102
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,613
You've been given license to kill them

103
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,514
and are to take of theirs
what you and your men can carry.

104
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,440
Licensed by who, you?

105
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,044
By order of Octavian Caesar.

106
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,059
What gives you the right
to decide who gets what?

107
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,996
The list has been equally divided.
You all get your fair share.

108
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,363
I've only got two senators.

109
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:52,169
- Try to keep him out of the mud.
- I will, Father.

110
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:55,763
- Cotta here's got six.
- Right!

111
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,275
You got more equestrians.
It balances out.

112
00:08:58,777 --> 00:08:59,903
It's the principle!

113
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:01,978
Principle? What principle?

114
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:11,347
Lucius, Lucius, stop right now.

115
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:16,550
Lucius, get out of the mud. Lucius!

116
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,895
Lucius, stop right now.
I swear I'll smack you so hard.

117
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:24,869
Lucius, stop! Stop it!

118
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,033
That's the one.

119
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:34,841
I hope he dies roaring
with his knees in a knot.

120
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,848
Excuse me, lady.
Is this the way to the temple of...

121
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:55,563
You don't talk.

122
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,577
There's more than enough
here for everyone.

123
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:16,614
Close on 80 of the richest,

124
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:19,988
noblest patricians
for you to murder and then rob.

125
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,028
Which of you has ever seen
so much money for the taking?

126
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:27,088
What shall we do with all this wealth?

127
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:32,264
I'm serious. How shall
we spend this blood money?

128
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:35,296
Slaves? Wine?

129
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,807
Whores for the boys?

130
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:39,538
We can assume you have a better idea.

131
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,375
The Feast of Pomona is coming soon.

132
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,779
It used to be that each
collegium would distribute

133
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,646
fish and bread to the people.

134
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:46,981
Why?

135
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,418
As an offering to Pomona

136
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:51,422
and as a gesture
of goodwill to the people.

137
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,548
Yes, but why?

138
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:56,220
The people eat fish. Then what?

139
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:59,560
Then the people
will begin to see the collegia

140
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:02,328
as more than purveyors
of violence and fear.

141
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,460
But that is what we are.

142
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,635
It used to be different.
It used to be,

143
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:11,199
people would come
to the collegia for help,

144
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:13,541
for justice, for money,

145
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:16,308
for a marriage or a funeral
when they needed it,

146
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,111
extra grain when the dole was short.

147
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,051
What, we're gonna be
priests of Ceres now?

148
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,180
Thank you for the history lesson,
but that was the old days.

149
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:26,952
And nothing but war
and turmoil since then.

150
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,324
- Things change, brother.
- They do, brother.

151
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:30,885
They are changing now.

152
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,727
Whoever wins
in Greece wins Rome.

153
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:36,791
- Some kind of peace will follow.
- Suppose it does.

154
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:38,894
Peace is no friend to men like us,

155
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:41,167
men that thrive on blood and anarchy.

156
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:47,008
The collegia must change
or they'll die.

157
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:50,041
Suppose we don't want to change.

158
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:54,280
Suppose we don't want
to waste good money on fish for beggars.

159
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,280
I cannot force
any of you to be generous.

160
00:11:56,354 --> 00:12:00,080
However, the Aventine will be honoring
Pomona with fish and bread.

161
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:01,750
You spend your money as you wish.

162
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:04,318
Oh, I see. I see!

163
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:06,853
Play the big man
and make us look bad.

164
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:08,525
For that, you need no help from me.

165
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:12,230
Vorenus, you're right.
You're right.

166
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,500
It's a splendid idea.

167
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:18,600
We shall be charitable. We shall be large.
Let us feed the people.

168
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,736
By all means, goodwill.

169
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,174
So...

170
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,938
speak, brother.

171
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,535
Why'd you back him?

172
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,946
He's a man of vision, Cotta,
a man of vision.

173
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:34,213
It's our duty as Romans to back him.

174
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:36,447
- And?
- It's done.

175
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,832
I don't trust that Memmio.

176
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:51,802
- Too smooth by half.
- He bears watching.

177
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,665
You'll take care of Cicero?

178
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,730
He's at his villa in Tusculum.

179
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:58,038
They want it done quick.

180
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:01,876
- I'll get my kit and be off, then.
- No looting on this one.

181
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:04,780
We'll show some respect.

182
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,613
Right.

183
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,794
Off out, are you?

184
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,192
- Sharp.
- Don't touch that.

185
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,831
- Where are you going?
- Not your business.

186
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:32,640
- Just trying to be friendly.
- Look, love, I know your game.

187
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,106
I don't want any part of it.

188
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:38,115
Too bad.

189
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,278
It's a good game.

190
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,191
Go find yourself
some other fool to play with.

191
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,025
If you ever change your mind...

192
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:02,097
Don't flatter yourself. We're done.

193
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,204
What did she want?

194
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,274
Nothing.

195
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:16,344
- You know her.
- Yes, I know her.

196
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,480
Where are you going?

197
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:23,618
Bit of work. Only for the day.

198
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:26,794
Why don't you come along?

199
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:29,231
It's lovely country where I'm going.

200
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,728
Vorenus, why don't we all go?

201
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:43,572
Don't go.

202
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:46,484
I'll be back before you know it.

203
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,548
Save me some of that chicken, girls,

204
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,918
or I'm eating Lucius when I get back.

205
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:59,051
- Good luck.
- It's my middle name.

206
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:27,057
Dominus.

207
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,496
Speak, man, what news?

208
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,830
I've just spoken
to someone in Antony's camp.

209
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:38,927
And?

210
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:45,304
I think your secrets will be safe with Hector.
Out with it.

211
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:25,244
"My dear Brutus, I write
in haste with urgent news.

212
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:27,979
"Octavian and Antony are reconciled.

213
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,884
"Their two armies are united.

214
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,412
"They plan to descend on Greece
and take you by surprise

215
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,448
"with an overwhelming force."

216
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:38,192
Dominus, armed men
are at the door!

217
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:40,857
"You must retreat to Asia
before the trap is sprung."

218
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:43,834
- You must run.
- No.

219
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,529
Too late for that.

220
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,151
On your life, you must get this letter to Brutus.
Understand?

221
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:09,217
- On your life.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,421
Master, you must save yourself.

223
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:15,055
Show him the back way.

224
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,394
Be quick!

225
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,001
So are you Cicero, then?

226
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,339
What is your name, young man?

227
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,314
Titus Pullo, sir.

228
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:35,614
Late of the 13th.

229
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,480
The famous Titus Pullo. I am honored.

230
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,488
Likewise, honored.

231
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,157
Talk about famous.
Everyone's heard of Cicero.

232
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,058
Yes.

233
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,966
I daresay

234
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:55,231
your work today
will earn you immortality.

235
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:58,540
- How's that?
- I will be in all the history books.

236
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:02,034
My killer's name,
no doubt, will live on also.

237
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,373
My name.

238
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,609
Thought you meant me.

239
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:11,180
Good peaches.

240
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,555
Yes, just getting ripe.

241
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:20,723
There's no way...

242
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,700
I can dissuade you from your task, I suppose?

243
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,133
I have a great deal of money.

244
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:30,005
No, sorry.

245
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,601
Normally, I'd be tempted,
but you're far too important.

246
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:35,579
Imagine the fuss.
I get back and I haven't done my job.

247
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,706
Go away!

248
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:41,812
- Leave him alone.
- Give over.

249
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:43,980
- Put your weapon down.
- Never.

250
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:46,286
Don't mess about. I haven't got all day.

251
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:48,758
Do as he says, Tyro.

252
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,158
But, Dominus.

253
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:52,857
Really, old friend,

254
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:56,389
if you could see how absurd you look,

255
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:57,958
you would not protest.

256
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:00,527
Do as he says.

257
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,235
Thank you.

258
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,371
No, not yet.

259
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,372
Please...

260
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:17,581
give me a few moments.

261
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:19,587
Whenever you're ready.

262
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,838
Mind if I pick some peaches?

263
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,034
What?

264
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,375
Oh, yes...

265
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,139
take what you want.

266
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,840
Thank you.

267
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,080
Nice present for the wife.

268
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:11,874
All right.

269
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,869
Now.

270
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,481
Stop this at once!

271
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:31,292
Resume your hideous wailing when I'm gone.

272
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:34,559
Everything will be all right.

273
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,329
You've been freed in my will.

274
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:41,369
Take...

275
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:44,807
Take care of my people.

276
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,778
Yes, master.

277
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:50,941
Goodbye.

278
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,223
Easiest if you kneel.

279
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,385
You might not want to watch this.

280
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,930
- Such a beautiful girl.
- She is.

281
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:52,499
I mean no disrespect,

282
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:55,339
but it seems a shame
she'll never have a family of her own.

283
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:58,572
It is. It is a shame.

284
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:01,209
But she could...

285
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:03,812
marry, if you would let her.

286
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,251
I know Niobe would want it so.

287
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:12,353
Niobe would only want her
married to a decent man.

288
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,092
And no decent man would have her.

289
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:15,759
We might try and find her one.

290
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:21,228
What kind of man would marry a prostitute?

291
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,638
No man that she deserves.

292
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:26,609
- Lucius, stop!
- If she can't have a good man...

293
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:42,357
Take better care of your brats, peasant.
I could have killed him!

294
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,691
You stupid bastard,
you were riding too fast.

295
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:47,698
Fuck you and your fucking mongrels.
Get out of my way.

296
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:52,636
Vorenus, no!

297
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,294
The children.

298
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,200
Go.

299
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:03,112
Go, get out of my sight.

300
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:11,312
Get back to your game.
And, you, stay out of this road.

301
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:34,534
Anyone want some peaches?

302
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,616
- Good day, was it?
- Very nice. Yours?

303
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,922
No problem.

304
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,723
He's not a bad fellow, that Cicero.

305
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:56,995
Not stuck up, like you might think.

306
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,968
Give one to your sister.

307
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,967
More names from Mark Antony.

308
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:36,201
- More?
- Antony has many enemies.

309
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,071
It takes time to remember them all.

310
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,501
Surely we have killed enough.

311
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:43,411
Close on a thousand men.

312
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:46,840
The troops need paying.
We have to get the money from somewhere.

313
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:50,012
Agrippa has a point.
We should proceed more slowly.

314
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:53,023
We do not want to...

315
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:55,355
appear butchers.

316
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:57,020
Certainly not.

317
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,726
Excuse me.

318
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,033
I need some air.

319
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:34,222
- Long day?
- Very long.

320
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,431
It's tiring work, I imagine,

321
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:42,599
killing people,
even defenseless ones.

322
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,835
Most of them we shall let escape into exile.

323
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,638
They will only lose money and land.

324
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:49,669
Just ruined? That's all right, then.

325
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:52,683
It's not pleasant work,
but it's necessary.

326
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:55,160
For the good of the Republic.

327
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,517
Exactly.

328
00:26:57,555 --> 00:27:01,013
- If you'd excuse me.
- No, wait.

329
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:02,685
You've been avoiding me.

330
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:05,025
- I thought it best.
- Why?

331
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:07,396
To avoid any awkwardness.

332
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:10,533
Awkwardness?

333
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:12,160
I see.

334
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:13,670
I was right, then.

335
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:15,794
How so?

336
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,070
I think if you did actually
love me as you said,

337
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,304
you wouldn't mind
any amount of awkwardness.

338
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,972
No, I'm glad to know the truth.

339
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:26,313
Please, do not toy with me.

340
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:29,309
You cannot have mistaken my sincerity.

341
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:31,116
But to avoid awkwardness?

342
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:34,750
I didn't speak to you because
I know my feelings for you are hopeless.

343
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,953
But that's for me to say, isn't it?

344
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,160
No. No, it's not.

345
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,861
My father was a nobody.

346
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:47,928
His father was a slave.
I have not a drop of good blood in me.

347
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:50,668
So you have risen purely by merit.

348
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,836
Surely that is commendable, in its way.

349
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:56,840
You are sister
to Gaius Octavian Caesar.

350
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:59,849
You'll not be married
to the commendable son of a nobody.

351
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:02,250
- I'll marry who I like!
- No.

352
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:04,953
No, you won't.

353
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,824
You'll marry some useful nobleman
of your brother's choosing.

354
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:16,296
- Octavia...
- Just leave me alone.

355
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:20,028
I'm sorry.

356
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:26,702
I've been torturing myself
these last months.

357
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:30,640
I cannot... I cannot bear to...

358
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:32,740
Don't.

359
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:48,523
- Hello, Octavia.
- Maecenas, I came to see my brother.

360
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:51,592
I'm sure he'll be very happy to see you.

361
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:55,935
Agrippa, we can't find
the wretched blasted figures

362
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,237
for the blasted tax projections.

363
00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:59,640
Yes.

364
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,044
Lovely to see you again.

365
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:33,439
It is no small sum we are asked to give.

366
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:35,104
What guarantee is there

367
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:38,013
that our money buys
the influence we seek?

368
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:42,109
It is Herod's own agent
who makes this request of us.

369
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,553
If our money can ensure

370
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:47,819
that Rome recognizes him
as King of Judea,

371
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:51,794
Herod will be in our debt.
He acknowledges this himself.

372
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:55,356
But who exactly
does he intend to bribe?

373
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,562
Who knows who will be
master of Rome next month,

374
00:29:58,602 --> 00:30:00,433
leave alone next year?

375
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:05,170
We will not disburse the money
until the conflict is settled.

376
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:08,839
How has it come to this?

377
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,706
In this holy place

378
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:17,882
you conspire in bribery,

379
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:21,483
so that idolaters can rule
over your own people.

380
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:25,154
- Who do you think you are?
- Sit down, Moses.

381
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:28,324
Would you have
the Seleucids rule Judea?

382
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:30,162
Or the Ptolemys?

383
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:32,726
Better one we know,
one we can work with.

384
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,898
Why let any of them rule?
This is our land!

385
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,603
You are traitors to your own kind.

386
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:41,634
May Ha-Shem have mercy on all of you.

387
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:50,643
Name yourselves.

388
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,952
We are the sons of Arod,

389
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:56,083
from the families of Manasseh.

390
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:59,220
We are the wrath of Israel.

391
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,285
Oh, Tevye.

392
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,095
What joy it is
to have your strength at my side.

393
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,727
I don't get it.
Roughing up the elders, no problem.

394
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,329
- But where's the point in that?
- Zion is the point.

395
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,237
We're redeeming the Kingdom of Zion.

396
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:46,038
Remember, friends.
Remember who we are.

397
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,839
We are the chosen people.

398
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,779
Not slaves, not animals.
The chosen people.

399
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:53,305
Make way. Make way there!

400
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:02,758
Thank you.

401
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:06,092
- Everybody eats today.
- Bless you, Vorenus.

402
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,688
See?

403
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,199
Orderly as you like.

404
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:12,395
Yes, very nice.

405
00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:16,898
Octavian leaving today?

406
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:20,377
- Winner takes all, you reckon?
- I reckon.

407
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,470
Shame not to be there.

408
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:26,241
Those days are behind us, brother.

409
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:30,049
We've other concerns here.
There'll be peace soon, one way or another.

410
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:33,022
A good thing, I suppose.

411
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,149
But?

412
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:40,690
You know how it goes
with me in peacetime.

413
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:43,797
Violence is the only trade I know.

414
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,997
Peace comes, and the collegia change,
as you say they must,

415
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:48,960
I'll be on my arse again, won't I?

416
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,338
Jobless, telling war stories
to the rest of the drunkards.

417
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,773
No, it's different now.

418
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,781
You and me,
we can do big things here.

419
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:00,941
You will.

420
00:33:00,985 --> 00:33:02,976
You'll do big things.

421
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:08,150
It's good to see you so happy
and full of purpose again. It is.

422
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:12,184
But me, I don't know.

423
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:17,828
You're second man in the Aventine.

424
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,494
Second man.

425
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:23,273
I can see it on my tombstone now.

426
00:33:23,307 --> 00:33:26,902
"Second man on the Aventine.
He handed out many fish."

427
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:30,573
- Nothing wrong with handing out fish.
- No, no, no.

428
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:34,311
Canny business, no doubt.
But it's not soldier's work, is it?

429
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:36,046
I'm a soldier!

430
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:39,547
Least I used to be.

431
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:56,336
Second hour.

432
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:06,549
Second hour.

433
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:35,575
We should go.

434
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:42,744
Third hour.

435
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:44,583
Gods! That can't be right.

436
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:47,749
- They're always right.
- Third hour.

437
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,986
Blind, bawdy house slave.

438
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:51,824
Always.

439
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:55,021
Familiar with the species, are you?

440
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:58,193
I'm an unchaste and sinful woman.

441
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:01,932
- I thought you liked that about me.
- I'm sorry.

442
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:04,964
- I have no right to be possessive.
- No.

443
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:08,342
I like that about you.

444
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:27,556
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'll be fine.

445
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:30,965
Once you're gone,
I'm sure I shall be fine.

446
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:34,300
I really should go. I'm very late.

447
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:36,135
Then go.

448
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:39,369
- I don't want to leave you like this.
- Go!

449
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,406
Everyone together! Together, I say!

450
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:27,280
Octavian, please.

451
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:29,416
If only for my sake, be good to Antony.

452
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,858
I am pledged to it, mother.

453
00:36:30,894 --> 00:36:33,720
He's an arrogant shit,
but he's a good and honest man.

454
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:35,094
You need him.

455
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:37,828
- You need each other.
- I'm aware, Mother.

456
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,733
- Listen...
- Troops are assembling

457
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,960
on the Field of Mars.
We must be away soon.

458
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,098
- Where is Agrippa?
- I don't know.

459
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:46,632
Saying goodbye
to some woman, I expect.

460
00:36:46,677 --> 00:36:49,407
He attends to several whores.

461
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:51,209
Or one lover.

462
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,716
- I don't know which.
- Be a friend to Antony.

463
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:57,640
Don't be cold and superior, it will
only provoke him. It provokes everybody.

464
00:36:57,688 --> 00:37:00,418
We all know how clever you are.
No one needs reminding.

465
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:01,446
Yes, Mother.

466
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,060
I'm so sorry.

467
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:15,037
Hot from a brothel bed on such a day?

468
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:16,471
Shame on you, Agrippa.

469
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,804
I assure you, nothing of the sort.

470
00:37:18,842 --> 00:37:22,539
I'm teasing you.
It's fine. We should go.

471
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,878
Goodbye, Mother.

472
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:30,880
Juno bless you.

473
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,819
Thank the gods you haven't gone already.

474
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:36,553
I'm sorry I'm late.
Women's troubles.

475
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,721
Had to go to the temple,
the place was a madhouse.

476
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:42,891
- I'm so glad I didn't miss you.
- Give me a kiss, sister.

477
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:44,230
The men are waiting.

478
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:13,963
Forward!

479
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:27,610
So now you can tell me all about Agrippa.

480
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,306
Well, what about him?

481
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:34,350
How long have you two been lovers?

482
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:35,942
It's not true.

483
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:39,979
Please, don't lie to your mother,
you know it's futile.

484
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,428
How did you know?

485
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:49,058
I didn't until now.

486
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,124
You mustn't...

487
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:53,830
You mustn't tell Octavian. Please!

488
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:56,080
It's harmless enough, I suppose.

489
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:59,575
Both you and Agrippa
have good reason to be discreet.

490
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,634
You may as well enjoy yourself.

491
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:02,667
Thank you.

492
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:05,113
Just as long as you keep
your wits about you.

493
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:08,447
Don't think you'll marry him someday
because it won't happen.

494
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:09,952
I know.

495
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:12,318
But I love him, Mother.

496
00:39:13,357 --> 00:39:14,847
I love him.

497
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:18,993
Soft as cheese.
What am I gonna do with you?

498
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:21,926
Help me!

499
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:24,990
Gods, help me!

500
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,463
Gods, help me!

501
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:30,667
Please help me!
I beg you to help me.

502
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:35,167
Jocasta, what's wrong?
What's happened to you?

503
00:39:35,212 --> 00:39:37,510
Men came in the night.

504
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,777
All my family are dead.

505
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:42,944
They killed them and took me away.

506
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:46,615
- They have dishonored me.
- You're safe now.

507
00:39:46,656 --> 00:39:49,022
Isn't she, Mother? We'll keep her safe.

508
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,854
Of course. We'll protect you.

509
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:31,834
Whole place stinks of fish, doesn't it?

510
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,963
I don't mind. Reminds me of home.

511
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:42,504
Like fish, did they? Your lot?

512
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,639
I didn't know that.

513
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:48,742
We had a big lake. Deep.

514
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:51,411
A lot of fish.

515
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,150
What is the helmet for?

516
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:56,725
Nothing.

517
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:01,295
- Just thinking of old days, that's all.
- Old days?

518
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:03,993
Not today.

519
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:06,798
- Soldiers leaving.
- You mean me?

520
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:10,432
Leaving with them? No.

521
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:11,771
No.

522
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:16,301
Well, it had crossed my mind, obviously.

523
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:20,248
I'm in with the chiefs, aren't I?

524
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:22,774
I mean, if I was to go back in now,

525
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:25,982
I'd probably be first spear at least.
Legate even.

526
00:41:26,022 --> 00:41:29,219
Think about that, wife of a legate!
Talk about respect.

527
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:30,988
And money.

528
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:34,019
Probably buy a lake.

529
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,028
It'd be a short campaign.

530
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,163
Everyone says so.

531
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:51,337
Sons of Dis, I was only talking!

532
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:53,372
No call for blubbery.

533
00:41:59,456 --> 00:42:01,219
I'm "preglant".

534
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:05,686
What?

535
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:07,492
I'm "preglant"!

536
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,328
- "Preglant"!
- Pregnant?

537
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,561
Whatever you call it!

538
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:27,440
What is that you've got there?

539
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:30,009
You've been mooning over it the last hour.

540
00:42:31,187 --> 00:42:33,678
This is my father's signet ring.

541
00:42:34,724 --> 00:42:36,419
I received it from my mother.

542
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:39,519
I remember it on his hand
when I was a boy.

543
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:43,427
It's a good fit.

544
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:49,896
Sir, word from the scouts.
The enemy is sighted.

545
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,966
- At last!
- It's not just Octavian, sir.

546
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:55,480
- Mark Antony is with him.
- That's impossible!

547
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:57,035
The Heron standard was seen.

548
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,742
- How many legions?
- 19, it seems.

549
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:01,751
To our 14.

550
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:06,055
The worm turns.

551
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,817
- How far away are they?
- A day's march.

552
00:43:11,995 --> 00:43:14,088
Muster the men. We must break camp

553
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,394
and begin the retreat immediately.

554
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:18,663
No, wait. Stop.

555
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:31,071
Do nothing. We will not retreat.

556
00:43:31,114 --> 00:43:33,378
- Old friend, this isn't...
- No.

557
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,013
No more running.

558
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:43,284
We will meet them here tomorrow.

559
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,029
If we win,

560
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:49,623
all the more glory for us.

561
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:53,666
And if we are to die,

562
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:57,434
this is as good a place as any.

563
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,501
'Tis in the hands of the gods now.

564
00:44:03,546 --> 00:44:06,310
We have the upper ground.

565
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,614
As he says.

566
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,351
Heavens, I entirely forgot!

567
00:44:49,392 --> 00:44:52,987
- Today is your birthday, isn't it?
- Is it?

568
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:55,529
I believe you're right.

569
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:01,193
Happy birthday.

570
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:03,501
Sorry there's no cake.

571
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,400
Next year.
You can bake me an extra big one.

572
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:07,800
I shan't forget.

573
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:10,675
No cinnamon. Makes me sneeze.

574
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:22,781
If you need to urinate,

575
00:45:22,826 --> 00:45:24,623
now would be the time.

576
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:27,454
I'm fine, thank you.

577
00:45:27,497 --> 00:45:29,397
You sure?

578
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:33,898
Let us begin, then.

579
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:36,037
Watch closely, boy.

580
00:45:37,941 --> 00:45:41,206
This is how history is made.

581
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,704
Now...

582
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:47,281
let's have some fun.

583
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:53,456
Advance!

584
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:10,160
Sorry, rude of me.

585
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,674
Would you like the honor?

586
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:15,405
No, no, you do it by all means.

587
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:18,277
Thank you.

588
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:23,351
Advance!

589
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:47,359
What is happening? Do you know?

590
00:47:47,403 --> 00:47:49,462
No idea.

591
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:57,375
On my command, follow me!

592
00:47:57,981 --> 00:47:59,175
Where are you going?

593
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,548
When in doubt, attack!

594
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:07,682
Standard on Antony!

595
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:20,930
Go.

596
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,369
Thank you.

597
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:23,895
You two, on me.

598
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,100
- Sir!
- Yes, sir!

599
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:06,744
Sir, Antony's forces have broken the line.

600
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:08,850
Our right flank is gone.

601
00:49:13,723 --> 00:49:14,712
Halt!

602
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:16,486
Our right flank is gone.

603
00:49:16,526 --> 00:49:18,391
Send in the reserve cohort!

604
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:23,557
Testudo!

605
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:47,288
Forward!

606
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,674
Down.

607
00:50:10,546 --> 00:50:12,377
Cassius?

608
00:50:17,754 --> 00:50:19,051
Cassius?

609
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:22,284
What happened?

610
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:24,486
Not sure, to be honest.

611
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:27,553
Hell of a birthday.

612
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:28,859
Don't despair.

613
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:31,628
- The day's not done yet.
- Sir, our center is routed.

614
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:35,501
We must fall back.
We must fall back immediately.

615
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:48,946
I see. All right.

616
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:51,476
Come, old friend, we have to move.

617
00:50:52,855 --> 00:50:55,016
Sir, we must go.

618
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:57,117
Cassius?

619
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:05,190
We must go.

620
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,490
Sir.

621
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:42,730
It has been an honor
and a pleasure leading you.

622
00:51:42,772 --> 00:51:45,900
I am sorry we could not do better.

623
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:48,911
But you must look to yourselves now.

624
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:52,005
- Save your skins.
- Sir...

625
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,017
Give my best to my mother.

626
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:00,579
Tell her...

627
00:52:09,165 --> 00:52:10,962
Tell her something suitable.

628
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:09,082
Cohort, halt!

629
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:02,202
Keep searching!
Put the dead on the pyre.

630
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:03,872
Breathe deep, boy.

631
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:06,678
The smell of victory.

632
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:09,776
Smoke, shit and rotting flesh.

633
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:13,050
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- What report, Agrippa?

634
00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:17,890
The body of Cassius has been found.
We're still searching for Brutus.

635
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:19,224
Excellent.

636
00:54:20,263 --> 00:54:24,165
Have the head packed in salt
for transportation back to Rome.

637
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:27,294
People appreciate...

638
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:29,861
the little touches, I find.
