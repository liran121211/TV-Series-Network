1
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:06,208
You done?
- Yes. Almost.

2
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:07,917
Hurry up. Hurry up.

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,333
Today we'll reach early and take the front row.

4
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,333
After so long I've completed the DPP.

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:15,458
Batla sir is right.

6
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:18,625
If one knows inorganic the
questions get solved instantly. - Yes.

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,375
Lord knows why they teach SPDF orbital.

8
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,333
They should begin with Inorganic.

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,917
That ways student's
confidence will get a boost. - Yes.

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,250
For the first time I could finish
the DPP in fifteen mins.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,917
I finished in twelve.

12
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,417
Well, it's possible you
made some mistakes in haste.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,333
Wait for it to be discussed.
- Really?

14
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,917
Well, alright. We shall see.

15
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:40,917
The one who has more correct answers..

16
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,333
..has to treat the other
to Shreeji's onion puffs.

17
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,917
It's a bet.
- It's a bet.

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,292
You will lose.
- Come. Come. Come.

19
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,042
You have to do something.
It took you 15 minutes.

20
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,667
One should take time but do it perfectly.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,792
Vaibhav Pandey!

22
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,542
Yes, aunty.

23
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,000
Vaibhav Pandey.
- Yes, aunty.

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,625
Your fan was left on yesterday.
- No, aunty. The fan was off.

25
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,708
It was on!
- Maybe it was left on.

26
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,792
Aunty, the fan was off.
- Don't tell lies.

27
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,458
I could hear the fan
on full speed all the way up.

28
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,917
Aunty, when the sound of our
fan can't be heard our room. - Yes.

29
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,500
How can the sound of
our fan be heard in your room?

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,500
Don't apply your physics in this matter..

31
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,500
..because if the fan is left on again..

32
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:27,500
..I shall apply my math and increase
200 rupees in the rent next month.

33
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:28,208
Bunty!

34
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:29,500
Aunty. List..

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

36
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,500
Old hag! She is demanding
money whilst brushing her teeth.

37
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:37,250
So give her the money.
- It's not about the money.

38
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,708
Lalita Pawar!

39
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,792
In dad's presence she was acting
like Nirupa Roy.

40
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,167
He is like my Bunty.

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,542
I like.. Damn!

42
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,250
Even if I have to sleep with the fan off..

43
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,833
..I won't give her an
excuse to increase the rent.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,667
Okay. You can think about Tarka later.

45
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,667
Let's sit in the first
bench now and show them.

46
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,625
Only ten minutes left in class.

47
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,625
Everybody pay attention.

48
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,917
This is a very important exception.

49
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,667
It was asked in JEE 2005.

50
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:17,208
Silver Iodide is an ionic compound
still it's not soluble in water.

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,833
Why? Because Fajan's rule applies here.

52
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,167
What was it?
- No ionic compound is completely ionic..

53
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,750
..and no covalent compound
is completely covalent.

54
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,083
Very good!

55
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,625
Right, Meenal. You see..

56
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,135
Just like that your rank just rose by 500

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,708
 and you move from Computer Science in IIT BHU
to Metallurgy IIT Bombay.

58
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,083
Look, its Inorganic that improves rank.

59
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:43,542
What was your rank, sir?

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,958
What? DPP.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,042
Yes, yes. Let's do DPP.

62
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,500
All of you bring it out. Come on.

63
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,500
Get this repaired.

64
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,250
This is most important.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Please continue.

66
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,250
These are the faculty feedback forms.

67
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,375
Fill if you care to and return them in two days.

68
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,792
And only five days remain
towards the third installment.

69
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,125
And the next lecture will
also be given by Batla.... sir.

70
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,833
As you might be knowing Bansal sir has
gone to Romania for the Math Olympiad.

71
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,625
Abroad?
- Yes.

72
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,813
And you. Get a haircut.

73
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,125
Where are you loitering?

74
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,667
Yes. So, let's do the DPP.
- Yes, sir!

75
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,708
Good! I like excited state.

76
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,083
Good!

77
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:44,125
Yes. So, the first answer is A.

78
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,583
The second answer is C.

79
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:01,667
The third answer is D.

80
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,962
The fourth answer is

81
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,546
 B.

82
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,833
The sixth answer is C.

83
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,542
B.

84
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,083
C.

85
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,750
(Muffled)

86
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,125
(Muffled)

87
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,042
(Muffled)

88
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,500
(Muffled)

89
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,000
Now write your marks on the DPP.

90
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,958
And keep them away for revision.

91
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,083
And what about the 15th, sir.

92
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,708
That is a chocolate problem.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I included that exclusively for the A1 batch. You skip it.

94
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,750
Okay, sir.
- Sir! Sir!

95
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,000
Sir, how can the answer
to the 14th question be C?

96
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,917
Sir, this cannot become a compound.

97
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,458
The octet rule will break here.

98
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,250
Yes. You are absolutely correct.

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,125
So?
- This is an exception, son.

100
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,833
Exception?

101
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,250
But, sir, rules cannot break in science.

102
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,792
Who told you that?

103
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:19,000
Exception is the rule of chemistry.

104
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,333
Got it?

105
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,917
Come on. Let's start salt analysis.
Sit down. Sit down.

106
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,667
Sit down.

107
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,792
Okay, so. Pay attention. Everybody listen.

108
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:30,792
It's very important.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,333
Why are you laughing?
You got three answers correct.

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,000
You got two. Puffs.

111
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,375
We took this very lightly, bro.

112
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:49,708
Thought it's a piece of cake . It isn't.
- Yes, bro. It's certainly not a piece of cake.

113
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,958
It is extremely spicy today, bro.

114
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,542
Water.

115
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,917
Water.

116
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,625
Brother. Water.

117
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,625
Here. Have this.

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,875
Hold this.

119
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,458
Easy. Easy.

120
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,875
Okay?

121
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,750
May I have it all?
- You may.

122
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,375
Just give me the wrapper.
- Thank you.

123
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:21,625
Wrapper?

124
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,958
He must be eco-friendly.

125
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,500
Very promising.

126
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,750
No, no. These are not wrappers.
They are my trophies.

127
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,625
My fourth chocolate problem.

128
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,958
You can solve the chocolate problem?

129
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,000
You are in A6, aren't you?
- So?

130
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,833
Not just me.
Five others have also done it.

131
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:48,875
What are you saying? - Exactly, don't do it.
It is only for the A1 batch.

132
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
Give me the wrapper.

133
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,500
Bro.

134
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,958
So, how much.. Not that it matters to me.

135
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,458
How much do you
score in Inorganic DPP?

136
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,208
In inorganic?

137
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,708
About 12 or 13.

138
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,875
You?

139
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,667
13 or 14 types.

140
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,042
Yes. 13 or 14.

141
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,042
Very promising! Very promising!

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,458
These people can solve
the chocolate problem.

143
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,792
What is different in their A6 from our A5?

144
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,958
The color of the walls.
The width of the benches.

145
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,875
The number of fans.

146
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,792
Also, the faculty.

147
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,625
Why?

148
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,375
Come. I'll tell you.

149
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,542
Come. Come. Come.

150
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,917
What are you doing? Are you insane?

151
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,583
Give him zero. Zero.

152
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,875
If Batla's teaching isn't up to the mark..

153
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,583
..what will we give
him in the feedback form?

154
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,792
We will give him a zero, won't we?

155
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:35,250
Awarding bad marks and humiliating thereafter
suits teachers, not students.

156
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,417
That too from A5.

157
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,208
You dork! If we don't give bad feedback..

158
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,583
..he only will continue to teach.

159
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,042
Then how will you learn inorganic?

160
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,042
Teachers are equal to parents.

161
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,792
Then you should give them feedback too.

162
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,042
Dad, you are not up
to the mark as a father.

163
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,417
Hereafter uncle will sleep in your bedroom.

164
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,042
That doesn't make sense. Cool down.

165
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,083
Go and switch on the fan.

166
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,250
The fan won't be switched on today.

167
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,000
But I am feeling a little hot.

168
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,167
Fill the form first.
Then the fan will be switched on.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,333
I am going to drink water.

170
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,125
Meena!

171
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,708
There was this 'Dwapar' era..

172
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,375
..when Gurus like Dronacharya
used to be respected.

173
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,125
 And here is this era..
- Hey! Even Arjun fought Dronacharya.

174
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,125
Even your Ramayana is weak..

175
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,417
..where as Dronacharya sir
was like the best teacher ever.

176
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,833
Bestest teacher ever!

177
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,833
And yet he fought with him. Why?

178
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,542
For seizure of a plot.

179
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:47,125
And you, Meena, can't even fill
a single feedback form against Batla for JEE.

180
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,125
If it were me, I'd have leapt from here.

181
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,083
Go ahead. Give him bad marks.
I won't do it.

182
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,417
Okay.

183
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,750
Okay. Fine. Fine.

184
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,333
You'll also rot in some
private engineering college like that Batla of yours.

185
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,542
Bloody non-IITians.

186
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,792
Hey!

187
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,583
What's going on?
- Nothing, aunty.

188
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,958
I felt a spray of water.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,083
You are playing holi with drinking water?

190
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,833
You are right, aunt.
- No, aunty. We were simply.

191
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:15,833
300 rupees will be increased.

192
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,833
Aunty. Aunty.
- Bunty!

193
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,958
Aunty, listen to me. Aunty!

194
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,125
I am just like your Bunty.

195
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,083
Mummy!

196
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,042
I will fill water from
the neighboring institute.

197
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,875
But will not pay this witch! Bloody grouch.

198
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,042
Take this. I've signed it.

199
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,167
Fill what you want in it. Son of a witch!

200
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,417
Sorry, pal. - It's okay, bro.

201
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,875
'Only a cloud understands
the thirst of the Earth.'

202
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,417
Hey, Kumar Vishwas! Come.
- Where?

203
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
Come along.

204
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,417
We have given it..

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,375
..but Batla will only be removed
when everyone gives bad feedback.

206
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:05,250
"What good is a life with no friends?"

207
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,500
Take this, bro. I filled the form.

208
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,875
Remove that scoundrel Chauhan!

209
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,583
The faculty's name is Batla.

210
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,583
Chauhan sir teaches in A2, not in A5.

211
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,958
Oh crap! I've fallen till A5?

212
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:27,292
"Not by maps, not by religion or by need."

213
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,458
"My world is made up of friends."

214
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,917
"Made up of your love,
your sound and your worship."

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,875
"My world is made up of friends."

216
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
Just a minute.

217
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,042
No. Neither will I give a negative feedback
and nor will let you give it.

218
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,875
Why? Is he your uncle? - Yes!

219
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,542
He is your uncle?
- Yes.

220
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,250
Family?
- Yes. Family.

221
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,542
Look, bro. Teaching style.. Batla?
- Zero.

222
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,000
Two. Two. Let's give the poor chap two.

223
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,250
Doubt solving. - Zero!

224
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,000
One. One. One.

225
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,875
Personality. - Zero!

226
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,000
Zero. Zero. Zero.

227
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,500
And punctuality. - Nil.

228
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:30,000
Sorry. I revise my periodic table
once daily before lunch and after dinner.

229
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,333
That's nice.

230
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,833
Very nice!

231
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,417
The form? - Oh, feedback form!

232
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,850
I am doing well in Inorganic so,
no need for me to fill it up.

233
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,833
Well, bye. I have to revise
all the atomic radii too.

234
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,750
Let's go, Vaibhav. Come.

235
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,750
We are in A5 but we are not destined..

236
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:53,583
..to be able to solve the chocolate
problem like the A6 students.

237
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,000
What did you say?

238
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
Very nice initiative!

239
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,292
Batla should be changed.

240
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,333
In fact, every teacher in this
coaching class should be changed.

241
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,958
No, no. This coaching
industry should change.

242
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,333
Exam pattern, syllabus, curriculum.
Pedagogy should change.

243
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,333
IIT should change. This whole
educational system should change.

244
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,625
And for that..

245
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,333
..patriarchy should change.

246
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,167
What do you think, Shivangi?

247
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,167
I think you should attend class first.

248
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,375
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. Inorganic.

249
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,292
What is AWS under inorganic?

250
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,167
Awasthi. Will he teach us now?
- What? Batla is gone?

251
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,167
He acted very respectable.

252
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,708
He isn't gone. He has been removed.

253
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,625
Uncle.

254
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,792
Mr. Batla.
- Hi.

255
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,542
How are you?
- Yes. Sit. Sit. Sit.

256
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,000
So, tell me. What brings you here?

257
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,500
I just wanted to talk to you, sir.

258
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,792
Yes, yes. Tell me. - Sir, I've lost A5.

259
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,500
Yes. - If you could let me
give extra classes to resolve doubts..

260
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,917
Doubt classes that too of Inorganic?
Who will attend, sir?

261
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,750
Just don't decrease my salary.
I will do anything.

262
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,542
Give me a junior class if you wish.

263
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,500
I can even teach 8th grade physics.

264
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,708
How can you say that, sir?
You are respectable to us, sir.

265
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,583
Not true, sir.
The other subjects are respected..

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,583
..when inorganic demands
the most hard work. - Yes.

267
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,458
One has to revise every morning.

268
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,667
Yet the others have better salaries.

269
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,375
Look, sir.
Math and Physics are taught by IITians.

270
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,000
Pay less to them and
other institutes poach them.

271
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,750
That's why brother-in-law
pays them so much.

272
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,250
What can I do in this matter, sir?

273
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,250
I could only offer your nephew a scholarship.
Did I or didn't I?

274
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,042
Yes, sir.

275
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,750
When in fact, he didn't deserve it.

276
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,042
But, sir, even if I was to be removed
Mr. Rao. would've been a respectable replacement.

277
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:28,833
Or maybe that teacher of A6.
Parminder.

278
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,125
Even he would have been a better option.

279
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,125
But sir, you replaced me with my junior.

280
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,833
You know what, sir? He is a psycho.

281
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,833
He doesn't know anything.
He used to attend my lectures.

282
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,625
In that case,
sir, even you made a mistake, didn't you?

283
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,500
Junior and senior don't
matter in inorganic, sir.

284
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,542
Someone had to be retained. So, we did.

285
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,625
And that poor chap will be a psycho.

286
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,375
He too has been idling
at home for the past 4 months.

287
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:55,375
He can idle another four months.
He owns two hostels.

288
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,792
Tell me something, sir.
If he was a true teacher..

289
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,917
..wouldn't he join
some coaching institute by now?

290
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,167
Why are you making
fun of the poor chap, sir?

291
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:07,958
Even you are aware
no institute poaches Inorganic faculty.

292
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,500
Up! Stand up quickly!

293
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,500
What have you studied till
date if you don't know this exception?

294
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,000
Call your family today and tell
them you won't be able to crack IIT.

295
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,808
And if you don't have
the courage to tell them, then download 'tic tok'.

296
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,500
Many jerks like you dance there
and even earn more than they deserve.

297
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,917
I'll be your first customer. Take this!

298
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,417
You scored four out of fifteen.

299
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,792
Sir, do you discuss the chocolate problems?
- Yes, yes.

300
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,040
Of course I do.
- So what is the reason for this exception...

301
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,038
But only with A1 batch students.

302
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,833
..because they don't ask
stupid questions like A5 students.

303
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,833
These are facts, information. But no!

304
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,703
"We want logic."

305
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,292
Sir, why do notes only come
in 100 and 50 rupee denominations?

306
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,667
Why not 75?

307
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,875
Why did Ranbir choose Alia?
Why not Deepika?

308
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,250
Simply memorize what's
written and be done with it.

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,833
But no! "We want logic.
We want to be toppers."

310
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,333
"Sir, do you know why I am
a topper from A5 and not from A1?

311
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:15,458
Because I am an ass."

312
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,560
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

313
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,833
If you want to learn inorganic
then you do as I tell you.

314
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,833
Keep memorizing it.
That's that!

315
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,833
No questions asked.

316
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,250
Everyone got it!?
- Yes, sir!

317
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,167
Say it aloud. - Yes, sir!

318
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,333
I can't hear you.
- Yes, sir!

319
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,792
Good!

320
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,500
Now some questions from JEE '97.

321
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:41,708
We shall solve them.

322
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,209
They're really important for you guys.

323
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,208
Remove your note books.

324
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,000
Sir, we have a request.

325
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,000
Have you paid the installment?
- We paid it, sir!

326
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
We paid it long ago.

327
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,333
Okay, talk.

328
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,583
Sir, you..

329
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,500
Sir, can the Inorganic faculty
be changed once again?

330
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,500
Yes.

331
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,917
Why not?

332
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,250
Fill the feedback form next year.

333
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,500
It'll be changed.

334
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,792
Sir. Next year will be too late, sir.

335
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,958
Why don't you reinstate Batla sir?

336
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,625
You worthless chaps should
never be given the feedback forms.

337
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,625
The toppers never make any fuss.

338
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,958
Get out!

339
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,250
They want to be IITians.

340
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,208
Meenal is also frustrated, sir.

341
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,292
What happened to her?
- Hee-haw. Hee-haw.

342
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:49,401
(muffled) Not again.

343
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,042
Call Meenal.

344
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,792
You idiot! Give it to me!

345
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,424
I've told you so many times you should know
topper's phone numbers by heart.

346
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,458
Hello. Oh sweet child Meenal.

347
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:19,854
(sobs)

348
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,708
Is there any... problem with the new sir?

349
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:28,370
(sobs)

350
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,833
Tell me, child.

351
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,667
Yes, sir. A little bit.

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,667
Then why did you wait?
You are this year's topper.

353
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,237
Topper?

354
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,149
- Girls topper.

355
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,250
If anything happens,
you should message me immediately.

356
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,417
That's why you have my personal number.

357
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:54,208
Yes, sir. I changed my phone so,
your number got misplaced.

358
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,208
Take it down.

359
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:02,008
9-8-6-2...

360
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,191
I'll give it to you later.

361
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:04,917
Okay.

362
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,292
Put Awasthi in the foundation course.

363
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,250
Tell me. Which sir would you like?

364
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,125
The teacher from A6.

365
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,333
Yes. The teacher from A6.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,792
The teacher from A6.

367
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:28,042
Par...min...der.

368
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:31,750
Okay
- Yes.

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay.

370
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,208
Look. She is this dude's girlfriend..

371
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,542
..but who all are chasing her?
All the boys in Kota?

372
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,417
The boys from where? - Boys in Kota!

373
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,833
But dude's girlfriend
refuses everyone except 'the dude'.

374
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,125
So what does that make the dude?
- Exception.

375
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,000
And what does that make the girlfriend?

376
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,833
Innocent. She fell for that jerk!

377
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,417
We must understand the gist of the matter.

378
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,542
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is?
- Exception!

379
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,083
Very good! This is fun.

380
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:08,000
So the dude sees me outside the class
and says Inorganic chemistry is dangerous.

381
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,458
It is very complicated.

382
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:10,833
I will quit.

383
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,625
I said, brother,
your girlfriend is also complicated.

384
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,148
Do you leave her?

385
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:19,717
No. What do you do with her?
You pay her attention.

386
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,917
You focus on her. You talk to her nicely.

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,375
Shona. Mona. Babu. Jadu. Tona.

388
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,125
What else do you call?

389
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,250
Look at that. On hearing it even
the Bajrang dal at the back is attentive.

390
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,833
Hello. Sit straight.

391
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,167
Yes.

392
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,375
You find it very amusing, bro.

393
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,708
Stand up.

394
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,625
You have a girlfriend?

395
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,583
You don't. That's not surprising.

396
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,750
Sit down.

397
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,042
Just as our brother here is alone,
similarly boron is alone.

398
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,875
Boron is short of electrons
but nobody is giving it.

399
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,917
So, what will we do?

400
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,542
Will it remain alone?

401
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,875
Is our brother sitting alone? No.

402
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,292
Brother found a monkey just like him.

403
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,792
What did he find? - Monkey!

404
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,167
Friend. Only I will say monkey.

405
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,042
So the boron finds boron like itself..

406
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,458
..and forms a bond with it.

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,208
Not James Bond. Bond.

408
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,042
When two friends make
a bond what is it called?

409
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,500
It will become a banana, sir.

410
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:23,833
Very good answer!

411
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:28,083
It will form a banana bond.

412
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,917
The educated people call it
three-center to two electron bond.

413
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,083
What is it called?
- Three-center to two electron bond!

414
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:41,917
No need to remember that.
It will not help you clear IIT.

415
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,667
What do we want to clear?
- IIT!

416
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,042
Very good!

417
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,542
So you two. Have you formed a bond?

418
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,167
Have you formed a bond?

419
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,000
Come on. Write in your book.

420
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,875
When two atoms combine
to form a bond of similar type..

421
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:05,042
..due to lack of electrons, the
bond is known as banana bond.

422
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:09,667
Children, if there is any question
on banana bond, we will do it?

423
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,417
Yes, sir!

424
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,792
That means banana bond?
- Is not a problem.

425
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,667
The bell has rung.

426
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,667
Everyone will complete their
sheets and bring them in tomorrow.

427
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,083
Those who don't complete
it will get a punch from me. Okay?

428
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,958
Bye. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Let's have a song.

429
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,958
A song, sir.

430
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,958
Yes, sir. A song, sir.

431
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:30,667
Please, sir. Please, sir.
Please, sir. Please, sir.

432
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,958
Silence!

433
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,750
Are you here to listen to songs?
I sing songs?

434
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,083
Is this 'Indian Idol'?

435
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,000
Is this why your parents pay your fees?

436
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,833
Sing a song, sir. Sing a song.

437
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,573
(breaks into a punjabi song)

438
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,526
(humming punjabi song)

439
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,083
He explains so well. He made it so easy.

440
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,708
Apart from being the best
teacher he is the best singer also.

441
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,375
The boys from A6 said so.

442
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,375
But they never said he makes
you laugh so much too. - That's right.

443
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,250
I swear if he wasn't a teacher
he would surely do stand up comedy.

444
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,375
Praise the lord. Its like we got
the 'Jeetu Bhaiya' of Inorganic chemistry. - Yes.

445
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,958
 I remember the whole lecture vividly.

446
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,208
I won't have to refer
to my notes to do the DPP.

447
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,333
It's nice. He teaches us while singing.
That's how the class should be.

448
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,125
Today my brain has opened to chemistry.

449
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,125
It's already open.
- It has opened today.

450
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,875
The door is already open.

451
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,125
Clean all the cobwebs from here.

452
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,042
Move the suitcases and
throw away all the garbage.

453
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,667
Welcome, prince.

454
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,208
It seems to me I'll have
to cut money from your security now.

455
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,667
What happened now, aunty? - What is this?

456
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:33,750
The floor.

457
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,708
What is on the floor?
- You.

458
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,708
You are being a wise ass.

459
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,458
What kind of stains are those?
Crispy. Crispy.

460
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,458
Even lizol can't remove these.

461
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,792
I am warning you. I am warning you
I don't want even a scratch on my Kota marble.

462
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,167
This is not Kota marble. It is Kota stone.

463
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,250
What did you say to my face?

464
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,375
Aunty, hereafter we shall take more
care of your marble than our books.

465
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:53,375
Oh, no.

466
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,375
Hereafter we will have
daily cleaning here..

467
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,375
..and you will have to
pay 500 rupees per month for it.

468
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,083
Let's go.

469
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,375
Hey! - Get out of my way.
You don't even shower.

470
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,030
'Aunty, give me hot water.'

471
00:25:03,758 --> 00:25:05,945
 Filthy rascals.

472
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,000
I wish I had a feedback
form for this Tarka as well.

473
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,125
Never mind Supankha. You are a hero.

474
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,292
If it hadn't been for you neither
would the inorganic teacher change..

475
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,917
..nor would my luck.

476
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:19,000
Brother, I will give
you my first two chocolates as offerings.

477
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,042
Its alright, junior.

478
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,167
Come on, children.
Remove your sheets. We shall begin now.

479
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,208
I will tell you the answers.
Check your answers.

480
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:31,000
The first. Very easy question.
It's a shame to even discuss it.

481
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:35,000
The answer is A.
Mark it and move on. Tally it.

482
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,708
Tell me the second. B. ZnS.

483
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,208
Which of you have done the third?
It is a very easy question.

484
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:46,042
We shall solve it orally.
Its a shame if you use your pens.

485
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,208
The answer is B.

486
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,250
What is this?
Such easy questions. Time waste.

487
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
Even more basic question.
C is the answer.

488
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,475
If you got this wrong,
 get yourself checked.

489
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,099
Question number 4.

490
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,691
The answer is B. Very basic.

491
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,750
The answer is C.
I did it in the last class.

492
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,667
You should have no problem.

493
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,625
Sixth question.
Let's go to the eighth question. - Sir!

494
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,208
Sir. How can the answer
to question 7 be A? - Son, that..

495
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,750
It should be C, shouldn't it?
- Let's complete this and then I will..

496
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,417
No, no, sir. Tell me this first.

497
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,250
Sir, aluminum is from the boron family.

498
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,625
It doesn't have electrons either.

499
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,042
So, it will form a bond
with another one like itself.

500
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,417
So it will make a banana bond.

501
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,083
What is this coordinate covenant bond?

502
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,667
That is the exception, son.
I taught you that in class.

503
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,042
But, sir, the banana bond
is an exception in itself.

504
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,417
Son, this is an exception
to the exception.

505
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,750
Class, what did I say was
the first rule of chemistry?

506
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,500
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is?
- Exception!

507
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,500
Let's move on.

508
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,042
The eighth question. D.

509
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,542
Don't take stress.
We will solve the chocolate problem.

510
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,542
Hey, bro! What's up? - Scram!

511
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,542
Scram! Scram! - Go.

512
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,542
Is he crazy?

513
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,167
Meena, get out of this illusion.

514
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,542
We are not going to get chocolate.

515
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:20,000
Do you understand?
We won't be able to do anything.

516
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,000
We won't be able to do anything no
matter how many teachers are changed.

517
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,958
I made enquiries.

518
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:28,167
The A6 batch students have also taken a
corresponddence course of our institute.

519
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:31,250
The scoundrels have the solutions
before the DPP is discussed.

520
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:34,083
They get chocolate but they
don't score marks in the test.

521
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,542
That's why they are still in A6.

522
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:40,542
Why don't we take private classes
outside the institute for inorganic.

523
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,500
Really? - Yes.

524
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,417
And what will we gain from it?

525
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,958
What will we gain from it?
What will we gain?

526
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,958
They will teach us well, won't they?
Even these people are teaching us well.

527
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,208
Meena, the problem
is not with the teachers.

528
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,083
The problem is with this nasty subject!

529
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,333
It is an utterly boring subject!

530
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,542
There are only facts that have no logic.

531
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,000
There are more exceptions than the
number of rules in the name of logic.

532
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,083
In the first octet rule they
say there should be only 8 electrons..

533
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,333
..but then any number of electrons
are making compounds.

534
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,458
Four. Six. Seven. Eight. Ten.

535
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,000
And Twelve. - Yes.

536
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,167
One atom has so many models.

537
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,958
First they teach you Dalton's model.

538
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,083
The moment you understand it they say,
"Oh, this is incorrect."

539
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,458
Alright. Let's say
they made a mistake once.

540
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,125
Then they teach you Thompson plum
pudding model. Even that is wrong.

541
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:24,375
Then they teach you Rutherford
model. Even that is incorrect.

542
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,208
Then why are you teaching us?

543
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,417
Make it first. Sit down and make it.

544
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,292
No, no, no. We will teach you.

545
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,958
We will teach you. Bohr's model.

546
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,000
Heisenberg model.

547
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,208
None of them are entirely correct.

548
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,917
These people are making fools
of us by calling it exception.

549
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:44,375
This is not an exception.
It is an excuse. Pure excuse.

550
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,542
They don't have a theory
that gives you all the answers.

551
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,542
And how could they have a theory?
Tell me. How could they have it?

552
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,542
Geniuses like Einstein
and Newton gave theories.

553
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,875
They never read this moronic subject.

554
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,125
There's no logic.

555
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,042
All they have is exception,
exception and exception.

556
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:04,125
'Inception' did not confuse
me as much as exception has.

557
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,542
Every atom acts and
reacts as it pleases here.

558
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,583
The oxidation state
of all of them changes.

559
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,792
Plus two. Minus seven.
Plus three. Minus half.

560
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,167
Even the oxidation state
of oxygen is not fixed.

561
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,792
When your own elements don't give a damn..

562
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,667
..then why make a happy
periodic family? Why?

563
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,792
Learn from math. Learn.

564
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,458
Zero to nine is fixed
once and for all. Final.

565
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,167
But here,
their elements aren't fixed till date.

566
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,708
Something new crops up every year.

567
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:34,125
Boom! Number 113 is the number
picked in this year's lucky draw.

568
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,542
We shall call it! Nikenugium.
No, no, no. Nikeniugium!

569
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,750
Damn it! It is easier
to recite a Sanskrit mantra.

570
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,167
Newton gave us three laws. Three.

571
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,625
Half our physics is covered with it..

572
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,500
..but here,
there is a new rule for every question.

573
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,083
Admit it. Admit that you are
not logical like physics and math.

574
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,792
Okay. Eat some.. - No!

575
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,500
Tell me something. It is simple.

576
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,250
What will happen if you
toss an apple in the air?

577
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,458
It will fall.
- It will fall? It will fall?

578
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,792
But it will fall in physics.
It won't fall in chemistry.

579
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:06,250
What will happen in chemistry?
There will be steric hindrance.

580
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,083
If that's not enough then resonance,
inductive effect.

581
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,792
Everything will happen.
Anything can happen here.

582
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,208
They don't even name the colors simply.

583
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,458
It's not green. It's apple green.
It's not red. It's crimson red.

584
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,917
It's not pink. It's hot pink!

585
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,750
That's why only girls are so good at chemistry.

586
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,292
They make you do nonsense.

587
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:24,250
Flame test. Salt analysis.
Titration. Brown ring test.

588
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,458
Rotten eggs smell.
Why should I smell a rotten egg?

589
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,458
Why? I am a Brahmin!

590
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,833
Atomic size trend.
Ionization potential trend.

591
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,833
Electron-affinity trend. Electron
-negativity trend. Horizontal trend.

592
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,833
Vertical trend.

593
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:40,000
You can call something a trend
when you can predict something with it.

594
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,833
If anything is happening anywhere
and anytime like 'Thugs of Hindustan'..

595
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,208
..then how can they call it a trend?

596
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,458
How can they call it that?

597
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:46,750
I am telling you, Meena.

598
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,750
Chemistry is not a subject.
It is subjective.

599
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:50,750
I did so much for this subject.

600
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,625
Assignments, notes, flash cards.
I sat in the front row.

601
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,167
Changed three teachers.
Changed the studying strategy.

602
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,417
But what is the end result? Zilch!

603
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,542
He wouldn't stop, Jeetu Bhaiya.

604
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,208
That's why I brought him to you.

605
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,208
You have understood it correctly.

606
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,958
The problem is not with the teacher,
it's with the subject.

607
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
There must be some reason you
find physicists only in universities..

608
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,167
..while you find chemists at every corner.

609
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,833
You understand that you
cannot memorize so much, right?

610
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,042
Fine. - But how does that
solve the problem, Bhaiya?

611
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,292
It isn't? - No.

612
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,125
I thought it was simple.

613
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,167
Okay, let's say you have to go on a date.

614
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,250
You have a girlfriend? - No.

615
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,125
Let's assume you have
a hot girl like Katrina.

616
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:35,042
Ma'am is punctual.
She calls you at 8 o'clock sharp.

617
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,958
If you're going on a date you
will take a gift for her, won't you?

618
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,917
Champagne, bouquet..
- Teddy bear. Pink.

619
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,083
Your ideas are very different.

620
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,667
Anyway, let's assume
you take a teddy bear.

621
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,042
You bump into a thief on the way.

622
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,042
He snatches the teddy bear and runs.

623
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,250
What will you do? - How can he run away?

624
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,792
I will catch hold of him and punch him.

625
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,500
Of course.
Ideally that's what you should do.

626
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,208
But the thief is fast.

627
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,042
And you have two gifts
in your hands. Then?

628
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,042
Then we scream aloud.
Someone will surely help.

629
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,250
That could be one approach.

630
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:05,208
Maybe it will work. What will you do?

631
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,292
I will forget about the gift..

632
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:11,167
..and rush with the remaining two gifts.

633
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,708
So, rush!

634
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:16,208
I told you it is simple.
IIT is the hot gal.

635
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,750
Sure. The bouquet and champagne
are math and physics..

636
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,083
..while the teddy is inorganic chemistry..

637
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,583
..which we are unable to get hold of.

638
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:24,917
But, Bhaiya,
the real life girlfriend wants the teddy.

639
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,250
I won't get admission
into IIT without inorganic.

640
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,208
Who says so?

641
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,083
Who is the IITian in this room?

642
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:37,042
Do you think I memorized
chemistry like a jackass?

643
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,292
Before you study for an exam,
study the exam.

644
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:45,667
What do you think? How much do you need to score
 during those six hours to get into top five IITs?

645
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,667
90 percent for top five..
- No, no. Are you insane? 95 percent.

646
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,583
95 percent.

647
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,375
How will you face this savage world?

648
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:54,834
It will eat you alive!
40 percent.

649
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,708
Only 40 percent for top five?

650
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,917
Only 40 percent for top five IIT?

651
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:00,917
You are kidding, aren't you, Bhaiyar?

652
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,542
There are many things apart
from memes on the internet.

653
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:07,667
Go and watch videos of Unacademy.
Strategy for IIT JEE.

654
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,917
JEE toppers and scientists take time
out to make some videos for you.

655
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,458
At least do that much. Is your
Jeetu Bhaiya going to solve everything?

656
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,390
Even if omit 60 percent of the syllabus..

657
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,750
..you still stand
a chance to get into IIT.

658
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:20,000
The syllabus for inorganic
chemistry might be vast.

659
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,167
So, let it be.

660
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,167
How much weightage
does it carry in our exam?

661
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,042
How much weightage would chemistry
carry in our exam? Tell me.

662
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,292
Chemistry would be one-third.
- 33 percent.

663
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,083
One third of that would be.. - 11 percent.

664
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,792
Think about it.

665
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:31,875
Do you want to chase 11 percent..

666
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,583
..and ruin the crease on your trousers..

667
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,708
..or focus on 89 percent?

668
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,875
Score 40 percent and then
enjoy in a good IIT for four years.

669
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,833
Bhaiya, I shall burn up
all the sheets of Inorganic today.

670
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,250
End of story!
- That's wrong.

671
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,958
Yes. It is knowledge. It is a sin.

672
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,375
Sell it as waste paper.

673
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,958
You will get some money.
Eat some snacks with it.

674
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,958
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, one can improve
one's rank with inorganic, right?

675
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,480
Inorganic improves the rank of those
who are actually getting a rank.

676
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,958
But in your case,
it will leave you rankless.

677
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,333
So, the best way to
tackle problems like these..

678
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,708
..is not to get involved.
Just take the fast lane.

679
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,250
Do you understand?
Come on, you guys. Leave. Leave.

680
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,292
Go.

681
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,083
Why do you look so confused, Meena?

682
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,042
But,
Jeetu Bhaiya, the other day you said..

683
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,250
..if you have a problem
in life you confront it.

684
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:17,292
Make your problem a dare.
Make your dare a habit and forge ahead.

685
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:21,500
Today you are saying to let
Inorganic go if we don't know it.

686
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:28,542
Son, Inorganic chemistry is an exception.

687
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,542
Come on. Leave.

688
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,042
Thank you, Bhaiya.

689
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:43,167
Objective in the exams should
not be to solve all the problems..

690
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,042
..but to solve the maximum
number of questions.

691
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:01,875
If the problem is very confusing and
time consuming, they you can skip it.

692
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,750
If you have any time
remaining then get back to it.

693
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,625
Bear in mind, not every
problem is meant to be solved.

694
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,375
Vaibhav Pandey!
- Aunty?

695
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,800
I've told you so many times
not to put so many clothes..

696
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,208
..in the second hand washing machine.

697
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,208
Do you think about electricity
and water?

698
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,042
Aunty.

699
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,250
How are you?

700
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:21,480
Take this. This is your extra charge.

701
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,208
And I shall give it to you every month.

702
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,208
Just don't disturb
me for the entire month.

703
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,208
Thank you.
