1
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,999
Hello, mummy.

2
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,589
How are you, son?

3
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:30,244
I am good.

4
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,091
How are studies going?

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,144
It's going well.

6
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:35,520
Classes have begun.

7
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,120
His routine will be disturbed.

8
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,414
Let him sleep.

9
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,304
You let the day pass
and then call specifically at night.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,909
Tell me.

11
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:49,037
Are you in good spirit?

12
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,137
Yes, mummy.

13
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:54,019
How do you manage to
keep repeating the same question?

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,706
Okay.

15
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,598
I'll hang up then.

16
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:00,196
Okay.

17
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:01,675
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

18
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:21,209
Are you revising 'coordinate' inside?

19
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,833
Just two more minutes, bro.

20
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,086
Did it fall?

21
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,494
Did it fall?

22
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:49,302
Did I tell you or not?

23
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,840
Jeetu Bhaiya and Physics
can never be wrong.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,293
Bhaiya. Bhaiya.
Once more.

25
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,873
How many times did you pay the fees?

26
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:57,249
What if I say 'once more'?

27
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:04,612
Look at that.
He is feeling sleepy in class.

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,796
Am I that boring?

29
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,479
I stole someone's wheel at 4:30 AM.

30
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,061
He may show up anytime.

31
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:13,726
And this chap is all sleepy.

32
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:15,452
Sorry, sir.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,940
- I could not sleep all night, so..
- What did you just say? Come again?

34
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:22,107
- I could not sleep all night..
- No. No. Before that?

35
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,438
Sorry, sir.

36
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,268
Sir!

37
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,420
Did everyone hear that?

38
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:31,780
Sir.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,545
Jeetu Bhaiya is no longer a 'Bhaiya' (brother).

40
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:35,904
What am I now?

41
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,732
Sir!

42
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:41,015
Batla sir and Rao
sir aren't the only sirs.

43
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,981
Even Jeetu Bhaiya is now a..

44
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,501
Sir!

45
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,489
You surely deserve a prize.

46
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,781
- Come over.
- Go. Go

47
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,814
- Come.
- Well done!

48
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,882
The credit for my success
goes to my mother Mrs.

49
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,154
Sumitra..

50
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,023
Scoot! Go and wash your face.
Go!

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,732
He wants to take my hard earned money.

52
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:06,226
- You are so dramatic, Bhaiya.
- Why shouldn't I be?

53
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,492
I wasn't the Governor of Dramatics
society IIT Kharagpur for nothing.

54
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,072
Let's resume.

55
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,884
- A beautiful damsel.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:18,502
Yes! Now you're all awake..
at the mention of 'damsel'.

57
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,227
- Are the patties fresh, brother?
- Certainly.

58
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,850
Give me one.

59
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:28,921
You are foregoing food for patties?

60
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,345
It is not food.
It is bullcrap!

61
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,450
Just a week away from home and
you've turned foul-mouthed.

62
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:36,813
Bullcrap is not a cuss word.

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,457
It's a body product.

64
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,685
Fertilizer.

65
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,606
Agarwal sir used to utter it even in classroom.

66
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:42,907
Give me pickle.

67
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:43,820
Carry on.

68
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,992
Uday, rather than learning
hard work, discipline..

69
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:49,511
..and punctuality, you choose to
learn cuss words from Agarwal sir.

70
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,459
And you... Munching patties all the time.

71
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,439
You'll grow weaker
if you skip meals.

72
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,161
If you grow weak you fall ill.

73
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,357
And the children who
fall ill within the first week..

74
00:04:57,437 --> 00:04:59,167
..are taken back home by their parents.

75
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,581
And they never make it to IIT.

76
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,117
Meena, I will fall ill
even if I eat this food.

77
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,259
This is so oily.

78
00:05:07,614 --> 00:05:09,657
- Is oil free or what?
- Speak softly.

79
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,072
If Chandru hears then we'll get
mixed vegetables of all the gourds for dinner.

80
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,174
Including bitter gourd.

81
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,322
Still drinking Bisleri?

82
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,618
Meena. Not Bisleri.
Aquafina.

83
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,396
It's all the Bisleri's are the same.

84
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:26,618
Why are you squandering money?
Drink this.

85
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,705
The mess does not make the water.

86
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,709
My thirst doesn't get
quenched by this water.

87
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:32,796
It is salty.

88
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,093
- The Chambal water.. Is hard.
- Is hard.

89
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,350
I know.

90
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,646
I've been hearing
this for the past week.

91
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,293
Look, if you don't eat well
you won't be able to concentrate.

92
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:47,343
Then you won't be able to study long.

93
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,095
As it is you are facing so many complexities
why invite a new one.

94
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,658
Look, if you drink more of
this you will spend more money..

95
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,512
..if you drink less
you will be constipated.

96
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,252
I already am.

97
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,841
You couldn't empty your bowels even today?

98
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,491
What kind of conversation
is this for the dining table?

99
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,652
Wonderful! When you called
this delicious food a body product..

100
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,268
..was the conversation good then!?

101
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,053
You couldn't empty your bowels?

102
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,942
Are you going empty it for him?

103
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:24,918
Uday!

104
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:25,875
Let's go for some tea.

105
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,037
Come.
Oh, Shivangi!

106
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,871
You bite so hard.

107
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,630
Raunchy!

108
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:35,956
Meena.

109
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:37,998
Let's go for a tea.

110
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,325
It isn't 5:30 as yet.

111
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:46,322
Have you finished the sheet?

112
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:48,634
Yes, I've completed up to 35.

113
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:50,636
You completed 35?

114
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,922
You did it very fast.
I am still on the 30th.

115
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,093
Why don't you complete it?
It will be done by 5:30.

116
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,091
How do you guys manage to sit for so long?

117
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,517
I get tired in a little while.

118
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,224
Don't say that.

119
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,801
Even yesterday you didn't finish the homework.

120
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:26,383
If you leave it today as well,
it's bound to pile up.

121
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:30,111
I am not up to it.

122
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,061
Then try to read the theory.
Utilize your time.

123
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:36,877
I don't feel like it now.

124
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,029
This is what I've been trying
to explain to you for so long.

125
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,416
You know what.

126
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,153
Read Flamingo for now.

127
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,874
It's a light read and
will prepare you for boards too.

128
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:50,043
Take it.

129
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,005
It contains stories.

130
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:02,103
A monkey is pulling down
an object through a pulley.

131
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,860
Another monkey is pulling
the first monkey's tail.

132
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:10,761
Since it is pulling his tail
it is bound to create tension.

133
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:23,966
Vaibhav!

134
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,352
Vaibhav!

135
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,843
Your symptoms do not
appear right to me at all.

136
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:31,686
You need the guidance of someone wise.

137
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,798
- Who?
- A counselor.

138
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:43,005
Psychiatrist?

139
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:46,977
Counselor? Like hell!

140
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:49,661
Is this a mental problem?
Am I depressed?

141
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,454
Do I have anxiety?
Am I suicidal?

142
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,673
Have I lost my mind that I need a counselor?

143
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,653
And anyways,
half the counselors here are frauds.

144
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:01,583
I don't need anybody.

145
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,053
You need Alprozolam,
which is good for your sleep..

146
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:09,526
..and can restore the balance
of serotonin and dopamine in your body.

147
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,567
And Lactulose for your
constipation problems.

148
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:14,659
Pay the fees outside.

149
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,568
You do know that you
are not a Doctor, right?

150
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,834
Just because I wore
a coat instead of an apron..

151
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,688
..and my handwriting is not good,
does it mean I am not a Doctor?

152
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:24,933
Because you don't have a license.

153
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:26,660
Why have you worn this lab coat?

154
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,549
Don't dress for the job you have.

155
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,010
Dress for the job you want.

156
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:33,463
Vaibhav.

157
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,224
I know what you need.

158
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,006
Radha Krishna temple.

159
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,133
All your prayers are answered over here.

160
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:48,968
Take this.

161
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:50,977
Write it nicely with a clean heart.

162
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:54,381
It is mathematically impossible, Meena.

163
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:59,621
There aren't as many seats
in IIT as the number of prayers here.

164
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:01,625
What is this, Meena?

165
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,258
Why did you have to bring us here?

166
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,389
Help me.

167
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:07,093
Are you crazy?

168
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:13,526
It was needed.

169
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,257
But not from anybody.
A loved one.

170
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,129
Someone who would empathize.
Someone who has faced this himself.

171
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,848
So, he told me about you.
That's why I brought him here.

172
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,469
Did the right thing, didn't I?

173
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,774
Absolutely.

174
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:29,947
You certainly are wise.

175
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,657
Ofcouse, he is in Maheshwari.

176
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:33,884
Piyush.

177
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,470
You tell me how you managed, bro.

178
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,468
My food, drink, potty and sleep,
everything is out of order.

179
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,035
How did you get my address?

180
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,214
From your parents..

181
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,051
..because you weren't
answering my phone.

182
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:50,899
Smart, right?

183
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:51,939
Again, my idea.

184
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:54,162
Very nice.

185
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:57,191
I won't take up much of your time.

186
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:59,499
I understand the
pressure from Maheshwari.

187
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,241
Just share with me any coping mechanism.

188
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,300
I am not able to handle it.

189
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:07,679
A friend in need is
a friend indeed, right?

190
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,366
Isn't that right, brother?

191
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,172
You did the right thing coming here?

192
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:18,075
Ain't that true?

193
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,412
Thank you.

194
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:20,989
You did the right thing..

195
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,518
..because even I am unable to handle it.

196
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,775
It seems even Piyush is constipated.

197
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:31,997
This is something else, Meena.

198
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:33,153
What's the matter, bro?

199
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,579
I am not in Maheshwari.

200
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,074
I've been taking individual
lessons for the past six months.

201
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,039
My suspicion turned out right, Meena.

202
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,219
Didn't I tell you,

203
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:45,527
what is a 'Maheshwari' boy doing in Talwandi
 instead of Vigyan Nagar.

204
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:46,290
I don't understand.

205
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,282
What are you saying?

206
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:50,901
Dad got me admitted using influence..

207
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:53,788
..but when the batch was
shuffled after the first test..

208
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,520
..I ended up in the last batch.

209
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,634
The next time I was the
last student in that batch as well.

210
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,357
Then I had to leave Maheshwari
and opt for individual coaching.

211
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,298
I see.

212
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,633
That's why you wouldn't
return my calls, you rascal.

213
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,213
- So sorry, brother.
- Get lost!

214
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,878
How could I tell you?

215
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:15,727
Dad has bragged all over Itarsi..

216
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:17,139
..that I am in Maheshwari.

217
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,887
Ya.

218
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,304
He does brag alot.

219
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:23,163
He told all of Itarsi that
I didn't get admitted to Maheshwari.

220
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:26,635
All of Itarsi feels I will
surely get admitted to IIT.

221
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,522
Yes.
All of us feel that way.

222
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:29,067
Yes.

223
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,688
I was baffled as to
how he soared so suddenly.

224
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,473
I hope your family knows.

225
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:37,625
- No, buddy.
- No?

226
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:40,150
Last time when I went
home for Diwali..

227
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:43,266
 ..I had planned on disclosing
everything and end the matter but..

228
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:45,018
 But?

229
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:50,809
For the first time
in my life Neha called.

230
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,773
Neha Purohit?

231
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,450
Yes.
You know her younger sister.

232
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,011
- Shilpa?
- Yes.

233
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:58,026
She was thinking of
IIT herself and needed tips from me.

234
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,111
So both of them came to my place.

235
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:00,146
Both Neha and Shilpa?

236
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:01,984
- Yes.
- Their mom came too.

237
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,534
- Aunt Disha?
- Yes.

238
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,625
For the first time in my
life I got so much recognition..

239
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:07,934
..how could I have let it go?

240
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:11,975
Also, do you know,
during the conversation..

241
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,959
..aunt confirmed my
time and date of birth.

242
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,811
Even I am preparing for IIT.

243
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,791
I was a better student
than you in school.

244
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,969
She never asked me for tips.

245
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,494
You are studying in Prodigy.

246
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:30,446
Never mind all of that.
Tell me what I should do.

247
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:33,382
You..

248
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,001
..better see a counselor.

249
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:09,782
Yes, mummy.

250
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,120
What were you doing?

251
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,210
Nothing.
Was studying when..

252
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,508
..an idle lady disturbed me.

253
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,576
How could she do that?

254
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:23,050
Make it clear to your landlady
when you are studying she..

255
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,441
I got it.

256
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,564
I'll hang up.
You continue studying.

257
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,457
Are you in a good spirit?

258
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,320
Yes, mummy.
I am.

259
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:41,496
Until I categorically tell you never assume otherwise.

260
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,581
Well, goodnight.

261
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,927
Goodnight.

262
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,197
What do you mean?

263
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,093
"I didn't attempt the problem
as I didn't understand it."

264
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,157
Always look for hints, so many are there.

265
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:12,508
 Where?

266
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,639
The first hint is that
the problem is given.

267
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,513
When the maker has
posed the problem to us..

268
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,399
..that means it's solvable with our knowledge.

269
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:23,316
Secondly the velocity is given.

270
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,302
See. Is it or isn't it?

271
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:26,744
So, it will be used in either
of the two things.

272
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:28,201
Energy or momentum.

273
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,505
Now you have to decide
which gamble to take.

274
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:33,865
If it still doesn't make
sense then keep looking for hints.

275
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,825
Is the word 'friction' visible?

276
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:39,330
Yes.

277
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,610
It means energy cannot be used.

278
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,819
What does that leave?
Conservation of momentum.

279
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:46,742
Initial equal to final.

280
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,150
Say yes or no.

281
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,283
Yes, sir.

282
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,241
Just equate initial to final.

283
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:53,233
Tick it and move on.

284
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,775
At some point in the future
whilst laughing, singing..

285
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,679
..or in toilet you will realize..

286
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,635
..why was the mometum conserved.

287
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,243
Okay?

288
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,604
Even if you don't understand the
question jostle with it.

289
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:03,516
What do you do?

290
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:04,591
Jostle with it.

291
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:05,796
Yes.

292
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:08,170
Once you have learned to jostle with
questions and twirl the pen...

293
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,556
..you are already half an IITian.

294
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,652
Come on.
Next.

295
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:19,833
Hello, bro.
Didn't you do the rest?

296
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,811
Sir, I only did up to number 52.

297
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,516
I see. You completed 52.
Very good!

298
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:29,734
It's me who hates the environment.

299
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:32,603
I made a 150 page long sheet
just to waste paper, right?

300
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:37,663
Sir, Not that I can't crack problems..

301
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,560
..but I am unable to sit for long.

302
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm not in the right spirit.

303
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,643
Is this the problem
or there's more to it?

304
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,260
Bhaiya, he doesn't even eat well.

305
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,244
He survives on Maggi and patties.

306
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:52,249
He still drinks Bisleri
water and doesn't even sleep.

307
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,059
Why, brother?

308
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,295
Yes, Bhaiya.

309
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,053
You came late.

310
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,291
So he missed the orientation.

311
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,994
He does not know the two important
concepts of living in Kota.

312
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:09,830
Tell him, Meenal.

313
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:10,760
What are they?

314
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,551
Firstly, Jeetu Bhaiya
is not our physics faculty.

315
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:15,844
He is our agony aunt.

316
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:17,849
He solves all kinds of problems.

317
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:22,509
Academic, non-academic,
personal, financial or romantic.

318
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,074
Even if your landlord has
kicked you out of the house..

319
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:29,343
..in the middle of the night or
if you've argued with the mess people..

320
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,016
..or if a Policeman has caught
you reading obscene literature.

321
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:34,527
Jeetu Bhaiya solves everything.

322
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:38,614
Just call him immediately and
Jeetu Bhaiya solves all the problems.

323
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,382
And..

324
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:44,194
..the second?

325
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,562
You forgot the second?

326
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:48,020
Yes.

327
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:50,840
Every child is special.

328
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:52,958
That is utter nonsense.

329
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:54,933
You are not some unique personality.

330
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,142
These problems occur to
thousands of students each year.

331
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,869
Before preparing for IIT at Kota
one must prepare themselves to live in Kota.

332
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:03,853
And there are simple ways to do it.

333
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:06,651
If you encounter problems..

334
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:07,500
Jostle with them.

335
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,395
Jostle with them.

336
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:10,463
Even if you don't like the water,
Just drink it.

337
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:12,664
Even if you don't like the mess food,
Just eat it.

338
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:15,241
Even if you are unable to sit for long
Just sit for long.

339
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,636
Challenge yourself.
I will sit for long.

340
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:17,562
I won't get up at all.

341
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,028
I will solve problems.
I will read theories.

342
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:21,675
I will watch Unacademy's lessons.

343
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,217
I will go through old papers.

344
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:25,696
I will sleep,
I will die but I won't get up.

345
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:27,128
So, what have you done?

346
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:29,064
You have turned your problems to dare.

347
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,233
And dare is directly connected to ego.

348
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,390
Ego has many disadvantages
but it has one advantage too.

349
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,003
Things seem to be doable.

350
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,554
And you don't have
to do this drama for long.

351
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:39,258
How many days?

352
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:40,374
21 days.

353
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,292
You can form any or give
up any habit in 21 days.

354
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,223
I had a smoking problem.

355
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:47,211
2 packs a day.

356
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:48,526
I lost it.

357
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,512
I left it one day and after
that I bragged about it at home..

358
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,465
..to my girlfriend,
faculty, driver and the driver's wife.

359
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:58,051
So much so,
I gave 2000 rupees to the vendor..

360
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,569
..not to give me cigarettes to smoke.

361
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,818
If you brag about it to the world
then the world won't let you smoke.

362
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:07,093
I felt a little urge in
the beginning and then some more.

363
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:09,295
By the time 21 days had
passed the urge was zero.

364
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:10,790
That's what you have to do.

365
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,127
Say something. Yes or no.

366
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:16,231
Yes, Bhaiya.

367
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,413
Uday is a nasty fella..

368
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,304
..but Meena, you knew this was
happening with your friend..

369
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,211
 ..and still didn't tell him?

370
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,202
 Bhaiya, I..

371
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:28,920
You too, Brutus.

372
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:30,925
You too.

373
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,534
Did you notice?

374
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:36,601
Bhaiya called me Brutus. 'Brutus Meena'

375
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,646
What? Don't you have any sense of humour?

376
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,597
I might look nasty
but not from the heart.

377
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,526
Sure, I'm a member of the Bihar Tigers.

378
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,645
I have the responsibility of
the entire city on these shoulders.

379
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,658
But Uday Gupta never ignores his sidekicks.

380
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,822
..because your brother is
the king of the streets.

381
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,581
I have taken the annual subscription
for Unacademy plus.

382
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,404
For you.

383
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:15,619
Go.
Attend as many live lectures as you wish.

384
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,845
And always remember. Your brother is Caesar, not Brutus.

385
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,058
This man rises up at 3 pm.

386
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:29,363
But don't you rise.
Go study.

387
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,372
What are you looking at?
Go study.

388
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,002
One cannot hate what one does not see.

389
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,354
Don't look at the mess food at all.

390
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,276
Pick up bread without a fuss.

391
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,779
Dip it in whatever and just chew.

392
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,240
Sometimes you
may be tempted to look down..

393
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:52,069
..but therein lies your defeat.

394
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:04,983
Tastes even better today.

395
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:15,469
Don't drink water at room temperature.

396
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,262
Drink chilled water of the fridge.

397
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,568
People even savour beer if chilled.

398
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,126
Salt water is nothing.

399
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:23,225
Bottoms up.

400
00:22:24,557 --> 00:22:27,590
Here x is given as
the distance of the block..

401
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:31,353
..and we have to find the
velocity as a function of x.

402
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:34,067
Just choose the correct option.

403
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:35,409
C.

404
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,081
When did you come?

405
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,162
I came to check on you.

406
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:39,767
Good! Good!

407
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:43,700
If you have chosen C option
then your answer is correct.

408
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,272
Now I shall tell you
the solution of this question.

409
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:47,912
Yes, I have eaten.

410
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:49,701
I am all well and
am in good spirits.

411
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:52,978
Mummy, how do you manage to
keep repeating the same question everyday?

412
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:56,482
Okay.

413
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,353
Apply more pressure, bro.

414
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:05,416
Vaibhav.

415
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,752
Is it working?

416
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,925
Lentil soup,
veggies and breads have to be prepared..

417
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,511
..so there is always a scope of mistake.

418
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,571
Given the scope,
the cooks in the mess ensure mistakes.

419
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,912
That's why one should prefer
eating what they don't make..

420
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,820
..such as salad,
pickle, papad, yogurt and sugar.

421
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,159
And there is your three course meal.

422
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,622
I have helped many people crap.

423
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:52,986
Yours is no different.

424
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,058
Two puffs.

425
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:56,284
Only two puffs.

426
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,640
You will experience streamline motion.

427
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,596
Not friction.

428
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:01,540
Nonsense.

429
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:05,741
Take it. This is 'the truth'.
-Scram! Bloody addict!

430
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:17,399
Children, today we shall solve
a problem on vertical circular motion.

431
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,516
Let me first explain the problem to you.

432
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:20,816
Vaibhav.

433
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,715
Aunty.

434
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,469
She was walking down
the stairs and fell.

435
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,801
She is frothing in the mouth.

436
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:25,668
Hello.
Ambulance.

437
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:27,171
Come to Lal Burj quickly.
It's an emergency.

438
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:28,837
What? Froth? Where?

439
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:31,757
You got up?

440
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,507
For that two-bit woman?

441
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:35,144
You just want an excuse.

442
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,433
Damn you!

443
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,533
You will bring disgrace
on us in Jeetu Bhaiya's presence.

444
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:42,511
Give me my 100 rupees from the bet.

445
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:44,590
Engineer.

446
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:46,382
Nature has done half the job.

447
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:47,330
Water contains salt.

448
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,715
Just add salt and lemon to it.

449
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:49,678
Lemonade is ready.

450
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:54,103
This small tip saves ten
million children's lives every year.

451
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:55,682
It's great!

452
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:56,575
Isn't it?

453
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,829
Go and prepare two glasses now.

454
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,152
Three.

455
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:04,861
Mummy, Uday's girlfriend does not
call him as many times as you call me.

456
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:07,615
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

457
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:09,014
Well done, bro! Well done!

458
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:10,790
You are under the oath of IIT.

459
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,828
One can't follow one days,
how will one follow test cricket?

460
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:17,041
The T-20 format has been
created for Kota students.

461
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:19,249
IPL is the future.

462
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:21,861
If only they would take Yuvraj to play.

463
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,406
It's very wrong of them.

464
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,913
You are correct, bro.
It's all politics.

465
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:29,706
Bro, Yuvi can and Yuvi will.

466
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,870
That's right, bro.
Yuvraj will return.

467
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:32,922
You can quote me on that.

468
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:34,781
You?

469
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:36,762
Yes.

470
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:38,865
He will return.

471
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:43,753
Children, today we shall solve
a problem on impulse momentum theorem

472
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,109
In it we shall learn
to calculate impulse.

473
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,520
Wow! There was no sound today.

474
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,274
You know this is really inappropriate.

475
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:57,461
I'm happy for you, buddy.

476
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,844
Children, we will solve
a problem on friction today.

477
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:04,761
As you can see in the
picture two blocks are made.

478
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:07,909
Both the blocks are kept on a wedge

479
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:10,089
 ..and both are connected
with the help of a string.

480
00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:15,922
[Educator speaking]

481
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:17,358
Shall we?

482
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:18,354
Yes.

483
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:19,532
It is 6:30 already.

484
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:23,544
For which the system..

485
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,762
Let's go.

486
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,902
That was done in class.

487
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:39,497
But I'm glad today you came
with DPP and sheets finished.

488
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:42,442
That means this chap
is able to sit up longer.

489
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,986
Yes, sir.

490
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,538
Is food and water sorted?

491
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:48,177
Yes, Bhaiya.

492
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,878
Are you able to crap properly?

493
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,571
Oh, Bhaiya!

494
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,746
Come along.
Why are you being shy with me?

495
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:57,092
I am your agony aunt.

496
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:00,899
And we have a long journey together.

497
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,905
Everyone has these problems.

498
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:04,447
I too have them.

499
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,033
Have you been doing Physical Chemistry?

500
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:14,801
Give me one.

501
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:16,603
A cigarette?

502
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,678
Yes.

503
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:18,876
Cigarette, Bhaiya?

504
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:22,123
When I don't feel the urge
and the situation is under control..

505
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:23,889
..then you can cheat sometimes.

506
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:32,856
Cheating occasionally is fine.

507
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:34,871
As long as it doesn't become a habit.

508
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:45,783
- What's the matter?
- Auto!

509
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:48,515
Lets rush to Vigyan Nagar.

510
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:50,263
- Let's go, sir.
- Bhaiya!

511
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,525
- Bhaiya!
- I'll see you later.

512
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,140
What happened?

513
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:58,277
Nature's call?

514
00:27:58,357 --> 00:27:59,384
Yes.

515
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,531
Meena.

516
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:05,943
Come.

517
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:08,529
It's only 5 O'clock.

518
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,259
Let's go! Come!

519
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,531
It's always the same..

520
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:12,399
Let's go!

521
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,453
I just needed to study
one more paragraph.

522
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:15,728
What will you gain from
studying one paragraph?

523
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,909
Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

524
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,802
Occasional cheating is fine.

525
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,537
As long as you don't form a habit.

526
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,846
'The person you are
calling is not answering.

527
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:05,108
Please try later.'

528
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:09,306
He's not picking my call.

529
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,579
Now he is in a happy place.
