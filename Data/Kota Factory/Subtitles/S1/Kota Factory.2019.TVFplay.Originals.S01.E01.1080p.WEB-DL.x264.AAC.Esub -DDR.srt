1
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,250
Kota.

2
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,250
In the area of education this city
has created an identity for itself..

3
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,875
..nationally as well as internationally.

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,000
And right from the start,
Maheshwari classes..

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,542
..has been carrying the banner
of success on this path to victory.

6
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,958
Within a span of 30 years

7
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:39,625
Maheshwari classes has
embarked upon a mission..

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,208
..that envisions the
whole world of education..

9
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,417
..with services from standard
eighth till university.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,750
In this pursuit Maheshwari classes
has to give credit to its team..

11
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,000
..teaching methodology
and student-centric approach.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,333
We are now catering to
the need of the students..

13
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,125
..throughout their academic cycle..

14
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,417
..till their step into
their professional life.

15
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,417
The complete educational hub.

16
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,917
The journey of thousand
miles begins with a single step.

17
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:11,000
The credit for having come this
far after starting with one classroom..

18
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,042
..goes only to our students.

19
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,360
Gyan Mittal.

20
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:17,946
All India Rank one JEE Advanced,
listen to his own words

21
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,625
All the credit for my success
goes to Maheshwari classes.

22
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,708
It is the best coaching for IIT JEE.

23
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,542
Year after year the
best results come from here.

24
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:31,708
Not only in JEE, but also in NEET,
Olympiad, KVPY, NTSE and other exams.

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,838
Maheshwari classes,
We will make a change together.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,215
Kota.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,754
In the area of education this
city has made a name for itself..

28
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:46,135
..nationally as well as internationally.

29
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:49,385
And right from the start,
Maheshwari classes..

30
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:53,010
..has been carrying the banner
of success on this path to victory.

31
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:57,260
Within a span of 30 years
Maheshwari classes has embarked..

32
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,344
It's not as though we were unaware, sir.

33
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:02,594
We even sought admissions
for coaching in April..

34
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:04,510
..but that was in Itarsi. Local.

35
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:07,219
Vaibhav was doing very
well even over there.

36
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,885
He was amongst the top three..

37
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:12,177
..but when the All India
test series took place in November..

38
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,469
..that's when our eyes opened.

39
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:17,344
Sir, Vaibhav's friend
Piyush is your student.

40
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:21,177
He lagged behind Vaibhav in school.
You can confirm from him.

41
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:23,427
Even he shot ahead of Vaibhav...

42
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,010
Sir, Vaibhav is a
very hardworking student.

43
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:31,802
He even studies a lot but
Itarsi lacks the facilities of Kota.

44
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,219
Only one small institute exists there.

45
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:38,677
Only 'Success' and 'Ace' are small.
Goel-classes has 400 students this year.

46
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,885
Yes, sir. My Vaibhav
was attending Goel classes.

47
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,260
He was attending Goel?
- Yes.

48
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:46,552
Then he must be pretty
weak in chemistry.

49
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:48,469
He won't be able to cover it alone.

50
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:53,385
No, sir. The boy is smart.
He scored 90 percent in high school.

51
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,469
Trust me sir, he will be able to follow.
- No. He won't.

52
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,219
Pan India more than 7 lakh students score
90 percent in 10th grade.

53
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,416
More than 2 lakhs in CBSE alone.

54
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,804
And how many seats do they have in IIT?

55
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,447
5273 only.

56
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:13,156
If only the students with over 90
percent appear for IIT..

57
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:16,030
..even then 99 percent of those

58
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,096
won't make it.

59
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,652
Sir, the Minister forwarded this letter.

60
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,187
He even called me.

61
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,788
That's why I am
refusing in person.

62
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:32,609
Look, I won't make tall promises
but it would be beneficial to Vaibhav..

63
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,404
..to join us when the
12th grade batches start in April.

64
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:38,138
With all the others.

65
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,036
Jai Shree Krishna

66
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,480
Could you talk to Piyush?

67
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,313
We should have taken
admissions back then only.

68
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:11,438
Both of you would have been together.

69
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:15,647
Anyways, if not here then maybe
somewhere else.

70
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:18,581
But nowadays this
is the number one.

71
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,844
You better focus on driving

72
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:21,605
Smartass.

73
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,355
Where in Talwandi? 'Prodigy?'

74
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,105
How long have you been in Kota, brother?

75
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:37,063
Son, I've been in Kota since
the time it used to be a city, not a factory.

76
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:40,938
Back then coaching classes
did not have any uniforms..

77
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:46,980
..and this environment was confined
to a small locality of 'Vigyan Nagar.

78
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:49,938
What an apt name! Ain't it, sir?

79
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:53,272
Yes, some Agarwal classes used to be there.

80
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:58,688
Some? There was a time
when Mr.Agarwal used to rule, sir.

81
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,772
There may be many dons today,
but he is the only true Godfather.

82
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,522
This Jurassic park was established by him.

83
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:11,772
His name may not be Corleone
but he is Godfather to all.

84
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,147
He is called the
Stephen Hawkins of Kota.

85
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,230
Not Hawkins. Hawking.

86
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,480
Huh?
- Hawking. King.

87
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:21,063
Yes, yes. He is the king.

88
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:24,063
His own children 
may not have made it to IIT..

89
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:27,147
..but he has got thousands
of others through.

90
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,789
Though he couldn't walk by himself but 
has helped lakhs run their household.

91
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:35,605
Sir, its because of him every
other house in the city has a PG..

92
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,355
..and a mess at every corner.

93
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,188
And it has to be.

94
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,355
As every year more than 2 lakh
students come here.

95
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:46,063
Toss a stone blindly..
..it's bound to hit a student.

96
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,772
Hey! But don't toss one.

97
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,105
This is not a city, sir.
But rather a very big hostel.

98
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:59,129
Here the battle is not whether
an institute could post the solutions or not

99
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:03,480
But instead, 
which institute did it first.

100
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,438
Everyone here is crazy, sir.

101
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:09,438
Everywhere there is discourse..

102
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,938
..about which institute
charged fees from the topper..

103
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,272
..which institute really educated him..

104
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,605
..and which one simply bought off his rank.

105
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:19,272
Which teacher was poached by whom?

106
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:22,730
Which faculty quit to
start on his own?

107
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,522
And who in turn 
is quitting his institute?

108
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:27,022
Study a little!

109
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,188
Focus on your driving, brother.

110
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,980
It is a kind of 'Big Boss' running here.

111
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,688
Do you watch Big boss?
- Yes, I do.

112
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:35,583
Nobody watches it here.

113
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:38,837
This is the only city in India..

114
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:43,250
..where Nokia dominates Samsung.

115
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:47,180
If I must add, sir..

116
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:51,563
..all the students who come here 
may not get selected..

117
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:55,147
..but a student 
who doesn't get selected from here..

118
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:57,397
..was never meant to be.

119
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:29,688
Get your work done.
I'll wait.

120
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:40,813
Yes. It's done, sir.

121
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,147
Sure?

122
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,647
We will get it done, sir.

123
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:48,230
Be confident. My brother-in-law
started this institute with just one room.

124
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:49,730
And look at it today.

125
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,897
that's all impressive 
but will he be able to manage on his own?

126
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:56,647
Why not? He scored 90 percent
in the boards. That is not a joke.

127
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,688
The boy is sharp .

128
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:04,980
But I heard IIT has only 5273 seats. So..

129
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,772
But sir, you only need one.

130
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,298
Vaibhav.

131
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:13,462
 Just because he is willing to enroll..

132
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,147
..doesn't necessarily mean that you
have to accept.

133
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,230
Better stay at home and prepare this year..

134
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,813
..and aim for 
Maheshwari in 12th grade.

135
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:26,980
Dad, even if I have to take admission
in Maheshwari for the 12th grade..

136
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,266
..let me study in here only.

137
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:31,712
I can't do it at home.

138
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,022
Enroll him and hand him the material.

139
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,022
Which batch?
- IIT JEE A10.

140
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,980
A10?

141
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,313
How many batches do you have in all?
- Only ten, sir.

142
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:51,730
We don't have too many batches.

143
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,647
Teach less but teach well!!

144
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,397
Dad, Piyush was telling me that 
lower batches don't get any attention.

145
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,730
Says who?

146
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:03,563
Do we give attention or not?
- We do, sir.

147
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,772
I myself was in A7.
- He was in A7.

148
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,063
Sir, charge the entire fees if you wish 
but please ensure a better batch.

149
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:15,688
Look, sir.
Entire fees for 2 years will be charged anyways.

150
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,772
..but he will still be in batch A10.

151
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,230
It's brother-in-law's policy.

152
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,510
But this batch won't be permanent.

153
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:23,313
Reshuffling tests will
take place after two months..

154
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,063
..and you will do well in it.

155
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,563
That's it. Batch changed.

156
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:41,230
This is your material.
Uniforms are not in stock.

157
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:42,605
You will get it by day after tomorrow.

158
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:45,605
And you have a choice of three schools.
You can enroll yourself in any.

159
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,355
Which of these is a good school?

160
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,188
How does it matter?
He doesn't have to attend.

161
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,772
We have a tie-up with all three.

162
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,688
Okay. I'll go and put this away.
- Yes.

163
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:47,821
Hello.

164
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:49,488
Yes, Piyush.

165
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,863
Yes. Finally you found
the time to call me.

166
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:57,321
This is Vaibhav.

167
00:12:58,238 --> 00:12:59,279
Yes.

168
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,404
This is my Kota number. Save it.

169
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,196
Yes. Today.

170
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,113
No, not in Maheshwari. Prodigy.

171
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,654
Why thank God?

172
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:13,613
Are you crazy?

173
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:16,238
It's a good thing they
teach so much at Maheshwari.

174
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:17,946
Yes.

175
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:22,084
The lady who kept me as PG is nice.
She is very nice.

176
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,251
She told me I'm
like her son Bunty.

177
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,633
Oh, never mind that. Let's meet.

178
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,867
Once studies begin I won't
be able to come to Vigyan Nagar.

179
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,439
Shall I come?

180
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,588
Oh, I see.

181
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,610
Tomorrow then?

182
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:48,422
Ok. Let me know if you don't have 
extra classes tomorrow. Will meet.

183
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,042
Hello?

184
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,834
Hello?

185
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,001
May I come in?

186
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,792
I am Meena. Prodigy. A5.

187
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,267
You've seen the storeroom downstairs?
- Yes.

188
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,584
That's my room.
- I see.

189
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:23,417
You left the RO turned
on downstairs. What..?

190
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,334
Yes.
There was no water,

191
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,834
so I guess I left it turned on. Sorry.

192
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,709
Remove the plug after you use it.
Else aunty gets very upset.

193
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:33,751
Oh!

194
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,834
Is aunty very strict?

195
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,959
She spoke to me very
sweetly this morning.

196
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,167
She is bound to speak nicely
in front of parents.

197
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,480
She should have the guts to speak nicely 
once they've left. Right?

198
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,334
I have a two way socket.
You can have it.

199
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:50,959
Socket. Why?

200
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,542
When your roommate comes
he will fight every night..

201
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,167
..for phone charging.
There is only one plug.

202
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,708
No, I will stay here by myself.

203
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:57,829
All alone?

204
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,297
Ya.

205
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,667
The rent will be quite a bit.

206
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,542
Why didn't you go to Maheshwari
if you have the resources?

207
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,626
It is not so easy to
get admission in Maheshwari.

208
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,834
Isn't it? I got admitted.

209
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,376
In Maheshwari?
- Yes.

210
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,026
Then why...

211
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,876
The fee here is far lower
and also they teach in Hindi.

212
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:21,417
Also,  Jeetu Bhaiya is here.

213
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:22,876
 Jeetu Bhaiya?

214
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,667
How come you don't know Jeetu Bhaiya?

215
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,709
By which route did you come?
His hoardings are all over the place.

216
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,834
He is the best teacher
of physics in Kota..

217
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,751
..and number three at Unacademy.

218
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:33,292
Unacademy?

219
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,792
It is India's biggest education ape.

220
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:37,209
Ape?

221
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:41,876
You don't know ape?
Then how will you make it through to IIT?

222
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,709
You know the tiny boxes in mobiles.
If you send something..

223
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:46,792
Oh! App.

224
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:50,126
Yes. Ape.  Jeetu Bhaiya has uploaded
the entire syllabus of JEE on it.

225
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,626
You can study anytime you wish.
Even teachers learn from it.

226
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:56,417
Frankly, just that Jeetu Bhaiya
isn't contesting the elections..

227
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,042
..else he would have been
the best candidate.

228
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,959
So you are Jeetu Bhaiya's fan?
- Absolutely.

229
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,001
That man is deserving of fans.

230
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,876
He solves papers on International
physics to the clock.

231
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,251
All the best physics teachers in India..

232
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,751
..send their problem books to him to review.

233
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,584
His salary is more
than 10 to the power of 7.

234
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:54,417
Yet he is cheerful,
affable and light-hearted.

235
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:01,751
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Water did not come out of the RO.

236
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,626
Then how did you drink?

237
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,834
This is Uday's room.

238
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,751
He is from Udaipur but
he told aunty he is from Patna.

239
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,417
Why?

240
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,084
That I don't know.

241
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,626
Didn't you ask?

242
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,584
Why would I ask! 
It's not a syllabus question.

243
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,876
'One said and the other agreed.
Nanak says both are wise.'

244
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:31,876
Feel free to keep fruits, veggies,
yogurt, water, anything in it.

245
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,042
He has made it a public fridge.

246
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:36,751
Isn't Uday over here?

247
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,459
He mostly stays at Laxmi PG,
with lady Shivangi.

248
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,594
Very nice lady.

249
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,566
She's Uday's friend but
has more affection for me.

250
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,209
Uday studies with her all day long.

251
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:49,084
He studies so much he
doesn't even attend classes.

252
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,417
I too want to study that much.

253
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,334
Meena.

254
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,167
You were inside?

255
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,334
Call your mother a lady. I am a girl.

256
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,292
Hi.
- Hi. I'm...

257
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:02,626
Vaibhav. From Itarsi.
Joined Prodigy.

258
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,042
You are like a son to aunty, right?

259
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,917
Voices from the corridor
are audible here.

260
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,542
Even the sounds from here
are audible downstairs.

261
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:16,667
I am Shivangi. Uday's girlfriend
but have told aunty that I am his cousin.

262
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,751
The fridge may be public, I'm not.

263
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,167
So do come, fetch water and leave.

264
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,167
There is no need for small talk..

265
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,792
..unless you have doubts
in physics and chemistry.

266
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,292
And that too only if Meena
is unable to clear it.

267
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:30,167
Doubt solving expert. The standard
rate is two puffs for 30 minutes..

268
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:32,084
..and three puffs for one hour.

269
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:38,292
Only physics and chemistry?
You must be weak in math.

270
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,917
I was strongest in math.
It's bio that I was weak in..

271
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,167
..but I am doing medical
because dad is an IITian.

272
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:49,126
Your dad is an IITian?
Even dads are IITians?

273
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,959
That's great!

274
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,626
And he wants you to get into medicine.

275
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:55,042
There should be variety in the family.

276
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:55,959
Correct.

277
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,167
IITian thinks correctly.
- Variety my foot!

278
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,126
Dad is an IITian,
that's why he knows the truth about IIT.

279
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,417
He can't send his only daughter
amidst the lusting engineers..

280
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,876
..who are brimming with testosterone.

281
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,709
He won't be able to endure the meiosis.

282
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:10,167
I wore your bermudas. I hope it is okay.
My clothes are in the wash.

283
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,542
It is okay. I shall wear yours someday.

284
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:18,009
Actually, they will suit you.

285
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:36,292
The mess starts at 7:30.
Go early to eat..

286
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,084
..else cheese will be gone 
leaving only spinach in the curry.

287
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,542
Let's go together.

288
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:43,084
No, no. I am fasting.
I have to sleep early.

289
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,292
I have classes at 6 AM.

290
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,084
I'll have Poha n Jalebi early morning.

291
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,584
Class?

292
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:48,667
So early?

293
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:50,167
But my time-table..

294
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:52,667
 Jeetu Bhaiya runs
faster than the time-table.

295
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,792
You will have it too.

296
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,584
Which batch were you alloted?
- A10.

297
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:00,292
And you accepted it? A10.

298
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:04,167
Yes. Deepak sir said
it won't be a problem.

299
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:06,917
Why?

300
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,209
Why? What's wrong with A10?

301
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,885
Wrong? Sir, leave aside JEE advance..

302
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,001
..they don't even prepare
one well for MAINS exams.

303
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,292
No extra classes.
No doubt session. No DPP.

304
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,251
Also time gets wasted.

305
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:20,542
Who provided you all these insights?

306
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:25,584
Look, you came very late as it is.
We admitted you.

307
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,792
Now you feel the batch is wrong.
Change the batch.

308
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,251
It's not what you think.
It's your first day. Be positive.

309
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,792
Just start studying.
The batch makes no difference.

310
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,376
Sir, if it makes no difference
then transfer me.

311
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:36,751
To any other batch.

312
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,792
And sir, if I am worthy of A10..

313
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,459
..then I shall end up there
after the reshuffling.

314
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,959
No. No. Not possible.

315
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:48,584
It's a rule. We don't give special
treatment to anyone in Prodigy classes.

316
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,626
Be it a student or faculty.

317
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,459
But, sir, A10..
- Jeetu sir.

318
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,709
How are you, sir?

319
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,917
How are you?
- Good. Good, sir. Please sit.

320
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,376
Brother-in-law was
missing you yesterday.

321
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:58,959
Jeetu never comes over.

322
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:00,084
He even called you.

323
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,501
Sister prepared baked chickpea fluffs.

324
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,001
That's precisely why I didn't come over.

325
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,209
Your sister is a very bad cook

326
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,167
Moreover it's awkward to tell her.

327
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,167
This is absolute truth, Deepak.

328
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:15,756
This indeed is true.

329
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,316
You go to your class, son.

330
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,751
This is the entrance test
paper for the physics faculty.

331
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,001
You asked for it.

332
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:25,292
That's wonderful, sir!
Wonderful! The paper is very good, sir.

333
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,084
Then clear my payment, sir.

334
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:30,376
Payment?
- I took so many extra classes last month.

335
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:31,959
I messaged you.

336
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,876
Hasn't it been cleared as yet?
Will get it cleared, sir.

337
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:38,726
Yes, it's up to you.
If I don't get paid by Friday..

338
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:39,917
..I'll just switch off the
phone and leave.

339
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:40,709
Sir..

340
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,126
There are 58 countries
that offer visa on arrival.

341
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,167
I could be in any of them
Then keep looking for me.

342
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:46,667
Take me along if you go, sir.

343
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,501
If you leave because of me,
brother-in-law will kill me anyways.

344
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:51,459
Brother-in-law won't let you leave.

345
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,167
He still wants to start
up Prodigy International school..

346
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,459
..Engineering college and Universities.

347
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:58,792
And he will need someone over
there who can cut people's salaries.

348
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,209
Sir.
- Say hello.

349
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,126
Yes.
- Sir.

350
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,084
Yes.
- Sir, I need to talk to you.

351
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:05,751
Why are you troubling sir?
Sir, it's nothing.

352
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:06,709
Just a second, Deepak.

353
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,042
Sir, my name is Vaibhav Pandey.

354
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:09,542
I enrolled in the 11th
grade batch yesterday.

355
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,501
Sir, he is a late admission.
Now he wants to upgrade his batch.

356
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,209
No, sir. He won't let
me tell you the whole story.

357
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,376
Listen. Vaibhav Pandey?
- Yes, sir.

358
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,001
Do you enjoy begging?

359
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,251
First of all. Stop begging.

360
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,459
If you want something
work hard and snatch it.

361
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,251
The batch you have now is your truth.

362
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,084
A test will take place in two months.

363
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,292
Make an effort and you will improve.

364
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:32,876
But all the others got 
batches through entrance exam.

365
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:35,459
I didn't even get to take that
That is also a truth.

366
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,334
Sir, I definitely deserve
a better batch than this.

367
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:41,542
Why later? Give me a test now.
I am willing to sit for it.

368
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:42,667
Ask me questions, sir.

369
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,042
Okay.

370
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:53,234
Here are fifty questions.
You've until tomorrow. Solve these.

371
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,667
The batch you earn after this will be final.

372
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,709
What happened?

373
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:01,751
Why are you getting involved
in this matter, sir?

374
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,584
Even your time will be wasted.
- Thank you, sir.

375
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,786
Now seeing him other kids will
also demand the same.

376
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,876
How many kids will you test?

377
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:13,626
Not everybody demands. 
Only he did.

378
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,417
We shall see.
Don't forget the payment.

379
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,501
Yes. Your payment will..

380
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:12,792
I'm not getting this, buddy.

381
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,709
After finishing the puffs
you say you aren't getting it.

382
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,417
Seeing the figure I
felt I will be able to do it.

383
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,376
What kind of a question is this?

384
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:27,834
How hard does one blow into the bubble maker
to make a stable bubble?

385
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,751
This hasn't been taught.

386
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:37,693
You really can't do it, bro?

387
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:41,542
God!

388
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:43,751
Even Piyush isn't answering my call.

389
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,501
What should I do? I am trapped.

390
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:48,751
Shivangi too has gone.

391
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,834
Why did you agree to this paper
when you hadn't studied mechanics?

392
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,001
I had to be heroic over there.

393
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,376
I can't solve three
questions in four hours.

394
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,709
And I will be humiliated
if I take this with me.

395
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:08,626
Let's go then.

396
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,251
Where?

397
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:13,209
I had the puffs.
So the questions will be solved..

398
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,792
..whether I solve them
or someone else does.

399
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,209
Come.

400
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,792
I have to prepare for my own
Board exams and I have little time.

401
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,459
What are you studying for?
- Reshuffling.

402
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,126
You still have two months to go.
- Exactly.

403
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,751
How will this get done so soon?

404
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:49,334
I too am in 11th grade. We
haven't been taught all of this as yet.

405
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:51,084
You can ask me anything
from before this.

406
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:54,334
They taught us in the 11th grade.
But I've forgotten everything.

407
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,402
You can ask me anything
that comes after that.

408
00:25:56,834 --> 00:26:00,917
"No sorrow, no cannabis or your rum."

409
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,209
"My world is made up of friends."

410
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:09,709
The first is B.
The second is A. The third is C.

411
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,084
So soon, brother? Please write
the solution as well, brother. Please.

412
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,084
You said Jeetu sir set the paper.
- Yes.

413
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,626
This is too easy. Don't waste my time.

414
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:27,792
I told you, didn't I? Students
of A1 are very selfish.

415
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:30,001
This is too easy?

416
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:33,751
"No sorrow, no cannabis or your rum."

417
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:37,542
"My world is made up of friends."

418
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:43,459
"I had read it in books.
Now it is written on the walls."

419
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,167
"My world is made up of friends."

420
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:56,917
Sure, bro. Show me.
Which question do you want me to solve?

421
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:00,959
Just show me the questions.
Not the options.

422
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,126
It's just that every
question has a journey..

423
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,542
..which we have to take
ourselves without a map.

424
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,792
Brother, solve the third one.

425
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,042
I wasted two years to do this.

426
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,167
I won't make the mistake
in the drop year.

427
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:16,167
We are only asking you to solve
one question. It will take ten minutes.

428
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,542
If I take ten minutes to
solve ten questions for others..

429
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:23,126
..then it will take me one month
of the year to clear other's doubts.

430
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:27,251
It's a 'do' or 'die' situation for me.
And I want to do 'do'.

431
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,454
Please leave. Please leave.
NOW!!

432
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,584
Check it. The answer is 8.

433
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,584
But bro all the options are in
sin theta and cos theta.

434
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:39,501
Oh, yeah? Show me another question.

435
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,959
Yes, this appears familiar.

436
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,334
I think I can solve it.
- Then do it, buddy.

437
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,542
I've been cramming non-stop
for two days.

438
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:56,876
If I don't speak to my girl today
she'll break up with me.

439
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,501
Please understand.

440
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:01,584
Really, bae. Is that what he said?

441
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,126
What happened after that?

442
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:06,334
Come back tomorrow.
I'll solve it for you tomorrow.

443
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:07,917
Come during the day tomorrow.

444
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,084
Ya! Got it. Root 3/4. Check it.

445
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:13,542
The three options are in form of graph.

446
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,667
And what about the fourth?
- None of the above.

447
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,417
Then that must be it.

448
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,417
You see? I solved it, didn't I?

449
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:48,334
Your girlfriend betrayed you,
didn't she?

450
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,417
It happens.

451
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,709
No. I never had a girlfriend.

452
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:57,209
Your parents must be getting divorced?

453
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,334
Right? No?

454
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,667
Or you must be gay.
Wow, bro! You are gay.

455
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:10,209
My first gay friend.
- What nonsense are you speaking?

456
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,292
Then what is the reason?

457
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,417
What's the reason that a fragile
and helpless boy like you..

458
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:18,584
..left his home, school and
all else mid semester to come to Kota?

459
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,752
You are not a genius. That much is obvious.

460
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,584
Meena, he isn't telling
but this guy has a dark past.

461
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:28,792
Uday.

462
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,042
Can't you find a
better time for ragging?

463
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,167
We can't solve one question.

464
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:35,334
If you can tell us something
about mechanics then tell us..

465
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,876
..or else remain quiet for two minutes.

466
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:44,251
I don't know about mechanics
but the answer to the third one is C.

467
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,417
That's plain guesswork.

468
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:52,126
I am not guessing.
I have seen this question.

469
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,167
Yes, it appears familiar to me as well..

470
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,417
..but I've forgotten how it is done.

471
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,251
It is okay.
If anyone explains a little to me once..

472
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,542
We got ourselves embarrassed just now.
You want to go again?

473
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:06,334
I thought people come
to Kota and become geniuses.

474
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,001
Jackasses!

475
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:09,876
Idea!

476
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:15,001
Kids, we will solve
a tricky question today..

477
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:18,084
..and if you don't use
the trick in this question..

478
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,751
..it will be difficult
for you to solve this question.

479
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,792
As you can see a block and
spring system has been used here.

480
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:26,042
Here I have projected the back block..

481
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:31,751
..towards the front block with V0 velocity.
- This is the one.

482
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:33,292
The spring with the natural ability.

483
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,709
Go a little forward.
A little forward. A little forward.

484
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:39,251
Now you have to solve
this with center of mass.

485
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:42,501
If you solve this with center of mass..
- Yes, this is the answer.

486
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:45,001
We were fooled by the change
of language of the question.

487
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:50,584
We took the frame of reference
of ground when we had to take center of mass.

488
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:55,084
You see, Meena.
I'm not like you. You forget.

489
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,792
My lectures can be revised
anywhere and at any time.

490
00:30:58,084 --> 00:30:59,459
Yes. Alright.

491
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,084
What?

492
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,584
If one problem is
from Resnick Halliday..

493
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,084
..then all the others too
can be from some book or the other.

494
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,517
Don't start reading the text.
Look out for the figure first.

495
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,876
If you find the figure, then
read the question. It will save time.

496
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,876
I found the bubble one!

497
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:35,584
Surface tension equated with..
- Read it later. Just copy it now.

498
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,459
Bring more books.

499
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:01,376
These are bad times.

500
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,917
We have to sneak out for studies.

501
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,084
God save us from IIT.

502
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:34,126
"What good is a life with no friends?"

503
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,876
I've been shot.Help me..
-- Revive me.

504
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,783
Kill him. Kill him.

505
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:51,825
He's hiding in the bushes.

506
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,059
Come help me.

507
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:55,709
How do I come?

508
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,376
Please come now.

509
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,584
"My world is made up of friends."

510
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:06,417
"It is made up of your
love and your worship."

511
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,001
"My world is made up of friends."

512
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:15,626
"I have met several thousand
but I have only four good friends."

513
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:20,584
"This is everyone's path.
This is everyone's calling."

514
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:25,667
"What good is a life with no friends?"

515
00:33:26,126 --> 00:33:30,084
"Don't get lost. Don't get separated."

516
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:32,417
"Don't get lost again."

517
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,751
Take them. Take them all.

518
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:36,959
These books are of no use.

519
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,709
The one for whom
I wanted to crack IIT..

520
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,917
..she eloped with a commerce guy.

521
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:43,001
We only need the solution.

522
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,459
Old edition?

523
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,834
It will do. It will do. It will do.

524
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,501
Bye. Bye. Bye, bro.

525
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:02,792
"No sorrow, no cannabis or your rum."

526
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:06,751
"My world is made up of friends."

527
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:12,459
"I had read it in books.
Now it is written on the walls."

528
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,876
"My world is made up of friends."

529
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:21,126
"My world is made up of friends."

530
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,167
"My world is made up of friends."

531
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:29,584
"My world is made up of friends."

532
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:35,469
YOU have the keys!!

533
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:38,827
Oh yeah!!

534
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:52,876
"I had read it in books.
Now it is written on the walls."

535
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:56,292
"My world is made up of friends."

536
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:01,126
"My world is made up of friends."

537
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:06,042
"My world is made up of friends."

538
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:11,084
"My world is made up of friends."

539
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:15,459
"My world is made up of friends."

540
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:20,376
"My world is made up of friends."

541
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:25,209
"My world is made up of friends."

542
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:29,834
"My world is made up of friends."

543
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:34,501
"My world is made up of friends."

544
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:40,417
Enough already.

545
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,751
You will surely get a better
batch than A10 with this much.

546
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:45,709
This is copied.
Let me solve a few myself.

547
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:50,417
Hey, bro. Don't tell  Jeetu Bhaiya 
that you copied all these.

548
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:52,542
You will waste the
whole night's efforts..

549
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:53,917
..just for a couple of questions.

550
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,376
I am going to bed now.

551
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,292
How much longer will you remain awake?

552
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,542
It's almost done. Only a little longer.

553
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,792
Good luck.
- Yes, bro. Thank you.

554
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:15,542
Bye.
- Yes.

555
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,167
You did all of these?

556
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:48,251
Yes, sir. It took me all night.

557
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:54,751
How did you do this one?

558
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,376
The third one?

559
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,792
Sir, Instead of ground we had
to use center of mass as the frame of reference.

560
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,709
Then it got done.

561
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:07,126
Correct.

562
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:10,584
This one?

563
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:14,667
Sir, the first part
in this one was very easy.

564
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:18,126
In the second part the
movement of inertia was changed.

565
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:20,084
Then it got done.

566
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,084
This one?

567
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,334
In this one had to blow air into
a bubble. Then the surface tension..

568
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,959
You must have doubled it.
- Doubled. Yes, sir.

569
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:36,792
Then you must have equated it.
- Yes, sir.

570
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:39,334
It's correct.

571
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,626
Your method is correct.
- Thank you, sir.

572
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:45,376
But the answer is wrong.

573
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,167
Classic calculation mistake.

574
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,126
Coincidentally Sharma sir's
solution has the same mistake.

575
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:55,542
In the last edition.
Page number 98, problem number 17.

576
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,001
I mailed him.
He will correct it in the next edition.

577
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,084
Do you know why you couldn't
solve the remaining 8 questions?

578
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:14,751
Because those 8 questions
were framed by me.

579
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,792
The solutions for the other
questions are in one book or another.

580
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,501
Those you have solved.

581
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:23,709
You couldn't complete
these by yourself in one night.

582
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,126
Who was with you?

583
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:30,292
Who was with you?

584
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,584
I'm asking you for the last time. Did you solve these?

585
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,626
No, sir.

586
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,667
I had only solved NCERT so far.

587
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:41,501
Didn't you know this yesterday?

588
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,709
Yesterday you were acting like Kejriwal.

589
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,167
Give me one opportunity, sir.
Give me a chance. I will do it.

590
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:47,334
What happened?

591
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:49,667
Sorry, sir.

592
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:53,251
Do you know for whom quota,
coaching, material..

593
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:56,709
..DPP, sheets and ready
reckoner are designed for?

594
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,417
For the students.
- For rankers.

595
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:05,709
It's not for us?
We only copy. What do we have? Fees.

596
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,876
The rankers get facilities from
fees charged to students like you..

597
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,417
..and people like me make an earning.

598
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:13,209
Guys like you come to Kota.

599
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:16,209
Playing pokemon in 9th grade..
..and PUBG in 10th grade and

600
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,751
Kota in 11th grade.

601
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,584
Why? We will answer when Mr.
Sharma asks.

602
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,542
You are preparing for IIT and NEET in Kota.

603
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,792
It looks cool. It's a fad.

604
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:28,667
You read the ads in newspapers
and see the hoardings..

605
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,209
..that state 100 percent
selection guaranteed.

606
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,584
We claim the same.
100 percent selection guaranteed.

607
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:36,459
You see that and you come here.
There is no guarantee.

608
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,501
I am not reprimanding you.
I am opening your eyes. Sit.

609
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:42,626
Sit.

610
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:47,001
You came to Kota, didn't you? Why?

611
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:48,417
To study, sir.

612
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:51,001
You could have studied at home.
What will Kota do?

613
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,834
Think. Think. This will take time.

614
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:01,917
Kota provides an environment.
Since there are students everywhere..

615
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:10,001
..there is competition and focus.
So we ought to get selected.

616
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,417
And what if you don't?

617
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:14,834
Sir, even if one is not
selected it doesn't matter.

618
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:16,501
One has to study
for the 12th grade, sir.

619
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:19,334
It gets done from here.
There is no loss, sir.

620
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,209
There is. There is a loss.
That's what people don't understand.

621
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,084
Children leave Kota in 2 years..

622
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,792
..but Kota doesn't leave
the children for years.

623
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,959
What does Kota do?
It isolates you from the world.

624
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,167
Then it doesn't matter in
life which government crashed..

625
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,564
..who got married to
whom and who won the IPL.

626
00:40:35,588 --> 00:40:37,588
None of it matters in life.

627
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:43,167
Parents, siblings, friends and
relatives. Everything is left behind.

628
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:45,167
And you are left here alone.

629
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,792
What is left? IIT.
You keep harping about IIT over here.

630
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:52,876
When you desire something
so much at your tender age..

631
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,251
..there are only two outcomes.

632
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,126
If you get in then you have peace.
You're chilled.

633
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:02,251
And if you don't get in you wind
up being jealous, rancour and self-doubt.

634
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,001
One loses confidence, brother.

635
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:08,619
Then a person deems himself
a bigger loser than the world does.

636
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,709
After that no matter how
good a college you get into..

637
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:16,917
..you don't like it
because it is not IIT.

638
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,459
Seven years. 4 years of
graduation and 3 years of working.

639
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:23,959
It takes 7 years to
come out of this trauma.

640
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:29,084
Do you know the
punishment for fraud in India?

641
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:34,542
7 years. So henceforth 
stop all this fraud.

642
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,917
This is not your school where
you impress someone to get more marks.

643
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,626
Here you and I have to get
together to help you get selected.

644
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:47,542
You won't achieve that in this manner.
By copying and cramming.

645
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:52,001
What they show in the films is wrong.

646
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,917
People getting selected by cramming.

647
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:57,584
It's not the Chaturs who go to IIT.
Only Ranchos do.

648
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:59,042
You have seen 3 Idiots, haven't you?

649
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:07,084
Don't be afraid of the batch.
This is your truth. Accept it.

650
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,751
Yes, sir.

651
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:31,334
It is also true that you
brushed up entire Mechanics in one night.

652
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,042
So, you are certainly a fighter student.

653
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:38,542
And that is all a teacher wants.

654
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:54,626
You joined late
hence you are lagging behind.

655
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:56,334
..but you are not alone.

656
00:42:57,126 --> 00:43:00,334
We will fight right up till the last moment
 and crack IIT.

657
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:02,376
Okay?

658
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,292
Say yes or no.

659
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:07,626
Yes, sir.

660
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:10,876
Go.

661
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,167
Give this to the receptionist.
She will leave anytime.

662
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:14,417
Yes, sir.

663
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:20,334
Sir.

664
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:22,917
How do I solve the
remaining eight questions?

665
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,959
Come. The repeater batch has
the same topic going on.

666
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,334
Come on.
