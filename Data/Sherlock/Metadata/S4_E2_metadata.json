One mysterious case in particular baffles Scotland Yard but Sherlock is more interested in a seemingly trivial detail. Why is someone destroying busts of the late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher? Is there a madman on the loose, or is there a much darker purpose at work, something with its roots deep in Mary Watson's past?", "Whilst the Watsons are delighted with their newborn, Sherlock believes, after hearing a recorded message from Moriarty, that his supposedly dead adversary has a posthumous plan to attack him. When Lestrade calls him in to solve the mysterious death of cabinet minister David Welsborough's son, Sherlock is intrigued that a bust of ex-premier Margaret Thatcher has been broken. Further incidents follow in which busts of Thatcher are destroyed, one involving murder. Sherlock deduces that a priceless jewel was hidden in one of them to smuggle it into England, but when he lays a trap for the thief, he is amazed to learn who is also innocently involved, somebody whom he must attempt to save from a vengeful associate from a failed operation six years earlier.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3538760", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 26701, "number_of_episodes": 15}
