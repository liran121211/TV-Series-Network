Acting on behalf of Lady Elizabeth Smallwood, he wishes to retrieve from Magnussen 30-year-old love letters her husband wrote (before their marriage) to his lover - a girl only 15-years-old at the time. Sherlock finds a way into Magnussen's office (which explains his relationship with Magnussen's secretary Janine) but is shot by a black-clad, gun-wielding woman intent on killing Magnussen.\u2014garykmcd", "Sherlock has been hired by Lady Smallwood to intercede on her behalf with Charles Magnussen.

Unfortunately, there's a nasty surprise waiting for Sherlock in Magnussen's office, a surprise he may not survive.
