Sherlock, however, prefers to assist Lestrade following a massive bomb blast.

While proceeding to solve that case, Sherlock encounters difficult distractions from a mysterious villain who abducts people and threatens to kill them unless his demands, which are meant for Sherlock, are met.

Mycroft approaches Sherlock with the death of government employee Andrew West and his missing copy of the Bruce Partington plans, but a soulless criminal mastermind, speaking through a series of human bombs (innocent Londoners wired to explode), distracts Sherlock, sending him, Watson and Lestrade scurrying through the city to solve a 20-year-old masked murder, an insurance fraud business, a celebrity poisoning (murder), and assassinations surrounding a forgery scheme. Someone is playing with Sherlock, and he rightly suspects it to be his brilliant criminal equal, the mysterious, unseen figure known only to him as Moriarty.\u2014statmanjeff", "Sherlock Holmes is bored - there are no intriguing murder cases to solve. Then a nearby flat is blown up and Holmes starts to think something may be afoot. His brother Mycroft visits and tries to get him to solve a suspected murder case involving an MI6 officer and find the top secret missile plans he had. Holmes is not that interested. The bomb case gets more intriguing, and deadly, when Holmes is contacted by a would-be victim of the bomber. Unless Holmes solves a certain case within 12 hours, the bomb attached to the person will be detonated.
