Fantastic.

367
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:39,904
Where is it?

368
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,105
<i> [yelling]</i>

369
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,173
Oh! Fuck.

00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:45,144
<i> [scattered chattering,
 cackling]</i>

371
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,181
Oh, shit.

372
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,849
Okay.

373
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,550
No, I--they're over there.

374
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,551
They're over there.

375
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,487
Okay, great.

376
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,355
Okay.

377
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,358
I did it.

378
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,394
Hello?

379
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:05,663
Excuse me?

380
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,331
Are you okay?

381
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,533
Oh, fuck.

382
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,036
Okay, I just came--

383
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,737
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not doing anything.

384
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,938
- What are you doing here?

385
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,941
What are you doing here?
I said answer me!

386
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,843
- I came for a signature.

387
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:33,891
- "Release paperwork for
patient Felix Kjellberg"?

388
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:35,693
Is this your release paperwork?

389
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,328
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,131
- This way to Dr. Yates.

391
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:42,067
- Okay.

392
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,037
<i> [cackling]</i>

393
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:54,846
Oh, shit.

394
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,816
<i> [screaming]</i>

395
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:00,551
Oh, what the shit?

396
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:01,820
Okay.

397
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:05,923
I'm--all right.

398
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,426
Jesus Christ.

399
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,527
Okay.

400
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,028
Oh, chair!

401
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,596
Shit! Shit!
Okay!

Fuck this!

Fuck this!

00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,301
Where the fuck do I go?

405
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,937
Oh, shit!

406
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,337
Okay, I'm gonna go here.

407
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,574
Okay, exit, exit.

408
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:23,841
Oh, shit.

409
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,077
Okay.

410
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,646
Fuck this place!

411
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,881
Where the fuck is the exit?

412
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:32,517
Where does it end?

413
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,152
No! No!

414
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:35,519
Jesus Christ.

415
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:38,223
Okay!

416
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,557
What the fuck?

417
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,360
- [yelling]

418
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:44,395
I got him!

419
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:45,797
You're safe.
You're safe.

420
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,965
Go back.
Go back.

421
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,334
What's going on?
What happened?

422
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,970
- I never ran so much
in my life.

423
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,904
- What's your opinion
of American hospitals?

424
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,908
- You know, I can tell you
don't have health insurance

425
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,477
and stuff going on here.

426
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,244
It's a little bit more
sketchy here.

427
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,958
Hello.

428
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,358
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

429
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:15,393
- Good, good, good.

430
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:16,528
- Hey.
- How's it going?

431
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,596
- So I brought the paperwork out
for you to sign

432
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,565
so we can get started on your
restraining order

433
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:21,665
with Nikki.

434
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:22,834
- Tell them how much--

435
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,135
no, we love each other.

436
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,238
This will not be the end!

437
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,105
You can't stop real love.

438
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,406
- Okay.

439
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,308
- Have you had any other
incidents since we last spoke?

440
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,911
- Sorry, sir, I would like to
be--I mean,

441
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:36,748
I'm kind of his security detail,
so I'd like to sort of--

442
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,916
- So you want me to talk to you,
and you talk to him?

443
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,751
- I think that's the best thing.

444
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:43,121
- That's fine, but I normally
need to talk to him

445
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,923
because he's the person that's
gonna sign his name

446
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,724
on the dotted line.

447
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,026
- This is officer to officer.

448
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,028
- Well, I don't want to be
disrespectful,

449
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,632
but officer and security
are two different things.

450
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:55,701
- So we're both security.

451
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,670
- Okay.

452
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,439
- No, I haven't had any
incident with Nikki or anything.

453
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,674
- Did you ever see packages?
Do you understand, packages--

454
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,942
- Well, it's from fans.

455
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,612
- He did receive packages,
but not from Nikki.

456
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,115
- Well, okay.

457
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,183
This is for us
to get the temporary

458
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,186
restraining order going,
and then I'm gonna

459
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,922
need your signature
right down here at the bottom X.

460
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:18,889
- Is there a box that you can
check all packages?

461
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,559
- What is he talking about?

462
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,894
- He's your security guy.
You tell me.

463
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,231
Okay, so I just need you
to sign right here.

464
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,464
- Okay.

465
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,734
- And then I'll fill
this information in.

466
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:30,735
- Uh, right here?

467
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:31,870
- Yeah, right there
on the X.

468
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,038
- Is that it?
Is that it?

469
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,405
- That's it.
We're good.

470
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,007
- Thank you, officer.
- Appreciate that.

471
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,576
- Thank you so much.
- Keep an eye out.

472
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:38,676
- Thank you.
Okay.

473
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,877
Thank you so much.

474
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,015
Jeff, this is Felix.
Felix, this is Jeff.

475
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,451
- How's it going?
Felix.

476
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,086
- I generally do overnight
things,

477
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,788
donut shops or late-night
riding.

478
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,990
Hey, it's a one-way street,
guys.

479
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:55,159
It's a one-way street.

480
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,327
Could you guys--

481
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,729
- It's not a one-way street.

482
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,730
-<i> People think security guards
 are not prepared,</i>

483
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:00,865
<i> and I am fully prepared.</i>

484
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,701
- He has a weapon,
a gun?

485
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:08,205
- Okay, good.

486
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:11,643
Just wrapped up another day.

487
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:14,378
Crazy as always,
but I did it.

488
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:18,182
And I'll see you
in the next one.

489
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:19,550
Brofist.

490
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,951
- You don't trust me.

491
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,686
I know you don't
trust me.

492
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,521
You probably haven't been
getting a lot of sleep.

493
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:25,523
So we got you--

494
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:28,759
- A pillow?

495
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,628
Okay.
[chuckles]

496
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,364
This is my favorite pillow.

497
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:33,331
Yes.
