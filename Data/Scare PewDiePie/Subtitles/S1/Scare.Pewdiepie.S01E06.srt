to know where he is.

175
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,961
- Oh, okay, okay!
- He's leaving, he's leaving.

176
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,963
- Now it's safe!
I'm sure.

177
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:06,798
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

178
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,466
- What?
They're both out!

179
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,468
God damn it! What do
we do? - Uh, shit,
shit.

180
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:12,571
- Wait, no, we got to
figure out how to work it.

181
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,240
- Okay, we need to know
where we are.

182
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,342
- Okay, so that's the prizes.
- Where are we?

183
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,675
- Pretty sure
we're in the manager's office

184
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,011
because that's the only one
with an arrow.

185
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,846
- Oh, you're right.
- I mean, that would make sense.

186
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,648
- Oh, there it is!
- There he is!

187
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,681
- Oh, he's over there.

188
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:24,682
- Great, where are
the other ones?

189
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:25,951
- We should check one.

190
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,253
- Are they all out?
Oh, they're all out.

191
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,587
- Ah, Jesus!
- Oh!

192
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,490
- Ah, I'm so on edge!

193
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,959
[laughter]

194
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:35,628
We're pretty safe right now.
- Deep, deep breaths.

195
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,329
- Okay.
- We can do this.

196
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:38,497
- Oh, look.

197
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,231
Do you see that?
- I want to hit the door button.

198
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,966
I mean, I don't see that.
- Oh, my God.

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,601
What the fuck?
How do you not see?

200
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,538
- No, I think I see one.
- Check our door again.

201
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,239
- Okay.
- Check fucking--

202
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,740
- I think we're--
- Yes, feel free to open it.

203
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:49,742
- Are you sure
he's not in there?

204
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:50,810
- No, it's fine!

205
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,977
- [cackling]

206
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,512
- Oh, close it!
Close the door!

207
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:57,116
[laughing and screaming]
Jesus Christ!

208
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,584
How does it work?

209
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,587
Dude, what the fuck?
[alarm drumming]

210
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,155
- No, that's a stuffed
animal. - What did the
door do?

211
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:04,423
Why are they blinking?

212
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,125
<i> - Oh, your batteries are dead.</i>
 - Oh, come on!

213
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,225
- What?

214
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,593
- We only shut the door,
like, twice!

215
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,929
- Are you kidding me?

216
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,529
<i> - Yeah, we're gonna
 need a volunteer.</i>

217
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,798
- I got it!
I volunteer!

218
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,266
I volunteer as tribute.
- As tribute?

219
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,800
- Yeah, right!
- Okay, great.

220
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,304
<i>- So, there's a reserve battery</i>

221
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,372
<i> somewhere in the arcade.
 I don't know where.</i>

222
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:23,541
<i>If you can find it and bring it
 back to the manager's office,</i>

223
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:25,043
<i> that'll restore your energy.</i>

224
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,245
- All right, I got this.
- Testing one, two, three.

225
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,781
Hello, hello?
- Oh, yeah, I got you, got you.

226
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,350
- Hello, walkie-talkie.
- Okay, I got you, I got you.

227
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:32,484
- Hello?

228
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,385
- Okay, we're keeping you
a lookout.

229
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:37,555
- Okay, it's clear, ready?
Okay, here we go.

230
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,190
- Hello?
Oh, there he is, look!

231
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:40,225
- I don't think
your volume's on.

232
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,393
- Hey, watch out, dude!

233
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,161
<i> Check to your right!</i>
 - What?

234
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,295
- [cackling]
- Oh!

235
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,764
You guys, slacking off
the on the job.

236
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,067
- Oh, shit, dude, I'm sorry.
- There was a bunny right there.

237
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,069
- You're fine!
Okay, you're fine.

238
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,369
- Okay, I'm not seeing anyone.

239
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:54,673
I'm gonna sprint into
the main arcade area.

240
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,307
- Main arcade, fuck.
- Where is it? Where is he?

241
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,177
- I'm at the prize counter.

242
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,612
<i> - Yeah, we see.
 [laughs]</i>

243
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,213
- Where are they?
There's four of them!

244
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,949
<i> Where are they?</i>
 - Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

245
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:05,050
- Kangaroo in the distance!

246
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,586
- I'm--I see a chicken.
I see a chicken.

247
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,655
- Don't engage with the chicken!

248
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:11,055
Oh, shit, there's the chicken!

249
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:13,057
- Where are you right now?
- He's so fucked.

250
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,793
Uh, we should just
close the doors.

251
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,695
- I'm hiding under
the air hockey table.

252
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,531
- [laughs]

253
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,800
- Is the coast clear?

254
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,168
- Wait.
- Hold on, hold on.

255
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,737
What the fuck is that?

256
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:25,803
- Is that the battery?
- Is that it?

257
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,338
- Oh, oh, that might be battery!

258
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:30,242
Okay, you need to go
to Wizard Wild Ride.

259
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:32,278
<i> Do you see the roller coaster
 spin-y thing?</i>

260
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,647
- Yeah, I see the roller coaster
spin-y thing.

261
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,215
- Walk towards it.
Oh...

262
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,317
Oh, f--oh, shit.
- There's a bunny.

263
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,186
- [cackling]
- Oh, God, oh.

264
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,822
- [deep laughter]

265
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:44,923
<i> - Oh, shit, oh, shit!
 - Oh, shit!</i>

266
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:46,792
<i> - Is that the fucking bunny?</i>

267
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:48,794
<i> Uh, he's near us,
 but he's walking away.</i>

268
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,163
<i> - This is so--</i>
 - Oh, my God, dude.

269
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,464
<i> - They're everywhere!</i>
 - There's the bunny.

270
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:53,498
Okay, over and out,
there's the bunny.

271
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,966
<i> - They're in the claw machine.</i>

272
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,235
<i> - Okay, they're all right next
 to the claw machine.</i>

273
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,503
- Claw machine?
Okay.

274
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,037
I'm making my way
to the spin-y thing.

275
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,639
- The Wizard Wild Ride, yes.

276
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:02,206
<i> - I'm not seeing anybody.
 I'm not seeing anybody.</i>

277
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,143
- We don't see you.
Where the hell are you?

278
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,578
<i> - In the middle of the arcade.</i>

279
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,580
<i> I'm approaching
 the spin-y thing.</i>

280
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,914
- We see you.
Do you see the battery?

281
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,149
- You see it?
It's right in front of you!

282
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,884
<i> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
 - Yes!

283
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,086
- Oh.
Okay.

284
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,421
Okay, you got it.<i>
 - I got it?</i>

285
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,188
<i> I got it.</i>
 - Yes, that's it.

286
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,324
<i> - Lot of numbers
 and stuff on it.</i>

287
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:20,959
- Well, fucking get--

288
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,561
- Just sprint!

289
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,363
<i> - Uh, what--where do I
 take this thing?</i>

290
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,396
<i> - [deep laughter]</i>

291
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,198
[screaming and laughing]

292
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:29,601
- Oh, shit!
What the fuck?

293
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,337
Mat, are you there?
We need the battery!

294
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,139
<i> - Ah, shit, looks like
 that curse lives after all.</i>

295
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,642
- The curse lives?

296
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:38,776
<i>- They say there's only one way
 to defeat the curse.</i>

297
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,279
<i> There are these two tokens
 in the arcade.</i>

298
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:44,350
<i> PewDiePie should probably be
 the one to locate the tokens.</i>

299
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,453
<i> Arin, you can direct him
 using the cameras.</i>

300
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,388
<i> So if you find the tokens,
 bring them</i>

301
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:51,890
<i> to the Wizard's Wild Ride.</i>
 - I don't like the rules.

302
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,225
<i> - You will get to play
 one arcade game</i>

303
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,628
<i> to remove the curse.</i>

304
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,228
<i> So do good.</i>

305
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,065
- Hey, if you kill PewDiePie,
that's not good.

306
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:03,102
- Be safe.
- Okay.

307
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,604
Okay, keep me safe.<i>
 - Don't worry.</i>

308
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:08,339
<i> Hold on, let me get to five
 and make sure you're safe.</i>

309
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,343
<i> Okay, it looks like
 the coast is clear.</i>

Okay, all right!

00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,684
Ah, Jesus!
Fuck this place!

314
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:21,052
Fuck this place, Arin!

315
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,121
- I'm thinking--oh, my God,
the chicken!

316
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,158

Where's the chicken?

Okay, wait.

322
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:38,002
I'm at the stage.

323
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:40,238
What do I do?
Where's the tokens?

324
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,440
<i> - I'm looking, dude!</i>

325
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:42,774
- Give me some hints.

326
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,644
<i> - Okay, I think I know
 where the first token is.</i>

327
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,480
<i> It's near the prize corner,
 but there's like a million</i>

328
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,115
<i> fucking dudes there.</i>

329
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,518
<i> Where are you, dude?</i>

330
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,953

I'm at the prize place.

<i> - Okay.
 I think it's on the--</i>
