Suffice it to say that I believe we
were all equally shocked by that.

So,
do you have any idea what the weapon is?

Who developed it? Why
Tierney wants it so badly?

64
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,619
Well,
the "who" is likely the Protector aliens,

65
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,121
the fleet with which
EarthCom tangled last year.

66
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,291
The "what" is that it is some
sort of anti-matter super-weapon.

67
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,128
It literally obliterated every piece of
matter with which it came into contact.

68
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,297
And the "why" is,
that with enough of it,

69
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,550
it could very well
be a planet killer.

70
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,195
You need to find out
more about this weapon,

71
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,763
and whether there are any
more of them out there like it.

72
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,640
Of course, but at this point,

73
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,767
Tierney still seems very able

74
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,769
to cover her tracks
exceedingly well

75
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,688
by using the portals she creates to
transport herself around the galaxy.

76
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,357
Matta may be able
to help us with this.

77

She's been investigating how
to track my mom and Tierney

78

the portals that they've been creating.

very well be the break we're waiting for.

even than arresting Tierney,

None, but the energy signature

- the original captain Clayton.
- Whoa.

420

You must understand our concern
that you're sending citizens off

421

through a portal that
you know very little about.

422
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,788
We've been through portals
such as these ourselves.

423
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,500
Then you know that they transport
you through space to other worlds.

And we also know that
they can be very dangerous.

When our Ark ship crashed here,

there were not enough resources

As soon as you become

There is, in fact,
a certain perverse logic to the practice.

With limited resources,

your mom used to
escape the freighter.

So, it was a different
portal that brought us here.

And if this is true, then Tierney and
Eve could still be on the planet after all.

You're not going to win.

694
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,567
I'll find the Ancients, and convince
them that this universe is worth sparing.

695
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,528
I'm afraid that's not possible,
Jax.

696
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,365
You've already told them this
universe isn't worth saving, didn't you?

697
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,535
The destruction of this
universe has already begun,

698
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,204
and without the
portals to reach them,

699
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,581
there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

Jett. Hey, wait up.

703
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,966
I need to get to class.

704
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,342
So, I spoke to Professor Shral,

705
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,261
and he didn't seem
to care what you did.

706
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,720
But I do.

707
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,240
You need to tell me
what's going on with you.

708
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,724
You need to stop messing with my life,
okay?

709
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,268
Just leave me alone.

710
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,727
Is that really what you want,

711
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,396
for no one to care about you?

712
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,774
You wouldn't understand, Zazie.

713
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,736
I know what it's like to be
forced into making bad choices.

Trust me.

00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:57,966
Okay.

I...

719
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,708
I didn't like the
person I'd become.

720
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,586
I don't blame you. I
wouldn't have liked him either.

721
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,671
And I paid the price.

722
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,175
I didn't just get suspended.
I lost my entire scholarship.

723
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,260
So,
my family doesn't have money.

724
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,554
So...

That's what you were doing
in Professor Shral's office,

729
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,441

730
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,276
Yeah.

Oh, my God! That is so great!

00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,821
- That's so great!
- What's great about it?

733
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,199
I thought you were a
thief and a liar and a cheat.

734
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,410
Okay, maybe you missed what I said,
I'm a... janitor.

735
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,704
So what? It's honest, hard work.

736
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,664

going through.

Nothing has changed.

I saw everything I needed to see

751
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,364
Do you know what that was like?

752
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,575
The darkness. The loneliness.

And they were wrong,
and I am so sorry.

756
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,377
We can go to the
