1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,801
Previously on Pandora...

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,971
I may be an empath, but
I... I'm no mind reader.

3
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:05,506
My dad served in the military, too.

4
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:08,333
He said EarthCom did some pretty
messed up stuff during the War.

5
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,168
The only reason you came
on in this little adventure

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:11,713
was because I promised you information

7
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:13,178
about what happened to your parents.

8
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,003
You used me like you always
do to get what you wanted.

9
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,496
You don't care whose lives
you put at risk to do that.

10
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:21,188
Why do you always have
to act so superior?

11
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:22,545
Because I am superior.

12
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:24,370
It's not narcissism.

13
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,737
It's an empirical fact.

14
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:28,754
♪ You say goodbye ♪

15
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,323
Atria's been bugging me to do a night up

16
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,592
at that new spa up on The Pearl.

17
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:32,617
I hear it's great.

18
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:33,841
I hear it's expensive.

19
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:36,466
Oh, come on, it'll be a fun
trip up the space elevator.

20
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:39,374
We deserve a night of R & R
with a little zero-g massages,

21
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,432
maybe a facial.

22
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,591
I would very much like to attend also.

23
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,716
Sorry, no C chromosomes allowed.

24
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:46,174
Girls only, Ralen.

25
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,666
But why don't you and Thomas
plan a boys' night together,

26
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,691
do something fun.

27
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,749
Like throwing chairs.

28
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,907
Is that your idea of fun?

29
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,233
On Zatar, throwing chairs is
considered quite entertaining.

30
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:59,936
You will never guess what I found out.

31
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:03,155
You know, that very stud-muffinly
young teacher's assistant

32
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:05,246
that you don't want to
admit you're so crushing on?

33
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:06,312
You mean Xander?

34
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,355
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

35
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:12,279
He has a birthday tomorrow,

36
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,069
and he doesn't want
anyone to know about it.

37
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,605
Well, then he obviously
told the wrong person.

38
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,102
Was that a joke?

39
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:24,518
Just an insight I've made from
observing Atria's behavioral patterns.

40
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,537
So in other words, it's a joke.

41
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,153
Well, he didn't tell me.

42
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:31,679
He told Kossara, and
then Kossara told me.

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,395
Why would he tell the bartender
that he's having birthday

44
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,563
if he didn't want anyone to... ?

45
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,454
You're Delaney Pilar, aren't you?

46
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:38,445
I am. But you may call me Pilar.

47
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,571
I am Jet. I'm in Shral's Interstellar
Protocol class with you.

48
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:44,731
You know, maybe we could
get together to study

49
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:46,023
one day.

50
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,459
Well, she's already in a study group.

51
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,129
- Would you like to... ?
- No, thank you, Jet.

52
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,187
Maybe next semester.

53
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:54,046
Oh, how about dinner this semester?

54
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,338
Ah, sorry, I'm really busy.

55
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,272
But I appreciate the invitation.

56
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,954
You obviously have time for
drinks with your friends,

57
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:09,355
but you have no problem
blowing me off, huh?

58
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,227
Don't tell me you're with this Zit?

59
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,199
I'm not "with" anyone.

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,800
And I'm definitely not
interested in being "with" you.

61
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,891
You know, someone's gonna knock
you off that pedestal one day,

62
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,948
- you smug...
- I suggest you walk away.

63
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:36,015
Now.

64
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,198
You okay?

65
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,502
When you're as attractive
and smart as I am,

66
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,271
unfortunately, these things happen
more frequently than I'd like.

67
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,641
But I'm fine.

68
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,442
Could I get a Sumi Starburst, please?

69
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,025
What's wrong with that one?

70
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,172
Are you sure you're okay?

71
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:05,239
Never better.

72
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,265
Like many Sumi customs,

73
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,101
their dining etiquette
is highly ritualized.

74
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,395
They begin each meal
by praising the host

75
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:29,563
and declaring themselves
unworthy of his or her generosity.

76
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,744
What might the Sumi make
of the old Earth tradition

77
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:36,280
of touching glasses to make a toast?

78
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:38,476
Ms. Larson.

79
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,885
As it says in chapter three

80
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,354
of Simak's Guide to
Interstellar Diplomacy,

81
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:47,324
the Sumi are very sensitive to
gestures of respect and disrespect,

82
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:48,739
so I think they would appreciate

83
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,819
the honor of someone
making a toast to them.

84
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,083
Then I sincerely hope

85
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:54,532
you don't pursue a career
in interstellar relations,

86
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,134
or we might find ourselves
in yet another war.

87
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:01,186
Who would like to explain
Ms. Larson's error?

88
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:06,377
Ms. Pilar, please enlighten
us with your wisdom.

89
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,213
As it says in chapter four
of the Simak's Guide,

90
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:12,682
the Sumi are also extremely
sensitive to germs and contamination.

91
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,613
They'd find the gesture
of touching their glass,

92
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:16,419
or any other eating utensil,

93
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,254
to someone else's to be repulsive.

94
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:21,781
And possibly an act of
violence and hostility.

95
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,273
Excellent.

96
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:26,198
War with the Sumi mercifully averted.

97
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:29,925
Class dismissed.

98
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,711
- Hey...
- I'm used to it.

99
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:46,414
Some people think I
have an unfair advantage

100
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:49,317
because of my nanites and
connection to the datastream.

101
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,686
But that only helps with
things like rote memorization,

102
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:53,788
which the Academy isn't about.

103
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,491
The teachers here expect
analysis and critical thinking.

104
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:59,293
I have to do that with my own
brain, just like everybody else.

105
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:01,262
You study harder than anyone I know.

106
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:02,731
You deserve those straight A's.

107
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,432
Speaking of studying,

108
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,802
I talked to Xander about needing
some extra tutoring from him,

109
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,638
and I've arranged to have him
come to the Black Hole tomorrow

110
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,474
at exactly 1900 hours.

111
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,240
God, I love surprise parties.

112
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,810
And boy, is he gonna be surprised.

113
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,500
Do you think that maybe,
since he didn't tell anybody

114
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:19,780
it was his birthday, that...

115
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,281
Pilar!

116
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:25,552
Pilar, can you hear me?

117
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,954
Pilar! Can you hear me?

118
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,188
Pilar, wake up!

119
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:39,748

120
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,940
Are the doctors going to call
when they know what's wrong?

121
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,942
I hope so.

122
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:51,544
I'm listed as Pilar's
emergency contact but...

123
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,025
never thought she'd actually need it.

124
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,996
Maybe I should go back to the
medical center and see if she's okay.

125
00:05:58,585 --> 00:05:59,619
No need.

126
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,654
They released you.

127
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:02,722
Are you okay?

128
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:05,625
Should you not be getting more tests?

129
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,760
Oh, I already got plenty.

130
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:10,029
Anyway, the cute doctor
gave me a thorough check up,

131
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,932
including diagnostics of all
of my implants and nanites.

132
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:15,568
I'm entirely fine.

133
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,202
Other than the fact the doctor
already has a girlfriend.

134
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:22,041
So, what happened? Why did you collapse?

135
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,310
Just exhaustion and stress, they said.

136
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,979
Apparently it happens
to a lot of freshman.

137
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,649
But you haven't been exhausted
or stressed, have you?

138
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,152
Only... with mid-terms coming up,

139
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:35,886
I guess I've been
pushing myself too hard.

140
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,525
Maybe we should do that
spa day sooner than later.

141
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,560
Oh, can I?

142
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,760
Still no.

143
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,029
Okay.

144
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,485
Where you going, P?

145
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,434
Wha... ?

146
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,504
Stop looking.

147
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,279
She's hot.

148
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,373
Could you stop staring?

149
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:04,523
This is not stress. This is
something way more serious.

150
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,324
I think I was sleepwalking.

151
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,760
You don't just suddenly
start sleepwalking.

152
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,729
And yesterday, you
collapsed leaving class.

153
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,264
I think something could be
seriously wrong with you.

154
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,299
The doctors said my BIOS
were completely normal.

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,434
Maybe it's not something physical.

156
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:20,403
I assure you there is
nothing wrong with me.

157
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,340
I am functioning at peak efficiency.

158
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:25,135
You know, if you're ever
worried about anything,

159
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,209
you can talk to me, right?

160
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,111
I just need to rest and recharge.

161
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:30,648
I will meditate on the datastream
again before Xander's party.

162
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,374
- I'm worried about you.
- You needn't be.

163
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,153
I am looking forward to the party
tomorrow and watching the two of you

164
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,556
do your "we don't have the hots
for each other" mating dance.

165
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,623
- We don't have...
- Good night, Jax.

166
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,194
Good night, P.

167
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:02,644
Aah...

168
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,714
What is it?

169
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,182
Are you all right?

170
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:08,685
No. You woke me up
with all that yelling.

171
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:10,819
What are you talking about, silly?

172
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,656
You said you really wanted
a strawberry milkshake?

173
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:17,060
No, I didn't.

174
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,194
Although I was thinking about one.

175
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:28,503
What's wrong?

176
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:30,871
I don't know.

177
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,809
Ever since me and my pop mind dived,

178
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,177
my telepathic powers seem to be growing.

179
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,217
So, what am I thinking now?

180
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,260
Did you just do what I think you did?

181
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,963
That's telekinesis, not telepathy.

182
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,167
How is that even possible?

183
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:59,935
You can't tell anyone about this.

184
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:00,969
Why not?

185
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,403
It's too dangerous.

186
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:04,906
The ETC did horrible things
to my pop during the war.

187
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,875
If they found out that I inherited
some of his abilities, then...

188
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,844
The war is long over.

189
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,846
The Corps was disbanded years ago.

190
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,579
They're always planning
for the next one.

191
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:17,785
And I can't put you or any
of our friends in danger.

192
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,522
Isn't that a little paranoid?

193
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:23,090
EarthCom doesn't do things like that...

194
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:25,059
do they?

195
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:49,484
Pilar au naturel. Oh...

196
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,117
Thank you, God.

197
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,297
Is everything all right, Pilar?

198
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,534
Of course. Uh...

199
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,201
See you tonight at the party.

200
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,222
Pilar, where are you?

201
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,528
All right. Xander's gonna be here
in a few minutes. Everybody hide!

202
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:37,631
Where is Pilar?

203
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,065
Is she not attending?

204
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,100
She'll be here.

205
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,399
She said she wouldn't miss it.

206
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,107
And then, last night, I had this
amazing breakthrough on my paper.

207
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,776
The Battle of Proxima Centauri
has always been considered

208
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,945
a turning point in
the Earth-Zatarian War,

209
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:57,850
but didn't EarthCom really gain the
advantage after the Siege of 2187?

210
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,355
Well, uh, that's certainly
an... interesting thesis.

211
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,456
You don't agree?

212
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,224
It doesn't matter
whether I agree or not,

213
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,260
as long as you have facts
to back up your arguments.

214
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,530
Oh. Thanks, Xander.

215
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,798
Thank you. That is good advice.

216
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,235
Now, just one more thing...

217
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,641
Surprise!

218
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,584
Happy birthday!

219
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,186
Thanks. Thank you.

220
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,187
Many happy returnings.

221
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,891
Is that not right?

222
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,693
It's close enough.

223
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,263
Well, this is certainly a surprise.

224
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,864
Well, you can thank Atria for that.

225
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,999
She insisted we do
something for your birthday.

226
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,234
Obviously. Thank you. Thank you, Atria.

227
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,705
Happy birthday, Xander.

228
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,772
Oh.

229
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,340
Oh, hug him already!

230
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,016
Sushi?

231
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,383
Yeah.

232
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,650
Great.

233
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,796
You know I really do appreciate this.

234
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:23,834
I didn't realize how much
I needed a break from work.

235
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,769
Ah... yes, work.

236
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,638
Too bad you can't tell me what that is.

237
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,807
Although, I am sure saving the
galaxy can be quite exhausting.

238
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,775
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

239
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,577
You looking for someone who's not me?

240
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:43,854
Pilar.

241
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,822
She was supposed to be here by now.

242
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,091
I gotta go.

243
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,191
You're leaving already?

244
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,261
Why? Do you want me to stay?

245
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,498
Well, I didn't say that exactly.

246
00:13:58,335 --> 00:13:59,701
Hey, ah...

247
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:06,541
You're learning.

248
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,762
Anyways, I gotta go check on
Pilar and make sure she's okay.

249
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:15,074
By the way, you never told me
what you wanted for your birthday.

250
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,132
You never asked.

251
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,224
Well, I'm asking now.

252
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,258
Well, how 'bout I tell
you when you get back?

253
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,715
Deal.

254
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,626
Welcome home, Jax.

255
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:35,762
Pilar, where... ?

256
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,895
Pilar.

257
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,546
Jax.

258
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,885
I think I'm broken.

259
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,380
I'm broken, Jax.

260
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,907
There's got to be something
wrong with my bio-organic.

261
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,877
It's the only explanation
for what's wrong with me.

262
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,212
Stop that!

263
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,470
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,914
This isn't stress.

265
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:16,050
Something in me is malfunctioning.

266
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,952
Something the doctors missed.

267
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:20,520
There's got to be an
error with my implants

268
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,924
or the core data program that
controls the nanites in my bloodstream

269
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,592
that's affecting my motor functions.

270
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,963
I didn't want to tell anyone

271
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,864
'cause I was afraid
you'd think I was crazy

272
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,866
or just making this whole thing up.

273
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,934
No one who knows you
would ever think that.

274
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,903
We just want to help you.

275
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,072
If there's nothing physically wrong

276
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,307
with me or my implants,

277
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,475
then it must all be in my mind.

278
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:48,681
Maybe it's not my parts, maybe
I'm the one having a breakdown.

279
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:49,916
I don't know what's wrong,

280
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,584
but we're gonna figure this out.

281
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,985
Together. Okay?

282
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,190
You've thoroughly analyzed
all of your bio-organics?

283
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,960
What about their source code?

284
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,994
Not yet.

285
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,097
Then let's go through them,

286
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:05,931
line by line, until we find the glitch.

287
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,632
What if there is no glitch?

288
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,368
What if it's me, Jax? What
if I'm the one who's broken?

289
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,836
No mater what, I will
always be here for you.

290
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,605
You're not alone.

291
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,810
Thanks, Jax.

292
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,415
I've never really understood what
it's like to have a real friend.

293
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,019
I never needed one until today.

294
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,379
Happy birthday, lieutenant.

295
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
What?

296
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,585
I said happy birthday, Xander.

297
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,306
It's almost morning, and you haven't
even unwrapped your present yet.

298
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,155
Kossara...

299
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,191
not tonight.

300
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,328
Thank you.

301
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,297
It's been a long night.

302
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,142
We've found nothing.

303
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,744
It's hopeless.

304
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,447
And now I really am exhausted.

305
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,049
Wait... look at this. It's
the code for your dataport.

306
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,951
This one line keeps doing that.

307
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,507
It could have been so easy
for the doctors to miss it

308
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:36,920
in their diagnostics.

309
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,422
It's not your hardware,
it's your software.

310
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,858
I think we just found the glitch.

311
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,728
I don't think it was a mistake.

312
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,962
It looks like a back door
was programmed into the code

313
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:49,422
to access the datastream...

314
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,035
and me.

315
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,060
I thought the datastream
was impossible to hack.

316
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:56,114
Even the Zatarians couldn't
do it during the War.

317
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:57,707
It is impossible...

318
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,841
without a back door like this.

319
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:03,246
Who could have put that there?

320
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,249
Most likely, the original
programmer at the company

321
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,150
that manufactured the dataport.

322
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:10,223
Let me guess.

323
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:12,321
Parallax.

324
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:16,259
But why would they want
to hack your implants?

325
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,228
I have no idea.

326
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:21,030
There's only one reason to
put malicious code in there.

327
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,531
Whoever did that wanted
to be able to control you.

328
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:28,369
I feel so completely violated, Jax.

329
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:32,106
What do you say we cut
their strings, Pinocchio?

330
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:33,741
I don't know.

331
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:37,712
Once we sever the connection,

332
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:40,082
whoever's responsible won't
be able to control you anymore.

333
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,971
But if I leave it disconnected,

334
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:44,376
I won't be able to access
the datastream again.

335
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,212
No.

336
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,557
At least not until we track down
who's been doing this to you.

337
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:49,925
How do we do that?

338
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:51,560
I've been on the
datastream my whole life.

339
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,386
I don't even know how
to exist without it.

340
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:54,910
Do you trust me?

341
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:56,610
I'm learning to.

342
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,674
I haven't always been as loyal
to my friends as I should have.

343
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:04,137
But I only want to help you.

344
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,239
I know that.

345
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,644
Good.

346
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,245
'Cause I need you to believe me
when I say we can't do this alone.

347
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,147
We're going to need some help.

348
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,183
It's absolutely inconceivable.

349
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,184
So you don't believe me?

350
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:20,722
Of course I do, Ms. Pilar.

351
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:23,525
I just find it unconscionable

352
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,727
that anyone could inflict
this kind of suffering on you.

353
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,129
We have to do something about this.

354
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,990
It appears logical that
Parallax is responsible

355
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,233
for the flaw in the code.

356
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,801
If you can figure out why,

357
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,970
that will help you determine the who.

358
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,039
But... what could anybody want from me?

359
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,875
I wish I could answer that.

360
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,392
What happened at the Black Hole

361
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:45,946
and then those holograms
of her, that's personal.

362
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:48,116
Someone has a grudge against Pilar.

363
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:50,477
Do you know anyone who might
fit that description, Ms. Zhou?

364
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,920
As a matter of fact I do.

365
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:01,095
Hey, Jet.

366
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:02,530
We need to talk to you.

367
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:03,764
About Pilar.

368
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,900
Yeah, sure. I'd love to talk about her,

369
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,236
especially those big, round...

370
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:10,369
Whoa!

371
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,547
Man, this guy's fast.

372
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:22,482
Perhaps that's why he
goes by the moniker "Jet".

373
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:23,850
Do you think?

374
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,030
I'm so sorry.

375
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,466
How clumsy of me.

376
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,371
Ow, you're hurting me, man!

377
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,073
That is my intention.

378
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:48,240
What do you want?

379
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:49,642
You tell us, genius.

380
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:51,153
You're the one with all
the tricked out uber-tech,

381
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,812
so you must have all the answers.

382
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,413
Yeah. Something about Pilar, right?

383
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:55,915
You are correct, Jax.

384
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,651
He does possess a keen degree
of mental acuity, after all.

385
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,219
What do you want me to say?

386
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,755
I couldn't resist sending out
that holo-nude after she flamed me.

387
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,957
We know you are the one
who hacked her dataport

388
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,526
and forced her to behave in
such an uncharacteristic fashion.

389
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,961
I didn't hack anybody!

390
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:11,297
You... You can't hack the
datastream. It's impossible.

391
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,431
How did you find out about the
back door in the datastream code?

392
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:14,700
What back door?

393
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,802
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

394
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,106
If you continue to be duplicitous,

395
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:25,043
I may be forced to apply some
Zatarian methods of persuasion.

396
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:28,146
We call it the mind ripper.

397
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:30,749
The English translation
is not entirely accurate,

398
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,451
but I believe you get the point.

399
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,105
I've never tried this on a human before,

400
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:36,888
but there's a first time for everything.

401
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,624
No, no, no. Look... Look, I'm sorry
I embarrassed your friend, okay?

402
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,693
But I never hacked her. I
don't have that kind of tech.

403
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:44,362
Really!

404
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:46,697
- Uh, hello? What is this?
- Ow!

405
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,702
I'm commencing a mind ripper.

406
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,370
Okay, okay, look, it's all fake, okay?

407
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:54,811
My implants don't actually do
anything. They're just for show.

408
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:02,078
Speak.

409
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:06,816
The hacker crowd I run with...

410
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:10,020
they can afford all
this incredible tech.

411
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:12,547
Or their parents can, anyway.

412
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,459
My family don't have
the credits to afford it.

413
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,960
So... I fake it.

414
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:20,030
This...

415
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:21,965
This is just an ordinary contact lens.

416
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,034
Yeah.

417
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:25,770
And... And this, this
is a real dataport,

418
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,772
but it isn't connected to anything.

419
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:30,406
And this tech on my
face is a cheap fake.

420
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,236
Guys, I... I couldn't have
hacked your friend,

421
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,003
or anyone, even if I wanted to.

422
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,949
I think he's telling the truth, Ralen.

423
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,954
If you did not hack Pilar, then who did?

424
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,624
How the hell should I know?

425
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,359
Whoa. No, no, please.

426
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,727
This is your crowd, right?

427
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:52,005
They're always trying
to one-up each other

428
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:53,597
with the most difficult hacks.

429
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,932
So if someone was able
to pull off the impossible

430
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,768
and hack the datastream,
they would tell everyone,

431
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:00,527
would they not?

432
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:02,822
Tell us who's been extolling
their cybernetic acumen

433
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:04,554
and technical aptitude.

434
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,877
Uh...

435
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:08,878
You...

436
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,280
Bragging.

437
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,580
Who's been bragging?

438
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,985
You don't know what these people
would do to me if you cross them.

439
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,822
You should be more worried
about what I'll do to you.

440
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,056
- Come on.
- Wait, stop! Stop!

441
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,095
I can give you the names of some
people I think could have done it.

442
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:27,930
But I don't know for sure.

443
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,477
How are you supposed to relax

444
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:37,207
when it's so quiet without
any voices in your head?

445
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,300
The idea is to feel your own body,

446
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:42,235
listen to your own thoughts.

447
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,022
I don't like my own thoughts.

448
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:49,803
I keep remembering how
completely helpless I felt that night

449
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,305
at the Black Hole.

450
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,140
And then those holo-nudes
Jet sent to the entire school.

451
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,850
Normally, I could block
it out by flooding my mind

452
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,648
with sounds and images
from the datastream. But...

453
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:04,759
You've never been off the
datastream this long, have you?

454
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,051
Not since I was six years old.

455
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,886
That's when I first got my implants.

456
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,356
I don't even remember
my life before that.

457
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:14,324
The datastream has always been there.

458
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,763
I didn't have any brothers or sisters.

459
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,397
Or really any friends.

460
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,601
It was a way to not
feel so alone anymore.

461
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,037
I don't know how you concentrate

462
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,405
with all those sounds and
images in your head all the time.

463
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:32,876
When I'm on the datastream,

464
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:35,911
it feels like I'm connected to
something larger than myself.

465
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,681
Do you ever feel that way?

466
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:41,984
I guess that's why I joined the Academy.

467
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:44,788
To find that something.

468
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,789
I had it, and I've lost it.

469
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:49,693
I can't help thinking,

470
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:51,695
what if I have to keep
off the datastream forever

471
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:53,163
to keep this from happening again?

472
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:55,497
That is not going to happen.

473
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,671
Maybe those other students
were right to resent me.

474
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:05,475
I've spent months convincing everybody

475
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:08,009
how superior I am because
of my enhancements.

476
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,645
Without them...

477
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,214
I don't know who I am.

478
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:16,819
You said it yourself...

479
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,388
the datastream can only get you so far.

480
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:22,624
You've still had to work hard
to succeed at this Academy.

481
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,260
Even without the enhancements,
you are still beautiful

482
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:27,562
and funny and brilliant and kind...

483
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,364
a true friend.

484
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:32,735
I know that should be enough.

485
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:36,571
But this hacker stole something
from me, and I can't just let it go.

486
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:38,607
None of us are.

487
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:39,740
I promise.

488
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,212
We should get to class.

489
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:54,222
I'm not sure I can
face other people today.

490
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:57,125
Not if they're still talking about...

491
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:58,860
Fine then. We'll ditch class.

492
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:00,762
No. You should go.

493
00:26:00,763 --> 00:26:02,964
And leave you alone with all this quiet?

494
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:04,333
I don't think so.

495
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:06,702
I'll be okay. You go to class.

496
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:08,537
The study group needs you.

497
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:11,506
Without me, they'll need the second
smartest student in the group.

498
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,375
I'll be okay.

499
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:17,277
I'll see you later.

500
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:20,079
Okay.

501
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:45,673
Perhaps we are approaching
this incorrectly.

502
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:49,777
If we can determine how the
interloper took control of Pilar,

503
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:52,146
that may help us identify
who is responsible.

504
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:54,732
From what I learned from
talking to Professor Baker

505
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,049
in the engineering department,

506
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,885
they could be anywhere
on the datastream.

507
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:00,569
They wouldn't even have to be
close to Pilar to mess with her.

508
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,490
Which would explain
Parallax's involvement.

509
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,025
But why choose her?

510
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:07,427
Shral thinks there might
be a personal connection.

511
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,844
But if that were the case,

512
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:10,865
wouldn't the hacker want
to watch her every moment?

513
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:12,732
At least while he's controlling her?

514
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,335
Jet was in the Black
Hole when Pilar walked in.

515
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:18,605
Jet was also in Professor Shral's
class when Pilar collapsed.

516
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:21,308
Was that the first incident?

517
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,875
No. It was in the Black Hole,

518
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,611
when she ordered another Sumi Starburst,

519
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:26,546
even though she had one
she hadn't even touched yet.

520
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,146
So who else was there?

521
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,216
I mean here.

522
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:33,186
Jet, but I am almost
positive it wasn't him.

523
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,588
There were at least a
dozen other people here.

524
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,924
But I regret to say I...
I don't recall any of them.

525
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,428
I have a plan.

526
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,663
What if we re-integrate
Pilar to the datastream again

527
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,365
and wait for the hacker
to try something.

528
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,967
Only this time, we'll be
there waiting for them.

529
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,803
It sounds dangerous, Jax.

530
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:52,404
Are you sure Pilar will want to
risk going back on the datastream?

531
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,440
There's only one way for
us to know for certain.

532
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,477
We must ask Pilar.

533
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,714
Welcome home, Jax.

534
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:04,916
Oh, no.

535
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:08,386
Pilar is gone.

536
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,357
Like "gone" gone.

537
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,425
I can't believe it.

538
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,827
She didn't even say sayonara.

539
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:19,064
I don't think she's coming back.

540
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,345
Wassup, Atria?

541
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:25,580
Why is she here?

542
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,847
Pilar's in trouble.

543
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,874
I know you're upset with
me, and I don't blame you.

544
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,008
But we really don't have time for this.

545
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,388
Pilar has left the Academy.

546
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,511
We need to locate her before something
else unfortunate happens to her.

547
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,520
I'd like to, but what can I do?

548
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,581
You can help us find
out who's responsible.

549
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:41,833
How's that?

550
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,399
We think it's someone who hangs
out with Jet and his hacker squad.

551
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,202
So if you could just get close
enough to read their minds,

552
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,369
- then maybe we...
- What?

553
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,305
- You told them?
- I had to.

554
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:51,663
Pilar needs us.

555
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:54,272
This was supposed to be between
us, Atria. It was private.

556
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,031
I didn't want you to tell
anybody. I told you that.

557
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:57,644
Please, Tommy.

558
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,888
If you can read minds after
what happened with your father,

559
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:02,157
then you're the only one
who can help us help Pilar.

560
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,620
I know you don't trust
me after I used you to get

561
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,455
what I wanted with
your father and Tierney,

562
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,457
but this isn't about me.

563
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,792
This is about our friend.

564
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,626
And she needs our help right now.

565
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:19,343
That's why I need to
take a leave of absence

566
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:21,335
from the Academy, Dr. Osborn.

567
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:23,501
Well, frankly, I thought you
had a much brighter future

568
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:25,171
ahead of you here.

569
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:27,073
That you might be able to
make command track eventually,

570
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:29,508
or there could even be a
role for you in the C.I.S.

571
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,144
Apparently, I was mistaken.

572
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:34,479
I just can't control
what's happening to me.

573
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:37,951
I need some time to
heal and re-evaluate...

574
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:39,853
I can assure you you
will have ample time

575
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:41,787
to re-evaluate your choices in life.

576
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,750
Consider yourself expelled.

577
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,326
Expelled?

578
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,029
- Uh, but I don't want to leave. I just need...
- You're excused.

579
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,165
Good luck with your future endeavors.

580
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,001
- But, sir...
- I said you're excused, Ms. Pilar.

581
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,068
Good day.

582
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:06,711
Xander?

583
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:08,647
What's wrong?

584
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:12,384
I've been expelled.

585
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,219
Surely not.

586
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:17,156
Can you... ?

587
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:19,625
Can you talk to the professor?

588
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:22,328
Ask him to reconsider.
I just need some time.

589
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,428
I understand.

590
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:29,268
You know, I saw those holo-nudes of you.

591
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,303
You did?

592
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:32,070
Hey. Don't be embarrassed.

593
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:33,571
You looked amazing.

594
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,540
It made me wonder if maybe I've been

595
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,375
chasing the wrong girl.

596
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:39,577
- What?
- Well, you're very beautiful.

597
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:41,579
You have an amazing body.

598
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,815
Maybe you and I can

599
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:46,818
spend some time together on The Pearl,

600
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,054
discuss how I can
convince Professor Osborn

601
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:51,956
to let you back into the Academy, hmm?

602
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,737
Just you and me.

603
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:56,761
What about Jax? I-I thought
you had feelings for her.

604
00:30:56,762 --> 00:30:59,330
Pretty sure there's enough
of me to go around.

605
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,666
Hey.

606
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:05,836
No, no.

607
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,515
Jax.

608
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:22,485
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

609
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,690
You won't believe what's been happening.

610
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,726
What is it? What's happening?

611
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,728
I went to your uncle for help,

612
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:33,063
- and he wants me to leave school.
- What?

613
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:35,198
- And then Xander.
- What about Xander?

614
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,467
Oh, it doesn't matter.

615
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,335
I'm just glad you're here.

616
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:40,516
Cool. Well, I'm about to go
to the Black Hole

617
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:41,581
with Ralen for some drinks.

618
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:42,772
Do you wanna come?

619
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:43,805
No, I...

620
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:46,776
Oh, I think I did something really dumb.

621
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:50,213
Yeah. Walking into the Black
Hole naked was pretty stupid.

622
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:51,247
What?

623
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,150
You know that wasn't me.

624
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:56,786
Come on, Pilar. We all
know what really happened.

625
00:31:56,787 --> 00:31:58,686
You had too much to drink, got wasted,

626
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:00,466
it's all very walk of shame-y.

627
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,558
What are you talking about? I...

628
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,893
I thought you were my friend.
How can you say that?

629
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:09,699
You're apparently confused.
See, Atria's my friend.

630
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,268
You're just my roommate.

631
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,937
You said that we were more than that.

632
00:32:13,938 --> 00:32:15,939
I didn't want to be the
one to tell you this,

633
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,123
but I have some friends
going to college on Europa,

634
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:20,558
and they've all seen your holo-nude.

635
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:23,478
They can't believe that
you're my roommate.

636
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,746
You're kind of a C-list celebrity now.

637
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:27,982
I gotta go, Jax.

638
00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:31,485
Bye, Pilar.

639
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:56,777
What do you think you're doing?

640
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,846
Oh, my God.

641
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:01,783
Ralen!

642
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,852
I think I'm going crazy.

643
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,218
I was about to jump.

644
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:08,757
I understand.

645
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:10,157
Would you like me to push you?

646
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:20,368
Don't worry, Jet.

647
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,703
We're not here to ask you any
more questions about Pilar.

648
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:27,541
Good. 'Cause you know I
wouldn't tell you nothing anyway.

649
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,076
Neither would my friends

650
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:32,513
because we don't know
nothing, right, guys?

651
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:33,580
Of course.

652
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,205
Anyways, we found out who's responsible

653
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,007
and we just thought
you might want to know.

654
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,256
We need to go.

655
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:45,792
Now.

656
00:33:50,465 --> 00:33:52,699
Did you just tell me to jump?

657
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:55,535
Why not?

658
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,205
What do you really have to live for?

659
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:02,441
Unless you want to come
back to Zatar with me.

660
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:06,679
My father might have special use
for a person with your abilities.

661
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,746
What use?

662
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,382
Don't be naive.

663
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,552
You know why I'm really here.

664
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,555
You know who my father is.

665
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,058
You will be a...

666
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:24,130
What did they call them
during your Cold War,

667
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:28,266
a "useful idiot" in the battle to come.

668
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:33,505
I would never betray the Confederacy.

669
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:35,741
Why?

670
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,043
It has already betrayed you.

671
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,050
You found out something, did you not?

672
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:45,142
I did.

673
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:47,186
Except for Jet, they all
know about the back door.

674
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,787
But only one of them was smart
enough to figure out how to use it.

675
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,058
Who? Who knew?

676
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:54,892
Locate Sarika Larson.

677
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:05,844
Go on.

678
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:07,978
Don't stop now.

679
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,317
Jump!

680
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,350
Pilar.

681
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:16,254
What are you doing?

682
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:17,789
I'm going to jump.

683
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:20,592
Isn't that what you want?

684
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,227
You'll all be happier when I'm gone.

685
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,395
No.

686
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:24,430
Of course not.

687
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:26,298
You said I was lying.

688
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:28,066
That I made it all up.

689
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,834
That wasn't me, Pilar.

690
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,235
You're in a simulation.

691
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:34,138
None of this is real,

692
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,917
but if you jump, your
brain could think it is,

693
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,875
and you could get seriously hurt.

694
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:40,076
You need to step down, now!

695
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:42,079
Wha... ?

696
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,513
What are you talking about?

697
00:35:45,183 --> 00:35:47,251
This can't be another trick, can it?

698
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:48,653
It is,

699
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:51,422
but I'm not the one playing it on you.

700
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:53,782
You're in the VR Simulator at school.

701
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:56,393
After I left you, you must have
logged back onto the datastream

702
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:59,163
and got hacked again.
None of this is real.

703
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,632
No, no, no... She... She's lying.

704
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,400
Do it. Jump.

705
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:05,302
You're broken.

706
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:07,637
Your friends don't believe you.

707
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:10,474
You're worthless. Weak.

708
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:12,843
And deserve everything
that's coming to you.

709
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:14,877
That's not Ralen. It's Sarika.

710
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,546
Who's Sarika?

711
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:22,219
How do you not know who Sarika is!

712
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,387
From Shral's class.

713
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:24,621
She's the one who hacked you.

714
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:26,390
She's the one who lured you here.

715
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:29,026
She's jealous of you, and
she wanted to hurt you.

716
00:36:29,027 --> 00:36:31,095
But you are so much stronger than this.

717
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:34,064
You have always been there
for me when I needed you.

718
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,931
Let me be there for you now.

719
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:47,377
VR program terminated.

720
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:00,657
That must have felt good.

721
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:03,993
You have no idea.

722
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,737
Uh, let me get you another one, Atria.

723
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,203
How did you know I... ?

724
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,978
Why does it have to be like this?

725
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,647
I thought after everything...

726
00:37:24,648 --> 00:37:26,214
I did it for Pilar, Jax.

727
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:28,050
Not for you.

728
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,084
That's what real friends
do for each other.

729
00:37:32,055 --> 00:37:33,120
I understand.

730
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:37,025
I have to go. Catch you later, Atria.

731
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:39,060
Bye, Thomas.

732
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:54,075
What in the worlds?

733
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:07,989
Ms. Pilar. Just who I was looking for.

734
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:11,093
I... I didn't forget
an assignment, did I?

735
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,184
Not at all.

736
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:14,696
I have news to share that I
thought you'd all like to hear.

737
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:17,632
By unanimous vote of the
disciplinary committee,

738
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:20,367
Sarika Larson has been
expelled from the Academy.

739
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:24,071
And furthermore, on my recommendation,

740
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:25,966
the civilian authorities
have been alerted

741
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:27,631
to pursue assault charges against her.

742
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,412
I can't thank you enough
for your help, sir.

743
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:36,482
Would you like to join us, professor?

744
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,524
Don't mind if I do.

745
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,395
Yeah.

746
00:38:58,348 --> 00:39:00,306
I'm sure you'll be pleased
to hear you received

747
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:03,877
a perfect score on your
Interstellar Protocol midterm.

748
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:07,514
An impressive feat, considering you
were under the weather at the time.

749
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:10,250
And you weren't even back
on the datastream yet.

750
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:12,753
That was 100 percent Delaney Pilar.

751
00:39:13,788 --> 00:39:15,355
That's wonderful!

752
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:16,421
Yay you!

753
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,997
The real congratulations
belongs to you guys.

754
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,734
You never gave up on me,

755
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:30,370
even after I gave up on myself.

756
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,436
Aww.

757
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:38,877
Ms. Larson?

758
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:41,941
Do I know you?

759
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:43,409
Regan Fried.

760
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:48,587
That was a most
impressive piece of coding.

761
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,723
What do you mean?

762
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,124
Let me be frank.

763
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,026
We gave the information
about the back door flaw

764
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:56,162
to a select number of candidates.

765
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:59,199
You're the only one who
exploited it successfully.

766
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,933
How do you know about that?

767
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,308
We created it.

768
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:05,070
The Parallax Corporation is always
looking for creative thinkers

769
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,305
like yourself.

770
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:08,073
Would you be interested in a job?

771
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:11,343
Only if I can get back at Delaney Pilar

772
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:14,745
and her friends who
ruined my entire life.

773
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:19,584
I'm sure we can accommodate any
outside interests you may have.

774
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,121
Then you have yourself
a deal, Ms. Fried.

775
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:26,524
Apparently, we do understand
each other after all.

776
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,997
Professor Shral, I didn't realize
he was expecting you.

777
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:34,333
Most certainly he is not.

778
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,334
- Right, I'll just tell him...
- Don't even bother.

779
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,776
Oh, Martin, what can I... ?

780
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,177
You knew.

781
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,347
Parallax was using that
girl to hack Delaney Pilar.

782
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,183
Excuse me.

783
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:57,087
You wanted to use the roommate
to spy on Ms. Zhou for you,

784
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,024
but what you didn't expect

785
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:02,650
was that she was unreliable
and had her own agenda.

786
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,762
I do not know why you would think that.

787
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,200
I do not work with Parallax, and
I certainly would never condone

788
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,069
the physical or emotional
abuse of one of our students.

789
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,139
But...

790
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,441
if somebody is attempting
to observe Pandora,

791
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,310
we need to find out
who they are and why.

792
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,413
How long do you intend to keep her
in the dark about who she really is?

793
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,615
Until I know the threat she
poses has been neutralized

794
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,549
and where the girl's
allegiances truly lie.

795
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,386
You're playing with fire, Donovan.

796
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,659
If you're not careful,
you're going to burn.

797
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,494
No, Martin.

798
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,697
If we don't put out
this fire, we all burn.
