Due to injuries that I sustained
at the Battle of Voyek 4,

00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,697
I was relieved of my post

About four days later,

29
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:08,707
the<i> Sea Hawk</i> intercepted
a Zatarian armada

30
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,251
which had breached our
interstellar defense perimeter,

31
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,874

He stayed a course,

he knew he could not win.
