1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:01,767
<i>Previously, on</i> Pandora.

2
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,200
You're not Professor Osborn.

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,394
I'm his teaching
assistant, Xander Duvall.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,109
I feel it incumbent to make
sure you're looked after.

5
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,396
- What's your name?
- Ralen.

6
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,662
I'm Jax. This is Greg,
Thomas and Atria.

7
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:19,248
How did you convince your master

8
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:20,567
to let you go to the academy?

9
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:24,130
Adari masters aren't known for
emancipating their clones.

10
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:25,409
I killed him.

11
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,456
I've had to call in
more than a few favors

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,584
to cover for the fact
that you stole a ship.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,162
I accompanied the students
home on the<i> Earhart.</i>

14
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:36,954
<i>Tereshkova</i> will leave New
Portland in 36 hours

15
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,746
and return the specimen to Earth.

16
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,777
You going to eat those
or stare at them 29/7?

17
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:51,633
It's 24/7. You're on Earth now, Jax.

18
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,459
I do not understand.

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,636
They don't appear to provide
any nutritional benefit

20
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:58,425
from my analysis of the ingredients.

21
00:00:58,587 --> 00:01:00,761
It's not about the nutritional value.

22
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:02,250
It's about the yummy.

23
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,835
Perhaps you heard the old Earth
expression, "When in Rome."

24
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,626
I have not.

25
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,132
Just eat them, because if you
don't, I definitely will.

26
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,900
I second the mouthful.

27
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,124
They do have a pleasing taste.

28
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,921
See? What did I tell you?

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,015
What's going on?

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,149
Is everything okay?

31
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,349
They're calling us in.

32
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:53,077
What is it?

33
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:54,491
What's happened, Jax?

34
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:57,169
The<i> Tereshkova.</i> She's gone.

35
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:59,174
What do you mean, gone?

36
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:05,380
Destroyed.

37
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:20,440
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

38
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:25,738
So, what's the deal
with the cyber-tech?

39
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,390
I've had them since I was six
years and four months old.

40
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,916
Your parents must have been loaded

41
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,365
to afford that kind of pricey hardware.

42
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,815
We got by.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,375
You're originally from Earth, right?

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,691
My grandparents settled on
Euripides after the migration.

45
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:42,399
How much of that cyber-wear
do you have under there?

46
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:45,488
I've heard about subdermal
nanite enhancements

47
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,964
that allow you to pleasure
your partner with...

48
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:49,370
Tell you what.

49
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,459
All this small talk isn't
really working for me.

50
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,386
And, honestly, you looked a lot hotter

51
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,215
in your profile holo.

52
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,977
Have a nice day.

53
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:01,465
Loser.

54
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,055
Who's a loser?

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,475
Not you if that's what you're
worried about, roomie.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,960
I wasn't.

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,794
Did you hear the news?

58
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,326
I was on a date. So lame. What's up?

59
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,539
The<i> Tereshkova</i> was destroyed returning
to Earth from New Portland.

60
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:15,856
How?

61
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,737
I'm still trying to find
out more information.

62
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,620
Apparently it blew up
near the asteroid belt.

63
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:22,231
There was a crew of over
150 people on that ship.

64
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:23,867
That's awful.

65
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,980
Did you know anyone onboard?
You seem really shook up.

66
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:30,306
Just hits close to home, I guess.

67
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:33,941
Is there something
you're not telling me?

68
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,605
Do you think you can
log on the datastream

69
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,071
and just see what you can sleuth.

70
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,768
Sure.

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,393
Where are you going?

72
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:44,745
I'm late for a game with
Greg, Atria and Thomas,

73
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,242
I promised I'd be their fourth.

74
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,497
Volleyball, huh?

75
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:50,542
You never cared about v-ball
until Greg asked you to play.

76
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:53,904
I thought you weren't at
the academy to meet boys.

77
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:54,946
I'm not.

78
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,857
I lost the two most important
people in my life.

79
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,704
I'm not looking to care
about anyone else.

80
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,032
Can you just please let me
know what you find out?

81
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,389
Yeah.

82
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:09,094
Yeah!

83
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,785
Yeah!

84
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,834
Mind's not on the game, is it?

85
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,101
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,610
I can't stop thinking
about all those people

87
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,302
who perished on the<i> Tereshkova.</i>

88
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:26,493
And you're wondering if it
had anything to do with us.

89
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:27,976
Okay, Jax, it didn't.

90
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,403
An EarthCom battle cruiser
is one of the most

91
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,135
sophisticated pieces of
machinery in the universe.

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,433
There are a million things
that can possibly go wrong.

93
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,298
How about I help you get
your mind off all this,

94
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,175
otherwise you're going
to drive yourself crazy.

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,285
What are you doing tonight?

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,162
I thought you had your
med rounds on campus.

97
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:43,642
Yeah, you're right.

98
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:45,441
What are you doing tomorrow night?

99
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,941
I don't know.

100
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:48,307
You tell me.

101
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:50,062
I'll let you know.

102
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,096
You want to hit the showers?

103
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:55,293
- Oh!
- Not with you.

104
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:58,132
Yeah, that-that's not...

105
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:01,128
I-I didn't mean it like that.

106
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,404
Bye.

107
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:20,896
_

108
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:29,390
I am not going to let a
murderer speak on campus.

109
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:31,649
If you think your Seeker can come here

110
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:34,956
and there won't be consequences,
you can think again.

111
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,340
He's evil.

112
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:41,202
A man who preaches nothing
but vile and depraved hate

113
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:43,180
under the guise of religion.

114
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:47,830
On Adar, clones aren't
servants, they're slaves.

115
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,894
I spent my whole life
trying to escape that life.

116
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,785
To come here, to the
academy and to Earth.

117
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,082
And now you're just going to let

118
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:58,059
this serpent-tongued
Mephistopheles speak on campus?

119
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:00,577
Atria, I understand how you feel.

120
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:03,435
But this institution
is based on the tenets

121
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,504
of tolerance and mutual understanding.

122
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,196
And, most importantly,

123
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,949
free speech and a sharing
of divergent ideals.

124
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,355
The Seeker's ideals are not divergent.

125
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,171
They're depraved.

126
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,996
The Adari have enslaved generations

127
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:19,525
of manufactured humans to serve them.

128
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,090
I know.

129
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,434
I was one of them.

130
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,004
Look, his speaking engagement
is not an endorsement

131
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,394
of his views by the school.

132
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,416
Seeker Hubbell was invited by
the Adari Student Council.

133
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,887
Now, our bylaws are very
clear on this point.

134
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,613
You of all people should appreciate

135
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,535
why cloning is outlawed everywhere else

136
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,972
in the Confederacy but in
the Adari territories.

137
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:42,102
It's not that I'm not
sympathetic to your position.

138
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:46,122
But we have an obligation
to be open to all voices,

139
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,243
even the ones that we object to.

140
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:51,725
Not to mention, the Adari were
a vital ally during the war.

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,624
They used clones as cannon fodder

142
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,815
and broke their own
non-aggression pact with Zatar

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,207
to join Earth.

144
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,466
With friends like that,
who needs enemies?

145
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,849
Atria, please,

146
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,957
look at the big picture.

147
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,667
If there was one person on campus

148
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,596
I thought would understand,

149
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,785
it was you, Professor.

150
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,081
I guess not.

151
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:15,489
So, what do we really know

152
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,750
about what happened to the
<i>Tereshkova,</i> Professor?

153
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,771
Not nearly as much as we should.

154
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,698
The official investigation
is already underway.

155
00:07:24,217 --> 00:07:27,127
I want you to lead up
the unofficial one.

156
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:29,001
For me.

157
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,767
What about the specimen that
we discovered on New Portland

158
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,191
that we were transporting?

159
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,944
There's no sign of it
in the debris field.

160
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,199
Someone or something

161
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,623
didn't want that creature
brought back to Earth.

162
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,332
What do you want me to do?

163
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:46,224
There's an enemy agent on campus
who was onboard the<i> Tereshkova</i>

164
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,893
48 hours before it was destroyed
under suspicious circumstances.

165
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:52,879
I suggest you begin with him.

166
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,358
You want me to spy on Ralen?

167
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:01,327
Everyone just wants to pretend
it's unicorns and rainbows

168
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:03,730
to keep the Adari happy in
case there's another war.

169
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,496
I'm sure that's not true.

170
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,489
I can't believe EarthCom would
sacrifice its values and beliefs

171
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:10,402
for political expediency.

172
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,761
I am considerably younger than you,

173
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:15,153
having only been manufactured
less than a decade ago,

174
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,708
but I'm not nearly as naive, Jax.

175
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:22,706
You're absolutely right, Atria.

176
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,845
I can't change what
happened to the<i> Tereshkova.</i>

177
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,521
But I can make a difference here.

178
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,681
I want you to know you're not alone.

179
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,406
If Seeker Hubbell has a right to speak,

180
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,136
then we have a right to have
our voices heard as well.

181
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,123
Very loudly.

182
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:38,462
Go back to Adar!

183
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:40,198
Go back to Adar!

184
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:42,081
And the maker of all things

185
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,826
looked upon our planet,

186
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,787
and beheld it was corrupt.

187
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:49,133
And he brought great suffering
to the people of Earth.

188
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:52,560
But then, praise be.

189
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,353
He offered us a pathway to the stars

190
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,181
to find a new home.

191
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:00,449
We embarked unto the
stars in our own arks

192
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,758
to new worlds

193
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,992
for those who heard his word.

194
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:08,974
And I, as his instrument...

195
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:13,495
Your hate has no place here, Seeker!

196
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,664
I preach only his
divine love, my child.

197
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,413
You enslave an entire
race and call it love?

198
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,905
Hypocritical much?

199
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,763
How can we enslave those
who have no souls?

200
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,449
He has provided them in his grace

201
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:31,290
to serve only us and his word.

202
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,918
You've got quite the imagination,

203
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:35,215
I'll give you that.

204
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,852
Go back to Adar!

205
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:40,793
Go back to Adar! Go back to Adar!

206
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,556
Go back to Adar!

207
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:46,380
Go back to Adar! Go back to Adar!

208
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,316
Go back to Adar!

209
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:52,330
Go back to Adar! Go back to Adar!

210
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:34,208
You all right?

211
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,976
Lights.

212
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,610
Three?

213
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:44,680
It is good to see you again, Nine.

214
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,358
Why do you tremble at my touch?

215
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,065
If the Seeker were to know I was here,

216
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,910
- I would be put to death.
- He won't know.

217
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:55,868
And you can stay here with
me as long as you wish.

218
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,512
You don't have to go back to Adar.

219
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:00,037
- I must.
- No, that's what they tell you.

220
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:02,110
Don't believe it.

221
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,864
Look at me.

222
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:07,776
For the first time in
my life, I'm happy.

223
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,403
I found a place where I fit in

224
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:13,055
and where I'm appreciated
for who and what I am.

225
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,892
You do not understand.

226
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,081
I must go back,

227
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:19,418
because I'm part of the resistance

228
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:22,697
and I need to return to save our
sisters and brothers on Adar.

229
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:25,340
And I need your help.

230
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,253
I need your help.

231
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:30,369
With your contacts,

232
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,885
you can help rally the resistance

233
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,851
to sabotage the cloning factories

234
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,285
and inspire a revolution
against our Adari masters.

235
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,857
If we do it,

236
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,549
we'll be on our own.

237
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:44,062
EarthCom will not help.

238
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,162
They won't risk alienating the Adari

239
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:48,864
as long as they believe the
Zatarian threat remains.

240
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,605
Then you must go back to Adar yourself.

241
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,351
It's the only way.

242
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,745
You have to hide me.

243
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,497
If they find me here...

244
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,105
Just getting dressed!

245
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:06,441
Be out in a minute!

246
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,690
Hold your Zatarian equines!

247
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,293
I'm so sorry about what happened today.

248
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,289
That was so messed up. Is
there anything I can...?

249
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,399
Is there anything I can do?

250
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,316
There is nothing. Thank you.

251
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:26,959
Do you want to go for a drink, maybe?

252
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,315
Not at this time.

253
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:33,516
Well, if there's anything you need,

254
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,585
anything at all, just...

255
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,333
Just let me know.

256
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,280
You know we're all here for you, Atria.

257
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,397
I'm here for you.

258
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,142
I understand.

259
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,494
Well, that wasn't very convincing.

260
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:11,843
We'll have to work on that.

261
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,811
The Adari are so repugnant.

262
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,624
As if we should be
eternally grateful to them

263
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,069
for helping us during the war.

264
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,046
I know I'm not.

265
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,780
Yeah, I don't know if teaching
you sarcasm was the best idea.

266
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:25,846
Anyway, the Adari acted

267
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,166
completely out of their own
self-interest in joining Earth

268
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,368
during the war.

269
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,323
The Adari are not all the same.

270
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,205
My people traded with
them during the war

271
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,964
before they betrayed our alliance.

272
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:37,313
You assume they all believe
in the word of the Seeker.

273
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:40,049
I can promise you they do not.

274
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,708
You seem to know a lot about them.

275
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:45,314
I became acquainted
with many of the Adari

276
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,198
during our short-lived alliance.

277
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,224
Some I would even consider friends.

278
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,939
Don't tell me you approve of
them using clones as slaves?

279
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,384
I do not.

280
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,764
My people believe all
beings are entitled

281
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,700
to determine their own destiny.

282
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:00,348
The Adari are untrustworthy,

283
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,566
treacherous and wrong to presume
they can speak for the creator

284
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:04,713
of all things.

285
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:07,111
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
be talking it to you.

286
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:08,657
Yeah, I imagine it's kind of awkward,

287
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,083
since you were on the losing side.

288
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,492
We did not lose the war, Jax.

289
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:15,916
We agreed to cease hostilities.

290
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,941
It's not the same thing.

291
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,487
Are you saying you took a time-out?

292
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,657
If you were not my friend,

293
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:25,078
I would feel as though I
was being interrogated.

294
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,801
Sorry.

295
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,125
What's with Purple-licious?

296
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,384
Hey, Atria.

297
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,861
Ordering some chili cheese fries?

298
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:48,470
What are chili cheese fries?

299
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,867
My loves.

300
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:05,850
It is truly blessed to be
home again this very night.

301
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:06,957
Is it not?

302
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,366
Indeed, my Seeker.

303
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,755
To be amongst our own kind

304
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,703
and away from the infidels
of the otherworlds.

305
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:16,400
I must cleanse myself of their sin.

306
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:20,429
Atria, you shall accompany me
to conduct the bathing ritual.

307
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:23,975
It is my duty and my honor, my Seeker.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,335
Come.

309
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,021
You too, Atria.

310
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,902
Cleanliness is indeed
next to godliness.

311
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:35,392
Especially in those...
hard-to-reach places.

312
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:56,442
Got a question for you, Tommy Boy.

313
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,982
You want to know if I think
Atria's been acting strangely.

314
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,595
See, you do have some
telepathic ability after all.

315
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,764
Hardly. You'd have to
be blind not to notice.

316
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,010
Exactly.

317
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,091
That's why I think it's
time we sit down with Atria

318
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,880
and find out what's really going on.

319
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,618
And what about Protocol class?

320
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,937
We'll get the notes later.

321
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,800
You are such a bad
influence on me, Jax.

322
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,018
Good afternoon, Ralen.

323
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:24,269
I am so dreadfully apologetic that

324
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,910
I have been remiss in meeting with you

325
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,769
ever since you first
arrived at the academy.

326
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:30,049
I know you are quite a
busy and important man.

327
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:32,457
Ah, but never so busy that
I should not reach out

328
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,205
to such a brave young cadet

329
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,003
who would seek to
bridge the differences

330
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,871
between our two races by coming
to Earth to study and learn.

331
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,000
<i>E pluribus unum.</i>

332
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,245
"Out of many, one."

333
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:48,160
But that is not why you invited
me here, is it, Professor?

334
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:49,676
No.

335
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,934
No, I suppose it is not.

336
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:53,997
Let us speak plainly.

337
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,484
You suspect me in the destruction

338
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:57,374
of your war vessel, do you not?

339
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,292
And if I did suspect you of
sabotaging the<i> Tereshkova,</i>

340
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:01,652
what would you say?

341
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,532
That I have nothing to hide.

342
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:06,828
Do you, Professor?

343
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,998
And what do you think, Mr. Duvall?

344
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,013
I think we can all agree
that whatever happened

345
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,602
was a terrible tragedy,
no matter the cause.

346
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,418
Most diplomatic.

347
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,452
It is truly an honor
to finally meet you.

348
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:26,341
Your reputation is, of
course, legendary on Zatar.

349
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,352
I understand you have
become quite friendly

350
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:30,314
with my niece, Jacqueline.

351
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:33,736
She is a fascinating young woman.

352
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,245
Indeed she is.

353
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,653
Will there be anything else?

354
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,856
No, not at the moment.

355
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:45,676
But I have no doubt we
will meet again soon.

356
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,471
Of that I am sure.

357
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,907
<i>Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.</i>

358
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,574
What's it mean?

359
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:08,512
It's Latin.

360
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:10,741
"The act does not make one guilty

361
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:13,035
unless the mind should be guilty."

362
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,471
What do you want me to do?

363
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:19,457
Stay very close to our
young Zatarian friend.

364
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:22,540
He's not as smart as he thinks he is.

365
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,102
Atria, we need to talk.

366
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,084
Jaxie!

367
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:37,527
Okay, Atria, I think you've had enough.

368
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:39,307
Let's get you to bed. Come on.

369
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:42,349
Tommy, why don't you say
that like you mean it?

370
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:45,043
Okay, now I know you've had enough.

371
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:47,776
- Let's go, come on, come on.
- No, no...

372
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,323
- Oh, oh, oh...
- What is going on

373
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:52,699
with you, Atria?

374
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:54,806
Does this have something
to do with Seeker Hubbell?

375
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:56,262
Pfft! Seek this.

376
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,003
Talk to us. We're worried about you.

377
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:02,459
Oh, you are just so cute.

378
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:05,319
Oh, oh! No, no, no.
That's okay, sweetie.

379
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,278
Oh, you're cute too.

380
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,646
Yeah, so I've heard.

381
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,442
Uh... we need to talk, Atria.

382
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,839
I don't want to talk. I just want to...

383
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,719
You know Thomas's abilities.

384
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,374
He's a gifted Telepath,

385
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,269
and I know you hate it
when he reads your mind.

386
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,884
But I think we're going to have
to make an exception this time

387
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:22,916
for your own sake.

388
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:24,807
You can't do that.

389
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,631
Can't do what?

390
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,926
You can't read my mind.

391
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,430
Please.

392
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,047
You know I can't...

393
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:35,265
He won't, as long as you
tell us the truth, okay?

394
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,245
What are you doing, guys?

395
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,283
You know I can't really
read minds like my pop.

396
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:43,320
I can only sense intense
feelings and emotions.

397
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:44,640
I know that and you know that.

398
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,882
Don't you find it strange
that she doesn't know that?

399
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,554
Not to mention she doesn't even know

400
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,613
what chili cheese fries are.

401
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,564
But those are your favorite.

402
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:01,600
Your dinner, my Seeker.

403
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,594
Thank you for this bountiful meal

404
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,583
which you have graced
me with this night.

405
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,337
Oh, one more thing before you go.

406
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,642
I believe you have forgotten something.

407
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,537
Pardon, my Seeker?

408
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,180
To slit my throat.

409
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,290
Isn't that why you're here?

410
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,455
To kill me,

411
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:41,369
the way you said you killed my son?

412
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,587
After you ran away,

413
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,804
I thought I'd never see you again.

414
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,839
I am a citizen of Earth.

415
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,106
You can't hurt me.

416
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:54,044
Is that what you think?

417
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,249
You are, and always shall be,
the property of the Adari.

418
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:03,850
So...

419
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,792
I only have one thing
left to say to you.

420
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,457
Welcome home...

421
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,251
Atria Nine.

422
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:20,766
She was the one who insisted
on going back to Adar.

423
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:23,351
To destroy the cloning factories.

424
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,129
She believes she can make a difference.

425
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:28,181
And you don't?

426
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,669
I do not want to be punished.

427
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:32,438
You won't. We can protect you.

428
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:35,287
We can get you sanctuary on
Earth, just like Atria Nine.

429
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:39,533
You would do that for
me after I lied to you?

430
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,628
If you help us, yeah.

431
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:47,188
Look, I was scared. I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.

432
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,024
Sorry about what?

433
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,891
I did not know what it
would be like to be free.

434
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,753
My sister gave me that gift,

435
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,124
and I rewarded her with betrayal.

436
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:00,783
The Seeker knows Atria's
on Adar, doesn't he?

437
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,278
Yes.

438
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:05,773
That was why he came to Earth.

439
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:09,212
It was all part of a plan
to lure her back home.

440
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,054
I'm so sorry.

441
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,869
What is he going to do with her?

442
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:16,193
What he does to all runaway clones.

443
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,852
The Seeker will find out
everything she knows

444
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,348
about the resistance...

445
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,890
and then he'll kill her.

446
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:38,871
It is so wonderful to have you back.

447
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,626
Your sisters were most cooperative.

448
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,788
They had no choice.

449
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:45,321
You would have punished them.

450
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:48,325
I like to think it's because
they're happy in my service.

451
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,052
You were happy for a time as well.

452
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:55,614
But then you corrupted my son
with your heretical ideas.

453
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:58,624
Lenar did not need me to
know right from wrong.

454
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,173
He knew it was sick

455
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:03,733
to keep manufactured humans as slaves.

456
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,778
Believe what you wish,

457
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,243
it does not matter.

458
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:10,431
I only have one more question for you.

459
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,730
I'll tell you nothing.

460
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,854
You'll kill me either way.

461
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,884
That's true.

462
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,381
But there are many ways to die.

463
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,646
Some less painful than others.

464
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,876
I'm not the scared child
you knew when I left Adar.

465
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,343
I no longer fear you.

466
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:37,457
You should.

467
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:41,421
Perhaps you need a reminder.

468
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,142
The most important role

469
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,441
for all clones is to be
obedient to their master.

470
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:51,904
A lesson you seem to have forgotten.

471
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:02,114
It is his will.

472
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:08,183
Look, I can appeal to the
Adari Embassy on Earth

473
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,208
by lodging a formal complaint.

474
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,312
But they consider clones property,

475
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:14,491
and are unlikely to act.

476
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:18,828
You're talking politics.
I'm talking a human life.

477
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:20,133
Your student.

478
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,796
She looks up to you, you know.

479
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:24,669
Your idealism and your empathy.

480
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,950
You're been such an
inspiration to her and to me.

481
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:32,243
How can you just turn
your back on her now?

482
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,115
I'm sorry, Jax.

483
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,383
I really got to go.

484
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,846
You know, I would expect
this from my uncle.

485
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,776
Not from you.

486
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,053
I guess humankind hasn't
come as far as we thought.

487
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,431
Jax, what is wrong?

488
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,653
Atria. She went to Adar alone.

489
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,376
I think if something's not done
they're going to execute her.

490
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:05,520
What is EarthCom going to do about it?

491
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:07,937
Nothing.

492
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:10,673
What are you going to do about it?

493
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:12,940
Nothing. I have to go. I'm sorry.

494
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:15,212
I find that hard to believe.

495
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,956
I can't involve you in this, Ralen.

496
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,794
You are going to Adar, are you not?

497
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:24,587
What do you think you can
accomplish there by yourself?

498
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,696
Atria's my friend.

499
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:30,062
How could I live with myself
if something happened to her?

500
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:58,920
Hey, I know you.

501
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,860
You're friends with the purple girl.

502
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:01,907
Yeah.

503
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,446
Listen, Deck Sergeant, we are
really on the clock here.

504
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:06,308
I need to rent the<i> Earhart</i>
out for training.

505
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,193
Freshman are not
approved for flight time

506
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,183
without the approval of an instructor.

507
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,070
Not to mention, I don't believe you.

508
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:14,998
Fool me once, shame on you.

509
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,923
Fool me twice, shame on... you...

510
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:18,019
I'm going to fail my class

511
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,931
if I don't get some
more hours in orbit.

512
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:22,149
Well, that is what simulators are for.

513
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:24,310
There's got to be something
we can do to persuade you.

514
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,168
Look, I got in a lot of trouble
the last time you stole a ship,

515
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:28,992
so I can't help you, I'm afraid.

516
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:32,399
Without a teacher's consent,
you are staying grounded.

517
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,230
But they have a teacher's consent.

518
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:36,333
Oh, Professor Pevney.

519
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:37,614
Well, my apologies.

520
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,012
They didn't tell me
this was for your class

521
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:41,647
and they had your authorization.

522
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:43,793
Yes, well, they do now, Deck Sergeant.

523
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:45,645
Of course. Powering up the<i> Earhart.</i>

524
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,274
Is there anything else?

525
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,336
You've eaten?

526
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,186
Yes. Why?

527
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,715
- Go have dessert.
- Oh, I'm not...

528
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:56,737
Getting dessert, sir.

529
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,915
Why?

530
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,756
You know why.

531
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,858
You're with the Adari
resistance, aren't you?

532
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:08,220
You'll need this.

533
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:09,405
What is it?

534
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,836
Insurance.

535
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,384
And just remember,

536
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:15,468
Adar is still the only
planet in the Confederacy

537
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:17,026
that has the death penalty.

538
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,001
That's a cheery thought.

539
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:20,511
Good luck.

540
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:23,293
Atria is lucky to have
friends like you.

541
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,658
So, what's the plan?

542
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,732
I thought you had one.

543
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:40,531
When I agreed to come along,

544
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,789
I assumed you both knew
what you were doing.

545
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:45,295
- Hmm.
- So, do you think it's time

546
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,949
to open Professor Pevney's gift basket?

547
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:48,384
What do you think it is?

548
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:51,409
I hope it's snacks. I'm starving.

549
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,843
Definitely not snacks.

550
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,364
My son...

551
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:01,472
your former master.

552
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,821
You know your son is dead.

553
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:07,002
I know that's what he
wants me to believe.

554
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:08,730
I know he emancipated you

555
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:10,958
so you'd feel compelled to protect him,

556
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,199
but I need you to tell
me the truth now.

557
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:17,089
And why would I do that?
Out of compassion?

558
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:20,579
I have no soul, remember?

559
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,195
I love him.

560
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,769
Perhaps it's not too late
to make amends to him.

561
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:28,608
And to you.

562
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:38,821
Welcome to Adar.

563
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:40,298
That was rough.

564
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:42,267
I thought you were some
kind of ace pilot.

565
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,009
Sorry about that.

566
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:47,074
I've never landed a ship this
big on an alien planet before.

567
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,966
Just ran Sims.

568
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:52,205
Atria's going to be okay.

569
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,090
We're going to get her out of here.

570
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,771
The Seeker's compound
and cloning factory

571
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:59,189
are two klicks east of us.

572
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:01,224
I'm headed to the
compound to find Atria.

573
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,638
You and Pilar should stay here
in case we need to get out fast.

574
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,596
No can do. You'll need a diversion.

575
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,009
What do you say I give you one?

576
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,704
What kind of diversion?

577
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,367
A big one.

578
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:16,825
Hi, my name is Dr. Regina Lampert

579
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,212
from EarthCom Medical.

580
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:21,161
I'm here to observe the
Adari cloning procedures.

581
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,908
We don't have your visitation
authorized, Dr. Lampert.

582
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,636
Are you sure? Because I
was personally invited

583
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:29,245
by Seeker Hubbell himself.

584
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:31,282
Um, right, Pilar?

585
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:33,530
Give me a sec, here.

586
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,346
You heard about Atria Nine?

587
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:43,675
She's being put to death
for disobedience.

588
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:47,169
Her husk is scheduled

589
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:49,925
to undergo DNA reconstitution

590
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,346
in the tissue... v-vats.

591
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:55,696
What the hell are you talking about?

592
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:57,427
I have no clue.

593
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:58,736
Excuse me?

594
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,484
Hmm?

595
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,904
Oh.

596
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:08,394
You are cleared for access.

597
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:10,341
You may proceed.

598
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:16,395
Excuse me.

599
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:50,442
Can I get some help here?

600
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,549
I'm a doctor, not a locksmith.

601
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:15,604
Are you okay, Jax?

602
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:18,479
I think so.

603
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:23,369
I'm in, Pilar.

604
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:24,641
Planting the charges now.

605
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,794
Great. Now hurry up
before someone sees you.

606
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:29,804
Or me.

607
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:09,640
Atria?

608
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:14,503
Oh, this can't be good.

609
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,074
Thomas! Aah!

610
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,447
Let her go.

611
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:31,121
No! No!

612
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:53,566
What are you doing here... again?

613
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:54,886
Doing what I always do, apparently.

614
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,147
Keeping you out of trouble.

615
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:58,037
Thanks, but I had it under control.

616
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:00,311
Yeah, I can see that.

617
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:03,312
Tom's in the Seeker's compound.
He's going to need some help.

618
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,570
I guess that can be arranged.

619
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:19,792
We need a distraction.

620
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:21,581
You'll get your distraction in...

621
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:23,128
five seconds.

622
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:24,696
What happens in five seconds?

623
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:26,168
Boom happens.

624
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,510
What was that?

625
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,175
The cloning factory!

626
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,331
Come on.

627
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:44,612
Pilar, you got eyes on Thomas?

628
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,785
He's inside the compound.

629
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,631
I've located him in the
Seeker's chambers.

630
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,279
All right.

631
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:52,158
Let's go save Atria then.

632
00:33:57,834 --> 00:33:59,285
Tom's in here.

633
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,154
On my signal.

634
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:07,618
Three, two...

635
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,004
This isn't good.

636
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:19,617
The Seeker has Thomas.

637
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,484
Jax, I dispatched a drone

638
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:23,013
and have eyes on Atria and Thomas.

639
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:25,025
I'm sending you their coordinates now.

640
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,230
They're with the Seeker.

641
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,949
- Where?
- On the move.

642
00:34:27,974 --> 00:34:29,605
It appears they're
rendezvousing with a ship

643
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,090
on the perimeter of the compound.

644
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:32,588
What kind of ship?

645
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:34,701
A Zatarian ship.

646
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:50,502
Who the hell is that?

647
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,252
My former master, Lenar.

648
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,243
He's the Seeker's son.

649
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:56,082
We faked his death so
he could flee Adar

650
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:57,670
and marry the love of his life.

651
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:59,871
- A clone?
- Yes.

652
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,638
Me, technically.

653
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:02,813
You're married?

654
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,863
No, but Atria Six is.

655
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:06,591
And they're very happy.

656
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,824
Lenar is not like his father.

657
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,842
He's a good and honorable man.

658
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:13,567
What is Ralen doing here?

659
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:14,691
Mm-hmm.

660
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:16,427
He's full of surprises, isn't he?

661
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:17,986
Who's he with?

662
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:20,168
I think that's the Seeker's son.

663
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:21,773
Atria told me she killed him.

664
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:23,108
Yeah, well, apparently,

665
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:25,297
he's been miraculously resurrected.

666
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,822
You need to turn your safety off.

667
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,303
I never thought I'd see
you again, my son.

668
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,590
And I hoped I would never
see you again, Father.

669
00:35:43,326 --> 00:35:46,328
You must know how much I
prayed for this day to come.

670
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,138
What are you doing here, Lenar?

671
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:51,489
Every moment you're on Adar
puts your life in danger.

672
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:55,431
The Zatarian told me
you were in danger.

673
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,005
I couldn't let anything
happen to my sister-in-law.

674
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:06,771
What do you really
want from me, Father?

675
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:10,002
I need you to come home and
support my re-nomination

676
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:11,994
as Seeker in the Council,

677
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:14,041
and renounce your marriage
to the abomination

678
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:17,210
before it can be used by
my opponents against me.

679
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:19,414
And why would I do that?

680
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:22,633
Because I will let you
and your friends live.

681
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,285
Or would you really rather
die for real this time?

682
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,351
And what of Zatar?

683
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,355
Would you not make an
enemy of my people

684
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,599
if you killed us all today?

685
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:47,626
You made an enemy of me when
your people took in my son,

686
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:50,442
giving him asylum and sheltered
him on your home world.

687
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:53,048
Lenar asked us for sanctuary.

688
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:55,585
An offer we could not refuse.

689
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,019
Was it worth losing
the Adari as an ally

690
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:01,036
in your war against Earth to
help my son flee into exile?

691
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:04,234
We would make the same
decision again today.

692
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,567
He asked for help.

693
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,745
We were obliged to give it.

694
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:13,343
You will never understand my people.

695
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:15,892
Nor you, mine.

696
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:18,340
Be it a generation or more,

697
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:21,136
my people shall have their
vengeance against you.

698
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,242
But today, I shall have mine.

699
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,575
Ah!

700
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,517
Don't.

701
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:00,716
Why not?

702
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:04,995
Because it's his way, not yours.

703
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:21,439
The reality is nothing's
going to change on Adar.

704
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,096
After everything we did,

705
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,279
life there will still be the same.

706
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,713
Maybe, maybe not.

707
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:30,282
But just by you being free,

708
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,821
maybe your story can inspire others

709
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,549
to pick up where you left off.

710
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:37,640
Yeah, after all, Atria
Three has her own life now

711
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,986
and she's applying to enroll
at the academy next semester,

712
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:42,336
which is a start.

713
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:44,375
The Seeker said you weren't human

714
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,980
because you were made in a lab,

715
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,729
but the things that you did today,

716
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:49,489
all the sacrifices you
made to try to save

717
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:51,273
your clone brothers and sisters,

718
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:54,241
that's the most human
thing I could imagine.

719
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,305
And if history's taught us anything,

720
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,163
it's that things take time.

721
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:03,897
But if we commit and don't give up,

722
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:05,532
things will get better.

723
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,217
Eventually.

724
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,340
It's hard work.

725
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:11,900
Speaking of hard work,

726
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,896
I have a lot of homework
to catch up on.

727
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:16,721
I should go.

728
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,692
Want some help?

729
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,001
Sure.

730
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,052
Guess we'll see you later, gators.

731
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:24,943
MM-hmm.

732
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,387
Next time, will you please
tell me what you're up to

733
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:37,669
before you're going to
your life in danger again?

734
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:39,528
Why, so you can try and stop me?

735
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:40,984
No.

736
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,940
So I can go with you.

737
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:47,124
I'm just happy you're back safe, Jax.

738
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:49,935
Thank God Xander showed up when he did.

739
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,067
I have no idea how he
knew you were on Adar,

740
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:54,642
but I'm really glad he was there.

741
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,056
You know what, Greg? Can I
catch you a little later?

742
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:00,861
Why? You got a hot date?

743
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:03,163
No. There's just something
I got to take care of.

744
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:05,079
Sure.

745
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,685
Xander!

746
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:12,456
Jax, what can I do for you?

747
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,455
I've been thinking about something.

748
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,583
I hope it was battle
tactics and strategy,

749
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,625
because I've just graded your paper.

750
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,806
You can do better than a C-plus.

751
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:23,200
When you showed up to Adar, you
didn't know I was in trouble

752
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:25,779
because you were spying on me, did you?

753
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:29,337
Of course not, Jax. Why
would I spy on you?

754
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:33,390
You knew I was on Adar because
you were spying on Ralen.

755
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,596
You think he sabotaged the
<i>Tereshkova,</i> don't you?

756
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,535
That's what I thought.

757
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:50,019
I do imagine you must be quite upset.

758
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:53,178
Your young protégé destroying
a manufacturing facility

759
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:55,122
worth billions to Parallax.

760
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:57,946
Cloning is a very lucrative
business for us, you know.

761
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:00,212
Of course, had I known
of Jax's intentions,

762
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:02,579
I certainly would have
interceded on your behalf.

763
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:03,946
I don't care about that.

764
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:05,755
Parallax will make more
money from the Adari

765
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,859
on re-building their facility anyway.

766
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:10,191
So why are you here, Regan?

767
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:12,485
To tell you there's something
far more dangerous to you

768
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,040
than even my father.

769
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:15,657
And what's that?

770
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:18,172
Pandora.

771
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:20,479
Oh, that.

772
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,777
Yes, well, on that we can
most definitely agree.

773
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:27,148
Does she know what really
happened to the<i> Tereshkova?</i>

774
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,317
No.

775
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:31,277
And for the moment,

776
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:34,264
that will need to remain our secret.

777
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:36,570
You do have a lot of them,
don't you, Professor?

778
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:39,834
Just make sure you don't
keep them from my father.

779
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:43,234
We need to know everything
you know about Pandora.
