1
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,406
Be back for dinner, mommy-o.

3
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,302
Jax.

4
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,871
Hey, Jax, wait.

5
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:00,945
Sorry. Aehm.

6
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,505
Welcome to Earth.

7
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,305
You're not Professor Osborn.

8
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,224
You're perceptive, I see.

9
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:08,940
I'm his teaching
assistant, Xander Duvall.

10
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,870
I was told I'd be meeting Dr.
Osborn, so...

11
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:14,144
Yeah, he was supposed to.
He wanted to, in fact.

12
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,380
But he's very busy, so
he sent me instead.

13
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,536
You think he'd find the time

14
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,270
to meet the orphaned
niece he's never met.

15
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,935
Yeah, like I said, he's...

16
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,708
Very busy.

17
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,062
I heard you.

18
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:26,769
I'm not sure we're
completely getting off

19
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:28,377
on the right foot here, are we?

20
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,900
Well, it appears I'm not the
only one who's perceptive then.

21
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:33,116
I had a class with your mother...

22
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,424
when I was a freshman.

23
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,063
She was an inspiring teacher.

24
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:40,988
I'm sorry for your loss.

25
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,132
That's very kind of you.

26
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:49,424
I suppose we should go
get my duffels then.

27
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,703
You may just be strong
enough to carry all of them.

28
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:09,026
Interesting he chose to model
his home on the Queen Anne's.

29
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:11,877
Not what I was expecting.

30
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,144
Yeah? What were you expecting?

31
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,332
Certainly not to find my uncle
aspiring to live in the home

32
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,758
of a Bonanza King.

33
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:21,364
Even if just a very impressive replica.

34
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,406
Is that you, Mr. Duvall?

35
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:25,792
It is, Professor.

36
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:27,459
Uncle.

37
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:28,718
Jacqueline.

38
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,883
Sorry I was unable to
greet you personally,

39
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,735
but it is most agreeable
to finally meet you

40
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,438
after all these years, sadly

41
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,358
under such unfortunate circumstances.

42
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:38,977
I appreciate your help, uncle.

43
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,634
It's been a difficult few months
as I'm sure you can imagine.

44
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:44,133
I presume you've already been
briefed on your dispensation.

45
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,937
If you mean that as my
only living relative,

46
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,263
an I'm now your burden, then yes.

47
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,336
Hardly a burden, my dear.

48
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:53,501
I'm not an emotional man, but
I loved your mother dearly.

49
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,310
And to her, family was everything.

50
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,891
I feel it incumbent upon me

51
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,936
to make sure that you're looked after.

52
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,026
It's what she would have wanted.

53
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,939
Is there any news on the investigation?

54
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:05,496
None as of yet,

55
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,926
but I'll see what I can find out.

56
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,441
In the interim, you're aware I
arranged with the chancellor

57
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,012
for you to matriculate this semester

58
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,356
at the Fleet Training Academy.

59
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,441
I appreciate you
interceding on my behalf.

60
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,695
The school year started two weeks ago,

61
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,325
but based on your grades

62
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,430
you should have no problem
playing catch-up.

63
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:23,313
And if there's anything
else you need...

64
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,655
Quite right. Mr. Duvall can assist you.

65
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,469
He's one of my brightest pupils.

66
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:29,216
Please feel free to rely on him

67
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,766
for any of your immediate needs.

68
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:32,915
I certainly will, uncle.

69
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,477
Now as Mr. Duvall said,

70
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,946
the school year has indeed commenced,

71
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:38,337
and I am already quite
inundated with work,

72
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:39,593
so if you'll excuse me,

73
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:42,228
I'll see you both on
Friday for dinner here

74
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:43,491
promptly at 7:00.

75
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,089
Of course.

76
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,883
Such a warm and sociable man.

77
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,071
Great men like the professor
are often somewhat quirky.

78
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:56,956
Not the word I would've used.

79
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:01,516
Anything else I can help you with?

80
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:04,490
What do you know about my
the death of my parents?

81
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,107
Nothing.

82
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,700
I only T.A. for the professor,

83
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,103
and as you can imagine,
he's pretty tight-lipped.

84
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,764
Of course.

85
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,395
I guess I'll be seeing you around then.

86
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,764
Sooner than you might like.
I'll be seeing you in class.

87
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,669
May I assist you?

88
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,314
Is this Interstellar Protocol?

89
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,390
Stellar Cartography.

90
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,369
Wrong class. Sorry.

91
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:54,139
Protocol is more than simple etiquette.

92
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,301
It's not about manners or pleasantries.

93
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,889
It's about respecting
customs and traditions

94
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:04,439
utilizing proper diplomatic formality.

95
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,282
For instance, if I wanted to convey

96
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:08,725
my profound indignation

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,593
over the inability of a cadet to
arrive on time in my class...

98
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,961
how exactly would I do that?

99
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,968
I'm so sorry, I didn't...

100
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:24,462
To misunderstand the culture
you're communicating with

101
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,746
is one of the worst mistakes
an officer can make

102
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,140
in a first contact situation.

103
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,868
Seemingly incomprehensible acts
can often be better understood

104
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:39,693
when one examines the situation
from the opposite perspective.

105
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,914
And there are some worlds
in which failure to adhere

106
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,339
to proper protocol

107
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,010
can have the direst of consequences.

108
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,886
Consider yourself lucky
this is not one of them.

109
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:55,319
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Zhou?

110
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:07,307
Shral didn't need to
be such a scum weasel.

111
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:10,483
It's my first day.

112
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:11,925
I got lost on the way to class.

113
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,667
Are all the professors here so awful?

114
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,787
Actually, most of the
profs are pretty neat.

115
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:18,383
Except Osborn. That man is a total ass.

116
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,243
He's also my uncle.

117
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:21,422
Oops.

118
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,063
I guess I shouldn't have said anything.

119
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,086
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I agree.

120
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,597
He is a total ass.

121
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,812
I'm Jax. Nice to meet you.

122
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:30,944
Atria.

123
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,882
So where you headed now, Jax?

124
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:33,937
Back to the dorm.

125
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,648
I have a ton of assignments
to catch up on.

126
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:37,336
Well, I'm going to hang
at the Black Hole.

127
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:38,750
- Want to come with?
- Black Hole?

128
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,189
Center of gravity on campus.

129
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,059
Lounge, bar, hangout.

130
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:43,560
Place where you can unwind.

131
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:46,094
And if you ever wanted to
hear some really bad poetry,

132
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,593
it's the place to do that too.

133
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:51,089
Did I mention it's a great
place to meet hot guys also?

134
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:54,213
Not on my dance card this semester.

135
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,738
- I have other obligations.
- You say that now.

136
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:59,273
Oh, that's Tom. He's
also in Shral's class.

137
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,329
You'll like him.

138
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:02,028
He's not your average joystick jockey.

139
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,781
- Fighter pilot?
- Wannabe.

140
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,790
Hopefully, he'll wise up and
get on a command track.

141
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,365
He's way too smart to be
flying jets in space.

142
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,842
Glad you haven't got many bruises

143
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,625
from that unprovoked
attack in class today.

144
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,547
Ugh. That you can see.

145
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,110
Sumi Starburst for you, Tommy Boy.

146
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,393
Hey, Atria. The usual and...

147
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,539
and the new girl.

148
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,347
- Jax.
- Jax. What can I get you?

149
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,805
Just a shoulder to cry on.

150
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,518
That I can definitely provide.

151
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:30,510
Let me guess. Osborn.

152
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:33,178
No. Shral carved her
up and spit her out

153
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:34,730
real good this morning.

154
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:35,899
I had him last year.

155
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,448
His bark is worse than his bite.

156
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:39,735
He's a pretty decent instructor
once you get to know him.

157
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,070
- What year are you?
- Just finished my undergrad.

158
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,835
On the med track now,
looking to get onboard

159
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,061
an exploratory vessel as a CMO.

160
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,391
Ah, a doctor.

161
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,617
Well, not yet.

162
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,102
And with the way this semester's
been going, maybe never.

163
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:53,273
Well, I love the humility.

164
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:56,279
Not to mention a man who's
good with his hands.

165
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,297
So, what's your story Jax?

166
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:01,105
Oh, not much to tell, really.

167
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,873
Yeah, somehow I doubt that.

168
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,886
Her parents were killed
at New Portland.

169
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,544
Didn't you hear?

170
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,943
Yeah, I heard.

171
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,430
Everybody heard.

172
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:11,931
But just because it's on my mind

173
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,922
doesn't mean it's on my tongue.

174
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,408
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...

175
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,466
It's fine. It's not any kind of secret.

176
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,472
Old news. Really.

177
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,498
Hello.

178
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:31,078
Could I get a...?

179
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,837
Come to think of it, I think I
am going to get that drink.

180
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,920
I got this.

181
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:45,636
- Bartender.
- What can I get you?

182
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,714
He'll have a Blue
Safari, and so will I.

183
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,968
If you wake up with a massive
headache in the morning,

184
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,497
you can blame me.

185
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,747
Why are you talking to me?

186
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:56,851
Why shouldn't I?

187
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:59,606
I mean, if you'd prefer, I can
go back and hang with my...

188
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,438
I guess I can't really
call them my friends,

189
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:04,194
because I just met them, but
the group I'm hanging with.

190
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,265
Are you with the Earth
Intelligence Services?

191
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:12,003
Not very trusting of the
kindness of strangers, I see.

192
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,773
Come on.

193
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,549
Drinking alone is called alcoholism.

194
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,317
Much better to do it with a crowd.

195
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,432
Go on.

196
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:22,815
- So, what's your name?
- Ralen.

197
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,529
I'm Jax, this is Greg,
Thomas and Atria.

198
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,845
She's easy to recognize,

199
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,211
because she's the only one
who's a natural purple.

200
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:30,965
- I see.
- So...

201
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,996
you're the Zatarian
Ambassador's son, huh?

202
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,637
I have that privilege.

203
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:36,795
What made you decide to
join the Academy, Ralen?

204
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,296
Other than spying on all of you?

205
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,728
That was my attempt at humor.

206
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:50,238
It can't be easy being
the first Zatarian

207
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:52,098
to ever attend the
Academy since the war.

208
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,925
I can't imagine it's
any easier for you.

209
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,640
There's not a long history of clones

210
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,772
belonging to the Adari sect
joining the space fleet.

211
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,335
That's true, but that's because
we're considered as property

212
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,279
and our masters won't let us
pursue a formal education.

213
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,364
So how did you convince your master

214
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,001
to let you go the Academy?

215
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:11,669
Adari masters aren't known for
emancipating their clones.

216
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:14,144
I killed him.

217
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,013
Ahem. Here.

218
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,343
- Excuse me?
- I could tell

219
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,913
you desperately wanted some
chips, but didn't want to ask.

220
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,631
- Telepath?
- Part.

221
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:29,233
My mother was a captain in EarthCom.

222
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:30,629
My pops, telepathic.

223
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:31,998
In the C.I.S.?

224
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:34,218
No. Jail.

225
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,425
He got busted in Macau
for cheating at cards.

226
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,761
Wasn't the first time either.

227
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:40,052
Not what Earth Intelligence had in mind

228
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,385
- when they created Telepaths.
- Yeah.

229
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,835
Wasn't really what I had
in mind for a dad either.

230
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,120
So, what really brings you
to the Academy, Ralen?

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,037
I have always thought

232
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,746
the best way to avoid another conflict

233
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,074
between our two respective races

234
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,332
is to understand each other better.

235
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,704
That's why I prevailed upon my father

236
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,629
to have the Earth Ambassador to Zatar

237
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,229
request that my application
to the Academy be accepted.

238
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,890
So, what do you think so far, mate?

239
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,618
Earth preaches a set of
values across the galaxy

240
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:21,323
about tolerance and diversity,

241
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,888
but I have yet to see the
actions of your people

242
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:26,132
meet their high-sounding words.

243
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:30,256
Until today.

244
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,559
Tell you what.

245
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:35,036
Since we're now apparently the
paragons of human virtue,

246
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,372
allow me to offer you the
chance to join our study group.

247
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,284
You and Jax, of course.

248
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,624
Not easy to make it
at the Academy alone.

249
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,528
We're stronger together than apart.

250
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,787
I will accept your invitation.

251
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,129
We got to go, but we'll see you soon.

252
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:51,130
We're needed in space.

253
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,751
They a couple?

254
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:58,028
Not yet.

255
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:00,123
He has a girlfriend on Vega 5,

256
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,956
which won't last much longer.

257
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,091
For some reason,

258
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:06,763
147-trillion-mile-distance
relationships never work.

259
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,989
Why? You interested?

260
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,244
Nah.

261
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:13,209
Not in him.

262
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:17,865
I like Ralen. What do you think?

263
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,308
We'll see.

264
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,419
I'm having a tough time reading him.

265
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,892
Maybe he just doesn't like you
poking around inside his head.

266
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,778
I know I don't.

267
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:31,919
Zatarian attack ship closing.

268
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:34,192
Should I attempt to hail them?

269
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:37,110
They're heading towards
us and not communicating.

270
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,474
Could be trouble. Weapons hot.

271
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,956
All pulse cannons online.
Prepare to fire on my mark.

272
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,702
But Tom, we don't know
their intentions.

273
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:47,470
We do now.

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,297
Hey.

275
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,483
Let's go again.

276
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:08,921
Maybe this time a little
bit less chattering,

277
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,915
little bit more blasting, yeah?

278
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,501
Might help.

279
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:25,875
Hey, Miss Congeniality.

280
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,120
You busy downloading
from the datacore again?

281
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:30,043
Sorry to interrupt your reboot.

282
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:31,575
I wish you wouldn't call it that.

283
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,416
You know we call it meditation.

284
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,512
I met some people today.

285
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:36,160
They invited us to join
their study group.

286
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,786
I said yes for both of us.

287
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,333
Are you sure that is wise?

288
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,152
What do you know of them
and their abilities?

289
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:42,594
I know I like them.

290
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,556
Not necessarily the best criteria

291
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:46,359
to evaluate their suitability
as study partners.

292
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,480
Why do you always have
to act so superior?

293
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:50,301
Because I am superior.

294
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:53,336
It's not narcissism,
it's an empirical fact.

295
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,838
Right, well, one of them is Zatarian.

296
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:57,097
Ralen?

297
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,502
- Yeah. You know him?
- I know of him.

298
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,675
- We should be wary.
- Why?

299
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,366
Because he is Zatarian.

300
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,721
We do not know his true
motives for being here.

301
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,672
- I do.
- You do?

302
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:10,348
Yeah. He said he wants to bring
our races closer together

303
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,552
through mutual understanding.

304
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:13,933
- And you believe him?
- Why shouldn't I?

305
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,072
- Because he is Zatarian.
- You said that already.

306
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,389
You have to understand,

307
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:22,568
the Zatarian are violent and warlike.

308
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:24,846
They're treacherous and
wary of other species.

309
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,704
They're victims of their
basest instincts.

310
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,921
I could say the same thing
about human beings,

311
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,103
and we struggle to
overcome them every day.

312
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:37,369
So you're saying you're not
going to be in the study group?

313
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,691
I thought you believed in
respect for all races.

314
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:42,746
Isn't it reasonable to evaluate
this Zatarian on his own merits

315
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:44,424
and give him a chance
before convicting him

316
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,306
of your own personal prejudice?

317
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,574
I will participate in your study group.

318
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,769
What?

319
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,058
I said I'll participate
in your study group.

320
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.

321
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:57,323
- Now I got to go.
- Where are you going?

322
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:59,638
Dinner at my uncle's.
Should be lots of fun.

323
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,452
Tons of laughs You'd love it.

324
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:02,550
Want to come?

325
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:03,594
No.

326
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,703
You clean up well.

327
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:19,995
I could say the same about you.

328
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,143
How was your first day of school?

329
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:23,496
I'd prefer not to think about it.

330
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:25,823
I mean, I got raked over the
coals by my prof today.

331
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:27,867
- Shral?
- Yeah, Shral.

332
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:29,963
He was a real ass, if
you know what I mean.

333
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:32,107
No, I mean, hello, Professor Shral.

334
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:33,460
Mr. Duvall.

335
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,272
Pleasure to see you, as always.

336
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,222
Ah, Miss Zhou.

337
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:41,254
Mm.

338
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,425
I thought I recognized that voice.

339
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:45,524
A word of advice.

340
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:47,613
A good officer needs to get along

341
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:50,207
with all kind of personality.

342
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:53,911
Those you like, those you don't.

343
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:57,232
Other species you can't
even begin to understand.

344
00:17:57,746 --> 00:18:00,116
You'd be wise to remember that.

345
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:02,817
Enjoy the party.

346
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:14,549
You're taking perverse glee in
my predicament, aren't you?

347
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:15,905
Never.

348
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,925
You know, I admire a man
who still has books.

349
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,026
The touch and the feel of paper.

350
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,163
You know, it's tangible.

351
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,420
And as much as we've
gained as a civilization,

352
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:41,103
I feel we've lost to
life in our digital age.

353
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:45,200
Ellison Pevney, Miss Zhou.

354
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:48,220
I knew your parents well.

355
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,618
My condolences.

356
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:52,011
Professor Pevney, it is an honor, sir.

357
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,627
The pleasure is all mine.

358
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,482
And I am delighted

359
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,301
that you will be in my Earth
History class this semester.

360
00:18:58,326 --> 00:18:59,798
As am I.

361
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,622
Do you mind me asking,

362
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,391
is there any news of your parents?

363
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,564
I keep asking the same
thing repeatedly,

364
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,727
and no one seems to know anything.

365
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:12,417
Well, surely your uncle can help.

366
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:14,444
Help with what?

367
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:17,202
Donovan. We were just
talking about you.

368
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:20,009
We were talking about the investigation

369
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,242
into the attack on New Portland.

370
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:25,382
I'm afraid I have no news to report.

371
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,201
I've just learned the
investigation has been closed.

372
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:30,406
An entire colony was just obliterated.

373
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,500
How can they just close
the investigation?

374
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,852
I wish I had better news.

375
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:36,448
If EarthCom doesn't find
out what happened, I will.

376
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,758
You realize that's quite
impossible, of course.

377
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,693
We'll see what's impossible.

378
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,547
Anyways, you'll have to excuse me.

379
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:44,774
It's been a long week,

380
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,600
and I have a lot of
work to catch up on.

381
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:49,307
Thank you for the gracious invitation.

382
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,980
What was all that about?

383
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:01,881
She doesn't know, does she?

384
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:03,615
No.

385
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:07,445
I don't like it, Donovan. I
think you're making a mistake.

386
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:09,921
You need to tell her the truth.

387
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:15,808
For what it's worth, I'm with
Ellison on this one, Professor.

388
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:17,566
That is your right.

389
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,625
But even if you disagree
with my orders,

390
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,517
I do expect you to follow them.

391
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:32,562
I just want you to know
that you still have

392
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:33,920
my father's full support.

393
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,645
And mine, of course.

394
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:38,129
That is indeed a comfort.

395
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:41,443
By the way, I understand
you already know the girl.

396
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:42,697
Not well.

397
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:45,091
She dated my sister for awhile.

398
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,889
But you knew that already,
didn't you, Professor?

399
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,750
I may have heard something
to that effect.

400
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,666
Don't fence with me, Osborn.

401
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:54,359
My father won't always
control Parallax.

402
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,516
If he keeps harvesting the
organs of clones he grows

403
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,572
to sustain his frail body,
he may just live forever.

404
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:00,655
You should try it.

405
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,907
We'll see.

406
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:03,618
One day Humpty Dumpty may not be able

407
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:05,948
to put himself back together again.

408
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:09,627
I think it's time you run
back to lo and report.

409
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,578
Your father is not
renowned for his patience.

410
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,185
Neither am I.

411
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,444
So I advise you to tread carefully.

412
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,704
The company may be mine
sooner than you think.

413
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,690
I wonder what your sister,
Odessa, would say about that.

414
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,687
I doubt she'll be in a
position to say anything.

415
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,892
And if you don't watch
your tongue with me,

416
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,327
neither will you.

417
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,025
Forget it! Let's go!

418
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:24,599
Prior to this,

419
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,848
World War I had been mistakenly

420
00:22:26,873 --> 00:22:30,787
and over-optimistically called
"the war to end all wars."

421
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:37,974
But two decades later,

422
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:39,975
the continent would again find itself

423
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,450
on the brink of conflict
in the Second World War,

424
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,356
as you can see.

425
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,265
Enter.

426
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:59,441
You missed the study group.

427
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:03,185
I came to see if you were all right.

428
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,898
I'm fine.

429
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:08,364
Human behavior remains a
bit of an enigma to me,

430
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,918
but that was clearly a lie.

431
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,074
I guess it is.

432
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,834
I've just...

433
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,969
I've been thinking a lot
about my parents lately.

434
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:21,070
They were killed in an attack.

435
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,494
New Portland colony?

436
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,924
You heard about that?

437
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:26,579
My father is the Zatarian Ambassador.

438
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,298
There's not much in the
sector I don't know about.

439
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:31,040
Of course.

440
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:41,416
One of the reasons I
agreed to come here

441
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:44,420
was I thought I might be
able to find out more

442
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:46,111
about what happened to my parents.

443
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:47,583
And now it's been three months,

444
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:50,546
and I don't know any more today
than the day they were murdered.

445
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:53,818
And then I find out they closed
the investigation entirely.

446
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:56,644
So now, I may never find out
what really happened to them.

447
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:00,978
And no one really seems to care

448
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,254
about them or me.

449
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:06,177
I care.

450
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,996
And I'm not the only one.

451
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:12,518
We are your friends, Jax.

452
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,833
I am your friend.

453
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,730
Well, I appreciate that.

454
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:21,856
But unless you have a ship
with EM-FTL capabilities,

455
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,843
I'm not sure there's much you can do.

456
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:25,560
I do.

457
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,765
Do what?

458
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,176
I might have access to a ship

459
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,854
with light speed capabilities.

460
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:36,372
I think I may have just
found my new best friend.

461
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,783
Are you sure this is legal?

462
00:24:43,062 --> 00:24:45,912
We are students matriculated
at the Academy.

463
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:48,763
And this ship is
property of the Academy.

464
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,656
Are you saying this ship
doesn't belong to you?

465
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:54,764
Let's not split hairs,
as you humans say.

466
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:56,036
Excuse me?

467
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,161
It's an old model training vessel.

468
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,477
They won't miss it.

469
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,940
School is not back in session
for several more days.

470
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:02,980
So how do we get to it?

471
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:05,352
They're not just going to
let us fly it out of here.

472
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:07,408
I've already made arrangements.

473
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,734
Happy birthday!

474
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,651
I can understand if you don't
want to tell me how old you are,

475
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:15,495
but it can't be a day over 30.

476
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,268
Oh.

477
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:19,595
Well, it's not my birthday.

478
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,034
It's not?

479
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,980
But I have a delivery order
right here for William Rogers.

480
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm Elias Wilson.

481
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:30,772
Oh. There must be some kind of mistake.

482
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:32,876
But you're the flight chief, right?

483
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,122
I am.

484
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,541
What are you doing here?

485
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:43,596
Well, rumor has it you were
going on a little trip,

486
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:45,424
and I love to travel.

487
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,119
Look, I appreciate the sentiment,

488
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,737
but I don't think it's a good
idea if you try and tag along.

489
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,737
I don't know how long
we're going to be there,

490
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:52,891
or what we're going to find.

491
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:55,080
Well, sounds like we don't
have any more time to waste

492
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,901
talking about it then.

493
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,095
I sure wouldn't mind trying some
of this tasty-looking cake.

494
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,424
It's a long night, and I
can't leave my station.

495
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:08,686
Oh, I can't.

496
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:10,752
But I can give you something sweet,

497
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,776
because you're so nice.

498
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,885
What are you doing?

499
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,213
Did you just kiss that man?

500
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:20,057
Well, of course. It's
his birthday, kind of.

501
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:22,385
Is that true? Is it your birthday?

502
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,410
Well, no, not really.

503
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:26,315
Then why are you kissing my girlfriend?

504
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,901
I...

505
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:34,869
Nice work.

506
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,244
Thank you.

507
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:39,213
Now I'm really hungry.
That cake looked so yummy.

508
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,588
I just hope we're not making a mistake.

509
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:46,596
I mean, we could get expelled for this.

510
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,401
What have we gotten ourselves into?

511
00:26:48,426 --> 00:26:49,604
No idea.

512
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:53,205
BUT I DO KNOW REMEMBER ONE THING
MY SISTERS USED TO TELL ME:

513
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,424
Be a voice, not an echo.

514
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:58,471
You know, for years, I lived
as a slave among the Adari

515
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:01,533
because I wasn't considered
a real human being.

516
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,237
No one spoke for me.

517
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:05,028
So I'll tell you, Tom,

518
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,541
I'll never turn my back on
someone who needs my help.

519
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,002
Ever.

520
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:12,213
You're amazing, you know that?

521
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,651
Stars can't shine without darkness.

522
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:22,463
How far to planetfall?

523
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:25,494
At present speed, 16 hours, 24 minutes.

524
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,455
Okay. Anyone got anything
to pass the time?

525
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,924
I do love my classical.

526
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,033
♪ It's poetry in motion ♪

527
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:44,541
♪ She turned her tender eyes to me ♪

528
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:48,198

531
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:01,838
Scans?

532
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:04,925
I'm detecting an EarthCom vessel
in orbit around the planet.

533
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,271
Registry, ECOM-19.

534
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:09,120
It's the battle cruiser <i>Tereshkova.</i>

535
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,755
That's strange. Osborn said the
investigation had been closed.

536
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,115
Apparently not completely.

537
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:17,852
Can we get any closer
without being detected?

538
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:20,868
I can try bringing her down from
a parallel orbit on the deck

539
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:22,002
and below the ionosphere.

540
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,388
This ship is small enough it may
not read on their scanners.

541
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,008
- Do it.
- Aye, aye, cap.

542
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,066
I can also deactivate
the transponder codes,

543
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:37,760
which will make it less likely
they'll read us as well.

544
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:40,440
Yeah, but if they do, without
our transponder codes,

545
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:42,926
they may open fire thinking
we're one of the marauders

546
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:44,548
who attacked the planet.

547
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:46,288
There is that too.

548
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:49,430
Jax, I'm detecting life-forms.

549
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:51,358
I think it's time we join them.

550
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:54,220
Put her down near the colony
where she won't be seen.

551
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,256
I'm heading to the surface to
see what's really going on.

552
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,325
- Ralen, you up for a walk?
- I am.

553
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,998
Greg, stay here with the ship.

554
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:14,565
We'll let you know as
soon as we know more.

555
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,726
I didn't travel thousands
of light years

556
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,124
to let you go down there alone.

557
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:20,280
Besides, it might actually hurt
my feelings if I found out

558
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,983
you only brought me along for
my charm and good looks.

559
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,009
Well, I'd never want
to hurt your feelings.

560
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:32,178
The encampment where we
lived isn't far from here.

561
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:33,976
So, what are we looking for, exactly?

562
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,334
- A reason.
- A reason?

563
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,794
A reason for the attack.

564
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,140
And what if there wasn't one?

565
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:39,403
There's always a reason.

566
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:41,840
Seemingly incomprehensible
acts can often be understood

567
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,280
when examined from the
opposite perspective.

568
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:46,456
Or so I've been told.

569
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:59,081
- What is that?
- I don't know.

570
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:00,809
But I know what it's not.

571
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,403
The C.I.S. hasn't remotely
closed their investigation.

572
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,140
So either Professor
Osborn was misinformed...

573
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,527
Or was lying.

574
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:14,356
I'm going down there. Stay here.

575
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,008
Yeah, we're not letting you go alone.

576
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,967
This I need to do myself.

577
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:31,412
The Cronin?

578
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:33,014
They're a long way from home.

579
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,898
What do you make of that?

580
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:36,151
I do not know.

581
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:38,549
But Cronin rarely travel this
far from their mother world

582
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,341
unless they have a very good reason.

583
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:41,582
We need to go tell Jax.

584
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,165
Jax does not need or want our help.

585
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:46,005
We must be patient.

586
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,367
I wouldn't presume to understand Jax.

587
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:50,762
And you do?

588
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:54,160
Because you wish to
be intimate with her.

589
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:57,384
I only want to help her find out
what happened to her parents.

590
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,099
Of course.

591
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,191
Clearly, I misread your motives.

592
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:02,994
You got me.

593
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:04,715
Next time I hang out with her,

594
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,059
I'm taking her somewhere
romantic, like Euphoria 7.

595
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:09,703
Ah, the pleasure planet.

596
00:31:09,728 --> 00:31:11,154
So you've heard of it then.

597
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,454
Yes.

598
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:16,400
We should have annihilated
it during the war.

599
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:35,852
You shouldn't be here.

600
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,373
What the hell are you doing here?

601
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,097
I could ask you the same question.

602
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:42,264
- This was my home.
- Not anymore.

603
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:44,563
Everything I know was stolen from me.

604
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:45,762
I deserve to know why.

605
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:47,725
Look, you could get
in a lot of trouble.

606
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,452
I've had to call...

607
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:55,585
I've had to call in
more than a few favors

608
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,145
to cover for the fact
that you stole a ship.

609
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,711
And even if you don't care,
think of your friends.

610
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,514
You have to return to the Academy, now.

611
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,504
You never answered my question.

612
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,598
What are you doing here, Xander?

613
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,731
I'm here to keep you
from getting expelled.

614
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:12,067
Nice try. Try again.

615
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,060
Well, you're just going
to have to trust me.

616
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:17,644
- Why in the worlds would I?
- I wish I had a reason,

617
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,794
but sometimes you just have
to have a little faith.

618
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:22,230
Well, I'm afraid that's in
short supply these days.

619
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:30,510
- This mean anything to you?
- Should it?

620
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,750
They're images recovered from
your mother's workstation

621
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:34,344
at the dig site.

622
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,324
"The obstacle is the path."
What does that mean?

623
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,511
Why are you looking at me like that?

624
00:32:44,105 --> 00:32:46,043
Are you absolutely sure
that's what it says?

625
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:47,216
Aren't you?

626
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,207
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

627
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,239
I guess my mother must
have said something.

628
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:53,366
We've had hundreds of
xenolinguistic experts

629
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:54,722
and cryptologists,

630
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:57,207
and hundreds of thousands
of hours on the datastream

631
00:32:57,232 --> 00:32:58,824
trying to decode that image,

632
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:00,481
and none of them have
been able to crack it.

633
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:02,975
Are you absolutely sure
that's what it says?

634
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,566
Yes.

635
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,877
Your mother never showed you that.

636
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,065
Of course she did.

637
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,423
How else would I know what it says?
No. She didn't.

638
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,613
Those were the images she
was working on decoding

639
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:15,074
when the colony was attacked
and she was killed.

640
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:21,602
What's really going on here, Xander?

641
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:24,860
I can't tell you.

642
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:27,680
But I can tell you that what
your parents discovered

643
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,498
may well be a threat
to our entire galaxy.

644
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,314
I need to see what's inside this cave.

645
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:35,722
No. You need to go.

646
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,015
Not until I see it for myself.

647
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,527
We're detecting some
sort of immense power.

648
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:56,872
Energy signatures off the charts.

649
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,323
You've never been here
before, I presume?

650
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:17,388
Can't say that I have.

651
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:23,075
There's something else you should see.

652
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:31,872
Your parents never told
you about any of this?

653
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:34,529
To be honest, I always found
their work pretty dull.

654
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,322
I guess I was wrong.

655
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,715
What does it mean?

656
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,160
I don't know.

657
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:14,276
There's something on the
other side of that portal.

658
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:17,065
- The obstacle is the path.
- Stand by.

659
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,160
I need further instructions
from Earth before proceeding.

660
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:21,031
Good thing I don't.

661
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:31,011
One thing's for sure, we're
not in Kansas anymore.

662
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:33,050
What?

663
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:34,593
Never mind.

664
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,013
Any idea where we are?

665
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:39,082
I wish I knew.

666
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:40,707
Commander Duvall,

667
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:41,807
are you there?

668
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:43,045
Do you copy?

669
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,440
We're okay.

670
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:48,119
Hold your positions. Await
further instructions.

671
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:52,907
It seems to have created some
sort of stable wormhole,

672
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:55,815
between where we were and where we are.

673
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,550
Why?

674
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,832
You tell me. You opened it.

675
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,662
Dr. Slavin?

676
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:05,589
Dr. Slavin, report.

677
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,981
Report!

678
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:12,362
Something's not right.
We need to leave, now.

679
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:13,950
I'm staying. This may
have something to do

680
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:15,108
with what happened to my parents.

681
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,930
This time I'm not taking
no for an answer.

682
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:27,773
Stay down.

683
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:00,920
Jax!

684
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:11,112
You okay?

685
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:13,424
Is it dead?

686
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:15,244
Just stunned.

687
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:17,702
For now.

688
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,598
Not going to say anything, are you?

689
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:35,856
Of course not.

690
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,409
So how about I tell you who you are.

691
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,654
You're some sort of
intergalactic secret agent

692
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,368
working for military intelligence.

693
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,931
Not going to tell me if I'm
getting warmer, colder...

694
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:46,115
- If I could tell you...
- You would.

695
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,609
Got it.

696
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:49,500
And what about my uncle?

697
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:51,448
What does he have to do with this?

698
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,661
He sent my parents to New
Portland, didn't he?

699
00:37:57,264 --> 00:37:59,622
Did he know they would be attacked?

700
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:07,488
What about my friends?
What'll happen to them?

701
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:10,813
I'll accompany all of you back
to the Academy on the<i> Earhart.</i>

702
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:13,352
We'll chalk it up to some
sort of hazing prank.

703
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:16,673
There won't be any disciplinary action.

704
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:20,305
I like you, Xander.

705
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,448
Against my better judgment, I do.

706
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:25,644
But you know I am never
going to let this go.

707
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,006
I know.

708
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,983
The worst part is never
getting to say goodbye.

709
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:37,597
You never really appreciate your
parents until they're gone.

710
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,612
And I think they knew
how much I loved them.

711
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:42,080
At least, I hope so.

712
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:45,082
God, I miss them.

713
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:51,598
Good night, Xander.

714
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,710
Good night, Jax.

715
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,878
Doctor, what do you have for me?

716
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,748
I completed my analysis of its DNA.

717
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:10,549
Not only does it share
the same nucleobases

718
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:12,498
as all known terrestrial life,

719
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:14,681
its genome is practically identical

720
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:16,220
to that of Homo Sapiens.

721
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:19,859
Or at least the part of the code
actually endemic to our species.

722
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:22,371
That said, some of what would
normally be non-coding genes

723
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:25,550
in humans appears to be active.

724
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:28,926
And that's its DNA there?

725
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:31,588
Yes and no.

726
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:33,518
I don't have time for games, doctor.

727
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:35,290
No game, Agent Duvall.

728
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:37,326
It's virtually the same DNA,

729
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:38,927
but it's not from the specimen.

730
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:41,711
It's the DNA you took from the girl.

731
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:44,830
She has the same active sequences.

732
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,187
Are you saying that she's not human?

733
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,902
That's exactly what I'm saying.

734
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:23,751
_

735
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:28,313
_

736
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:31,321
_

737
00:40:32,157 --> 00:40:34,173
_

738
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:39,103
_

739
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:50,315
You're late.

740
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:57,912
I accompanied the students
home on the<i> Earhart.</i>

741
00:40:57,937 --> 00:41:00,643
The<i> Tereshkova</i> will leave
New Portland in 36 hours

742
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:03,360
and return the specimen to Earth.

743
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:05,785
I received your preliminary report.

744
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:09,549
I believe things may be worse
than we initially feared.

745
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,113
You're wrong about her.

746
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,406
I might very well be,

747
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,648
but we can't afford
to take that chance,

748
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:20,056
or Pandora could be responsible
for the death of every man,

749
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,645
woman and child in existence.

750
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,517
She's your niece. Her name is Jax.

751
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,299
Call her that. Don't use her code name.

752
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:27,008
I know you're fond of the girl.

753
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:29,934
But this Pandora is a lot
like her mythical antecedent.

754
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:32,107
She was curious too.

755
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,995
And by the time she opened her box,

756
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,211
it was too late to stop
the demons she unleashed

757
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,068
into the world.

758
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:40,990
And I assure you,

759
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:45,457
this Pandora's demons
are very, very real.
