[MARCUS] For Elliot!

718
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,673
<i>[SHUTTLE PILOT]
This is shuttle XL4.</i>

719
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,226
<i>We have cleared the planet
and will commence docking.</i>

720
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:36,465
The first portal took us
to a Zatarian outpost

721
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,616
where the fleet that we'd
been tracking is mustering.

722
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,497
The coornates from my multi-bracelet...

723
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:42,318
I am aware, Mr. Duvall.

724
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,943
What I now need is a full debrief

725
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:45,198
on portals you encountered.

726
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:47,497
How they worked and
where they took you.

727
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:49,615
We lost Jacqueline's signal
when she made the jump

728
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,992
through the first portal.

729
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:52,312
What signal?

730
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:55,699
From the nanotech you injected
into her on Euphoria 7.

731
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:58,254
You don't think you were
the only one watching.

732
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:00,105
Why do you think I gave it to you?

733
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,902
You knew that Fried would
use her to open the portal?

734
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,849
You wanted her to do it.

735
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,674
To see what was inside, yes.

736
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:08,819
Say, if that was the case,

737
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:10,246
then why didn't you just tell me

738
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,925
when you sent me to Euphoria 7?

739
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,583
You had an extremely
valuable part to play

740
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,273
in our little drama,

741
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:18,234
and I believed you would
be more convincing

742
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,513
if you didn't know every
detail of the denouement.

743
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,049
And you knew I wouldn't do it

744
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:25,194
if I knew I was serving
Jax up to Harlan Fried.

745
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,966
Well, that too.

746
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,457
[AIR HISSING]

747
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:44,995
Hey.

748
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,657
Jax.

749
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,344
Did we make it off the planet?

750
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,714
[LAUGHS]

751
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:54,081
We did.

752
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:56,844
That's good to hear.

753
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,613
And I'm glad that you're
here with me as well.

754
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,839
I need to think.

755
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:13,741
About us?

756
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,343
About a lot of things.

757
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,493
Does that mean you're not interested

758
00:39:18,518 --> 00:39:23,048
in a sentimental relationship with me?

759
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:25,178
It just means I have to think.

760
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,471
Okay?

761
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:30,427
Now, get some rest.

762
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:34,486
- Okay.
- Okay.

763
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:54,741
Will Ralen be okay?

764
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:56,420
He will.

765
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,317
And I can't thank you both enough.

766
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,161
If you hadn't gotten my
message and warned my uncle,

767
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:04,252
we would still be stranded down there.

768
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,099
What are friends for?

769
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,859
Speaking of friends, where's Thomas?

770
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:11,751
I thought he'd be with you guys.

771
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:17,587
What is it?

772
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,132
He's not still mad at me, is he?
