1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,796
<i>Previously on Pandora...</i>

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,928
My father won't always control Parallax.

3
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:07,146
If he keeps harvesting the
organs of clones he grows,

4
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,662
he may just live forever.

5
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,881
Is this what Earth used to be like?

6
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:14,076
This was way before the
Great Migration started.

7
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,609
We've all been infected.

8
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:18,921
Jax's sample is negative.
No infection detected.

9
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:20,297
There's something special about you.

10
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,889
My telepathic powers seem to be growing.

11
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,385
That's telekinesis, not telepathy.

12
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,492
The only reason you came
on this little adventure

13
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:38,218
was because I promised you
information about your parents.

14
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:40,320
You used me to get what you wanted.

15
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:41,421
Wait...

16
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:42,880
<i>Help!</i>

17
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,304
You saw something.

18
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:53,859
<i>The planet, our home, is dying.</i>

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,343
<i>We ignored the warnings.</i>

20
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,421
<i>We gave in to greed.</i>

21
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,761
<i>Now we must leave.</i>

22
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,366
<i>For future generations, we need to...</i>

23
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,453
Yeah, I'm watching her right now,

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:08,718
and I'm telling you,
it smells like running away.

25
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:09,909
That's why I'll win.

26
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:21,001
<i>Liu's opponent,</i>

27
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:23,982
<i>industrialist and tech
entrepreneur Nelson Fisk,</i>

28
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,445
<i>also spoke to us.</i>

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,824
<i>You know, it's scientifically
proved, you know?</i>

30
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:29,289
<i>She's running away from the Earth,</i>

31
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,132
<i>and we have to save the Earth.</i>

32
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,734
She's a science nerd.

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,732
They want sizzle, not steak.

34
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:37,046
Her Migration plan
will be dead on arrival

35
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,148
once I give my proposal.

36
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,921
<i>... can't just run away.</i>

37
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:44,171
<i>We can and we will make
the Earth great again.</i>

38
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,070
Yeah, if you think that's passion,

39
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:47,562
wait for the final speech.

40
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,784
Got to go. Duty calls.

41
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,593
Very important meeting.

42
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:08,602
Okay, honey, bedroom's right over there.

43
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,294
Make yourself comfortable.

44
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:13,903
You?

45
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,101
I know you, you're...

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,882
Okay, guys, guys! Get in here!

47
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,613
<i>I'm one of the great scientists.</i>

48
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:57,638
<i>Not a lot of people know that.</i>

49
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,601
<i>I'm one of the great scientists,
I'm telling you.</i>

50
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,343
<i>You know, making spaceships...</i>

51
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,625
<i>I'm trying to save the world.</i>

52
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,132
<i>I ask you, who could be against that?</i>

53
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,257
Please...

54
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,828
just let me say one thing.

55
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,692
No.

56
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,101
No!

57

58
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:31,773
Today's lesson is...

59
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,266
- Nice of you to join us.
- ... about one of the most

60
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,760
important events in history.

61
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:38,321
The Great Migration of 2047.

62
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:41,742
In 2039, we had devastated our home.

63
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:44,351
Now, it was decided our only hope

64
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:47,303
was for much of humanity
to journey to the stars

65
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,756
and wait for Mother Earth to recover.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,953
But another plan was almost presented...

67
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,536
Are you okay?

68
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,343
I just had the strangest dream.

69
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,609
In class?

70
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:58,598
It's not that boring.

71
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,333
I dreamt I killed a man.

72
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:03,631
There was a man
who was hailed as a genius,

73
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:04,871
a hero,

74
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:07,693
perhaps even our savior by some.

75
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,843
But before he could unveil his plan,

76
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:11,828
he was tragically assassinated.

77
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:15,843
His name was Nelson Fisk.

78
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:21,781
Now what's wrong?

79
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:23,373
Nelson Fisk.

80
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,165
That's him.

81
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,453
That's the man I killed.

82
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,219
Ah, Xander,

83
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,796
thank you for joining us
on such short notice.

84
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,429
I want you to meet my mentor

85
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:40,545
who first recruited me into the CIS.

86
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,881
Prescott Fleming needs
no introduction, professor.

87
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:45,000
It's an honor, sir.

88
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,031
If half of what Donovan
tells me about you is true,

89
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:49,273
the honor is entirely mine.

90
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,720
This is Prescott's better half, Maya.

91
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:57,775
Well, I know when it's time to leave.

92
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,056
Leave you to your work.

93
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:03,173
Lovely to meet you, Mr. Duvall.

94
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,525
He wouldn't tell you this,

95
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,718
but Donovan values your work greatly.

96
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,173
So don't let him convince you otherwise.

97
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:26,578
I asked Professor Osborn
to summon you here today.

98
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,039
I have questions...

99
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:29,994
and concerns.

100
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,892
Some of us at CIS

101
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:35,428
are worried about certain
emotional attachments

102
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:36,696
you may have.

103
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,641
I've been doing my job. My duty.

104
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,967
Of course you have.

105
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:43,369
And we expect you to
keep on doing your job.

106
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,619
Nothing more, nothing less.

107
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,807
You can count on me, sir.

108
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:49,602
So let me ask you,

109
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:53,516
when the Zatarian arrived at
New Portland with the girl,

110
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:57,103
why was he allowed access to
a classified CIS facility?

111
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,595
He saved my life.

112
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,301
And Jax's.

113
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,897
Well, if the Zatarians didn't know

114
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,623
about portal technology before,

115
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,258
well, you can be assured they do now.

116
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,794
Are you actually accusing me
of working with the Zatarians

117
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,291
to undermine EarthCom security?

118
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:11,197
- Well, are you?
- All right, enough.

119
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,275
There is nothing the
CIS needs to worry about

120
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,291
when it comes to Mr. Duvall's loyalties.

121
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:16,645
I'll vouch for that.

122
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,471
That is all, Xander.

123
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:19,929
You may go.

124
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:22,916
You're too hard on him.

125
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,942
Oh, do stop treating him like a son.

126
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,478
He allowed the Zatarian to
leave New Portland alive

127
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:30,125
and to board the Tereshkova.

128
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,275
Mr. Duvall is not
a cold-blooded assassin, Prescott.

129
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,814
Nobody's perfect.

130
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,274
Obviously, I share
your concerns about Ralen

131
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,133
as much as your belief that he is here

132
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:42,234
to obtain intelligence on
Pandora for the Zatarians.

133
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,165
So why are you really here, Prescott?

134
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,872
Parallax.

135
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:49,145
Harlan Fried now seems to
have inexplicable access

136
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,987
to everything we do at CIS as well.

137
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,985
Inexplicable access?

138
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:58,892
Unless there's a mole
inside the organization.

139
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,439
Precisely.

140
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:04,900
We should try one more time.

141
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,495
We'll get it. We're going to get it.

142
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,621
Just keep at it, okay?
Have another drink.

143
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,189
Ready?

144
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,395
I think you need to close your eyes.

145
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:17,204
Deep breaths.

146
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,846
Okay, that's all I've got.

147
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,992
I'm sorry, the rest is all you.

148
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,508
Just, you know, focus.

149
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:29,876
Hard.

150
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,359
Okay, maybe you're not there yet.

151
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:38,743
Sometimes it just takes a sec...

152
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:41,030
Oh, hold that thought.

153
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,623
No, literally, keep thinking it.

154
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:50,306
Oh! Oh, sorry.

155
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,867
Sorry, I think I broke
his concentration.

156
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:10,259
Oh, boy, did the temperature

157
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,517
just drop way down
to arctic cold or what?

158
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,896
More like Pluto.

159
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:14,946
Clearly, he's still upset

160
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:16,814
over what went down with his dad.

161
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,869
I thought after what
happened with Pilar,

162
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:20,046
he'd give me another chance.

163
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,218
He will, just give him time.

164
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:23,890
No, but he's right, Atria.

165
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,675
When I encouraged him to
talk to his dad and Tierney,

166
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,845
I did it for myself and not him.

167
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,117
Maybe I don't deserve
Thomas's friendship.

168
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,892
You were there for me when
I needed you the most.

169
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,251
And Pilar.

170
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:38,179
You're a good person who
suffered a horrible loss.

171
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,995
He's probably just hurt

172
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,321
that you didn't feel you
could confide in him.

173
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,273
So you said you had a problem.

174
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,093
I can't even explain it.

175
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,363
I guess I should be used to that by now.

176
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,087
Perhaps you should
tell us what's going on.

177
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,273
I had this weird dream
in class the other day,

178
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,868
and it really freaked me out.

179
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,140
I had a dream I killed someone.

180
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,181
His name was Nelson Fisk.

181
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,556
Nelson Fisk?

182
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,713
Well, he died over 150 years ago,

183
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:16,859
so I'd say you've got
a pretty great alibi.

184
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,900
You are making a humorous retort,

185
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,667
but on Zatar, we believe strongly
in the existence of past lives.

186
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,556
That is exactly what it felt like.

187
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:28,868
It was so real.

188
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:31,165
It wasn't like a dream at all.
More like a memory.

189
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,909
It's certainly possible
that's what you experienced.

190
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,427
Is there a way that Zatarians can access
these repressed memories?

191
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,653
There is a ritual

192
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:45,544
which allows us to transport
our minds to days long past.

193
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,458
But it's dangerous.

194
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,021
You can get lost there.

195
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,047
If the ritual goes wrong

196
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:52,873
or is used incorrectly,

197
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,887
it can lead to madness.

198
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:58,036
Okay, so that's a hard pass.

199
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:00,075
When can we begin?

200
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,429
<i>Welcome, Ralen.</i>

201
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:15,546
What is with all the candles?

202
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,647
We thought it would help.

203
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,632
It will not.

204
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:24,640
Although you do need to
remove all your garments.

205
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:29,133
That is, of course,
not part of the ritual.

206
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:30,949
However, it is very warm in here

207
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,317
from all these candles.

208
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,569
Is Jax supposed to...?

209
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:41,819
It tastes better than it looks.

210
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:49,863
What's that?

211
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,122
From the lady.

212
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:52,548
Should I be jealous?

213
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,843
That wasn't necessary.

214
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:05,869
You looked like you could use one.

215
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,936
You think Donovan and my husband

216
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:13,335
were too hard on you.

217
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:16,851
I've loved Prescott since I was 19,

218
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:20,098
and even now I still
have to leave the room

219
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,976
when CIS business comes up.

220
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:25,351
I've gotten really
good at graceful exits

221
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,454
over the years.

222
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:33,874
Marriage isn't easy for men
like my husband, nor Donovan.

223
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,546
He isn't married.

224
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:38,087
But he was.

225
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,093
I see he never told you.

226
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:47,091
Men like Osborn like to keep
their lives in compartments.

227
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:49,443
They never tell anyone everything.

228
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,351
But it doesn't mean
he doesn't trust you.

229
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:55,345
You just need to know that,
no matter how hard it is now,

230
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:59,561
one day, you will feel very
at home in their world.

231
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,632
If that is what you wish.

232
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,960
End of pep talk.

233
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,851
But my advice isn't free,

234
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:12,163
so why don't you buy me a drink or two?

235
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,609
Or three?

236
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:45,683
No, no, no, no.

237
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,952
No touching allowed.

238
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:22,171
Fisk is co-opting the narrative.

239
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,529
He looks strong. We look weak.

240
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,694
The people see him as
standing and fighting,

241
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,960
while we look like we're running away.

242
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:34,491
We're just trying to give Earth
a chance to recover without us.

243
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:36,844
It's the only responsible plan.

244
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:54,886
I asked you to stay behind

245
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,221
because I have a special
assignment for you.

246
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:59,738
- If you're up to it.
- Of course.

247
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:02,894
I need you to spy on
Fisk and his campaign.

248
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:04,228
There's something about his plan

249
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,964
that doesn't remotely add up.

250
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:08,166
Something is wrong with his science,

251
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,092
but I can't figure out what.

252
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,520
And right now we need an advantage.

253
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,497
- Is she supposed...?
- Shh!

254
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,606
It's always nice to meet a counterpart.

255
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:59,223
You're with the Liu
contingent, aren't you?

256
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,192
So we can't be friends?

257
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,270
I mean, yes.

258
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,302
Sure, we can.

259
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:10,194
- I'm Jacqueline.
- Harlan.

260
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,953
Harlan Fried.

261
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,317
What happened?

262
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,748
I don't know.

263
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,408
I'm not sure, but it felt so real.

264
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:27,831
Almost like I was actually
there 150 years ago.

265
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,325
You must concentrate.

266
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,682
The memory is inside you.

267
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,488
But the more painful it is,

268
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,544
the harder it is to access.

269
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,253
I met someone.

270
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,544
Who?

271
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,419
It was Harlan Fried.

272
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:45,653
He was actually really hot.

273
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:49,966
Okay, now I know you were only dreaming.

274
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,898
We need to access some files.

275
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:12,356
Everything you have on Nelson Fisk

276
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:14,525
and the London Climate
Conference of 2039.

277
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,567
Uh-huh.

278
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,405
Must be that time of year
when Professor Pevney's

279
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,856
teaching about the Migration, huh?

280
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,684
- Mm-hmm.
- Great professor, isn't he?

281
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,419
Absolutely.

282
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:24,176
These files are old.

283
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:25,847
I don't even have a data file for them.

284
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:27,613
They only exist as hard copies on paper.

285
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:28,940
We'll take that then.

286
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,239
All right.

287
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,856
<i>Access denied.</i>

288
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,113
Sorry, that's not gonna be possible.

289
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:37,848
Not possible? Why not?

290
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:40,151
- Access is restricted.
- On whose authority?

291
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,505
By order of...

292
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,880
Professor Donovan Osborn.

293
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,774
Thank you.

294
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,942
The idea was always
to bury these files...

295
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,301
Sorry, dear. I have no idea,

296
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,159
but Donovan wants you to go in.

297
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,927
Well, we can't bloody
well do that now, can we?

298
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,156
Do yourself a favor. Say no.

299
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:10,255
Tell him this is no job

300
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,364
for a young man of
conscience like yourself.

301
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,431
Mr. Fleming seems upset.

302
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:20,263
With good reason.
We have a traitor in our midst.

303
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,457
Earlier today,

304
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:23,325
a file request was made
at the Academy library.

305
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,014
Certain sensitive files were requested

306
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,372
by my niece, of all people.

307
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,966
Don't worry,
for once this is not about Jacqueline.

308
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:33,580
Somebody in the library
contacted a mole inside CIS,

309
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:36,407
and now Harlan Fried
knows about the files.

310
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,133
Fried was never supposed to know.

311
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,811
I told Prescott I wanted
you to look into it.

312
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,894
He wasn't very keen on that
idea, I imagine.

313
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,316
He doesn't trust you.

314
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:48,677
But I do, and that's all that matters.

315
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,944
We need to find that mole.

316
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,353
Be careful.

317
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,963
Whoever this person is

318
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:02,052
will stop at nothing to keep
their identity a secret.

319
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,359
Jax? Jax?

320
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,917
Don't. Stop. If you bring
her out of it the wrong way,

321
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:26,534
she can become lost and never
find her way back to us again.

322
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,025
I should never have let her
do this in the first place.

323
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,886
It's not as though you or
anyone else could stop her.

324
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,371
Once Jax makes up her mind...

325
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,805
I know, I know.

326
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,122
But you can't let her continue.

327
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:39,719
When she gets out, you have to stop.

328
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,479
<i>I'm trying to save the world.</i>

329
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:48,085
<i>Who could be against that?</i>

330
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,510
No!

331
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,723
This must not continue anymore.

332
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:01,950
We still don't know what happened.

333
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,980
Nelson Fisk tried to save the world

334
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:07,761
from environmental calamity,
and I killed him.

335
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,113
No.

336
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:10,917
That was 150 years ago.

337
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,143
It could not have been you.

338
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:14,712
You're the one who told
me past lives are real.

339
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:19,216
And I know with every fiber
in my being that I did it.

340
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,256
Okay.

341
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:24,097
This is all too dangerous.

342
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,839
You can become lost in the
past and never able to escape.

343
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:29,425
This must end. Now.

344
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,536
I can handle it.

345
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:31,972
Give me the elixir.

346
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:33,762
I will not.

347
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,963
Don't feel sorry for me.
You're making it worse.

348
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:53,067
I'm not. I don't...

349
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,690
I'm guessing you had another
headache in class today.

350
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,692
A headache I could handle.

351
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:05,363
Hearing the thoughts of every
single student sitting near me,

352
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:06,411
that's worse.

353
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,043
Some of these guys,
you don't even want to know

354
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,450
what's going through their heads.

355
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,846
Judging by the things they say,

356
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:15,273
I doubt their thoughts
are worth hearing.

357
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:21,947
We can get through this, Thomas.

358
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:24,083
Together.

359
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:28,497
You know...

360
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,238
you're the only one I can talk to.

361
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,840
You're scared. I get it.

362
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,387
It's scary to be special.

363
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,926
Different.

364
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,961
Even though that's all
I've ever really wanted.

365
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:47,960
You are special.

366
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:51,887
And I...

367
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,235
You what?

368
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,641
I love you.

369
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,568
Commander, we require your help.

370
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:20,794
I'm afraid now's
not really a good time, Ralen.

371
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,612
Xander, I need your help.

372
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:25,209
I need you to talk to my uncle for me.

373
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,011
Yeah? Why can't you talk to him?

374
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:29,604
What are you doing?
Is there something in your eye?

375
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:30,648
What, um...?

376
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,759
What do you need me to
ask the professor about?

377
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,544
Some files at the library.

378
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:36,937
He had them sealed,
and I need to know what's in them.

379
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,863
I need you to get them.

380
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,302
I'm... I'm sorry, but I can't.

381
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:42,957
Jax is asking for your help.

382
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,480
Yeah, I get that, Ralen,
but you have my answer.

383
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,303
Does what she's suffered
mean nothing to you?

384
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:49,209
She is in pain even
now, and you can help.

385
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:52,598
I don't need you to
tell me what Jax needs.

386
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,215
Are you two going to fight over Jax?

387
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,582
- This is exciting.
- Enough. This isn't helping.

388
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,975
Xander, I can't explain it,

389
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,238
and you wouldn't believe me if I tried,

390
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,732
but I have to know
what's in those files.

391
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,092
I have to go.

392
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,842
That was most uncharacteristic
of Commander Duvall.

393
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:35,112
If you mean he acted like a
total scum weasel, I agree.

394
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,521
What was all that about anyway, Jax?

395
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:38,841
You okay?

396
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,958
- <i>What was all that about anyway, Jax?</i>
- I'm fine.

397
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:42,597
<i>What was all that about anyway, Jax?</i>

398
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,349
<i>You okay? You okay?</i>

399
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,552
What is wrong with her?

400
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,220
I believe it is the guilt.

401
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:02,271
The ritual has given
her many more questions.

402
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,072
No answers.

403
00:23:04,097 --> 00:23:05,521
So how do we help?

404
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:11,294
She saved me when my bio-organics
were hijacked by Sarika.

405
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,349
Now I will save her.

406
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,950
Jax, we're trying again one more time.

407
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,115
Going back to find out what happened.

408
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:49,763
Okay?

409
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,847
I have to warn you,

410
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:03,279
doing this again so soon...

411
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:05,294
We know. Dangerous.

412
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,115
I don't have a choice.

413
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:09,724
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

414
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:14,091
In a way, you are.

415
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:16,661
You're getting lost in your own past,

416
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,888
or at least some version of it.

417
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:21,481
If this is the only way, I have to try.

418
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,521
Regardless,
this is the last of the elixir.

419
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,302
You can't get more?

420
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:28,646
Not unless I go back to Zatar.

421
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:32,411
Even then, it's very hard to come by.

422
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,333
Only the most royal houses...

423
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:35,677
You're from a royal house?

424
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:39,663
Maybe I've been too hard on you, Ralen.

425
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,365
Suffice it to say,

426
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,484
this will be our final attempt.

427
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,825
Working hard as always, I see.

428
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,513
Can I tell you a secret?

429
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:15,919
Nelson watches Elena's speeches,

430
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:17,482
like, obsessively.

431
00:26:18,238 --> 00:26:20,357
He thinks she's got
a great speechwriter.

432
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,962
You do have a way with words.

433
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,235
I have a way with a lot of things.

434
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,865
What just happened?

435
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:41,510
I do not know,

436
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,661
but she seems quite content.

437
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,298
It appears she's in
a great deal of pain.

438
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:05,349
Yeah, I'm not sure that's pain.

439
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:23,006
Damn!

440
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:44,086
Come quick!

441
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,349
There's some kind of wild
firefight going on outside!

442
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:54,154
School project?

443
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,974
What? What's wrong?

444
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:00,299
What did I do?

445
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,509
Stop!

446
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,466
Now you tell me who you work for!

447
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,792
You tell me now,
or I'll let the telepaths get it out!

448
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:36,677
Fleming! I work for Fleming!

449
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:52,006
The answer is no.

450
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:54,745
I haven't even...

451
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,319
You don't have to. He can...

452
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:59,250
Well, you know.

453
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:01,175
That's why I need his help.

454
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,911
Jax, don't ask.

455
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:05,998
I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important,

456
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,616
if Thomas wasn't my only hope.

457
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:09,593
No matter how quietly you talk...

458
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:11,185
I know.

459
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,488
I'm sorry, I know I have no
right to ask you for help.

460
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:15,020
But I also have no choice.

461
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,537
After everything that's happened...

462
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:18,302
I know. I'm sorry.

463
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:21,092
But if you can read minds,
then you know that already.

464
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:23,241
Even I can see how badly she needs you,

465
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,881
and I can't read minds.

466
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:30,047
You know how many inexplicable
things have happened to me,

467
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:33,100
from suddenly being able
to read alien tongue

468
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,131
to not being infected

469
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,358
by a deadly genetically
engineered pathogen.

470
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,678
But what does it all mean?

471
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:42,083
I think these experiences
have unlocked something in me.

472
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:45,077
Memories from over a hundred years ago.

473
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:47,931
I don't understand, Jax.

474
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:49,530
I don't understand either.

475
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,003
But I'm pretty sure I killed someone,

476
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:53,928
and I don't think that
man deserved to die.

477
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:55,639
And I need to know why...

478
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:58,652
before I lose my mind.

479
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,702
What is going on?

480
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,529
Why did Donovan call me at
this ungodly time of night?

481
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,467
This way, Prescott, please.

482
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:16,412
What's the bloody meaning of this?
How dare you?

483
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:18,389
Relax. We just need to talk.

484
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:20,531
And why is Mr. Duvall
holding a pistol on me?

485
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,787
In case you take the news badly.

486
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:24,272
What the hell are you talking about?

487
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:25,836
This is ridiculous.

488
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:27,428
Do you remember my wife?

489
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,061
Your wife? Yes, of course I do.

490
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:31,795
Do you remember what happened to her?

491
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:33,760
She was shot.

492
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:35,975
They never caught the
enemy agent who killed her.

493
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:38,264
I killed her.

494
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:41,451
When I found out she
was the enemy agent,

495
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,361
I killed her.

496
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:47,350
It was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

497
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,522
That is the pain I am
trying to spare you now.

498
00:30:51,973 --> 00:30:53,306
What?

499
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:55,556
What are you...?

500
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,965
Maya?

501
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,702
Are you sure?

502
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:18,336
You were right, sir.

503
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:21,735
There is a mole in the CIS.

504
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,076
And I'm afraid it's your wife.

505
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:38,254
Uh...

506
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,521
Kneel down, I guess.

507
00:31:42,131 --> 00:31:44,701
I don't know.
It's not like I've done this before.

508
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,146
I heard that.

509
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,948
Oh, now you're just showing off.

510
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,147
Relax, Jax.

511
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:06,475
You have to let me in.

512
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:33,498
Fisky is expecting me.

513
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:43,620
<i>Liu's opponent,</i>

514
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:46,343
<i>industrialist and tech
entrepreneur Nelson Fisk,</i>

515
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,026
<i>also spoke to us.</i>

516
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,360
<i>You know, it's scientifically
proved, you know?</i>

517
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,073
<i>She's running away from the Earth...</i>

518
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:53,928
She's a science nerd.

519
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,886
They want sizzle, not steak.

520
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,498
Her Migration plan
will be dead on arrival

521
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:02,293
- once I give my proposal.
- <i>We can't just run away.</i>

522
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:06,569
<i>We can and we will make
the Earth great again.</i>

523
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:09,991
If you think that's passion,
wait for the final speech.

524
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:12,522
<i>You got to back Earth,
you got to back the people.</i>

525
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:14,170
I got my young protégé, Fried,

526
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:16,663
to take care of Professor
Markovitz and Dr. Bechmann.

527
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:20,241
By the time anyone finds out
the CO2 scrubbers don't work,

528
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:23,077
we'll be rich and long gone
from this doomed planet.

529
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:24,272
Don't worry.

530
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:27,258
I don't know, maybe Liu's
"migration to the stars" plan

531
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:29,420
would have worked.
Who knows, but who cares?

532
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:30,446
You know, if they're lucky,

533
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,389
maybe she'll even get
a few ships off-world

534
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:33,975
before too many people die

535
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,670
when they realize our carbon
scrubbers are pure fantasy

536
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,195
and don't work.

537
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,940
Got to go. Duty calls.

538
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:43,928
Very important meeting.

539
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,334
Okay, honey, bedroom's right over there.

540
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,726
Make yourself comfortable.

541
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,777
Guys! Guys! Get in here!

542
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:31,029
<i>I'm one of the great scientists.</i>

543
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:32,076
<i>Not a lot of people know that.</i>

544
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,137
<i>I'm one of the great scientists,
I'm telling you.</i>

545
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:35,778
<i>You know, making spaceships...</i>

546
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,433
<i>I'm trying to save the world.</i>

547
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:44,200
<i>I ask you, who could be against that?</i>

548
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:48,270
Please...

549
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:50,842
just let me say one thing.

550
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:52,645
No.

551
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,670
No!

552
00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:59,169
It was all a lie.

553
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:03,356
Fisk's plan to save the Earth,

554
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,048
it was just a scam.

555
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,895
He didn't care about anything or anyone

556
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,694
other than making money.

557
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,161
The planet

558
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,333
and humanity would have been doomed.

559
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:36,130
After the tragic murder of Nelson Fisk,

560
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:38,559
his bold plan suddenly died with him.

561
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,869
The only viable plan left
was the Great Migration.

562
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:46,544
Elena Liu successfully presented
her proposal in London.

563
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:48,208
It was adopted immediately

564
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,137
by governments around the world,

565
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:53,606
providing the foundation
for what would become

566
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:55,165
the Earth Confederacy.

567
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,169
And we ventured out into the stars

568
00:35:57,194 --> 00:36:00,114
in thousands of arc
ships across the galaxy,

569
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:03,606
setting up the colonies
and waited patiently

570
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,299
for Mother Earth to heal herself.

571
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,122
Sir, what happened to the people

572
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,581
who were on Fisk's team?

573
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:13,107
Well, some of them disappeared

574
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,825
even before the Great Migration.

575
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,309
Some suspect they were murdered,

576
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,001
but we'll never know why.

577
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:21,247
There was one young man you
may have heard of, though.

578
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:22,770
Harlan Fried.

579
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:24,196
Indeed.

580
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:26,387
Now, Harlan Fried was, as a young man,

581
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:29,208
one of Fisk's most trusted advisors.

582
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:33,122
Yeah, okay, he was hot.

583
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,255
Which makes it even more odd

584
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,423
that, after being the biggest advocate

585
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:38,997
for Fisk's proposal,

586
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,848
he quickly chose to endorse

587
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:43,450
Elena Liu's Great Migration plan

588
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:47,005
and abruptly left politics
to start Parallax Galactic,

589
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,966
the very same pangalactic
multinational we know today.

590
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,774
Now, many believe it was an
act of conscience on his part.

591
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,825
Others wonder if there was
more to the story than that.

592
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,887
Fisk's plan wouldn't have worked.

593
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,546
I know that, and you know that.

594
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:08,661
But the rest of the world still doesn't.

595
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:12,239
So what? His plan is as dead as he is.

596
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:13,864
Only if I kill it.

597
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:16,200
We still have public opinion with us.

598
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:19,184
So if you want me to endorse your plan,

599
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:21,567
you need to make it worth my while.

600
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:23,762
I have a company I'm looking to start.

601
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:26,262
I need seed money from the
international grant money

602
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,137
you'll receive, and I need ships.

603
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:32,981
You want money and spaceships

604
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:35,559
for disowning a plan you
know would never work.

605
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:38,278
Don't you realize that
billions of people will die

606
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,036
if Fisk's plan were implemented?

607
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:41,661
Oh, and I want a moon.

608
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,193
Io, in fact.

609
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,130
Jupiter still has 79 other moons,

610
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,677
so you shouldn't miss it much.

611
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:53,223
So do we have a deal, Miss Liu?

612
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:56,783
We have a deal.

613
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,907
Nice getting to know you, Jax.

614
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,652
Suffice it to say, I...

615
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:13,544
... truly enjoyed our time together.

616
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:15,604
I wish I could say the same.

617
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,865
Oh, don't worry.

618
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,407
I'm sure we'll see each
other again in the future.

619
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:31,125
You okay?

620
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:33,221
You didn't kill anyone else, I hope?

621
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:35,005
No.

622
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,083
But I need to find out what
else my uncle is hiding

623
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,559
about Harlan Fried.

624
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,620
And me.

625
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,536
Uncle, are you home?

626
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,044
Xander, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

627
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:54,946
I'm looking for my uncle.

628
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,708
Well, the professor had to leave

629
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,028
unexpectedly on business.

630
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:59,458
Anything I can help you with?

631
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:01,910
I think there's something
strange going on with me,

632
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:04,161
and my uncle knows more
than he's telling me.

633
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:05,903
What makes you say that?

634
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,562
Xander, where are you?

635
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,489
Jax, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

636
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:13,606
Is everything all right?

637
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,739
I was just looking for my uncle.

638
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:18,182
I didn't mean to wake you.

639
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:20,403
I have to go. Good night.

640
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:47,268
It must be very important
for you to come here, Donovan.

641
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:48,539
It is.

642
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,875
I need your help.
