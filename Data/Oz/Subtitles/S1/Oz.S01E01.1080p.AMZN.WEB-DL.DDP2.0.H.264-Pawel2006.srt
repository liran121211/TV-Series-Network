00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,066
An hour every day when
the cons gotta sit in silence.

364
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,734
I mean, what's next,
milk and cookies?

365
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,333
Arts and crafts?

366
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,266
- Maybe you should've listened
to what I was saying, Healy.

367
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,633
We gotta make 'em
be quiet in here

368
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,567
because when they get out
and they get a job,

369
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,567
they're gonna have to sit
and do their work and be quiet.

370
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,233
- Oh, come on, man, what kind of
fairy dust you been snorting?

371
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,567
These stupid fucks

372
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,300
aren't gonna work
for fucking Microsoft!

373
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,300
It's bullshit.

374
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,934
- If an inmate survives Oz,

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,367
he's got balls on the street.

376
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,900
I wanna take some of
the glamour away from that.

377
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,033
I wanna take some of
the glory away from that.

378
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,200
Maybe a high-school education.

379
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,834
Maybe learn to fucking read.

380
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,233
- If everybody's done making
speeches, I'm moving on.

381
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Next item:
no smoking rule.

382
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,066
- More bullshit.

383
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,367
You expect us
to enforce this ban?

384
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,000
- These are state guidelines

385
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,467
recommended by
the board of Corrections,

386
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,834
passed by the legislature,
signed by the governor.

387
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,834
- The governor
is an asshole.

388
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,734
- You mean politically,
or you speaking personally?

389
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,700
- He campaigned on the "no perks
for prisoners" platform.

390
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,533
He's gonna reinstate
the death penalty.

391
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,700
He's gonna slash our budget.

392
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,066
He's gonna incite a riot.

393
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,433
- [scoffs]
Riot?

394
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,333
- Yeah, I heard what happened
in the cafeteria.

395
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
It's just gonna escalate.

396
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:02,700
This place is fueled by smoke.

397
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,200
- I know that Marlboros
aren't gonna disappear.

398
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,400
They're just gonna
go underground like drugs.

399
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,667
I said we have to
enforce the new rules.

400
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:12,800
I didn't say
that I liked them.

401
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,500
Next item:
Kareem Said.

402
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,567
Now, he arrives today,
and I don't have to tell you

403
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,467
what a potential
powder keg this can be.

404
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,233
Not just because
he blew up

405
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,400
a white-owned warehouse
in his community.

406
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,567
Said claims that
he is not a criminal,

407
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,200
that he is
a political prisoner,

408
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,633
and until all the appeals
and shit are cleared,

409
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,633
he is to be treated
with kid gloves.

410
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,633
After that we can
bury him in Gen Pop.

411
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,200
- Prisoner number 9-7-S-4-4-4...

412
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,200
- Open.

413
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,467
- Kareem Said.

414
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,300
A.K.A. Goodson Truman,

415
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:50,100
convicted June 6th, '97,
arson in the second degree.

416
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,033
Sentence: 18 years.

417
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,033
Eligible for parole in five.

418
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,367
- In Em City,
we treat each other

419
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:06,734
the way that we would
like to be treated.

420
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
We treat each other
with respect.

421
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:13,600
- And what happens when one of
us does not respect the other?

422
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,100
- There's violence.

423
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,800
- Then prison life isn't all
that different

424
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:17,800
than the outside world.

425
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,133
- Your celebrity status

426
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,433
doesn't buy you any
extra advantages here.

427
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
All my prisoners
are equal.

428
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,266
- [laughs]
How ironic.

429
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,300
To finally be an equal
in a place

430
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,600
where I do not have
the freedom to enjoy it.

431
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:37,033
- You do the work assigned you,
you stay out of trouble,

432
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,200
we're gonna get along
just fine.

433
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,567
Otherwise, you go into
the general population,

434
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,467
and, Kareem...
[chuckle softly]

435
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,100
In the rest of Oz,

436
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,767
nobody's treated the way that
they would like to be treated.

437
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,300
- Then I consider
myself warned.

438
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
- I've read a couple
of your books.

439
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,600
I know the influence that
you can have over other men,

440
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,066
so I'm hoping
we can work together,

441
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,700
make everybody's
stay here more productive.

442
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,700
- I would like to help my
brothers live a full life.

443
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,734
- Yeah, so would we all.

444
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,333
Anything else
we can tell you?

445
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,834
- No.

446
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,266
I do have one thing
I can tell you.

447
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,900
- What's that?

448
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,700
- 78% of the population
at Oswald State Penitentiary

449
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,500
are men of color.

450
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,667
The ratio is,
at last count,

451
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:29,767
one officer for
every nine prisoners.

452
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,400
We could take this prison
anytime we wanted to.

453
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:35,000
- You could take it.

454
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,533
But you wouldn't
be able to keep it.

455
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,100
- Hm.
That remains to be seen.

456
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,934
- Are you telling me
you intend to start a riot?

457
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,100
- What I'm telling you is,

458
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,433
as of today,

459
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,333
I run Oz.

460
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,367
- Don't you fuck with me,
my brother.

461
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,100
[men chanting outside]
Officers.

462
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,834
- As-Salaam-Alaikum, brother.

463
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,934
[chanting continues]

464
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,133
[chanting silences]

465
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,166
- There is always in Oz

466
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,100
an undercurrent of fear...

467
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,900
of violence...

468
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,800
of hate...

469
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,400
waitin' to explode.

470
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,166
- [sighs]

471
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,967
- Prisoner number 9-6-C-3-8-2,

472
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,600
Dino Ortolani.

473
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,533
Convicted December 12th, '96,

474
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,033
one count murder
in the first degree,

475
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,667
assault with
a deadly weapon.

476
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,767
Sentence: life imprisonment

477
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:48,433
without the possibility
of parole.

478

00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:06,100
[both groaning]

480
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,767
- McManus, we gotta talk.

481
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:18,834
- About what?

482
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
- About sex.

483
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,400
- Sister, you're insatiable.

484
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,500
- And you are not that funny.

485
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,300
Now look,
Dino Ortolani has requested

486
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,500
a conjugal visit.

487
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,600
- So?

488
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:33,533
- Well, that would make it
the fourth since January.

489
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,066
- So?

490
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:37,133
- Well, so it's part of my job
to arrange for inmates

491
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,867
and their--what...

492
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,200
Excuse me,
am I in your way here?

493
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:42,500
To arrange

494
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,967
for inmates and their wives
to make whoopee.

495
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:47,633
And it's part of your job
to tell me

496
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,767
if said inmate
has earned said whoopee.

497
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,100
- Four times in a year.

498
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,400
That's more sex than I had
when I was married.

499
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:56,700
- Maybe that's why
you're divorced.

500
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,367
- Give him a six-hour conjugal.

501
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,166
- Wow, is that all?

502
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,400
- Yep.

503
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,433
- Well...

504
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,200
I just hope he's not
a premature ejaculator.

505
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,600
- [laughs]
- [whistles]

506
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,000
- Oh, for a second
I thought you escaped.

507
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,266
- Thanks, kid.

508
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,900
- He ate his mother.

509
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:30,567
- Get outta here.

510
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,834
- So I heard.
He killed her,

511
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,367
then he broiled
her head,

512
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:35,934
smothered it in onions.

513
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,867
- What, no garlic?

514
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,367
- He had his father
in the freezer.

515
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,600
- Sick fuck.

516
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,166
What the fuck's wrong
with this country?

517
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,600
In the old days,
murder was murder.

518
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,200
You killed someone,
it was business.

519
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,600
And you sure as Christ
didn't eat 'em.

520
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,867
- Times have changed, Nino.

521
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,367
- Fuck that.

522
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:54,800

nothing ever changes.

♪ ♪

524
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,400
- Now, my brothers,

525
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:01,233
we must dedicate ourselves

526
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,834
to a whole different
set of principles,

527
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,934
to a whole new
set of priorities.

528
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,900
We must rekindle

529
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,934
our natural sense of purity.

530
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,767
The heart and the mind

531
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,867
must be cleansed and set free.

532
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:20,266
And that means no drugs,

533
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,800
no alcohol,

534
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:25,166

536
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,900
Yes, my brother.

537
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,533
No foul language

538
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,266
and no abnormal sex.

539
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,633
