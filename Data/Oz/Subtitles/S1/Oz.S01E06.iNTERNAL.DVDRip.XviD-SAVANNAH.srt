1
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,829
Oz 1-6
To Your Health

2
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:46,025
Six percent of the total prison
population is 55 and older.

3
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:48,525
That's double ten years ago.

4
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,008
And we say 55 is old because...

5
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:54,741
...criminal life adds about
ten years worth of wrinkles.

6
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,434
Still, in Oz, you get decent food,...

7
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:59,329
...exercise, regular check ups.

8
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:07,079
And if you don't get whacked you live
longer than you would in your own hood.

9
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,866
Yeah, the prison system.
It can keep you alive,...

10
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,866
...but it can't take care of you.

11
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:16,766
I'm telling you, we're
ignoring the problem.

12
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,536
We have to deal differently
with aging inmates.

13
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:21,606
That's right. Oz was designed to punish
the young, to keep them in line,...

14
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:23,491
to keep them down, but
with a guy like Rebadow,...

15
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,158
you don't need to keep him down.

16
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,828
So what are you proposing?

17
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:31,163
Tell unit 2 into a cell
block exclusively for seniors.

18
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:33,752
They sleep together there, they can
eat all their meals together there,...

19
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:37,069
...they can play cards, they can
watch the TV shows they wanna watch.

20
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,116
Saturday night Bingo?

21
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:42,138
Well, why not? We need
to keep them active.

22
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:45,257
And less stress will help slow
down the aging process which...

23
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,549
...will help save on medical costs.

24
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,666
Plus, the older guys are not a security
problem, so you can save money on the officers.

25
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,696
McManus, you've been
awfully quiet today.

26
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:57,198
Never thought I'd ask but do
you have an opinion on this?

27
00:02:57,198 --> 00:03:00,948
Sure. Sounds like a good idea.

28
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,061
-That's it?
-Yep.

29
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:10,696
Fine, I'll run it by the
Commissioner. Meeting adjourned.

30
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,696
Finally.

31
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,365
Tim, you ok? You don't look so good.

32
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,295
Are you feeling all right?
- I said yeah,...

33
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,545
...ok?

34
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,341
Ok.

35
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,850
Free for dinner tonight?

36
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,753
Dinner?

37
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:32,892
- You think I'm an asshole.
- I do not think...

38
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:40,642
Well, I appreciate the offer, but the last
thing I need from you is a mercy dinner.

39
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:45,077
- Bob Rebadow's in the hospital, Kenny.
- So?

40
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:48,657
- So, I'm pissed off about that!
- So?

41
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:51,965
- So I hear you're responsible
- Where'd you hear that from?

42
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:58,215
I got ears everywhere,
Kenny, and I know it's true.

43
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:03,216
You don't hit old men,
Kenny. You don't...

44
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:05,375
What do you want, McManus?

45
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,164
You see those guys out there?

46
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,843
If I tell 'em to, they
will gladly kick your ass.

47
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,878
I'm not afraid of them. I'm
not afraid of you either.

48
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:12,955
- You're not?
- No.

49
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:14,874
- What are you afraid of?
- I ain't afraid of nothing!

50
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,071
- Nothing?
- Nothing!

51
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:18,541
Huh, you afraid of this?

52
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,791
You afraid of dying? You
little fucking punkass!

53
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:30,797
Get him the fuck out of here!

54
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,954
Leo, what are you doing here?

55
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:58,032
Same thing you are, I guess. I like
to work out when no one else is around.

56
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:04,782
I'll ignore you if you ignore me.

57
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,151
McManus, you ok?

58
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:11,490
Why does everybody keep asking me that?

59
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,856
I don't know. Past few weeks
you've seemed different.

60
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,606
I'm fine.

61
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:22,188
Commissioner rejected our proposal
for a senior citizens unit.

62
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,563
Big surprise. Commissioner
didn't reject it.

63
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:27,588
Governor Fuckwad did.

64
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:30,965
Well, Devlin's almost out of office.

65
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:37,145
I mean, he's on trial for taking those
kickbacks, lying, fraud, extortion.

66
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,895
I'll miss him.

67
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,925
You know, I've been hearing rumors that
you're living in Emerald City,

68
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,925
that you never leave the grounds
to go home anymore.

69
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,610
Since when do you listen to gossip?

70
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,929
You know, I've been dancing
down these hallways a long time.

71
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:56,062
I've seen this place
change people completely,...

72
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:58,084
...not just the prisoners.

73
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:00,378
You're not careful, Tim,...

74
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:04,378
...Oz'll nick away at your soul.

75
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:10,539
Huh. That's the first time
you've ever called me Tim.

76
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:15,668
You know, you don't even
have to be 55 to be old.

77
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,380
How you feeling?

78
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:48,134
I can't stay here anymore.

79
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,643
- In the hospital?
- In Oz.

80
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,143
- Why?
- I'm afraid.

81
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:57,071
- Of what?
- Them. The young.

82
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:00,157
When I first came to Oz, we
treated our elders with dignity.

83
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:05,676
But these kids, it's all different
now. I've decided to leave.

84
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:09,426
- Leave?
- Escape.

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,210
- How you gonna do that?
- God will show me the way.

86
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,767
The human body. It's amazing.

87
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:15,604
Made up of all these cells and
neutrons and veins and shit like that.

88
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:17,734
So many little pieces, so many
things that could break down,

89
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,492
and add on to that the wear...

90
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:21,481
...and tear we give our bodies,...

91
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:26,175
...what with the drugs and
drinking and chicken fried steak.

92
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:31,423
Man, that any of us are still standing,
still breathing, it's a miracle.

93
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:32,423
Breakfast, boys!

94
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,506
Let's go, Alvarez.

95
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:42,578
- I think maybe we got a problem.
- What?

96
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:44,578
Look at Alvarez.

97
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:54,974
Hey, Alvarez.

98
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:57,224
You think he's faking?

99
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:00,536
Alvarez! Alvarez!

100
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:08,616
Call for the doctor.

101
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:14,366
Prisoner number 43A515, Ricardo Alvarez.

102
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:17,259
Convicted March 3, '43. Armed robbery

103
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,259
Sentence: 20 years.

104
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:22,655
Convicted June 6, '61.
Murder in the first degree.

105
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,155
Sentence: life imprisonment,
solitary confinement.

106
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,583
Ricardo, we're going to
start with a series of tests.

107
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:41,014
You have to go home?

108
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,988
Your mother? Ricardo, where are you?

109
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:51,738
Do you know what city you're in?

110
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:55,188
R. Alvarez: Havana. Havana.

111
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,422
So, we're agreed, the medication's
controlling Cragen's paranoia.

112
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:00,877
Yeah, we should keep him on it.

113
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:01,877
Definitely.

114
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,152
Next is Miguel Alvarez.

115
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:10,170
Oh, yeah. I'm scheduled to do a
psychiatric reevaluation on Thursday.

116
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,112
Good luck, Pete. His baby
died right after birth.

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,086
He's pretty depressed.

118
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:16,098
He's about to become
even more depressed.

119
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:18,439
His grandfather, Ricardo
Alvarez, has Alzheimer's.

120
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,735
- Christ.
- Does his family know?

121
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,268
No, not yet.

122
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,541
Ricardo's son Eduardo
is an orderly in my ward.

123
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,265
I'll tell him when he
comes in for his shift.

124
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:29,351
- Eduardo. That's the one with
no tongue, right? - Uh-huh.

125
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,848
I'll talk to Miguel.

126
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:34,204
Listen, Tim, could I do
that? If you don't mind.

127
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:38,692
I'm always willing to give up an
opportunity to deliver bad news.

128
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:39,192
Next?

129
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,008
- Miguel, I need you to come with me.
- I didn't do shit!

130
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,258
Miguel, please.

131
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:50,658
Come on.

132
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,888
How come no one knew 'til now
that Ricardo's mind was going?

133
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,469
He was in solitary, Miguel. He hardly
says three words a day to anyone.

134
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:04,283
And there's nothing we could have
done to stop the disease anyway.

135
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,417
So what happens now?

136
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,449
Well, that's the tricky part.
Unfortunately, Oz is just not equipped...

137
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:14,702
...for long term custodial care and
there isn't anywhere else to send him.

138
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:18,011
You're telling me the state doesn't have
anyplace to take care of its old prisoners?

139
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,061
The state, the state's attitude
towards the elderly,

140
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:25,761
any elderly, in or out of prison
is hurry up and die.

141
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:31,962
I wanna see my grandfather.

142
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,465
Hey.

143
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:55,066
It's me, Miguel, and Eduardo.

144
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,928
Eduardo, your son.

145
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:05,692
Miguel, grandson.

146
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:19,291
You know what we should
do with Ricardo Alvarez?

147
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,291
What's that?

148
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,146
Let him go free.

149
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:35,029
Let him go free? The man
is a convicted killer.

150
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,066
He stabbed the inmate who
cut his son's tongue out.

151
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,337
- And he's old.
- He's old, Leo.

152
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:41,535
Old doesn't necessarily mean nice.

153
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:44,818
If there's any doubts about that,
spend ten minutes with my mother in law.

154
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:49,743
Leo, a 31 year old inmate
costs $21000 a year to maintain.

155
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,869
A senior costs three times that amount.

156
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,267
Since when did you get so
interested in the budget?

157
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,761
Since I figured out that the money we're gonna
waste taking care of Ricardo Alvarez could...

158
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:58,907
...be put to much better use.

159
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:01,115
Besides, Ricardo
doesn't know where he is

160
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,923
or why he's here. There is such a
thing as criminal menopause, right?

161
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:07,271
He cannot commit the crime again.

162
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:08,888
The man is no longer
a threat to anybody.

163
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,030
It doesn't change what he did and
it doesn't change his sentence.

164
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,339
Life imprisonment means just that.

165
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:24,339
Besides, if he doesn't really know he's in
prison, then he's already free. Isn't he?

166
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:29,558
When I was growing up, both my
father and my grandfather came to Oz.

167
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:34,058
You know, when I was little I always
wondered what was so great about prison

168
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,058
that they'd wanna leave us to come here.

169
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:41,825
But you're a kid. What do you know?

170
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,706
Yeah. So, the word "grandfather". What
does the word mean to you? Emotionally?

171
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:56,706
Nothing. Don't mean
nothing at all to me.

172
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:02,418
Pizza means more. Doorknob.

173
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:08,132
Would you like Grandfather
to mean something to you?

174
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:08,382
Yeah.

175
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:18,196
Dr. Nathan's not sure how long
your grandfather has to live. Look,

176
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:21,017
since your father's an orderly
in the hospital and is going to

177
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:23,351
spend the remaining time
with your grandfather,

178
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,494
there's no reason you
can't do the same thing.

179
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:34,598
Maybe if you take care of him,
you'll learn to care for him.

180
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:40,662
You know, in my family, Ricardo was
like God. You know, he was a legend.

181
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:46,984
My grandmother used to show me these pictures,
you know, and tell me stories all about him.

182
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:52,484
And I wanted to be like him, you know.

183
00:14:55,037 --> 00:15:03,287
Now I see he's just a man, you know. He's
just an old man and he's rotting away.

184
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:08,388
- I don't wanna end up like my grandfather.
- You don't have to, Miguel.

185
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:13,388
Oh, really? Well, I don't see
it going down any other way.

186
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:29,534
Rebadow, I'm sorry
you didn't make it out.

187
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:35,341
It's ok. It was worth it.

188
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:41,655
The adrenaline rush. I felt 25 again.

189
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:43,230
Here's your dinner.

190
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,830
- I don't want it.
- OK. What do you want?

191
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,143
I'd like a few years at the
end of my life to be free.

192
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:07,793
Do we care for people when they're sick
because we actually care about them?

193
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:16,349
Or do we care for them because when our
time comes, we want someone to care for us?

194
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,349
Or does it matter?

195
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,793
At least you got your health.

196
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,408
Don't you hate it when people say that?

197
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:29,341
I mean, you lose your job, you
lose your wife, you're in prison,

198
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:32,139
and some punkass dude gonna say,
"At least you got your health."

199
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,450
Like that's supposed
to make me feel better.

200
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,872
So what if I'm broke? So what if
some drug dealer wants to cap my ass?

201
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,581
At least I ain't got a tumor.

202
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,068
I swear, the next person
that says ALYGYH to me,

203
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,318
I'm gonna make sure they ain't
got their health much longer.

204
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:51,105
You say you were having nightmares.
Can you remember any of them?

205
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:55,343
- No. Ow.
- What's the matter?

206
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:59,573
My tooth hurts. It's
been hurting for a week.

207
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,523
- Then go see a dentist.
- No.

208
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,433
- Why?
- I hate the dentist.

209
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,303
All dentists, or just
Dr. Cocher in particular?

210
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:10,612
The concept of dentists.

211
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,306
Then what? You prefer
the concept of pain?

212
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:19,056
Make an appointment, Groves? OK? OK.

213
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,951
- Oh, God.
- What?

214
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:27,706
- Oh, sweet Jesus, Donald Groves
is coming in to see me. - So?

215
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,383
Gloria, he ate his parents.

216
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,343
I'm not sticking my fingers in his
mouth. My fingers are my livelihood.

217
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:37,677
He's been working in the ward
as an orderly. He seems harmless.

218
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:41,156
- So you'd stick your fingers
in his mouth? - If I had to.

219
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,878
- If he's in pain, you have to.
- No, I don't.

220
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,323
What about the Hippocratic Oath?

221
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:50,094
Dentists don't take the Hippocratic Oath.
We don't make any promises to anybody.

222
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,894
How's that gas working?

223
00:17:56,353 --> 00:18:00,270
- You feel happy?
Calm? - Uh-huh.

224
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,270
Good. OK, let's have a look.

225
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:11,426
Open your mouth.
Wider. Wider. Wider.

226
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,415
I can't get any wider.

227
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:20,715
- Allrighty, then. They look fine.
- It hurts.

228
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,104
- It's probably nothing.
- It's hurts.

229
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,542
- Oh, don't be a baby.
- Who are you calling a baby?

230
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:29,042
Nobody. Forget it.
Forget I said anything.

231
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,627
A-ha. There is a tooth that's rotted
out. I'm going to have to pull it.

232
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:38,593
That means I have to get a needle and
inject some Novocaine in your mouth.

233
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,793
- I hate needles.
- Everybody does.

234
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:44,031
- Then I have to drill.
- I hate drills.

235
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:49,187
Right now, so do I. Right now I
wish there were holistic dentistry.

236
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:50,437
I'm in pain.

237
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,499
Well, you're going to be in a
lot more before we're finished.

238
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,499
After that, you won't have any pain.

239
00:18:56,499 --> 00:19:01,067
If I cause you pain it's not my
fault, so don't bite my head off.

240
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:05,569
- I mean, uh...
- I know what you mean.

241
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:13,569
OK. Let's get started. First,
the Novocaine. Open wide.

242
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:24,482
Carol, could you give
me a hand here, please?

243
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:35,285
This is my tooth. It was in my head.

244
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:41,626
This tooth and I have been
together since we were kids.

245
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:46,303
This tooth chewed on my mom.

246
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:52,537
- You should sell it.
- Sell it? - Sell it.

247
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:54,574
The tooth from the
mouth of Donald Groves?

248
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:57,805
- Do you know how much that's worth
on the open market? - How much?

249
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:00,036
- Plenty.
- Who'd wanna buy my tooth?

250
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:02,073
- Collectors.
- Collectors?

251
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:05,551
Collectors. People collect everything.

252
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:09,021
Stamps, salt and pepper
shakers, World's Fair tchochkes.

253
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,427
Some people collect crime stuff.

254
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:15,481
Lindbergh ladder, Ted
Bundy's toenail clippings,

255
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,981
and this.

256
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,574
We'd have to get a fence, right?

257
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:23,427
We're in prison. How
hard's that gonna be?

258
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:26,927
Ross, if we get a good price,

259
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,896
I still got 30 more.

260
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,598
The mind is just like the body.

261
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:41,677
It's under constant assault from fear
and hate and a whole pile of loneliness.

262
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:45,401
These things are as
deadly as any Cancer cell.

263
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,651
The mind is just like the body.

264
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:53,953
The fact that the mind
can survive is a miracle.

265
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,067
All right, yo! All right!

266
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:42,955
Our next contestant is the lovely
and talented Tobias Beecher.

267
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:12,827
Never treats me sweet and
gentle, the way he should

268
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:20,827
I got it bad and that ain't good

269
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:29,351
When the weekend's over

270
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:34,228
and Monday rolls around

271
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:45,978
I end up like I start
out, crying my heart out

272
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:52,367
He don't love me like I love him

273
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:55,367
Nobody could

274
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:06,365
I got it bad and that ain't good

275
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:17,362
I got it bad and that ain't good

276
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,446
We knew Beecher was doing drugs.

277
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,452
Yeah, but now I'm
beginning to figure it out.

278
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:11,201
He thinks of himself as a victim,

279
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:15,159
so he's not going to get better unless
he feels he can control his life.

280
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,564
He's in prison, Peter Marie.
His life is totally out of his control.

281
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:21,393
I know, but now we have to get
him back to when he was in charge.

282
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,240
We have to remind him that there's
another victim involved here,

283
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,740
the little girl he killed.

284
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,272
Hello.

285
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:06,742
My husband wouldn't come.

286
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,310
He said he was afraid he might kill you.

287
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:25,088
This is Kathy.

288
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,360
I'm sorry, I didn't want...

289
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:42,397
I'm not sure why I came.

290
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:46,951
At the trial, I was sitting behind you.

291
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:50,574
I could barely see your face.

292
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:55,324
Guess I just wanted to finally see you,

293
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:07,427
see your eyes and to
tell you that I miss her.

294
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:12,878
Every single moment of every single day.

295
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,743
You fucking bastard!

296
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:23,184
I hope you die in here, you monster!

297
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:26,424
I hope you rot in hell!

298
00:26:26,424 --> 00:26:29,424
You killed my baby!

299
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:31,738
I don't know.

300
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:36,539
Maybe I let Schillinger
treat me like dirt

301
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,971
because I deserve to be punished.

302
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:43,721
Because I killed Kathy Rockwell.

303
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:50,664
Because I destroyed her family.

304
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:57,944
- And my own.
- And you hate yourself for that?

305
00:26:57,744 --> 00:26:58,994
Yes.

306
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,163
I guess I hated myself back before too.

307
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:10,393
I hated myself so I drank too much.

308
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:15,013
I hated myself for drinking too much
so to punish myself, I drank more.

309
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,463
Sister,

310
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:28,495
I don't wanna hate me anymore.

311
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:42,393
Hey, don't think you're fooling me.

312
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:45,471
I know the only way you got through
that variety show was by using drugs.

313
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:48,971
- Look, I... - Hey, I told you,
I don't want you doing that shit.

314
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,730
I'm sorry, sir.

315
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:58,864
No, I'm sorry.

316
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,871
Here. Put it on.

317
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:18,183
Perfect fit. No, no, leave it on.

318
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:25,452
Come on. If I go out there with this on,
one of those black guys is gonna kill me.

319
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:26,702
Yeah, I know.

320
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:31,703
What is this?

321
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:35,108
There's a new kid in town.

322
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:44,074
OK, that's great. I'm happy for you.

323
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:47,023
-  I'll move out of the pod.
- No.

324
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:47,773
Why not?

325
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,010
I don't want some
nigger to have your ass.

326
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,460
Goodbye, prag.

327
00:29:16,747 --> 00:29:20,692
- O'Reily, I need your help.
- I'm here.

328
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,171
Schillinger wants me dead.
He just gave me this to wear.

329
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,421
What am I gonna do, man?

330
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:34,062
Well, if you gotta go, you
gotta go high. Ever tried PCP?

331
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:36,746
<i>The trial of James Devlin opened
today at the state courthouse,</i>

332
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:41,782
<i>not far from the capital building, where the Governor
has ruled with an iron fist for the past year.</i>

333
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,966
<i>Devlin, who said he'll never
resign even if convicted,</i>

334
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:51,716
<i>is facing 25 years in prison for fraud, extortion,
racketeering, and obstruction of justice.</i>

335
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,497
Yeah, motherfucker!
That's it! I'm sorry, sir!

336
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:33,111
Beecher, get down!

337
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:44,095
God damn, fucking bastard!

338
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:47,845
Beecher! Beecher! Beecher! Beecher!

339
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,106
Help me!

340
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,250
We need you to keep your
hands away from your face.

341
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:05,228
Oh, shit.

342
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:08,240
I need a couple of 4x4's and some tape.

343
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,662
The glass in his eye is pretty
bad. I'm not sure we can save it.

344
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:15,405
We need to get him to Benchley Memorial
for surgery as soon as possible.

345
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:18,155
Fuck, I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

346
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,743
Beecher, you're a dead man!

347
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:23,662
- You have to go back to drug counseling.
- Fuck off!

348
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:25,812
If you don't, I'll transfer
you out of Emerald City.

349
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:26,562
Fuck off!

350
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:29,236
- Tobias, we're trying to help you.
- Fuck off!

351
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:34,894
Look, if you're afraid Schillinger's gonna kill
you, I'll place you under protective custody.

352
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:41,894
Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off,
fuck off, fuck off, you fucks!

353
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:44,167
People say, "She broke my heart."

354
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,118
That's bullshit, man.

355
00:31:46,118 --> 00:31:48,548
The heart can't break, it's a muscle.

356
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:52,298
Muscles tear, muscles cramp.

357
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:55,791
Yeah, the heart's a
muscle. So's the brain.

358
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,745
So's the dick.

359
00:31:56,745 --> 00:32:03,495
O'Reily, give this guy the mop.
You're through with the bucket brigade.

360
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:04,498
Good.

361
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,752
Dino Ortolani ran the
kitchen like a Swiss watch.

362
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:14,526
The best. Joey was good. Markstrom too.

363
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:21,107
But this Adebisi character, he's not
really focused on the job, you know.

364
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:25,772
And he abuses the
privilege. Everybody steals,

365
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:28,499
but he steals too much.

366
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:34,249
Now you're a smart guy and you've been very
efficient doing the jobs I've asked you to do,

367
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:38,993
so I'm putting you in charge
of the whole cafeteria.

368
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:41,615
What are you talking?
I run this kitchen.

369
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:44,115
And you're doing a half-assed job.

370
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:48,097
I got rotten fruit. I got cold entrees.

371
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:52,147
I got Glynn complaining
about cost overages.

372
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:53,616
I'm not working with him.

373
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:57,042
Fine. How's about I have you
transferred back to the sweatshop?

374
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:02,542
- I don't like the sweatshop.
- Then shut the fuck up. OK?

375
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,031
It's all yours.

376
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,730
All right, ladies, back to work.

377
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:16,247
What?

378
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:19,991
We had a deal. We were partners.

379
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:26,412
We still are. When it comes to running tits, that
part of the operation I got no complaints with,

380
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:29,912
but the kitchen I can't
afford you fucking up.

381
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:32,696
O'Reily will do a good job.

382
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:35,446
Fuck that pretty little mick.

383
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:41,385
Adebisi, you make your peace
with this any way you can.

384
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:46,564
I say O'Reily's gonna run the
kitchen as good as Dino ever did.

385
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:48,064
You wanna bet on that?

386
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:10,266
- What the fuck is going on here,
Wangler? - Nothing.

387
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:12,620
Exactly. Pick up the Goddamned pace!

388
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,535
We're going as fast as we can, man.

389
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:18,428
You're not fooling me.

390
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:21,686
What are you talking about, boss?

391
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:26,796
This. Adebisi, listen to me, I know
why Schibetta put me in charge over you.

392
00:34:26,796 --> 00:34:28,943
He's doing the old divide and conquer.

393
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:33,890
As long as he keeps the two of us at each
other's throats, he's got all the power.

394
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,788
What are you doing?

395
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:40,593
Let's face it, the both of
us only got one goal in mind

396
00:34:40,593 --> 00:34:45,093
and that's to take over
Schibetta's drug trade.

397
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:49,705
- Together we can do it.
- Together?

398
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:51,641
We gotta make him think
that we're enemies,

399
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:54,326
keep him off guard 'til we kill him.

400
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,619
We kill him, the mob kills us.

401
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:01,536
They won't know. Not if
we put this in his food.

402
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:04,471
Glass.

403
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:07,520
As long as we make it fine,
he won't be able to taste it.

404
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,526
Over time, the glass
will cut his insides up.

405
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:14,526
- And he'll die slowly.
- Painfully.

406
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:22,218
You are a sick motherfucker, O'Reily.

407
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:26,318
Coming from you, that's a compliment.

408
00:35:27,688 --> 00:35:30,438
- Wangler!
- What's up?

409
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:35,093
Bring me Schibetta's food.

410
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:39,532
And tell everyone to
start working full speed.

411
00:35:41,112 --> 00:35:45,562
OK. Everyone, move your asses now!

412
00:35:46,872 --> 00:35:51,319
So, Ryan, if you were released
from Oz today, what would you do?

413
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,962
- Travel.
- Where?

414
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:58,439
Around. You know, since I got here I've
been reading brochures and vacation guides.

415
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:02,130
They're great for when you're taking a shit
or before you go to sleep.

416
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:05,447
While I'm sleeping I actually dream about
going to these places.

417
00:36:05,447 --> 00:36:08,654
- Like?
- Mora Goro.

418
00:36:08,654 --> 00:36:12,404
Mora Goro? That's a jungle, isn't it?

419
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:15,484
- Yeah. You knew that?
- Yeah.

420
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:18,970
- Yeah, it's in Africa.
- Yeah.

421
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,063
- You wanna go with me?
- Me?

422
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:25,563
Yeah, you and me, you know.

423
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:29,666
I'm twice your age and I'm a nun.

424
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:34,745
Yeah, well, growing up and going to
St. Pat's, I never had a nun like you.

425
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:41,145
St. Pat's, huh? Tough neighborhood.

426
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:43,406
Yeah, I learned the
alphabet the hard way.

427
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:45,644
DEA, HIV, IOU.

428
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:46,644
I see.

429
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:59,025
You know, Sister, I got 12 years to my
parole. I wanna be alive to make that parole.

430
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:05,275
I'm gonna walk out of
here. I'm gonna survive.

431
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:18,993
Nine of Spades.

432
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:22,248
Trump.

433
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:27,815
- You ok, Nino?
- Yeah, just a little (?).

434
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:32,885
I told you, you're making
the red sauce too spicy.

435
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:36,385
I don't know what the fuck you're
putting in it but it's too fucking spicy.

436
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,403
- Trump.
- Shit.

437
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,403
I was addicted to crack.
Then I had my accident.

438
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:57,375
Lying in the hospital bed, I went
through detox. But that was easy.

439
00:37:57,444 --> 00:38:04,120
The doctors had me on
Morphine, Demerol, Percodan.

440
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,539
I didn't know I was in pain.

441
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:10,813
I didn't know I was in
the hospital, paralyzed.

442
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:14,330
Then I came here, went into counseling.

443
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,960
I take it one day at a time, you know.

444
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,270
But every day I think about drugs.

445
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,181
About not doing drugs.

446
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:24,931
Every single day, every single
hour, every single minute,

447
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:30,009
staying straight has become
my obsession. My new addiction.

448
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:40,719
Oh, shit. Jackson Vayhue got 12 years.

449
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,719
Yeah, I hear he's coming to Oz.

450
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:57,968
Hey, McManus, I been waiting to see you, man. You
really outta get wheelchair access to your office.

451
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,614
Put it in the suggestion box.

452
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:03,530
- Hey, I wanna be Jackson Vayhue's sponsor.
- How come?

453
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,103
The man is one of the greatest b-ball players
of all time. I'm one of his biggest fans.

454
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:10,406
What makes you think that I'm
bringing him to Emerald City?

455
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:13,676
Cause, like everybody
else, you're a starfucker.

456
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:16,738
Oh, right. Nobody could ever
accuse you of being an asskisser.

457
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:19,349
- All right, you're Jackson Vayhue's sponsor.
- When does he arrive?

458
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:21,055
- Tomorrow.
- Great.

459
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:26,555
You think you can get the
marching band ready by then?

460
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:43,292
No!

461
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:56,716
Prisoner number 97V588, Jackson Vayhue.

462
00:39:56,716 --> 00:40:01,717
Convicted August 17, '97.
Attempted rape, assault.

463
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:05,967
Sentence: 12 years. Up for parole in 5.

464
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:11,744
Vayhue, you wait here
for transport to Em City.

465
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:15,009
The rest of you scumfucks, now that you had
your shower and you're all sweet

466
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,509
and squeaky clean, are gonna follow
Officer Smith to your new accomodations.

467
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:22,859
This way. Right through there.
Come on, come on, come on.

468
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:30,076
Hey, Jackson, can I get your
autograph? It's for my kid.

469
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:51,783
Hey, Jackson, what up, baby?

470
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:08,907
Nice shot, yo. Thought
I'd find you here.

471
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:12,696
- I told you to leave me the fuck alone.
- I'm just here to help you get adjusted.

472
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:16,696
What, adjusted to this shit?

473
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,782
- Where you from? You from the projects?
- Yeah.

474
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:26,133
Yeah, me too. Spent all your time adjusting,
right? Figuring out how to fucking stay alive.

475
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,107
Figuring out why you don't have nothing.

476
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:35,458
You got about three ways to get out. You can
sell drugs, sing, or this shit right here.

477
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:40,958
It all takes talent, man.
I just happened to be lucky.

478
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,241
Fucking joke. I could hang, I
could put this ball in the hoop.

479
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:50,335
Oh, I got adjusted. I
got famous, I got rich.

480
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:56,277
I got used to the touring,
the endorsements, the women.

481
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:57,556
Maybe not the women.

482
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,548
I fucking blew that, boy, I blew that.

483
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:03,715
The one thing I'm good at
don't mean dick in here.

484
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:08,715
So how the fuck am I
supposed to adjust to that?

485
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:12,535
- Fuck you. I ain't doing this.
- Oh, yes, you are.

486
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:16,406
- What's the story here?
- Mr. NBA won't do his work assignment.

487
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:20,026
It was explained to you, right?
Everybody in Em City has a job to do.

488
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:23,214
Give me another job, then,
'cause I'm not doing this one.

489
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:24,964
You don't get to choose.

490
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:33,066
Look, pal, I don't do windows,
ok? I don't do windows.

491
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:35,902
Well, now you get to clean that up.

492
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:42,834
George Washington Carver.
He was born to slave parents

493
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:47,312
but he worked his way up and through
Iowa State College,

494
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:51,712
becoming a botanist and an agricultural chemist.

495
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:55,047
Now, he discovered hundreds of uses
for the peanut,

496
00:42:55,048 --> 00:42:58,447
the sweet potato, and the soybean. Now...

497
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:01,947
Mr Vayhue, are you listening to me?

498
00:43:02,044 --> 00:43:03,544
Sure. Soybeans.

499
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:08,639
All right, we'll pick up here next week.

500
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:09,139
Vayhue,

501
00:43:12,302 --> 00:43:16,802
I know you're a big
hotshot basketball star.

502
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:21,550
If you don't start paying attention
in the class, you'll go on report.

503
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,953
Go ahead, nigger.

504
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,453
Oh, no, my friend, you're the nigger.

505
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:32,441
- You got any drugs?
- No.

506
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:36,691
Then what the fuck good are you?

507
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:49,107
- Hey, Jackson, we made this
special for you. - Thanks, man.

508
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:53,107
No, thank you. I won 10
grand on that Bulls game.

509
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:01,040
What, you're looking for an autograph?

510
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,803
No, my brother, your
fame means nothing to me.

511
00:44:04,803 --> 00:44:09,493
Except that you are important to many
children and you are a role model.

512
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,819
I didn't ask to be
nobody's fucking role model.

513
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:16,257
Nonetheless, you are. And that
carries an enormous responsibility.

514
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:19,507
Look, man, fuck you, all right? Go
preach that shit to somebody else.

515
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:24,183
All right, my brother, all right.

516
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:27,939
- But we will talk again.
- Don't bet on that.

517
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:31,939
- Asalaam aleikuum.
- Eat me, nigger.

518
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:49,742
Who do you have to fuck to get high?

519
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:55,099
Son, come on son.

520
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:58,219
Let me squeeze them titties.

521
00:44:59,193 --> 00:45:04,391
I been fiending for this freedom.
I been begging for the beat.

522
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:06,891
I been jonesing for
the jump over the wall.

523
00:45:07,565 --> 00:45:10,491
But all I keep coming
back to is them titties.

524
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:14,741
Round and firm, for the vein burn.

525
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,823
I keep bugging over the reasons.

526
00:45:18,823 --> 00:45:20,573
For this shit I yearn.

527
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:26,515
Years in this piece got me.
Wanting the shit that I unlearned.

528
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,697
Got me wanting to block it out.

529
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:34,447
Forget about. Erase it from my think.

530
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:37,696
Come here, brother.

531
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:43,874
No.

532
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:49,821
- What, you don't wanna get titillated?
- No.

533
00:45:50,111 --> 00:45:52,991
Come here, boy, don't be a pussy.

534
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:56,491
Man, I been clean almost two years.

535
00:45:56,562 --> 00:46:01,648
Man, this one hit ain't
gonna kill you. Come on.

536
00:46:01,648 --> 00:46:05,393
See, we talking about
the '95 Bulls game.

537
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:08,643
- You scored 58 points.
- That's right.

538
00:46:10,126 --> 00:46:13,062
That ain't all I scored.

539
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:17,062
Little threeway with two cheerleaders.

540
00:46:17,272 --> 00:46:19,198
You'll always be my hero, man.

541
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:23,698
That's me. Fucking role model. Come on.

542
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,203
Well, maybe just, just one.

543
00:47:18,696 --> 00:47:21,224
You know that's been up Kenny's ass.

544
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:23,807
Next is Kareem Said.

545
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:27,615
Dr. Ferstopnick diagnosed him for
hypertension and prescribed Callen

546
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:30,741
but his vital signs
have yet to stabilize.

547
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:32,826
He's not taking his medication.

548
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:36,424
That doesn't make sense. A guy like
Said has everything to live for.

549
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:40,119
My guess is that he's concerned about the
effects the drugs could have on his mind.

550
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,805
He doesn't want his judgment clouded.

551
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:47,296
Well, I can understand that. Oz is the
last place you want to let your guard down.

552
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:49,452
Can't you switch his prescription?

553
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:53,278
Yeah, but they all have side effects.
If we don't get him to take something and soon,

554
00:47:53,279 --> 00:48:00,078
it's only a matter of time before
his blood pressure explodes.

555
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:04,454
Don't think of me as a psychologist.
Don't think of me as a nun.

556
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:10,204
Think of me as your mother.
Kareem, take your medicine!

557
00:48:10,986 --> 00:48:14,128
Now, Sister, I thought I was in
here for psychiatric evaluation.

558
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:18,767
You are. Because when you play fast and
loose with high blood pressure, you are crazy.

559
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:21,701
Said: Oh, Sister, I'm far from crazy.

560
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:28,163
You see, God endowed me with a mind
and gave me the ability to choose.

561
00:48:28,163 --> 00:48:29,802
I choose to be drug free.

562
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:33,985
And you make the choice how?
By considering the facts.

563
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:37,361
The fact is, you will die.

564
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:42,611
My physical condition is a
small part of a greater reality.

565
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:48,896
Now, it's been hard. But I am
now at peace with this, Sister.

566
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,995
Now why can't you be?

567
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:52,995
You, you...

568
00:48:54,930 --> 00:49:02,180
- Asalaam aleikuum, Sister.
You're a good woman. - Yeah.

569
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:10,087
OK, Huseni Mershaw, this is Kareem Said.

570
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:13,850
Kareem's gonna help you get used
to the routine in Emerald City.

571
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:20,100
- Asalaam aleikuum, brother.
- Asalaam aleikuum.

572
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:25,904
Here, your cuffs.

573
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:34,459
- Asalaam aleikuum, huh?
- Yeah. Have a nice day.

574
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:46,995
Prisoner number 97M688, Huseni Mershaw.

575
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,819
Also known as James Monroe Madison.

576
00:49:54,322 --> 00:50:03,322
Convicted August 11, '97. Attemped
murder, assault in the first degree.

577
00:50:05,063 --> 00:50:09,313
Sentence: 20 years. Up for parole in 3.

578
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,117
The Jew shot Omar Selim

579
00:50:15,117 --> 00:50:20,123
because he figured Selim was gonna rip off his
little store. Selim didn't even have a weapon on him.

580
00:50:20,123 --> 00:50:23,018
- And the Jew got off.
- Oh, you know it.

581
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:26,128
So we had to teach the little
Jew a lesson on respect.

582
00:50:26,128 --> 00:50:30,628
Thank you, brother Huseni. Now we pray.

583
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:40,691
Imam Said, listen, I think we
gotta do a little more than pray.

584
00:50:40,691 --> 00:50:45,441
We will, brother. Believe me, we will.

585
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:49,515
Believers are like a single man.

586
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:54,410
If his eye is affected,
then all of him is affected.

587
00:50:55,434 --> 00:51:00,885
- If the head is affected, then...
- Hey, wanna shut the fuck up?

588
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:03,885
- ...all of him is affected.
- Yo!

589
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:06,805
- Got a problem?
- Your bullshit's making me sick.

590
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:10,475
Don't insult the holy word.

591
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:12,725
Suck my dick, asshole.

592
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:24,639
- What's the problem here, guys?
- There ain't no problem, Officer.

593
00:51:28,224 --> 00:51:28,724
Sit down.

594
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:47,635
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

595
00:51:47,635 --> 00:51:48,222
Fuck you.

596
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:52,972
Make nice, Ross. If you can't
handle that, take a walk.

597
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:55,921
Fuck you too.

598
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:02,505
Everybody sit down.

599
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:07,032
He was making fun of the
word of God, Minister.

600
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:12,036
God does not need you to
defend him from a moron.

601
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:16,146
What God needs you to do is to
rein in your basic instincts.

602
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:19,896
What God needs you to do is
be a little patient, brother.

603
00:52:19,951 --> 00:52:23,589
The more of these little
skirmishes you get involved in,

604
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:29,695
is the more you weaken the
holy war we're about to fight.

605
00:52:29,695 --> 00:52:32,130
- So where you from, Minister?
- From?

606
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:38,318
Yeah, where you from? You're
not from the ghetto, right?

607
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,118
I was born in the ghetto.

608
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:43,835
But unlike most, I got out.

609
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:48,994
I have traveled the world, Huseni,
studied the great religions.

610
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:53,023
And I have sat at the knee of
mystics, shaman, and madmen.

611
00:52:53,023 --> 00:52:55,023
I know the world, Huseni.

612
00:52:55,565 --> 00:53:00,115
Yeah, well, maybe you been on the mountaintop
so long you forgot where you came from.

613
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:04,115
I have not forgotten who I am.

614
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:13,692
Well, maybe Allah sent me to remind you.

615
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:25,552
Hey, Imam Said's moving
slow, man. It worries me.

616
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:28,176
He knows best, brother.

617
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:32,485
Yeah, well, he's blessed by Allah and all
that, but that don't mean he can't be wrong.

618
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:33,485
So?

619
00:53:36,939 --> 00:53:43,905
So, I'm thinking he might be more valuable
to us as a symbol rather than a leader.

620
00:53:43,905 --> 00:53:47,405
A symbol? What do you mean?

621
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:54,589
Nothing, man, nothing.
I'm just talking smack.

622
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:56,339
I'm just wasting time.

623
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:11,781
Huseni.

624
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:14,552
What, what? What? What?

625
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,552
Imam, what?

626
00:54:19,347 --> 00:54:21,977
- My heart.
- You're having a heart attack.

627
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:23,477
Call the doctor.

628
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:27,914
It is the hand of God.
It is the will of Allah.

629
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:30,914
Help me, help me!

630
00:54:32,824 --> 00:54:35,574
You must go ahead and die.

631
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:54,076
All those little aches and pains,
eventually, they add up to something.

632
00:54:54,076 --> 00:54:57,076
Body, mind. Body, mind.

633
00:54:57,554 --> 00:55:00,433
They gotta work together,
or they don't work at all.

634
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:06,741
You gotta take care of your body.
You gotta take care of your mind.

635
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:10,252
You gotta love your
body. Most people don't.

636
00:55:10,252 --> 00:55:13,370
Most people hate their bodies.

637
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,104
You gotta get your
mind to love your body.

638
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,103
Even if you're fat around the neck
or even if things don't work

639
00:55:19,104 --> 00:55:23,798
like they're supposed to,
you gotta love your body.

640
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:28,436
Cause it's all you got to
hold onto. It's all you got.

641
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:30,434
I'll make a deal with you.

642
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:34,923
I'll love your body, if you love mine.
