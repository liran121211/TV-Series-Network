OZ

2
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:14,344
First Season
- Episode #5 Straight Life

3
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:18,185
Original Airdate: August 4, 1997

4
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,126
Floods.

5
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:48,870
You know how you always hear about them people in Iowa or
Missouri or wherever how some big river always overflows?

6
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:56,178
The fucking water keeps pouring over its riverbanks, out of
control, taking out farms and towns and everything in its path.

7
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,165
Everybody tries to
stop it, but nobody can.

8
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,888
Everybody's lives are wiped out.

9
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:09,739
Completely destroyed.

10
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,344
And the fucking river,
it don't give a shit.

11
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:17,972
It just keeps rising.

12
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:29,426
Year after year after fucked up year.

13
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:36,055
My question is, are them hicks in
the midwest whacked out or what?

14
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:40,539
This one joker I seen on TV, his
home had been washed away four times.

15
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,162
Four fucking times.

16
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,423
Why don't he just leave?

17
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:47,564
Why don't he jump in that pickup
and drive to higher ground?

18
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:49,990
Or is he like us in Oz?

19
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,930
There ain't no higher ground.

20
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:14,859
Yeah, what I'm saying is that
your officers are doing a shit job.

21
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:18,647
The whole concept behind Emerald City is
that you never take your eyes off anyone.

22
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:19,463
We don't.

23
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:22,979
Well, then how do you explain Beecher
getting a swastika burned onto his ass

24
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,367
or Miguel Alvarez
cutting his face all up

25
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:28,680
or inmates using classrooms
to snort fucking heroin?

26
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,798
It's life, Tim. Shit slides through.

27
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:32,768
If you don't like the way
I run things, replace me.

28
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:35,586
You know I'm not gonna do that, Diane.

29
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:39,435
Why? Cause we're fucking each other?

30
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,200
Sorry we're late.

31
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:46,643
If you ever got here on time, McManus,
I think I'd have a heart attack.

32
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,452
What are we talking about?

33
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:48,996
Drugs.

34
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:50,868
My favorite topic.

35
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:53,641
The more we try and stop the
drugs, the more the drugs get in.

36
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:54,663
Well, what do you expect?

37
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:57,790
Outside, they're sentencing
dealers to much longer prison time.

38
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,408
Yeah, we got a prison full of guys who are
experts at moving shit through any system.

39
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,300
Nino Schibetta's got the biggest operation.
We stop him, we make a major dent.

40
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,169
McManus, you wanted Schibetta in Em
City. You said you could reach him.

41
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,401
I will, in time.

42
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:14,110
Unfortunately, that's one of
the many things we don't have.

43
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,493
I know. When it comes to drugs,
there are two major players involved:

44
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,990
Nino Schibetta and Kareem Said.

45
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,135
Muslims are anti-drugs.

46
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:23,193
Exactly.

47
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,552
We want your help stopping the flow.

48
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,362
That's your job, not mine.

49
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:31,165
You know everything about this place. You
could tell us the whens and the wheres.

50
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:36,028
Yes, and end up dead. No thank you.

51
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,489
I have to take care of
this disease my own way.

52
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:39,645
Which is?

53
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,184
By fighting the addiction.

54
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:46,571
Well, you see, that's what I'm trying
to do with my counseling sessions.

55
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,940
You know, you and I have
exact same goals, Kareem,

56
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,405
only because of who we are we can't
help each other acheive these goals.

57
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:57,398
So more inmates get hurt.

58
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,712
It is so frustrating.

59
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,845
Sister, we both believe
in a greater power.

60
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,385
His will be done.

61
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,708
His will or yours?

62
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:14,156
Yeah, well, in my experience, God isn't too
helpful unless you give him a little nudge.

63
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,270
What now?

64
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:27,861
Schibetta's drugs fuck
with people's heads.

65
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,582
It's time I start fucking with his.

66
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:32,454
The last couple of weeks
have been tough on you, Nino.

67
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:35,363
Your wife dying,

68
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:39,121
Dino Ortolani murdered, Joey
D'Angelo out of commission.

69
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:44,928
Overall, your troops are thinning.
They're getting older, they're more anemic.

70
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:49,536
Now, the blacks and Latinos are taking
over, on the streets and in here.

71
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,784
So we gotta face it, the
days of the Mafia are over.

72
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,072
Who calls it Mafia?

73
00:05:56,072 --> 00:06:04,300
OK, OK. Let's just say you're at an age,
you outta start to relax a little bit.

74
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,759
Now, I got a friend, DEA.

75
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,119
He says you wanna
talk, he'll make a deal.

76
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,047
A deal?

77
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,241
What's he gonna do, put
me in witness protection?

78
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,945
You are a fool, McManus.

79
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,735
Now, you can try for the next thousand years
not to be a fool, but you'll always be one.

80
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:25,104
Well, I can't change neither.

81
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:28,015
I can't turn my back on who I am.

82
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,020
Certainly not for you.

83
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,519
Certainly not for some dumbass DEA deal.

84
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:37,606
You done with me?

85
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,889
For now.

86
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:41,956
Attention!

87
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,715
The following inmates are to
be transferred immediately.

88
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:51,036
As I call your name, gather your belongings
and form a line by Officer Vogelsang.

89
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,359
88P715, Ottovino.

90
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,538
91J224, Jenbro.

91
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,959
85P661, Pellicano.

92
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,517
94R511, Ricatta.

93
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,584
Arrividerci, baby.

94
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:03,897
Chocolate bars.

95
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:04,888
Pecans or without?

96
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:05,998
Both.

97
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,386
You got it.

98
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:12,829
Graci.

99
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:16,566
You been handling things pretty good
around here since Joey's accident.

100
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,163
- You do what you gotta do.
- That's right.

101
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:25,825
The bad blood between you boys and
us, well, with Jefferson Keane cold,

102
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,502
I'm willing to let bygones be gone.

103
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:29,847
Yeah, me too.

104
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,612
You like tits?

105
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,133
Who doesn't?

106
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,734
My tits are firm and round.

107
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,897
Maybe you could suck my tits.

108
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,747
There are a lot of
brothers who would love to.

109
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:47,733
If you fuck me over,
I'll cut this hand off.

110
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,227
What the hell was that about?

111
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:03,484
The future, my brother.

112
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,956
Us owning the future.

113
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:13,349
Tits. That's what we call drugs.

114
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,407
60% of the violence in
prison is due to tits.

115
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:25,295
Either people not paying their debts or people
trying to control the traffic. The traffic.

116
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:31,303
Here in Oz the last few days the
traffic has been bumper to bumper.

117
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,537
Prisoner number 94P442,
Ronald Poklewaldt.

118
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:50,693
Convicted March 8, '94.
Arson in the second degree.

119
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:55,698
Sentence: 25 years. Up for parole in 10.

120
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,746
Hey.

121
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,070
Hey, don't touch me.

122
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,157
Oh, so you're hiding behind
the bitch's skirt now, huh?

123
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:23,088
You hurt me, she'll see you.

124
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:24,351
I just want my money.

125
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:26,387
Next week I'm getting a check.

126
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:28,159
You said that last week.

127
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,251
I know, I know, but I can't be
held responsible for the U.S. mail.

128
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:34,006
Ow, shit!

129
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,116
Let's go.

130
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:40,136
- No money, no tits.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,594
Tomorrow we get healthy.
I want you boys to...

132
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:53,481
- Who you calling "boys", old man?
- Kenny, shut the fuck up. Take a walk.

133
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:56,378
- But I'm saying, how you gonna let him just call...?
- Be gone, little nigger.

134
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:01,704
Look, Nino,

135
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,032
I wanna be there when the shit comes in.

136
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,080
Where's it happen?

137
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,301
Sorry.

138
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:09,403
It's an old family
recipe. We don't share.

139
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:14,749
Hey, if we're gonna be partners, yo, we just
outta be up on how big a risk we gotta take.

140
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:18,024
- Just knowing it works ain't enough?
- No, man.

141
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:22,342
All right.

142
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:31,198
So how's it work, Nino?

143
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:34,413
We know it doesn't go from the
kitchen, otherwise we'd have seen it.

144
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:37,979
Kitchen's the first place
the cops would look. No,

145
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,840
we use the post office.

146
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,475
Hold this.

147
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:50,008
A box of socks from my sister. Versace.

148
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:53,717
It's an old trick.

149
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,458
It still works.

150
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,327
Yeah, but, where do you cut it?

151
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:01,511
- Here.
- Here?

152
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,403
Here, where?

153
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:06,127
I ain't telling you everything.

154
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:09,656
At least not until we've been
in business a little longer.

155
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:13,339
All right. Cool.

156
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,269
Fuck him.

157
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,505
I don't wanna do no
business with no dago.

158
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:23,031
- Hey, how's it going?
- Man, we won't be for long.

159
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:23,951
Schibetta's weak.

160
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,952
He done already lost a lot of his men.

161
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:29,757
All we got to do is find
out how his operation works,

162
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,077
then we take it over.

163
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,596
- Nino?
- Yeah?

164
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:38,054
My offer still stands. I wanna be here
for you. I wanna help you any way I can.

165
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:40,613
OK, kid, thanks.

166
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,818
I said "ok", ok?

167
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,016
OK.

168
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:56,579
I'll testify against Adebisi,
Markstrom, and Wangler.

169
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,868
We need to figure out
how the drugs get in.

170
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:05,469
You got any idea how the gangsters are doing it?
- No. No, I don't. I don't.

171
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,193
You find out, you let me know.

172
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:12,017
Oh, I'll find out all right, and
then I want you to bust Adebisi's ass.

173
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,308
Ronnie,

174
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:18,705
been to drug counseling recently?
- Sure, sure. I go all the time.

175
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:21,691
Sister Peter Marie says you
haven't been there for two weeks.

176
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:24,543
I'll go today. I promise.

177
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,342
Get lost, punk. You aren't squeezing
my tits anymore. You never pay.

178
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:49,648
No, no, no, that's not why I'm here.

179
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:52,531
Markstrom and his crew, how
they getting their shit into Oz?

180
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:57,185
What're you doing? You
doing market research now?

181
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:01,227
No, man, I'm looking to
fuck those niggers up.

182
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:07,794
Well, I don't know how they do
it, but I got a couple of guesses.

183
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,250
Sit your ass down.

184
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:46,727
- Nino, let's talk about this.
- Come on.

185
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:53,767
You stay out.

186
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,303
It's all right, Kenny. It's all right.

187
00:14:57,017 --> 00:15:00,398
Me and my associates are very
unhappy about this morning's events.

188
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,089
- How did this happen?
- Nino...

189
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,668
My operation's been running
smooth as a silk shirt.

190
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:07,459
I tell you what's what,
and suddenly the hacks know.

191
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:11,128
I gotta wonder if one of your boys is the jabber.
- Aw, come on, man, that's impossible.

192
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:14,659
Anything is possible! You want
to stay in business with me?

193
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,580
Find the leak and plug the leak today.

194
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,935
Don't worry about it. We'll take
care of it, all right? Come on.

195
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,378
Adebisi, stay.

196
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,409
- What's that?
- I don't know, man, but watch him.

197
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,976
Secrets. We all got secrets.

198
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,737
Mostly our secrets are
tied to our addictions,

199
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,549
our obsessions.

200
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:40,333
You like that bourbon too much?

201
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,086
You get off eating chicks with dicks.

202
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:44,762
You gotta do it in hiding.

203
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:48,806
You say you somebody but
you really somebody else.

204
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:53,921
Only things that matter to
us most, do we keep a secret.

205
00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,875
And sometimes, those
secrets will kill you.

206
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:09,826
Fuck!

207
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,628
Cut him down.

208
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:22,307
- Markstrom didn't strike me as the suicide type.
- He wasn't.

209
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,273
I'm sorry, Leo.

210
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,517
For what?

211
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,870
- He was your cousin.
- He's not my cousin.

212
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,748
What are you talking about?

213
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,037
That's what you told me when he came in.

214
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,410
That's why you wanted him in Em City.

215
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,779
He's not my cousin. He's
a narc, an undercover cop.

216
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,780
You put an undercover cop in my cell block
and you don't even fucking mention it to me?

217
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,221
Look, I'm trying to put some
brakes on the drug traffic.

218
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:44,453
I get city Narcotics to send in a man,

219
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,194
I figure the less people that
know about it, the better.

220
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:48,315
Even so, you shoulda told me, Leo.

221
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:52,580
And what? Listen to you lecture on prisoners'
rights? About entrapment? No, thanks.

222
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,642
So let me get this straight, Markstrom's
been feeding you info all along?

223
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,436
The idea was to get him
in good with the gangsters,

224
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,048
get him to find out
about their operation.

225
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,262
But somebody gave him up.

226
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:04,391
Yeah, who?

227
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,543
One of these monkeys in Narcotics
must be talking to the mob.

228
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,762
What? Oh, yes, Governor.

229
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:16,151
Yes. Yeah, I know. Goodbye.

230
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,912
This time, he wants a lockdown.

231
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:22,720
Oh, Devlin's fighting
for his political life.

232
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,023
He's trying to take the focus
off him and put it on us.

233
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,158
Yeah, I know. But the bottom
line is, I was gonna do it anyway.

234
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:33,807
Until we nail whoever's responsible for
Markstrom's murder, I'm locking Oz down, tight.

235
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:39,140
Man, who woulda thought
Markstrom was a cop?

236
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,651
- Makes you sick, don't it?
- Yeah.

237
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:43,055
Makes you wonder who
else is under cover.

238
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,085
Could be anybody.

239
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,356
Could be you.

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,183
Could be you.

241
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:58,764
Hey, Nino.

242
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:03,031
The hacks didn't buy
Markstrom's suicide.

243
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,919
I didn't they think would.

244
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,917
It was more a sign to Glynn.

245
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,419
Don't fuck with us.

246
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,017
Yeah, now they're gonna lock
down this whole fucking place.

247
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:14,051
For a little while.

248
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,565
And the smuggling
operation, it's busted.

249
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,544
The post office thing?

250
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,844
That's not the way we really do it.

251
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,714
That was just a test to see
what you boys were made of.

252
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,621
The truth is, I'd never
tell you the truth.

253
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:35,684
The fastest way to end this lockdown

254
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,578
is to pick one of your gang

255
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:40,022
and have him cop to
the Markstrom hanging.

256
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,822
OK.

257
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,995
I always thought Keane and
Markstrom were holding you back.

258
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:54,274
From the get-go, you were a guy
that sees how the world gets made.

259
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,682
Adebisi.

260
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:00,854
Ends in "I".

261
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:02,271
Sure you're not Italian?

262
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:03,967
Schibetta ends in "A".

263
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,993
Maybe you African.

264
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,221
Lockdown, gentlemen, lockdown!

265
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,585
Today, Adebisi!

266
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:29,212
Lockdown, gentlemen, lockdown.

267
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:44,121
Man, I fucking hate lockdowns.

268
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:48,349
I mean getting trapped
in this fucking fishbowl,

269
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:54,319
man, I start fiending
for some fucking tits.

270
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:58,362
You a tit boy, Groves?

271
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,565
Drugs are bad.

272
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,108
Bullshit.

273
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:05,144
Man, you had to be fucked
up when you ate your mother.

274
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,736
Mom told me that drugs were bad.

275
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:11,833
Right. I bet you were a
good little boy, right?

276
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,050
Did everything your mama told you to.

277
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,737
I like your scars.

278
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:25,929
Now I know why McManus put
us in the same cell together.

279
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,918
You're the only motherfucker in
Em City more fucked up than I am.

280
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,724
Here.

281
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:37,368
I don't wanna write anybody a fucking
letter. I wanna get fucking high.

282
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,247
- You lick the back.
- Lick the back?

283
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:45,869
It's liquid LSD.

284
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,609
Groves,

285
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,050
this gives stamp collecting
a whole new meaning, baby.

286
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,124
I don't have to tell you, drugs ain't
the only things to get addicted to.

287
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:07,378
Some people mainline their
work, some people snort ESPN,

288
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:10,062
some people needle pop gambling.

289
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:15,281
There are those that shoot up junk
food, fine wine, cohibas, baby.

290
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:17,706
Some people get hooked on love.

291
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,779
And like any fiend on the street,

292
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,723
you always need another
bump. Just one more bump, man,

293
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,785
just one more bump.

294
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:38,374
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:41,784
What's the matter?

296
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:46,871
Markstrom was murdered.

297
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,921
He was a cop.

298
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:50,553
I feel responsible.

299
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:54,830
Diane, Van Harris
confessed to the murder.

300
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,026
Yeah, well, even so. Maybe you're right.

301
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,441
Maybe I am doing a shit job here.

302
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:02,126
You know what, I got an idea.

303
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:04,337
Tonight after work you come to my place.

304
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:08,453
I can't, I gotta drive home.
Mom says Didi's been acting up.

305
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:11,284
I wanna meet your daughter.

306
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:15,073
Why don't you bring her into town,
three of us will go to dinner?

307
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:16,646
And then what'll I do with her?

308
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:21,009
This isn't exactly a take your
daughter to work kind of place.

309
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,231
I love you, Diane.

310
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:25,106
Do you?

311
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:29,448
No, you're supposed to
say, "I love you too, Tim."

312
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,244
The night of Keane's
execution, you know,

313
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:40,659
what we did, it was really fucked up.

314
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,499
And I don't know why.

315
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,514
Was it loneliness?

316
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,664
Why does the why matter?

317
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,744
Well, it doesn't, does it?

318
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,830
I came up here to get the
file on the new arrival.

319
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:11,976
His name is Scott Ross.

320
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,090
Scott Ross?

321
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,603
- Oh, shit.
- Is there a problem?

322
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,783
Nah, it's nothing I can't handle.

323
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:39,293
Prisoner number 97R518, Scott Ross.

324
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,847
Convicted June 4, '97.

325
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:45,191
Possession of marijuana
with intent to distribute.

326
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:49,854
Third conviction. Sentence:
Life without parole.

327
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:52,811
Three strikes, sucker!

328
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,276
- Wait here.
- Sure.

329
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,645
Since when you been working Oz?

330
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,416
About six months.

331
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,275
This is great.

332
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,413
No, no it's not.

333
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,981
Always dreamed of you
having me in cuffs.

334
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:20,375
Look, just because we knew each other in a former
life, doesn't mean you're getting any special treatment.

335
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,040
I love it when you play tough.

336
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,130
I'm not playing, Scott. Mack?

337
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,062
Mark Mack, Scott Ross.

338
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:30,940
Mack is your sponsor. He'll help
you get acquainted with the rules.

339
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,359
Take him to Em City.

340
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,210
You knew her on the outside?

341
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,133
Yeah. Me and her ex
used to ride together.

342
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:54,261
In there. Top bunk, all right?

343
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:09,829
All right, gentlemen,
the lockdown is over.

344
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,257
Hey.

345
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,904
I'm gonna give you ten minutes
to get your hands off my dick.

346
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,833
- Schillinger, you fuck.
- Scotty, how long you in for?

347
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,847
Life.

348
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,343
Oh, man.

349
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,647
What?

350
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:58,208
You got any cigarettes?

351
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,924
No smoking. Put the butt out.

352
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:12,489
Diane, I'm not asking
for any special favors but

353
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,176
we've known each other for a long time.

354
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,023
Have we?

355
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,593
I was married to Glen
for four fun filled years.

356
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:23,586
During that time, you were
finishing up a six year sentence.

357
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:27,078
We were on the road
together maybe five months.

358
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:29,332
They were a great five months.

359
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,067
All you did was come on to me.

360
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:35,445
If Glen hadn't been so fucked
up on coke, he'd have noticed.

361
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:38,206
I was a man in love. I still am.

362
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,256
Oh, please. Save it for the shower room.

363
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,714
Diane, I know what
your life is like now,

364
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,694
raising a kid on your own,
working midnights shifts.

365
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:47,608
I hear you're doing double
shifts cause you need the money.

366
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,675
I got a way to make you money.

367
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:55,187
You looking out for
my best interests, huh?

368
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:57,454
Yeah.

369
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,833
Like I said, save it.

370
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,083
Get your ass back to Em City.

371
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,501
Next item, overtime.

372
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:16,150
The good news is, based on the successful conclusion
of negotiations between the Department of Corrections

373
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,997
and the Officers' Union,
we have a contract.

374
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:26,519
The bad news is, because the
overtime rate is now so high,

375
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,793
the Commissioner has decided to no longer
allow officers to work double shifts.

376
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,493
What? This sucks!

377
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,464
The department gave in
to the union's demands,

378
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:39,615
knowing they never intended
to pay any overtime?

379
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,821
That's how deals get made.

380
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,722
Hey, what're you
complaining about, lady Di?

381
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,847
Frees you up to spend more
time with your boyfriend.

382
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:49,282
What are you talking about?

383
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,489
Yeah, Healy, what're you trying to say?

384
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,071
You two wanna pretend you're
not fucking each other, fine.

385
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,503
You're a funny guy, you know that?

386
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,591
Knock it off, you two!

387
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,133
McManus! McManus, sit down!

388
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,298
- You fucking prick.
- Sit down!

389
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:09,867
Healy, keep your comments to yourself.

390
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:14,137
Next item.

391
00:28:19,794 --> 00:28:20,880
Fuck them.

392
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,209
No, Timmy, it's not that easy.

393
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:24,951
Like it or not, we
work with these people.

394
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:27,672
If they don't respect us, it
makes the day ten times harder.

395
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,292
Are you saying we can't
see each other anymore?

396
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,135
Look, this job is all I
have. Do you understand that?

397
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:36,588
You have a college education,
a big time reputation.

398
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:39,738
If I lose this, it's back to
cleaning other people's houses.

399
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:41,726
It's welfare.

400
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:44,331
I have a daughter to feed
and a mother getting old.

401
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,203
I can give you money.

402
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:46,956
You have alimony and a mortgage,

403
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:49,705
you can't afford to take me
on. And I wouldn't want you to.

404
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:51,287
- I know.
- No, I'll see you, Tim.

405
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,576
We both know cigarettes
is money in the joint.

406
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:03,760
Want someone to do your
laundry, a couple of sticks.

407
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,167
Want someone to get
rolled, a carton or two,

408
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,307
depending on who it is.

409
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:13,980
Problem is, they got a
really short shelf life.

410
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,502
You can't hold 'em,
you gotta keep moving.

411
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:22,369
Supply and demand, baby,
that's what I'm talking about.

412
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,090
I bring 'em in, you sell 'em.

413
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:32,681
Carton a day, that's it.
Come on, what do you say?

414
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:36,876
OK.

415
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,445
Put the cigarette out.

416
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,001
That's my baby.

417
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,383
Not all drugs are recreational.

418
00:29:58,383 --> 00:30:00,971
Some are benign or,

419
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:02,063
supposedly benign.

420
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:06,645
I got the final results back from your
tests. You're suffering from hypertension.

421
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,113
The curse of my people.

422
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:15,567
African Americans are genetically
predisposed to the condition.

423
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,789
No, Doctor, it's not genetics.

424
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,261
High blood pressure is caused by racism.

425
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:25,330
There are some studies out suggesting a link
between racial discrimination and hypertension,

426
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,120
but the data is inconclusive.

427
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,284
Well, it may be inconclusive
to the scientists,

428
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,535
but I know that it's a fact.

429
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:35,157
Men of color in the working class have
a higher blood pressure than whites,

430
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:37,794
or even black professionals. Why?

431
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,201
Because we are forced to
accept unfair treatment, Doctor.

432
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:45,237
I'm not really interested in the
politics, Said, I care about your health.

433
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:48,923
And if we don't do something, you're
headed for heart disease, stroke,

434
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:52,795
damage to the other organs. So
I'm going to prescribe Zoltanolin.

435
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,686
What are the side effects?

436
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:58,450
Low heartbeat,

437
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,950
lightheadedness if you
stand up too quickly.

438
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,556
That's won't do.

439
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:05,182
Daily I kneel and I pray to Mecca.

440
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:06,439
What else do you have?

441
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:10,529
Callum. Constipation, nausea, dizziness.

442
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:14,036
No. My mind must function clearly.

443
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:17,070
All drugs have side effects.

444
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,573
Well, perhaps that's God's way of
telling us we shouldn't be taking them.

445
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:22,638
Either you taking
something, or you'll die.

446
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:29,628
Believe me, Doctor, I
have no intention of dying.

447
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:31,087
Can I go now?

448
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:33,005
Sure.

449
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,974
I'm sorry that you're ill.

450
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:58,361
And who told you that I was ill?

451
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:00,069
God.

452
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:05,351
Oh, yes. You talk to God.

453
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,875
When he's in town.

454
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,809
Well, in Islam, we believe that only
two people spoke to God directly.

455
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:15,941
Mohammad, and praise
be to him, and Moses.

456
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:18,386
So, you see, you are
in excellent company.

457
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:20,198
You think I'm lying or deluded.

458
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,369
Oh, yeah.

459
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:22,994
I may well be.

460
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:26,491
I do know sometimes I can
see inside men's souls.

461
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,865
And can you see into mine, old man?

462
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,429
Yes.

463
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:31,853
And what is there?

464
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:33,342
Anger.

465
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,793
Yes, I am angry.

466
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:42,249
I am angry at a society that cripples
my people and infects their bodies.

467
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,223
No, you're angry at God.

468
00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:48,934
I am not.

469
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:51,965
My illness is Allah's will

470
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:55,214
and I accept the bad as well
as the good that God gives me.

471
00:32:55,214 --> 00:32:58,310
Still, you're angry at him and afraid.

472
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,954
Afraid of dying.

473
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,331
That is not true.

474
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:07,524
You watched Jefferson
Keane die, die gladly.

475
00:33:07,524 --> 00:33:10,561
Keane embraced death like a
lover, like a traveler going home.

476
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:11,862
You saw that and you were afraid.

477
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:14,404
You realized you
aren't as willing to go.

478
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,823
Get out of here, old man.

479
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,105
Go.

480
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:51,899
The ever-increasing scandal surrounding Governor James
Devlin accepting kickbacks took another bizarre turn today,

481
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,534
when his wife Evangeline Devlin
moved out of the Governor's mansion.

482
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,075
Though no official word has been
given, sources say that Mrs. Devlin

483
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:00,830
has learned of an affair
between the Governor and...

484
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,500
The doctor told me what's going on.

485
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,244
That is not your concern, McManus.

486
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:05,668
He told me you won't
take your medication.

487
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,384
I haven't decided anything as yet.

488
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:12,120
Well, you don't have a
choice. Take the drugs.

489
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,488
And what if I refuse?

490
00:34:13,488 --> 00:34:15,621
- I'll force you to.
- How?

491
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:19,629
We'll open up your mouth and I'll
stuff the pills down your throat myself.

492
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:24,568
OK, let's make that deal, McManus.

493
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:25,896
Give me what I want.

494
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,405
I can't tell you much about
how the drugs get into Oz,

495
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:34,190
except to say look at your own house.

496
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:35,856
What's that mean?

497
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:52,387
- That's a pretty big accusation.
- Not really.

498
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:55,907
There are plenty of examples of
officers smuggling drugs into prisons.

499
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:59,053
Solidad, Attica, here in Oz in '82.

500
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,040
I remember. I was working solitary.

501
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,647
- Two of my best friends got busted.
- So, then?

502
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:05,727
- I'll start an investigation.
- Good.

503
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:10,233
Of the entire staff. Everyone from
the officers to the librarian to you.

504
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,568
I'll take it slow, because if it's true,

505
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,608
I don't wanna spook them.

506
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:16,411
I want to make the charges stick.

507
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,187
Hey, Roger.

508
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:19,742
Hey, morning, Mike.

509
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,445
- See the Toronto game?
- Yeah, Gaston's a spaz.

510
00:35:22,445 --> 00:35:24,459
- How much'd you lose?
- Don't ask.

511
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:34,868
Hey, Diane. You heading out?

512
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:35,956
Yep.

513
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,288
This graveyard shift's a killer.

514
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:06,081
- O'Reily.
- Yeah?

515
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,211
Go see Schibetta.

516
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:09,572
Since when are you his Western Union?

517
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:10,923
Since we partners.

518
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:12,327
- We?
- Yeah.

519
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:15,370
You're the monkey chained
to his organ grinder.

520
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:18,064
Better watch that pretty little ass.

521
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,303
No need. You're too
busy watching it for me.

522
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:23,055
And keep your fucking hands off me.

523
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,824
Oh, I'm scared of you.

524
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,115
You wanted to see me, Nino?

525
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,254
Yeah, come on in.

526
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:36,685
No, thanks. I've never
been big on tomatoes.

527
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:41,205
You Irish. You got no appreciation
for the simple things in life.

528
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:43,042
What's simpler than a potato?

529
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:44,400
Sit.

530
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:50,775
You been saying if I need it,
you'd be willing to help out.

531
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,856
Anything.

532
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:54,512
You know Adebisi's gonna shank
you the first chance he gets.

533
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,428
Don't worry about Adebisi.

534
00:36:57,122 --> 00:36:59,713
He's a mongrel, but effective.

535
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:03,550
From you I need a more
sophisticated favor.

536
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:07,182
I need to close down
Healy's drug operation.

537
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:09,965
Healy? Officer Healy?

538
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:12,512
Don't say you know nothing about it.

539
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:15,228
Your brother and Healy are friends.

540
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,683
Healy's been your archangel
since you got to Oz.

541
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:19,104
You been running tits for him.

542
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:19,835
You know, I don't know what you're...

543
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:23,382
I don't hold it against
you. I'd have done the same.

544
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:26,444
Only, Healy's business is
starting to cut into mine

545
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,198
and that I can't have happen.

546
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:32,877
So I am looking to you for assistance.

547
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,867
You want me to set him up?

548
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:40,295
Yeah. If you do, I promise I'll
take care of you. What do you say?

549
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:42,316
You've been good to me.

550
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:44,683
Is that your answer?

551
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:52,743
I'll do it.

552
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,903
- Bueni.
- So what's the plan?

553
00:37:56,361 --> 00:38:00,122
The plan is up to you. I
don't care about the hows.

554
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:01,618
Just get it done.

555
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:03,740
All right.

556
00:38:13,193 --> 00:38:15,397
- I need more tits.
- Oh, yeah?

557
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:17,393
I gave you a huge pair
a couple of days ago.

558
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:19,783
What can I say? We
go braless in Em City.

559
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:21,643
When can you get us some more?

560
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,263
Later.

561
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:31,384
- Yo, you looking for me?
- Yeah.

562
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,047
How'd you like some tits for free?

563
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,346
I don't kill.

564
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,526
You don't have to kill.

565
00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:37,933
What do you want to do?

566
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,131
Go see your pals upstairs.

567
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:41,513
And tell 'em what?

568
00:38:41,513 --> 00:38:43,855
Tell 'em that you found
another drug connection.

569
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,608
- Well, who you gonna bust this time?
- Me.

570
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,720
McManus! Get him out of here!

571
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,833
That's going on your record.

572
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,554
Big fucking deal.

573
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,987
I gave this place everything I had.

574
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,665
And then you decided to
take everything you could.

575
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,776
Look, I know working
here is no paradise,

576
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:34,852
but you swore an oath
and you broke that oath!

577
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,374
I got no sympathy for you.

578
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:38,531
Get him away from me.

579
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,638
You wait, Warden. You
wait 'til you need somebody

580
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,463
to back you up and I won't be here.

581
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,024
Then you can kiss your ass goodbye!

582
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:55,050
Will you testify against Healy?

583
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,992
No.

584
00:39:56,907 --> 00:40:01,329
I jabber on him, every other hack will be
waiting in line to take a whack at me too.

585
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:03,538
Fine. Officer Hunt?

586
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:08,013
See you in a month, O'Reily.

587
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:16,927
Hey, O'Reily, any idea
who ratted on Healy?

588
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:20,501
Beats the shit outta me.

589
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:26,601
But if I were a betting man,
I'd put my money on Poklewaldt.

590
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,470
Patient's name is Ronald Poklewaldt.

591
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,222
It's severe head trauma.

592
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:42,958
How are the vital signs?

593
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:03,815
Let me out of here!

594
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:13,193
You're done.

595
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:16,627
Piece of cake.

596
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,581
Look, what is this fucking
pinocchio? I don't play games.

597
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:40,135
How do you keep that
hat on your head, velcro?

598
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:42,190
- Deal me in.
- Play Pinochle?

599
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,912
No, I can learn.

600
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:46,942
Adebisi, I'll see you later.

601
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,462
OK, each player gets four cards.

602
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:01,864
One card, face up, that's the...

603
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:13,188
You're in a mood.

604
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:22,701
I'm in a mood, all right.
I'm in a mood to kill.

605
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,168
Anybody in particular?

606
00:42:29,743 --> 00:42:31,988
The mick and dago.

607
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,059
Yeah, well, I can go for a
piece of Schibetta's ass myself.

608
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:44,932
Yeah, well, stick around, little brother.
When the time is right, he's all yours.

609
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,851
He's all mine.

610
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:55,018
You take a drug, right. The
chemicals, they rush through your body,

611
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:56,897
rush through your brain.

612
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:58,918
And the sensations,

613
00:42:58,918 --> 00:43:02,183
you want the sensations
again and again and again.

614
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:09,063
But let me tell you, you can also get
addicted to grief, to guilt, to hate.

615
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:10,477
Cause when you feel dead inside,

616
00:43:10,477 --> 00:43:14,589
even bad sensations make
you feel like you're alive.

617
00:43:23,763 --> 00:43:25,975
What, that's it? No good night kiss?

618
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:34,603
I'm beginning to think
you don't love my anymore.

619
00:43:34,603 --> 00:43:35,671
I do.

620
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,050
Say it. Say you love me.

621
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,946
I love you.

622
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:43,460
No, you see, you said it
but you didn't mean it.

623
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:45,264
I do mean it, sir.

624
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:48,821
No, I'm telling you, the romance
has gone out of our relationship.

625
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,441
But, I have a cure.

626
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,167
I was saving this for your birthday,

627
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:59,388
but I think we need it now.

628
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,040
No, thanks.

629
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:06,444
Come on, you're gonna hurt my feelings.

630
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:09,326
You know what happens
when you hurt my feelings.

631
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:14,814
Put some on.

632
00:44:15,804 --> 00:44:16,862
No.

633
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:21,978
OK. Hey, I understand.

634
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,378
You wanna surprise me.

635
00:44:24,753 --> 00:44:28,237
Gonna wait for a special occasion
to get yourself all prettied up.

636
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:32,968
That is so sweet.

637
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:38,776
Hey, I can wait. Not too long.

638
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:25,522
What? A nun can't look beautiful?

639
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,053
Tobias, are you all right?

640
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:36,870
Sure.

641
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:46,786
You think I'm blind?
I'm a drug counselor,

642
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:50,737
for God's sake. If I can't spot the
signs, I might as well tear up my license.

643
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,682
I don't know what you're talking about.

644
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:58,956
Listen, I know how
hideous life is in Oz,

645
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:04,132
especially for a man like you with no streets skills,
no preparation for the reality of it all but, Tobias,

646
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:06,038
Tobias,

647
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:08,280
drugs are not the answer.

648
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,075
They only make the
questions more difficult.

649
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:19,024
I want you to start coming
to counseling sessions.

650
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,962
Whatever.

651
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,641
I'm not sure when he started

652
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:33,284
but my sense is not too long ago.

653
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:35,835
I'm hoping that we can
nip this in the bud.

654
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,751
Well, I'll have the officers on
duty monitor Beecher carefully

655
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:40,464
and see who he's hanging out with.

656
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,113
Well, it can't be
Schillinger who's supplying.

657
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:44,608
He's so antidrug,

658
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:47,129
he makes me look like Robert Downey Jr.

659
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:50,605
Maybe we should also talk
to members of his family.

660
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:52,340
Well, his wife took
the kids and moved away,

661
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,130
but he does have parents and siblings.

662
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,416
What about an intervention?

663
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:57,999
I think that's too much, too soon.

664
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:01,195
But why don't we invite one of his
relatives to visit him and see what happens?

665
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:03,622
You know, on the outside, Beecher
had a history of alcohol abuse.

666
00:47:03,622 --> 00:47:06,244
Oh, I know. How pathetic is that?

667
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:09,783
The man gets jailed for one addiction
and we watch him get hooked on another.

668
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:36,321
You smell good, Mother.

669
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:38,879
The same old Chanel, I'm afraid.

670
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:41,491
I remember you and Dad
getting ready to go out,

671
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:45,068
him putting on his tux,
you wearing the latest gown,

672
00:47:45,465 --> 00:47:47,762
and that scent wafting through the air.

673
00:47:50,594 --> 00:47:54,274
But that was a long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away.

674
00:47:55,977 --> 00:48:07,910
Toby, I had a conversation with the
man who runs the place where you live.

675
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:08,845
McManus?

676
00:48:10,436 --> 00:48:14,065
He told me that he
suspects you of using drugs.

677
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:19,439
- Mother...
- Tell me.

678
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:26,038
Mother, you don't know
what it's like in here.

679
00:48:26,815 --> 00:48:28,884
- I can imagine.
- No, you can't!

680
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:33,668
And I thank God every night for that.

681
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:38,839
So if you wanna tell me how
Agnes is doing in law school

682
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:41,993
or Dad's most recent fishing trip

683
00:48:41,993 --> 00:48:44,615
or Grandma's Winnebago, fine.

684
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:48,895
But if you came here to lecture me,

685
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,305
tell me to just say no, don't.

686
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:01,205
Don't put that final knife in my heart.

687
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:03,955
Toby...

688
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:47,909
Hello, Tobias. Come on in.

689
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:48,998
Sit down.

690
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:54,663
OK, we've got a new member
to our group, Tobias Beecher.

691
00:49:54,663 --> 00:49:57,706
I think you know Augustus
and Ron from Em City

692
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:03,827
and that's John and
Bill and Whitney Munson.

693
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:07,159
Beecher. I know a Beecher. Cyrus.

694
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:09,108
- Are you any relation?
- No.

695
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:11,539
Good. Man was a cocksucker.

696
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,717
OK. The idea here is for
us in a small group to talk

697
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:19,337
about ourselves, our
feelings, our addictions,

698
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:22,838
in the hope that we can find the cause.

699
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:24,907
I know the cause.

700
00:50:24,907 --> 00:50:26,381
I like the shit.

701
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:30,056
All right, that's fine. Pleasure
plays a very strong factor.

702
00:50:30,056 --> 00:50:33,900
Underneath, maybe
there's something else.

703
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:41,280
There's a deeper need, a hunger,
an emptiness that has to be filled.

704
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,578
So, Tobias, why don't you tell
us what you're addicted to?

705
00:50:48,114 --> 00:50:51,012
You know. They know.

706
00:50:52,196 --> 00:50:55,856
Yeah, ok. Augustus, you wanna
talk about your addiction?

707
00:50:56,545 --> 00:51:00,799
I was a crack addict. Been
squeaky clean 22 months.

708
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:03,326
Yes. Ron?

709
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,913
Speed's my bag.

710
00:51:04,913 --> 00:51:06,550
How long you been clean?

711
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,262
A year.

712
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:10,558
Whitney?

713
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:16,837
I quit seven times over the last 52
years. This'll be my longest period,

714
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:19,794
five years, three months, and six days.

715
00:51:20,527 --> 00:51:21,705
What are you addicted to?

716
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:23,817
- Since I been inside?
- Yeah.

717
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:28,353
Anything I can get my hands
on, but originally opium.

718
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:42,268
I had been decorated with the
Purple Heart for valor. Valor.

719
00:51:43,598 --> 00:51:46,480
Only I knew I was really a fraud.

720
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,318
Even after I was discharged I
couldn't take the uniform off.

721
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:56,340
During the war, off in the
Orient, I got hooked into opium.

722
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:01,198
My true self lay in that
quixotic little grunt.

723
00:52:12,618 --> 00:52:17,295
Prisoner number 45M242, Whitney Munson.

724
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:20,091
Convicted March 2, '45.

725
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:29,384
Murder in the first degree, criminal possession of a
controlled substance. Sentence: 110 years. Up for parole in 60.

726
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:32,062
Question, why'd you strangle the whore?

727
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:33,684
I didn't think I was.

728
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,284
I thought I was being affectionate.

729
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:43,694
Her neck was so pale, so thin, so fine.

730
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:46,731
And you've been in prison
for 52 years, right?

731
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,704
That's right.

732
00:52:47,704 --> 00:52:51,072
I've only got eight years
left until my parole.

733
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:54,745
Come the year 2005, I'm out of here.

734
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:58,224
Look, I can't stay here anymore and listen
to any more of these fucking stories!

735
00:52:58,224 --> 00:52:59,276
Tobias. Sit down.

736
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:00,596
- No, it's not helping!
- Sit down!

737
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:02,036
It's not helping!

738
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:18,890
Hello.

739
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,211
Yeah, yeah.

740
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:23,887
I'm here to give you a makeover.

741
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,291
Huh?

742
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:28,688
Your boyfriend told me to.

743
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:34,983
He said don't take no for an answer.

744
00:53:58,239 --> 00:53:59,959
My God,

745
00:54:00,828 --> 00:54:03,467
you're even prettier
than I thought you'd be.

746
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:26,748
Here it is a beautiful baby.

747
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:42,130
Miguel, your baby's dead.

748
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:53,511
Te quiero. Te quiero mucho.

749
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,621
I ain't saying drugs are good.

750
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:03,229
But when your past is
past and your present sucks

751
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:07,776
and your future holds nothing but
broken promises and dead dreams,

752
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,262
the drugs'll kill the pain.

753
00:55:09,262 --> 00:55:10,600
Listen up, America.

754
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:17,058
You ain't ever gonna get rid
of drugs until you cure pain.
