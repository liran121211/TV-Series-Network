But I can save them.

00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,894
Jane. Jane!

533
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,355
Jane!

534
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,731
Jane!

535
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,334
The hell was that?
What's wrong with her?

536
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,855
[WOMAN] You all right, sweetie?

537
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,820
You were looking a little forlorn there.

00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,410

be traveling alone, aren't you?

540
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,090
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.

541
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,760
So, where are you headed?

542
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,888
To your parents, I hope?

543
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm going to my friends.

544
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,150
I'm going home.
