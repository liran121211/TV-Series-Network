00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:13,604
was the original founder of Hawkins AV?

361
00:25:15,158 --> 00:25:16,354
Really?

362
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,976
He petitioned the school to
start it and everything.

363
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,853
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.

364
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,523
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.

365
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,984
Pretty awesome, right?

366
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,152
[DUSTIN AND LUCAS] Yeah.

367
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,948
We can't let him die in vain.

368
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,366
What do you want to do, Mike?

369
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,659
The Chief's right on this.

370
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,578
We can't stop those
Demo-dogs on our own.

371
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,704
Demo-dogs?

372
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,708
Demogorgon dogs.

373
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,169
Demo-dogs.

374
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,545
It's like a compound.

375
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,380
It's like a play on words...

376
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,464
Okay.

377
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:53,570
I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...

378
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,813
But there's an army now.

379
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,764
- [DUSTIN] Precisely.
- His army.

380
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,556
What do you mean?

381
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
His army.

382
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,062
Maybe if we stop him, we
can stop his army, too.

383
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,018
[DUSTIN] The shadow monster.

384
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:11,457
It got Will that day on the field.

385
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:13,603
The doctor said it was like
a virus, it infected him.

386
00:26:13,627 --> 00:26:16,325
And so this virus, it's
connecting him to the tunnels?

387
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,528
To the tunnels, monsters, the
Upside Down, everything.

388
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:20,412
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

389
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,623
Okay, so, the shadow
monster's inside everything.

390
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,542
And if the vines feel something
like pain, then so does Will.

391
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,087
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

392
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,838
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind?

393
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,257
A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.

394
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,094
And this is the thing that controls
everything. It's the brain.

395
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,804
Like the mind flayer.

396
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,766
- [MAX] The what?
- What?

397
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,977
The mind flayer.

398
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,270
What the hell is that?

399
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,994
It's a monster from
an unknown dimension.

400
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,691
It's so ancient that it doesn't
even know its true home.

401
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,985
Okay, it enslaves races
of other dimensions

402
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,229
by taking over their brains
using its highly-developed

403
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:54,971
psionic powers.

404
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,033
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.

405
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,536
No, it's a manual. And
it's not for kids.

406
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,955
And unless you know
something that we don't,

407
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,331
this is the best metaphor...

408
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,499
Analogy.

409
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,793
Analogy? That's what
you're worried about?

410
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,129
Fine. An analogy for understanding
whatever the hell this is.

411
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,257
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

412
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,967
- Flayer. Mind flayer.
- [SIGHS]

413
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,134
What does it want?

414
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,594
To conquer us, basically.

415
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,429
It believes it's the master race.

416
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,848
[STAMMERS] Like the Germans?

417
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,683
Uh, the Nazis?

418
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,186
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh...

419
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,647
If the Nazis were from
another dimension, totally.

420
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,944
Uh, it views other races, like
us, as inferior to itself.

421
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,907
It wants to spread, take
over other dimensions.

422
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,241
We are talking about the destruction
of our world as we know it.

423
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,869
That's great. That's great.
That's really great. Jesus!

424
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:45,738
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain

425
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:47,763
that's controlling everything,

426
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,626
then if we kill it...

427
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,336
We kill everything it controls.

428
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,505
- We win.
- Theoretically.

429
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,010
Great. So how do you kill this thing?

430
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:56,553
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

431
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,427
[CHUCKLES] No. No, no Fire...
No Fireballs.

432
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,805
Uh, you summon an undead
army, uh, because...

433
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,315
[STAMMERING] ...because zombies,

434
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,082
you know, they don't have brains,

435
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:08,747
and the mind flayer, it...
it... It likes brains.

436
00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:11,782
- It's just a game. It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here?

437
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,109
I thought we were waiting
for your military backup.

438
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,402
We are!

439
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,862
How are they gonna stop this?

440
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,385
You can't just shoot this with guns.

441
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,490
You don't know that! We
don't know anything!

442
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,743
We know it's already killed
everybody in that lab.

443
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,448
We know the monsters
are gonna molt again.

444
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:26,100
We know that it's only a matter of time

445
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,066
before those tunnels reach this town.

446
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,000
[JOYCE] They're right.

447
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,253
We have to kill it.

448
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,700
I want to kill it.

449
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:37,733
Me, too.

450
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,443
- I...
- Me, too, Joyce, okay?

451
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,552
But how do we do that?

452
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,930
We don't exactly know what
we're dealing with here.

453
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,932
[MIKE] No. But he does.

454
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,728
If anyone knows how to destroy
this thing, it's Will.

455
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,564
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.

456
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,566
[MAX] I thought we couldn't
trust him anymore.

457
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,153
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

458
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:02,032
Yeah, but he can't spy if he
doesn't know where he is.

459
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,872
Yeah, this'll work.

460
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,417
[GRUNTING]

461
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,604
Hey.

462
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,776
What you did, um, helping the kids...

463
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,656
that was... really cool.

464
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Yeah.

465
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,828
Those little shits are
real trouble, you know?

466
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,372
Believe me, I know.

467
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,263
[DUSTIN] Hey.

468
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,016
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

469
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,228
I guess I just thought
that he was my friend.

470
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,355
I was wrong.

471
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:17,832
I broke the rule of law,

472
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,113
so if you want your girlfriend to...

473
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,395
to take over my spot in
the party, I understand.

474
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,324
She's not my girlfriend.

475
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,617
I saw you two holding
hands in the bus, Lucas.

476
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,536
She was just scared.

477
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,330
Maybe, but I could feel it.

478
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,622
Feel what?

479
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,375
The electricity.

480
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,969
[SIGHS]

481
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,769
I get why El was your mage now.

482
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:55,288
What?

483
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,357
Lucas. He told me all about her.

484
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Well, he shouldn't have.

485
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,880
And just because you know the truth,

486
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,485
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

487
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:04,945
You do know that, right?

488
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,412
Yeah, I know.

489
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:09,752
I mean,

490
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,311
why would you want a stupid
zoomer in your party anyway?

491
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:15,904
I'm just saying, El?

492
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,835
She sounds like she was really awesome.

493
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,254
Yeah, she was.

494
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,633
Until that thing took her.

495
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,177
Just like it took Bob.

496
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,644
You sure this is gonna work?

497
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,479
He knew who I was.

498
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,272
He's still in there.

499
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,942
It's gonna work.

500
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,485
It has to.

501
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,537
- All right, you ready?
- [JOYCE] Yeah.

502
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,718
[GASPS]

503
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,579
If he finds out where we are...

504
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,832
will he send those dogs after us?

505
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,085
He won't find out.

506
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,049
Yeah, but, if he does...

507
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,221
Judgment day.

508
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,070
[GRUNTS] What? What? What is this?

509
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,325
What? What is this?

510
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,577
Why am I tied up?

511
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,248
Will, we just wanna talk to you.

512
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,624
We're not gonna hurt you.

513
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,833
Where am I?

514
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,920
You recognize this?

515
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,922
Do you recognize this?

516
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,715
[JOYCE] Hey.

517
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,551
We wanna help you.

518
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,136
But to do that, we have to
understand how to kill it.

519
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,721
Why am I tied up?

520
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,593
Why am I tied up?

521
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,633
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

522
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,873
[HOPPER] Hey.

523
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:24,867
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

524
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:29,276
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

525
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,450
[SCREAMS] Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

526
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:42,789
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

527
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,418
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

528
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,086
Let me go...

529
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,213
Go...

530
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,801
Go...

531
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,190
Do you know what March 22nd is?

532
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,527
It's your birthday.

533
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,697
Your birthday.

534
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,764
When you turned eight,

535
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:24,328
