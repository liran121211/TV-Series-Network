1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,250
[rain falling]

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,670
[thunder rumbling]

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,680
[breathing heavily]

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,826
[Mike] Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,930
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,220
[Lucas] Did you run away?

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,310
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Is that blood?

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,166
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!
- She's freaking me out!

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,400
I bet she's deaf.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,570
Not deaf.

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,950
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,910
[thunder rumbles]

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,410
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,410
- No, no, no!
- [boys exclaiming]

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,090
[Dustin] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,430
See over there?
[stammers] That's the bathroom.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,510
Privacy.
Get it?

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,910
You don't want it closed?

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,740
No.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,910
Oh, so you can speak.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay, well...

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,290
Um, how about we just keep the door...

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,130
just like this.

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,340
- Is that better?
- Yes.

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,100
[Dustin] This is mental.
[Mike] At least she can talk.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,060
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,850
She tried to get naked.

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,620
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,150
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like...

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,690
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,400
- From where?
- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,170
- You got a lot of family there?
- Bite me.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Seriously though, think about it.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,330
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

35
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,570
[Dustin] Why she went like...

36
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,420
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
- Like Michael Myers.
- [Lucas] Exactly!

38
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,170
We should've never brought her here.

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,646
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,420
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

41
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,276
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,260
- Who's crazy now?
- How is that crazy?

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,930
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

44
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,350
- So?
- So if I tell my mom

45
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,270
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

46
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,600
- Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.

47
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,270
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,570
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

49
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,780
- You're letting a girl...
- Just listen!

50
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,820
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

51
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,950
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

52
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,870
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,226
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

54
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,436
We'll be totally in the clear.

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,250
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

56
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,710
And this time, we find Will.

57
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,720
[Dustin] You really think she's psycho?

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
Wouldn't want her in my house.

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,430
[sighs] Mental.

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,770
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

62
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,110
[door closes]

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,490
Is that real?

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,580
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

65
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,210
What's it mean?
Eleven?

66
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,670
That's your name?

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,840
Eleven. Okay.

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,260
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

69
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,560
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,020
Um, well, okay.

71
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,190
'Night, El.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,730
'Night, Mike.

73
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,000
[door opens and closes]

74
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,890
[thunder rumbling]

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
[theme music playing]

76
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,810
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

77
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,690
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,650
- I can't eat.
- I just need you to eat, Mom.

79
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,150
[sniffles] Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

80
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,716
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to go alone...

81
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,876
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

82
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,320
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

83
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,780
- Okay.
- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

84
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,056
- How much is a copy?
- Yeah, okay.

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,226
- Okay, Mom. Mom.
- Ten cents?

86
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,870
- [stammering] If we... Ten cents...
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,210
[stutters] You can't get like this, okay?

88
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,710
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

89
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,340
[knocking on door]

90
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,590
[sighs] We've been waiting six hours.

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,390
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

92
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,050
Six hours.

93
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,260
A little bit of trust here, all right?

94
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,310
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

95
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,060
- And?
- Nothing.

96
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,560
God.

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,650
Flo says you got a phone call?

98
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,900
Oh, yeah.

99
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,610
[Joyce sniffles]

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,880
[Hopper] Storm barbecued this pretty good.

101
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,330
- The storm?
- What else?

102
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,330
You're saying that that's not weird?

103
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,080
No, it's weird.

104
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,670
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the...

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,760
No, it doesn't work like that.

106
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,590
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

107
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,406
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

108
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,470
No. It was him.
It was Will.

109
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,520
[voice breaking] And he was scared.
And then something...

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,440
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,336
- Who would do that?
- Well, this thing's been on TV.

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,530
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

113
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,610
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

114
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,320
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here?

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,620
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

116
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,216
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

117
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,710
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

118
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,080
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

119
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,790
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

120
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
[Joyce sniffles]

121
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,850
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
- No.

122
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,376
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

123
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,070
[Joyce sighs] Oh, come on!

124
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,230
You're wasting your time.

125
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,950
Hey, Hopper.

126
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,200
Hopper. [panting]

127
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,530
Let me go.

128
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,950
- I'm sorry?
- To Lonnie's.

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,910
[stammering] You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,420
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

131
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,210
He'll... He'll hide.

132
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,000
- You know, he's good at hiding.
- Yeah?

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,420
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

134
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,180
Stay here with your mom.

135
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,470
She needs you.

136
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,560
[engine starting]

137
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,480
[music playing faintly on TV]

138
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,820
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

139
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,160
Do a lot of studying last night?

140
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,830
Yeah, actually, I did.

141
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,290
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

142
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,090
Hey, what's going on?

143
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,590
[both] Nothing.

144
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,800
[radio static]

145
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,640
[footsteps approaching]

146
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,390
Hey, you found my supercomm.

147
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,640
Pretty cool, huh?

148
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,610
I talk to my friends with it.

149
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,570
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

150
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,730
Signal's pretty weak.

151
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,110
Got you breakfast.

152
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,660
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

153
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,136
but I just need you to go out there.

154
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,290
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

155
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,920
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,130
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

157
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,210
Understand?

158
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,720
Really, it's no big deal.

159
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,930
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

160
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,600
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

161
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,100
No.

162
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,520
No?

163
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,360
No.

164
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,780
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

165
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,120
You're in trouble, aren't you?

166
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,000
Who...

167
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,130
Who are you in trouble with?

168
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,420
Bad.

169
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,590
Bad?

170
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,760
Bad people?

171
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,470
They want to hurt you?

172
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,970
The bad people?

173
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,400

- [man] <i>Copy that.</i>

346
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,060
[devices beeping]

347
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,460
[beeping continues]

348
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,920
- [beeping rapidly]
- [oozing]

349
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,100
Extraordinary.

350
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
[Mike grunts]

351
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,940
[mimicking Yoda] Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

352
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,376
[in normal voice] His name's Yoda.

353
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,530
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

354
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,950
Whoosh!

355
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,410
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

356
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,386
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

357
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,540
[Rory roaring]

358
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,380
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

359
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,800
We got first every year.

360
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,590
Except for last year when we got third.

361
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,760
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

362
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,870
You know Will?

363
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,040
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

364
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,750
[vehicle approaching]

365
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,710
We gotta go.

366
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,300
[Karen] I bought pizza
and macaroni.

367
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,930
[Holly] Okay.
[Karen] Okay.

368
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,560
Ted? Is that you?

369
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,850
Just me, Mom!

370
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,600
- Mike? What are you doing home?
- One second!

371
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,940
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

372
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,740
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

373
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,780
Do you understand?

374
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,450
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

375
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,910
Promise?

376
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,000
It means something that you can't break.

377
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,000
- Ever.
- [Karen] Michael?

378
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,670
Please?

379
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,330
[sighs]

380
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,590
[breathing heavily]

381
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,730
[Eleven echoing] Pop!

382
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,860
[sobbing]

383
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,270
[normal] Papa!

384
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,860
Papa!

385
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,280
No!

386
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
Papa!

387
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,740
No! No!
No!

388
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,870
[screams]

389
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,580
Papa!

390
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,330
- Papa!
- [banging on door]

391
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,830
Papa!

392
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,000
[sobbing] Papa!

393
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,250
[echoing] Papa!

394
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,710
[sobs]

395
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
Papa.

396
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,180
[sobbing]

397
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,900
I just... I don't feel good.

398
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,650
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

399
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,970
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

400
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,466
but the last time I told you I was sick

401
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,466
- you made me go to school anyway, and...
- Michael.

402
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,320
- Yeah?
- I'm not mad at you.

403
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,700
- No?
- No, of course not.

404
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,950
[sighs]

405
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,960
All this that's been going on with Will,

406
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,170
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

407
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,960
I just...

408
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,510
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

409
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,340
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

410
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,550
I'm here for you. Okay?

411
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,560
[thud]

412
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,310
Is there someone else here?

413
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
No.

414
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,520
Eleven?

415
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,190
Is everything okay?

416
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,320
El?

417
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,700
- [sobs] Mike.
- Is everything okay?

418
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,990
[inhales]

419
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,120
Are you sure?

420
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,790
Promise.

421
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,140
[dial tone]

422
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,610
[grunts]

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,450
[exhales]

424
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,330
[volunteer 1] Will Byers!
[volunteer 2] Will!

425
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,016
[Hopper] Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

426
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,250
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

427
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,590
[Callahan] Oh, hell, I could survive that.

428
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,670
[Hopper laughs]

429
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,800
[Callahan] What?
George Burness made the jump.

430
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,220
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

431
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
George is a liar.

432
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,260
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

433
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,950
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

434
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,140
Nah.

435
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,020
[Florence on radio] <i>Chief, you copy?</i>

436
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,110
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

437
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,940
<i>Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.</i>

438
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,860
<i>I think you need to get there right away.</i>

439
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,580
[indistinct radio chatter]

440
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,710
[siren wailing]

441
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Ugh, Jesus!

442
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,640
[flies buzzing]

443
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,600
Suicide?

444
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,560
Mmm-hmm.

445
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,730
[Callahan] Missing kid, suicide...

446
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,530
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

447
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,990
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

448
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,240
Benny was my friend.

449
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,590
[music playing on car stereo]

450
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,240
[music playing on TV]

451
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,320
Hello?

452
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,530
[banging on door]

453
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,830
[Cynthia] Yeah.

454
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,250
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

455
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,396
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
- To look around.

456
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,920
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
- I'll be fast.

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,340
[Jonathan] Hey, Will?

458
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,800
Will!

459
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,970
Will, you here?
Will!

460
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,800
[grunts]

461
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,100
Get off!

462
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,850
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

463
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,060
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

464
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,320
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

465
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
My oldest.

466
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,360
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.

467
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,170
[door closes]

468
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,840
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen to me.

469
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,776
- You are out of your mind!
- She knows about Will.

470
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,510
What do you mean she knows about Will?

471
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,680
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

472
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,640
- [Lucas] You could tell?
- Just think about it.

473
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,996
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

474
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,640
the same place where Will disappeared?

475
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,020
- That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.

476
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,400
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

477
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,860
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us?

478
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,070
Do you know where he is?

479
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,216
[loudly] Do you know where Will is?

480
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,580
- Stop it, you're scaring her!
- She should be scared!

481
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,540
If you know where he is, tell us!

482
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,420
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

483
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,920
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

484
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,420
- What kind of danger?
- Her name is Eleven?

485
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,010
- El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger?

486
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,720
Danger danger.

487
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,470
No, no, no!

488
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,310
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

489
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,990
No.

490
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,920
[Lonnie] Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

491
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,880
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

492
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,750
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

493
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,260
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

494
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,930
he's not here and he never has been.

495
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,010
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?
- I don't know, I just...

496
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,600
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

497
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,220
You know, he was lost or something.

498
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,560
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

499
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,770
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

500
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,190
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

501
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,400
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

502
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,450
Come out here to the city.

503
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,160
People are more real here, you know?

504
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,950
And then I could see you more.

505
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,580
- What, you think I don't want to see you?
- I know you don't.

506
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,710
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

507
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,090
She even know you're here?

508
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,130
Oh, great.

509
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,920
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

510
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,800
Some real fine parenting right there.

511
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,640
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

512
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,020
In case you forgot what he looks like.

513
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,360
[Cynthia] He's kinda cute, hmm?

514
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,490
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

515
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,630
[Earl] Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

516
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,450
You, uh, notice anything...

517
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,870
odd about him the last few weeks?

518
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,210
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

519
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,420
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

520
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,710
He got any enemies you might know about?

521
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,880
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

522
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,970
[sighs] The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

523
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,510
nah.

524
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,350
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

525
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,690
- Just you and the boys?
- Yep.

526
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,850
Me and Henry and... [sighs]

527
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,690
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

528
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,820
No kid did this.

529
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,820
Kid?

530
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,700
What are you talking about?

531
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,700
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

532
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,540
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

533
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,000
Can you imagine that?

534
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,000
This kid...

535
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,760
what'd he look like?

536
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,220
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

537
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,736
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

538
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,220
He look like this?

539
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,940
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

540
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,060
No. This was a different kid.

541
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,610
This one had really short hair.

542
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,770
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

543
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,490
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

544
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,660
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

545
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,120
could it be Lonnie's kid?

546
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,160
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

547
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,120
About the right height, though.

548
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,870
I mean, could've been.

549
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,630
Yeah, that's...

550
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,710
Could've been.

551
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,130
[sighs]

552
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,930
Because I don't want to go by myself.

553
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,180
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

554
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,640
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

555
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,600
No, tell them we're... studying.

556
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,400
[Karen] Nancy! Dinner!

557
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,190
Coming!

558
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,940
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

559
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,290
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

560
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,210
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

561
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't know why.

562
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,960
[chuckles] Me, too.

563
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,510
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

564
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,970
So, there's this...

565
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,550
special assembly thing tonight...

566
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,930
for Will at the school field.

567
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,020
Barb's driving.

568
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,270
Why am I just hearing about this?

569
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,190
I thought you knew.

570
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,360
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

571
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,780
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

572
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,900
I mean, everyone's going.

573
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,990
[sighs]

574
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Just... be back by 10:00.

575
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,716
Why don't you take the boys, too?

576
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,950
- No!
- Mmm-mmm.

577
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,710
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

578
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,670
- [gasps]
- [Holly groans]

579
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,010
Sorry. Spasm.

580
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,140
- [Holly whimpers]
- Oh...

581
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,430
It's okay, Holly.

582
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,350
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.

583
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,350
- [sirens wailing]
- [people shouting] Will!

584
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,650
[volunteer] Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

585
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,870
[Callahan] Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

586
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,920
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

587
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,580
And stealing food from Benny?

588
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,340
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

589
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,050
Can't ask a corpse questions.

590
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,920
- [whistle blowing]
- [volunteer 2] Hold up!

591
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,470
You got something?

592
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,760
- Hey, what do you got?
- [Mr. Clarke] Not sure.

593
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,770
Maybe nothing.

594
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,770
I found this. In there.

595
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,650
[Powell] No way a kid
crawls through there.

596
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,400
[Hopper] I don't know...

597
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,860
a scared enough one might.

598
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,320
His brother said he was good at hiding.

599
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,430
[rhythmic beeping]

600
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,480
[radio static]

601
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
[Mike] El?

602
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,200
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

603
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,790
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

604
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,290
They promise.
Right?

605
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,920
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

606
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,300
[Dustin] Ow!

607
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,010
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

608
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,140
That's all.

609
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,140
We just wanted to find our friend.

610
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,770
"Friend"?

611
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,730
Yeah, friend.
Will?

612
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,110
What is "friend"?

613
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,610
Is she serious?

614
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,700
Um, a friend...

615
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,530
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

616
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,740
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

617
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,120
And they never break a promise.

618
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,120
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit?

619
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,960
A spit swear means...
[spits] you never break your word.

620
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,460
It's a bond.

621
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,210
That's super important, because friends...

622
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,550
they tell each other things.

623
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,380
Things that parents don't know.

624
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,560
[music playing on car radio]

625
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,270
[Nancy] Barbara, pull over.
[Barbara] What?

626
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,640
Pull over!

627
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,230
What are we doing here?

628
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,900
His house is three blocks away.

629
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,440
We can't park in the driveway.

630
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,570
Are you serious?

631
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,836
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

632
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,570
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

633
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,490
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

634
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,120
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

635
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,460
We're gonna have a great time.

636
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,080
He just wants to get in your pants.

637
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,790
[chuckling] No, he doesn't.

638
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,170
Nance... seriously.

639
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,340
He invited you to his house.

640
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,340
His parents aren't home.

641
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,680
Come on, you are not this stupid.

642
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

643
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,930
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

644
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,890
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

645
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,940
- Gross.
- I'm serious!

646
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,310
All right, well...

647
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,570
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

648
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,110
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

649
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Ugh.

650
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,740
Is that a new bra?

651
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,540
No.

652
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,830
[music playing in distance]

653
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,460
[doorbell rings]

654
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,970
Barb, chill.

655
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,260
I'm chill.

656
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,730
Hello, ladies.

657
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,740
[grunts]

658
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,300
[Sandra] What are you doing?

659
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,810
It's freezing.

660
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,060
You ever feel cursed?

661
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,570
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

662
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,950
the summer of '23.

663
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,910
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

664
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,670
When'd the last person freeze to death?

665
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,380
Hey, come back inside.

666
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,470
Warm me up. Just...

667
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,680
Just give me a minute out here.

668
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,730
[Sandra sighs]

669
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,120
[Lucas] What's the weirdo doing?

670
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,210
El?

671
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,900
Will.

672
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Superpowers.

673
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,620
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

674
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,240
Do you know where he is?

675
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,840
[Mike] I don't understand.

676
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,930
Hiding.

677
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,680
Will is hiding?

678
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,020
From the bad men?

679
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,610
Then from who?

680
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,410
[sighs]

681
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,170
[camera shutter clicking]

682
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,800
Where are you?

683
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,600
[camera shutter clicking]

684
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,780
[camera shutter clicking]

685
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,030
- [woman screaming]
- [gasps]

686
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,820
[panting]

687
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,820
[screaming continues]

688
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,160
- [Carol shrieking]
- [Tommy] One! Two!

689
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,920
- Three!
- [Carol] Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

690
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,670
- [Tommy laughing]
- You're such an asshole, Tommy.

691
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,210
[rock music playing]

692
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:18,890
[exhales]

693
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,600
Is that supposed to impress me?

694
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,480
- You're not?
- You are a cliché, you do realize that?

695
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,610
