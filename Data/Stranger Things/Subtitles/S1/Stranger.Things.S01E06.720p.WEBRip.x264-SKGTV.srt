1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,760
[Jonathan] Nancy!

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,300
[panting] Nancy!

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,760
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,430
Nancy!

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,640
Where are you?

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,770
[Nancy echoing] Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,940
Jonathan!

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,360
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,190
Nancy!

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,530
[breathing heavily]

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,740
Nancy!

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,410
[Nancy] Jonathan, where are you?

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,120
Jonathan! [breathing heavily]

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,910
Jonathan!

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,120
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
- [faintly] Where are you?
- [panting]

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,750
- I'm right here!
- [Nancy] Jonathan!

18
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,210
I'm right here! Nancy!

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,510
- Just follow my voice!
- [panting] Jonathan!

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,840
[Jonathan in distance]
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,680
- [growling]
- [gasps]

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,180
Nancy!

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,230
[panting]

24
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,270
- [growling continues]
- [breathing heavily]

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,150
[squelching]

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,570
[growling continues]

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,130
Nancy?

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,720
Nancy.

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,850
[Jonathan in distance] Nancy!
Follow my voice!

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,560
[monster growling]

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,770
Nancy?

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,530
[Jonathan gasps]

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,280
- [Nancy] Jonathan!
- Nancy!

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,450
- [Nancy straining]
- [Jonathan grunting]

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,380
[Nancy sobbing]

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,500
[Jonathan panting] I got you.

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,310
[theme music playing]

38
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,250
[pop song playing on car stereo]

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,816
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,090
- She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
- That's... that's not it.

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,850
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

42
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,600
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,600
So what? [scoffs]
Like, you're worried about her?

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,100
- What?
- Aw, you are.

45
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,900
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just... Stop.

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,626
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up?

47
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,990
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,400
[chuckling] Jeez.

49
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,410
- [Carol] Damn. Sorry.
- [Tommy chuckles]

50
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,210
[sighs] So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,960
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.

52
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,386
[Joyce] Look, we gotta
go through this again.

53
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,200
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

54
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,620
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

55
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,830
There was a laboratory.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,566
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

57
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,630
[inhales deeply]

58
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,130
There was this kid's room.

59
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,880
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

60
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

61
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,850
Because, I told you,

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,696
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal...

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,406
[stammers] You didn't say
there was a drawing.

64
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,326
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

65
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,690
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

66
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,020
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

67
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,400
[sighs]

68
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,780
Wasn't Will.

69
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,960
Earl...

70
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,840
The night that Benny died,

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,220
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

72
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,050
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,930
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

74
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,350
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

75
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,520
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,020
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

77
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,480
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

78
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,690
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

79
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,450
I've been looking for Will...

80
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,490
I've been chasing after some other kid?

81
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,180
- [Jonathan gasps]
- [monster growling]

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,340
- [growling]
- [gasps]

83
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
[Jonathan] Nancy!

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,730
[monster growls]

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,240
Better?

86
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,200
Yeah.

87
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,080
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,760
I can go home.
[stammers] I just figured...

89
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,750
Yeah, no.
I... [stammers]

90
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,130
- I don't wanna be alone.
- [sighs]

91
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,260
- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,850
[sighs]

93
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,210
Can you just come up here?

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah.

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,650
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- [softly] On.

96
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,150
[softly] Yeah.

97
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,370
You know, it...

98
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,200
it can't get us in here.

99
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,170
We don't know that.

100
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

101
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,700
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

102
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,660
Mmm-hmm.

103
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,330
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,580
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

105
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,670
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

106
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,720
Did you get it?

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
- I got it.
- Okay.

108
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,740
[grunting softly]

109
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,490
[pages rustling]

110
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,700
Oh...

111
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,790
Hey.

112
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,290
[Nancy] Hey.

113
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,500
[grunts] Couldn't sleep?

114
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,920
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

115
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,550
keep seeing that... thing.

116
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,060
Wherever I was, that place...

117
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,730
I think that it lives there.

118
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,650
It was feeding there.

119
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,780
Feeding on that deer.

120
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,240
That means that if...
[inhales deeply]

121
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,740
if Will and Barbara...

122
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,830
Hey.

123
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,580
My mom said she talked to Will.

124
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,000
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

125
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,090
That means that she's trapped...

126
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,510
in that place.

127
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,260
We have to find it again.

128
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,310
You wanna go back out there?

129
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,180
Maybe we don't have to.

130
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,560
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

131
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,770
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

132
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,940
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

133
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,740
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

134
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,990
It's always alone, like...

135
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,120
like a bear.

136
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,540
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

137
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,210
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

138
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,500
One sec.

139
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,960
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

140
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,010
That's one drop of blood in a million,

141
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,340
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

142
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,090
So you're saying it can detect blood?

143
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,180
[softly] It's just a theory.

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,180
We could test it.

145
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
But if it works...

146
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,270
At least we'll know it's coming.

147
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,490
- [door knob rattles]
- [both gasp]

148
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,070
- [Nancy sighs]
- [Karen] Honey, are you up?

149
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,660
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

150
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,280
[Karen] I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

151
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,040
I'll be down in a second.

152
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,620
- [footsteps receding]
- [sighing]

153
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,000
[Jonathan sighing]

154
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,590
- [sighs]
- Your mom doesn't knock?

155
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,180
[both chuckle]

156
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,430
[knocking on door]

157
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,110
- Hi. Scott Clarke?
- Uh, yes.

158
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,230
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

159
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,546
- at Hawkins Middle?
- The very same.

160
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,820
Oh, wonderful.

161
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,410
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

162
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,410
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

163
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,410
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

164
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,910
Oh, that's neat.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,646
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke...

166
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,290
Uh, please, call me Scott.

167
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,920
Scott.

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,920
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

169
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,010
and give them
the support and encouragement

170
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,090
to pursue careers in technology.

171
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,946
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

172
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

173
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

174
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,400
Oh, I have a few in mind.

175
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,870
[Mike sighs] I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

176
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,016
- [Dustin] She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,636
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

178
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,830
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

179
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,226
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

180
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,840
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

181
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
It wasn't his fault, either.

182
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,220
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

183
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,010
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

184
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,640
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

185
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,400
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

186
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,670
No, Mike, you give me a break!

187
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,190
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

188
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,810
I was the only reasonable one.

189
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,560
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

190
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,520
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

191
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,360
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

192
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

193
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,110
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

194
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,990
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

195
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,950
- No.
- Good.

196
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,580
Where are we going?

197
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,960
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

198
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,960
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

199

Today is a very special day.

202
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,440
Do you know why?

203
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
Because today, we make history.

204
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,280
Today, we make contact.

205
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,120

[Karen] Here you go.

212
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,090
Ah... yum.

213
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,510
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

214
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,640
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

215
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,930
[sighs] She is.

216
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,060
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

217
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,520
- Nancy, what's taking so long?
- [music playing faintly]

218
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,230
Nancy?

219
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,980
- [door knob rattles]
- [sighs] Nancy, come on.

220
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,990

- [music continues]

221
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,170
Nan...

[doorbell rings]

223
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,150
What do you want?

224
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,280
[sighs] I drew first blood, so...

225
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Okay, I'll shake.

226
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,300
On one condition.

227
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,430
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

228
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,930
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

229
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,720
- Fine!
- [Dustin] No, no, not fine!

230
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,100
Guys, seriously?

231
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,440
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

232
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,360
[sighs] We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

233
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
and those trolls took us out one by one.

234
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,160
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

235
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,120
So we stick together, no matter what!

236
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,120
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

237
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,130
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

238
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,460
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor...

239
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,340
She was just trying to keep us safe!

240
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,026
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

241
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,260
An accident?

242
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,300
All right, accident or not...

243
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,430
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

244
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,430
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

245
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,230
I could have been killed!

246
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,100
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

247
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,416
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

248
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,730
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

249
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,690
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

250
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,860
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

251
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,240
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

252
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,710
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

253
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,430
[upbeat music playing on PA]

254
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,190
[indistinct chatter]

255
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,556
[Dr. Brenner] <i>It's okay, Eleven.</i>

256
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,040
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

257
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,210
They're just here to watch.

258
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,090
Don't focus on them.

259
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,710
Stay in here, like before.

260
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,380
Yes, Papa.

261
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,850
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

262
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,520
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

263
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,730
It's reaching out to you...

264
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,650
'cause it wants you.

265
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,360
Hmm?

266
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,650
It's calling you...

267
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,490
so don't turn away from it this time.

268
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,910
I want you to find it.

269
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,080
Understand?

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Yes.

271
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
[man] <i>Are you lost?</i>

272
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,540
Is your mom here?

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,210
Your dad?

- What should we do?
- Uh...

276
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,770
Call the police.

277
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,820
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

278
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,610
- Hey! Stop right...
- [woman screams]

279
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,110
- Please.
- [woman grunts]

280
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,280
[stammers] You have to pay for those!

281
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,870
Stop right there!

Can I help you?

284
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,640
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

285
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,650
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

286
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,370
And you want to talk to my sister?

287
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,290
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

288
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,960
Okay, well, you can come in,

289
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,170
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

290
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,340
you're about five years too late.

Terry, you have some visitors.

293
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,430
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

294
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,560
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

295
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,020
Um, you see, uh, my son...

296
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,360
he's been missing for almost a week now,

297
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,610
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

298
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,320
about your daughter, Jane?

299
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,410
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

300
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,200
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

301
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,490
You guys keep in touch?

302
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,210
This is, uh... this is him.

303
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,750
[stammering] This is Will.

304
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,590
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

305
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,920
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

306
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,720
I told you, you're wasting your time.

307
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,920
[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.

308
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,880
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

309
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,930
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,560
[sighs] Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

311
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,440
He's your best friend, right?

312
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,520
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

313
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,110
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

314
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,530
But none of that matters.

315
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,280
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

316
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,756
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

317
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,716
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

318
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,250
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

319
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,920
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

320
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,460
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

321
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,000
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

322
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,760
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

323
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,510
- [chuckles] Yeah, right.
- [sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.

324
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,010
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

325
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,810
- Says who?
- Says logic.

326
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,480
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

327
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,520
Okay.

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
Whoa.

331

[panting] Uh... definitely.

342
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,450

343
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,490
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

344
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,250
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

345
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,120
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

- Isolation tanks?
- [Becky] Yeah.

347
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,170
These big bathtubs, basically,

348
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,880
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

349
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,630
You lose any sense of, uh...

350
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,510
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

351
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,890
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

352
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,350
Real hippie crap.

353
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,076
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

354
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,350
The thing is, though, is that

355
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,520
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

356
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,110
Jane.

357
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,440
[sighs]

358
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,990
Do you have any pictures of her?

359
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,080
I don't think you guys understand.

360
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,370
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

361
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,590
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

362
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,720
[sighs]

363
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

364
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,560
- like she's gonna come home someday.
- [lullaby plays from mobile]

365
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,100
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

366
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,980
Abilities?

367
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,860
[bones cracking]

368
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,650
You read any Stephen King?

369
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,400
- [hisses]
- [beeping]

370
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,450
[stammers]

371
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,870
[chuckles]

372
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,280
You guys look scared, actually.

373
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,200
[chuckles] I mean, it's all make-believe.

374
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,120
[clears throat]
What... what kind of abilities?

375
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,920
Telepathy, telekinesis...

376
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,630
[Eleven screams]

377
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,800
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

378
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,840
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

379
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,390
[yelling] Papa!

380
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,470
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

381
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,730
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

382
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,520
You know, to deal with the guilt.

383
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,570
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

384
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,940
[stammering] About having had the kid.

385
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,820
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

386
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,990
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

387
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,240
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

388
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,250
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

389
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,360
Oh, man.

390
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,900
[grunts]

391
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,370
[clattering]

392
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,120
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

393
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,000
What you kids doin' with all this?

394
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,420
Um...

395
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,300
- Monster hunting.
- Huh. [scoffs]

396
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,510
[cash register dings]

397
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,680
"Monster hunting"?

398
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,060
You know, last week...

399
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,980
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

400
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,900
It took me and Barb all weekend.

401
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,860
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now...

402
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,490
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

403
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,530
Yeah.

404
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,030
What's the weirdest part?

405
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,370
Me or the bear trap?

406
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,620
You.
It's definitely you.

407
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,130
[chuckles]

408
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,960
- [car horn honking]
- [Reed] Hey, Nance!

409
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,550
Can't wait to see your movie. [laughs]

410
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,010
What the hell was that?

411
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,800
I don't know.

412
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,560
What?

413
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,770
What?

414
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,440
Hey! Where are you going?

415
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,770
- [panting]
- Nancy, wait!

416
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,190
[whimpers]

417
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,650
Nancy!

418
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,210
[man 1] I can't believe it.
[man 2] These kids!

419
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,620
- [Jonathan] Jesus.
- [sighs]

420
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,050
Wow.

421
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,220
- [spray can hissing]
- [Tommy laughing]

422
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,340
[Jonathan] Wait!

423
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,076
[Carol] Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

424
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,116
[Tommy] Shut up!
[Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.

425
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,220
[Tommy speaks indistinctly]

426
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,730
[indistinct chatter]

427
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,020
[laughter]

428
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,110
Aw, hey there, princess!

429
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,780
[Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.

430
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,320
[Carol] Oh!
[Tommy] Damn!

431
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,740
What is wrong with you?

432
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,176
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

433
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,740
I was worried about you.

434
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,966
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you. [scoffs]

435
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,250
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

436
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,500
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

437
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,790
Speak of the devil.

438
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,130
Hi.

439
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,970
You came by last night?

440
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,550
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

441
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,390
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

442
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,850
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

443
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,520
Or for another
pervy photo session? [laughs]

444
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,206
- We were just...
- [Steve] You were just what?

445
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,820
Finish that sentence.

446
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,780
Finish the sentence.

447
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,570
[breathing heavily]

448
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,290
[scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.

449
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,500
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

450
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,186
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

451
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,806
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

452
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,840
a little screw-up like your father.

453
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

454
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,236
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

455
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,526
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

456
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,776
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

457
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,696
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

458
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,760
[Nancy] Steve, shut up!

459
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,906
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

460
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,786
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

461
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,850
[grunts]

462
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,140
- [groans]
- [Jonathan breathing heavily]

463
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,270
- [grunts]
- [Nancy] Steve!

464
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,020
- [Tommy] Oh!
- [both grunting]

465
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,690
- [Nancy] Steve.
- [groans]

466
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,530
Stop! Steve!
Knock it off, you guys!

467
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,756
- [Carol] Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

468
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,780
- [Carol] Get off! Stop!
- [both continue grunting]

469
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,556
- Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
- Easy, easy!

470
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,330
Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

471
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,420
[both grunting]

472
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,750
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

473
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,800
- Jonathan, stop!
- [sirens wailing]

474
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,040
[Tommy] Cops!
[Nancy] Guys... Jonathan, get off of him!

475
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,260
- Stop it!
- [Tommy] Cops! Come on!

476
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,260
- Stop it! Come on!
- Cops!

477
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,510
- You have to stop!
- Just go, Carol!

478
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,060
- [Nancy] Stop it!
- [both grunting]

479
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,826
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

480
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,600
- Kids! All right!
- Stop it!

481
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,020
[indistinct clamoring]

482
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,690
[Callahan] Oh! My nose!

483
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,560
[Powell] Calm him down!

484
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,230
- [grunting]
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

485
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,200
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

486
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,860
- [Jonathan] Get off!
- I got this one!

487
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,870
[Callahan] Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

488
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,790
[breathing heavily]

489
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,420
[audience cheering on TV]

490
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,920
[man on TV]
<i>Good gift for a college student...</i>

491
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,420
[continues indistinctly]

492
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,106
[Hopper] Well, thank you for your time.
We appreciate it.

493
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,330
[Becky] Hmm, yeah,
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

494
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
[door opens]

495
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,480
- Good luck.
- [Hopper] Thank you.

496
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,650
[sighing]

497
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,280
Hey...

498
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,900
[softly] What?

499
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,030
We're gonna find him.

500
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,240
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

501
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,120
We're close.

502
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,210
[breath trembling] Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her...

503
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,026
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

504
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,290
which means we've got a chance.

505
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,050
You know what I would give?

506
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,340
For a chance?

507
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,140
You know what I would give?

508
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,656
[Callahan over radio]
<i>Hey, Chief, you there?</i>

509
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,850
<i>- Hey, Chief?</i>
- Yeah, go ahead.

510
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,730
<i>Yeah, a fight broke out here and...</i>

511
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,020
- Cal, I don't have time for this.
<i>- It's Jonathan Byers.</i>

512
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,150
<i>You haven't seen Joyce, have you?</i>

513
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,960
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

514
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,170
You, yes. Him, no.

515
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,500
He assaulted a police officer.

516
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,896
- [ice cubes clatter]
- Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

517
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,090
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

518
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,380
[chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.

519
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,970
I think you better tell him that.

520
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
What?

521
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

522
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,480
And that damn stupid.

523
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,600
[sighs]

524
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,320
Found some ice.

525
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,870
Thanks.

526
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,580
[sniffs]

527
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,370
[sighs]

528
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,960
Everything okay?

529
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,840
Yeah.

530
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,550
Everything's fine.

531
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,720
[sighs]

532
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,480
[Dustin shouting in the distance] El!

533
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,400
[Mike shouting] Eleven!

534
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,740
- Eleven! El!
- El!

535
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,620
Eleven!

536
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,910
Eleven!

537
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,830
[panting]

538
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,800
- Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
- What?

539
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,960
El!

540
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,010
El?

541
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,800
Hey, there, Frogface.

542
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,760
Toothless.

543
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,720
Shit! Run, Mike!

544
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,850
- What?
- Run! Come on!

545
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,100
[Troy] You're dead, Wheeler.

546
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,900
[Dustin] Move, Mike!

547
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,570
Mike, come on, run!

548
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,490
[beeping]

549
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,790
[beeping continues]

550
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,180
[beeping intensifies]

551
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,680
[breathing heavily]

552
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,680
[panting]

553
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,730
[groans] Cramp!

554
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,480
- Just keep going!
- [grunts]

555
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,730
Keep going!

556
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,320
Shit!

557
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,200
- Stay back!
- Don't come any closer!

558
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,410
- [grunts]
- [scoffs] Nice throw, numbnuts.

559
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,250
[yelling]

560
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,670
[grunting]

561
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,420
- [gasps]
- Get off! Get off me!

562
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,380
Let him go! Let him go!

563
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,420
- Stay back, or I cut him!
- What do you want?

564
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,720
I want to know how you did it!

565
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,156
- How I did what?
- [Dustin whimpers]

566
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,470
I know you did something to me.

567
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,430
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

568
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,770
You mean piss your pants?

569
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,430
Our friend has superpowers,

570
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,940
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

571
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,400
- Shut up!
- [groaning]

572
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,820
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

573
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,610
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

574
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,530
Let him go.
Let him go!

575
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,820
I'll let him go, sure.

576
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,200
- But first... it's your turn.
- [panting]

577
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,410
My turn for what?

578
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,120
Wet yourself.

579
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,960
- What?
- Jump...

580
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,500
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

581
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,920
[Dustin] Stop! No!

582
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,920
[gasping]

583
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,710
I'll cut him right now!

584
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,130
[whimpering]

585
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,680
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

586
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,100
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

587
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,060
Mike, seriously, don't!

588
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,390
[breathing heavily]

589
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,830
[Dustin] Mike, don't do it!

590
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,750
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

591
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,710
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

592
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,170
[Dustin] Mike, don't!

593
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,880
- Dentist's office opens in five...
- [Dustin panting]

594
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,380
Four! Three!

595
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,260
- Two!
- Mike!

596
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,350
[Troy] One!

597
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,100
- [Mike screams]
- [gasps]

598
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,110
Holy shit.

599
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,480
[Mike gasping]

600
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,080
[whimpering]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

601
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,420
[grunts]

602
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,400
- [bone cracks]
- [screaming]

603
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,860
[Troy] She broke my arm! My arm!

604
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,980
Go.

605
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,910
[Troy] Let's get out of here! Let's go!
[James] Go!

606
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,910
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

607
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,120
She's our friend and she's crazy!

608
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,580
You come back here and she'll kill you!

609
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,630
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!

610
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,750
[echoing] She'll kill you, you hear me?

611
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
[ticking]

612
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,220

[people clamoring]

619
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,160
[Mike] <i>El, are you okay?</i>

620
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,830
El?

621
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,670
[sobbing] Mike... I'm sorry.

622
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,210
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

623
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,670
The gate...

624
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,970
I opened it.

625
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,060
I'm the monster.

626
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,150
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

627
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,810
You saved me.

628
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,780
Do you understand?
You saved me.

629
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,320
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.

630
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,210
[engine starting]
