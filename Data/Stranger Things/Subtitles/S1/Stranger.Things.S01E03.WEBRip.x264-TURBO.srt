00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,350
Hello?

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,530
Nancy?

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,610
Nancy!

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,450
[shouts] Hello?

00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,090

[voice echoes]

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,350
Hey, what's the matter?

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,440
Nothing.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,690
[growling continues]

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,150

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,590
You're so beautiful.

23
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,350

[theme music playing]

26
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,490
Steve?

27
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,500
- Hey, Steve.
- Mmm.

28
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,250
I'll...

29
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,300
see you tomorrow, okay?

30
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,430
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,280
[owl hooting]

32
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,630
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

33
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh, I scared you?

34
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,170
I know, I should have called.

35
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,840
[loudly] Where have you been?

36
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,380
[softly] We agreed on 10:00.

37
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,430
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

38
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,576
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

39
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,770
You didn't think to call and let me know?

40
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,520
With everything that's been going on?

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,350
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

42
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,190
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

43
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,570
Hey, wait...

44
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,820
Whose sweatshirt is that?

45
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,570
Steve's.

46
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,360
Steve's.

47
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,756
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

48
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,070
What?

49
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
No!

50
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,290
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

51
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,620
It's not a big deal.

52
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,870
Nancy?

53
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,540
What?

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,000
You can talk to me.

55
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,970
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

56
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,760
Nothing happened.

57
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,760
Nancy.

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Nothing happened.

59
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,150
Can I please go?

60
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,660
[swing creaking]

61
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,010
[Joyce softly] Will? Will?

62
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,760
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

63
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Will...

64
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,180
Please...

65
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,890
Will...

66
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,020
[grunts]

67
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,980
It's me.

68
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,560
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

69
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,650
Just say... [stammers]

70
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,900
- Mom?
- Jonathan!

71
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,860
- [stammering] Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

72
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,490
Come here. Come here.
[sniffles]

73
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,910
- What's going on?
- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

74
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,830
he's trying to talk to me.

75
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,790
[breath trembling]

76
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,000
- He's trying to talk to you?
- Yes, through... through the lights.

77
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,210
- Mom...
- I know.

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,670
I know.

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,880
Just... just watch.

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,550
Will... your brother's here.

81
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,430
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,310
Please...
[gasps] Did you see that?

83
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,350
It's the electricity, Mom.

84
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,746
- [stammering] It's acting up.
- No.

85
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,410
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,980
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

87
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,280
Something is going on here!

88
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,990
- Yesterday, the wall...
- What? What about the wall?

89
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,296
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,700
[stammers] I just know that Will is here.

91
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,280
- [sighs]
- No, Mom.

92
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,040
- [stammering] Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

93
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,540
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

94
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,790
He is just lost.

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,960
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

96
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,630
[stammering] Okay.

97
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,930
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

98
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,300
Okay, I'm sorry.
[sniffling] I'm sorry.

99
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,640
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

100
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

101
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,230
- [sniffling] Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

102
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,560
- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

103
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,610
- Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.

104
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,690
[sniffles]

105
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,570
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

106
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,150
- Okay.
- Yeah?

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,450
[Jonathan sighs]

108
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,750
[whispers] Will?

109
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,290
[radio static]

110
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,840
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

111
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,510
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

112
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,130
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

113
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,930
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,510
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,220
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

116
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,480
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,020
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

118
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,270
and the wrist rocket.

119
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,416
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

120
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,900
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

121
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,320
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

122
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,410
It's made up.

123
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,740
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

124
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,500
- and blind it.
- [sighs] Dustin, what did you get?

125
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,580
Well, alrighty.

126
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,920
So, we've got...

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,380
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

128
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,010
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

129
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,260
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

130
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,850
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

131
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,060
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

132
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,770
- We have her.
- [Lucas] She shut one door!

133
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,020
With her mind!

134
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,770
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

135
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,730
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

136
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,900
Like...

137
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,450
I bet... that she could make this fly!

138
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,160
Hey. Hey.

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,830
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,750
[clatters]

141
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,210
Okay, one more time.

142
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,540
- Okay.
- [sighs]

143
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,340
Use your powers, okay?

144
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,920
[clatters]

145
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,420
- Idiot.
- [Mike sighs]

146
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,180
- She's not a dog!
- [Karen] Boys!

147
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,010
Time for school!

148
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,220
Just stay down here.

149
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,560
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

150
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,100
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

151
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,060
- [Karen] Michael!
- Coming!

152
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,520
You know those power lines?

153
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,400
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
The ones behind my house?

155
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,820
Yes.

156
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,440
Meet us there, after school.

157
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,200
After school?

158
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,610
Yeah, 3:15.

159
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,830
Ah.

160
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,500
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

161
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,800
"Three-one-five."

162
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,840
Three-one-five.

163
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,600
[footsteps receding]

164
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,100
[indistinct chatter]

165
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,410
Hey!

166
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,580
[laughs nervously] Hey!

167
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,160
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

168
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,700
Yeah, totally.

169
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,790
I just...

170
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,210
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

171
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

172
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,130
I know.

173
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,050
I know.
Of course not.

174
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,680
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

175
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,850
You're being paranoid.

176
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,310
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's cute.

177
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Hey...

178
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,270
I had a good time.

179
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.

180
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,110
Yeah.
Me, too.

181
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,790
[both chuckle softly]

182
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,080
Mmm.

You can contact, uh...

We got a local kid that's missing.

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,290
Yeah. We are.

356
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,340
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the <i>Times,</i>

357
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,840
and we'll check out the <i>Post.</i>

358
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,090
[scoffs]

359
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,390
The librarian?

360
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,190
[timer ticking]

361
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,900
[Joyce chuckles] Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

362
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

363
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,950
I don't know, he...

364
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,700
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

365
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,280
[stammers] It's silly, I know.

366
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,410
No.
No, it's not silly.

367
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,500
How is Jonathan holding up?

368
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,540
[inhales deeply] You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

369
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,580
He always has been, you know?

370
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,920
I...

371
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,170
[scoffs] I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

372
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,800
Is something the matter?

373
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,220
Uh, no.

374
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,550
No, I just...

375
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,850
We're having electrical problems.

376
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,060
Joyce.

377
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,560
I want you to know something.

378
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,770
If you need anything, anything at all...

379
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,400
Ted and I are here for you.

380
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,520
[Joyce] Thank you.
Thanks.

381
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,900
Okay.

382
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,740
[Joyce] How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

383
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,610
Is he, uh, okay?

384
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,660
[Karen] Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

385
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,290
He skipped school yesterday.

386
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,330
He's never done anything like that before.

387
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,360
[gasps]

388
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,980
[low growling]

389
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,950
- [timer dings]
- Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

390
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,130
Oh, where's Holly?

391
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,760
[breathing heavily]

392
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,430
[Joyce] Hey!

393
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,180
She shouldn't be here.

394
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,770
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

395
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,110
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

396
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,860
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

397
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,820
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

398
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,780
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

399
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,120
but I need you to leave.

400
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,910
Okay?

401
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,080
[Karen sighs]

402
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,500
- [line ringing]
- Come on, come on, come on...

403
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,540
- [Ms. Holland] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

404
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,500
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

405
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,960
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

406
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,090
<i>Good.
I'm good.</i>

407
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,380
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

408
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,430
<i>Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.</i>

409
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,890
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

410
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,230
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

411
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,100
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

412
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,360
I meant, did she come home this morning?

413
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,610
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

414
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,900
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

415
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,910
Do... Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

416
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,620
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

417
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,670
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

418
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,080
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,340
[sighs]

420
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,800
[bell rings]

421
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,140
Hey, man.

422
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,270
What's going on?

423
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,350
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

424
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,786
[Carol] We've heard great things.
[Tommy] Yeah, sounds cool.

425
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

426
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,570
[sighs] I don't know
what you're talking about.

427
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,926
[Steve] Oh, no? Oh...
[Jonathan] Hey.

428
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,160
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

429
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,756
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

430
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,040
Here we go.

431
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,830
Ah...

432
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,910
Here we go.

433
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,710
- Oh, man.
- [Tommy] Let me see.

434
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Dude.

435
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,210
[Tommy exclaims]

436
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,606
[scoffs] Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

437
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,316
- I was looking for my brother.
- [Steve] No.

438
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,090
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,430
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

440
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,640
What?

441
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,770
This creep was spying on us last night.

442
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,100
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

443
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,650
[Steve clicks tongue] See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

444
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,780
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

445
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
It's hardwired into 'em.

446
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,790
You know, they just can't help themselves.

447
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,750
- [Tommy laughs]
- [Steve] So...

448
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,540
we'll just have to take away his toy.

449
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,750
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

450
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,550
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

451
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,550
- [Tommy chuckles]
- It's okay.

452
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,640
Here you go, man.

453
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
[Tommy laughing]

454
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,520
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

455
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,230
Boo.

456
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,610
- [ripping photo]
- [Carol gasps] Bye.

457
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,160
[Steve] Hey, Nance!

458
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,500
Come on.

459
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,980
[breathing heavily]

460
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,360
Three-one-five.

461
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,030
Three-one-five.

462
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,320
[softly] Three-one-five.

463
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,290
[cat meows]

464
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,420
[cat growling]

465
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,670
[hisses]

466
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,010
[cat growls]

467
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,890
[beeping]

468
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
[hisses]

469
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,320
[cat snarling]

470
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,910
[cat growling]

471
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,580
[whimpers]

472
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,290
[crying]

473
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,020
No! No!

474
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,390
Papa! Papa!

475
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,770
Papa!

476
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,940
Papa!

477
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,320
[screaming] Papa!

478
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,190
[shrieking]

479
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,990
No!

480
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,240
[shrieking]

481
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,830
[neck snapping]

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,050
[panting]

483
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,500
[sobs]

484
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,500
Incredible.

485
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
[sniffles]

486
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,600
[sobbing]

487
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,720
[Mike] El!

488
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,220
[panting] You okay?

489
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,600
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

490
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

491
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,240
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

492
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,700
- blow me."
- [Tommy laughing]

493
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,186
[Steve] Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

494
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,670
Saturday.

495
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,540
[Tommy] I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

496
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,790
[Carol] Oh, he's so a virgin!

497
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,760
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

498
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,220
[chuckling]

499
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,840
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

500
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,430
[Nancy stammering] I totally forgot.

501
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,100
I told my mom I would, um...

502
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,640
I would do something with her.

503
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,656
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

504
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,140
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,150
[sighs] What the hell's wrong with her?

506
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,190
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

507
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh, give me a break.

508
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,650
[Carol] What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

509
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,660
Why did they hurt you?

510
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,870
What?

511
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,460
Oh, that.

512
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
Uh...

513
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,300
I just fell at recess.

514
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,420
- Mike...
- Yeah?

515
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,970
Friends tell the truth.

516
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,100
[Mike sighs]

517
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,010
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

518
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,560
Mouth breather?

519
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,560
Yeah, you know...

520
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,770
a dumb person.

521
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,020
A knucklehead.

522
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,190
[Eleven] Knucklehead?

523
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,900
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

524
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,820
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

525
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,030
- Mike...
- Yeah?

526
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,620
I understand.

527
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,950
Oh.

528
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,790
Okay, cool.

529
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,080
Cool.

530
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,480
Barb?

531
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,980
Barb!

532
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,710
Barb?

533
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,590
[rustling]

534
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,720
Barb?

535
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,320
[rustling]

536
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,490
Barb?

537
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,410
[growling]

538
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,490
Oh!

539
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,000
[panting]

540
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,920
[porch swing creaking]

541
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,220
[dog whines]

542
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,890
[barking]

543
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,720
[sighs]

544
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,610
[sniffles]

545
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,570
Will... are you here?

546
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,110
[exclaims]

547
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,030
Okay, good, good, good, good.

548
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,990
Are you...

549
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,120
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

550
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,670
[stammers] Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

551
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,790
Can you do...

552
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,590
[exclaims] Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

553
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,800
[crying] Baby, I need to know...

554
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,430
[exhales heavily] Are you alive?

555
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,270
[sighing]

556
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,690
[softly] Are you safe?

557
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,200
[exclaims]

558
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,120
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

559
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,670
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

560
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,080
Can you...

561
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,750
[whimpering] Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

562
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,720
[voice breaking] Please just...

563
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
[mutters]

564
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,140
Will...

565
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,180
[sniffling]

566
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,290
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

567
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,710
Nancy?
What's the matter?

568
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,880
[crying] It's Barb.

569
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,180
I think...

570
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,470
something happened.

571
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,470
[sniffles] Something terrible.

572
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,890
[Powell] <i>I don't know, Chief.</i>

573
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,230
What don't you know?

574
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,480
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

575
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,610
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

576
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,780
She's been discredited.

577
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,006
- [sighs]
- Claim was thrown out...

578
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,160
Okay, forget about her.

579
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,490
Take a look at this.

580
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,790
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

581
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,500
Brenner.

582
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,500
He runs Hawkins Lab.

583
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,620
Okay.

584
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,210
[scoffs] You don't find that interesting?

585
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,710
Not really.

586
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,670
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

587
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,930
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

588
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,140
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

589
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

590
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,576
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

591
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,520
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

592
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,020
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

593
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,440
[sighs] Come on, man.

594
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,820
Work with me here.

595
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,490
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

596
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm just...

597
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,280
[sighs]

598
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,950
I'm saying maybe something happened.

599
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,880
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

600
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,880
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

601
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,630
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

602
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,260
[Callahan] <i>Hey, Powell,</i>
<i>is the chief with you?</i>

603
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,550
Hopper here.
What do you got?

604
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,860
[siren blaring]

605
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,180
[Eleven] Here.

606
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,810
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

607
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,430
Hiding.

608
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,150
No, no, this is where he lives.

609
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,230
He's missing from here.
Understand?

610
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,800
- [Lucas] What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

611
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,570
Um... no!

612
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,320
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing...

613
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,910
That's exactly what we did.

614
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,040
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

615
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,830
- Why did you bring us here?
- [stammers]

616
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,130
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

617
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,856
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

618
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,526
- We are not calling the cops!
- [Dustin] Hey, guys?

619
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,760
- What other choice do we have?
- Guys!

620
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,590
[sirens approaching]

621
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,680
[Mike] Will...

622
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,950
[exhales]

623
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay.

624
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,410
Okay, baby, talk to me.

625
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,210
Talk to me.
Where are you?

626
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,880
"R." Good, good, good, good.

627
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,340
That's good.
Come on, come on.

628
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,170
"I...

629
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,380
G...

630
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,140
H... T...

631
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,100
H...

632
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,180
E...

633
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,310
R... E..."

634
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,980
"Right here."

635
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,100
"Right here"?

636
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,860
[stammers] I don't know what that means.

637
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,230
I need you to tell me what to do.

638
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
What should I do?

639
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,650
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

640
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,580
[gasping]

641
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,340
[Joyce whimpers]

642
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,130
[monster screeching]

643
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,300
[sirens wailing]

644
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,140
[Hopper] Oh, Jesus.

645
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,940
[panting]

646
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,400
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

647
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,530
[indistinct radio chatter]

648
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,920
[breathing heavily]

649
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,350
It's not Will.
It can't be.

650
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,480
It's Will.
It's really Will.

651
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,410
[Eleven] Mike...

652
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,660
- "Mike"? "Mike," what?
- [gasps]

653
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,870
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

654
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,370
You said he was alive!

655
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,870
Why did you lie to us?

656
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,170
What's wrong with you?

657
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,000
What is wrong with you?

658
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,300
- [softly] Mike...
- What?

659
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,220
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

660
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,350
Mike...

661
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,100
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

662
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,270
[Lucas] Mike!

663
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,900
[shrieks]

664
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,280
- [Joyce gasps]
- [Jonathan] Mom?

665
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,250
- Mom, what happened?
- [Joyce whimpers]

666
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,580
[Jonathan] It's okay.

667
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:36,920
Hey.

668
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,510
[Karen] Michael?

669
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,470
What's wrong?

670
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,810
[sobbing]

671
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,830
