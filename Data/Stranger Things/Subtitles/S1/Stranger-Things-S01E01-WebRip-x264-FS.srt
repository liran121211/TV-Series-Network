[crickets chirping]

00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,426
[alarm blaring]

3
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,971
[panting]

4
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,687
[elevator descending]

00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,820
[elevator dings]

00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,994
[breathing heavily]

00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:25,799
[low growling]

8
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:31,263
[screaming]

9
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,649
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

10
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:47,321
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

11
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:49,364
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

12
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:50,782
What if it's the Demogorgon?

13
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,910
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

14
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,037
It's not the Demogorgon.

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,372
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

16
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,583
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya. [Chuckling]

17
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,460
- [snorts]
- [all chuckling]

18
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,463
[softly] Wait a minute.

19
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,090
Did you hear that?

20
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,592
That... that sound?

21
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,345
Boom... boom...

22
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,180
- [yells] Boom!
- [slams table]

23
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,140
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

24
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:16,892
That came from something else.

25
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,355
- The Demogorgon!
- [all groaning]

26
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:22,898
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

27
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,274
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

28
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:25,651
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

29
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,569
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

30
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:30,197
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,991
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

32
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,868
It stomps towards you.

33
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,952
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

34
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,330
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

35
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:41,249
- He roars in anger!
- [all clamoring]

36
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,834
- Fireball!
- [die clattering]

37
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,544
- Oh, shit!
- [Lucas] Where'd it go?

38
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:46,338
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Will] I don't know!

39
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,964
- Is it a 13?
- [Will] I don't know!

40
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,216
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Dustin] Oh, my God!

41
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,884
[Karen] Mike!
[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,052
[Karen] Mike!
[Lucas] Can you find it yet?

43
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,220
[Will] No, I can't find it!

44
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,971
- Mike!
- [Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

45
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,848
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

46
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:59,059
You mean the end? Fifteen after.

47
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:02,312
[Lucas] Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
[Will] Why do we have to go?

48
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,107
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,651
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

50
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,334
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

51
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,612
I'm serious, Mom.

52
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:13,156
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,158
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

54
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,119
You've been playing for ten hours?

55
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:22,249
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...
- I think you should listen to your mother.

56
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:25,794
- [static crackling on TV]
- [grunts] Dang dumb piece of junk.

57
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,797
[Will] Oh, I got it!

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,757
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

59
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,969
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

60
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:39,766
[Dustin] Yo, hey, guys.

61
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,727
- Does anyone want this?
- [both] No.

62
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:46,356
[Nancy] Yeah.

63
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,734
No, I don't think...

64
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,445
Yeah, he's cute.

65
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:54,865
Barb, no, I don't think so.

66
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,408
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

67
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,660
There's a slice left if you want it.

68
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,079
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

69
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,882
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

70
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:13,765
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- [Lucas] Yeah.

71
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:16,362
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

72
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:18,228
[Dustin] Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

73
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:19,598
She's always been a real jerk.

74
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:21,558
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

75
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,019
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

76
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:25,312
[Mike] Four years ago!

77
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,855
[Dustin] Just saying.
[Lucas] Later.

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,484
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

79
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,319
The roll, it was a seven.

80
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,614
The Demogorgon, it got me.

81
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,658
[grunts] See you tomorrow.

82
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,344
[Lucas] Good night, ladies.
[Dustin] Kiss your mom 'night for me.

83
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,764
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

84
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,516
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:05,519
[Dustin] Hey! Hey!

86
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,562
I didn't say "go"!

87
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:11,650
Get back here!

88
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,860
I'm gonna kill you!

89
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,363
[Will] I'll take your X-Men 134!

90
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,204
Son of a bitch.

91
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,021

98
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,639
Mom?

99
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:27,267
- Jonathan? Mom?
- [barking continues]

00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,494

00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,916
- Hello? Hello?

111
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,524

00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,488
[screeching intensifies]

113
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:08,785
[screeching stops]

114
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:22,424
[theme music playing]

115
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,527
[indistinct chatter on TV]

116
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,905
[woman on TV] And that's it
for News Center this morning.

117
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,323
Thanks for joining us.

118
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,700
Let's hand off now to Liz
at the news desk.

119
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,202
[Liz] All right, thank you, Donna.

120
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:33,369
Turning now to local news,

121
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,873
we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.

122
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,918
Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,

123
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:42,378
leaving many residents in the dark.

124
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,589
The cause of the outage is still unknown.

125
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,883
We reached out to Roane County
Water and Electric,

126
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,511
and a spokesperson says
that they are confident

127
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,180
power will be restored
to all remaining homes

128
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:53,807
within the next several hours.

129
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,642
[news continues indistinctly]

130
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,143
- [dog barking]
- [snorts]

131
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,562
[sighs]

132
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:03,900
- [groans]

133
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:12,200
[lighter flicks]

134
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,081
[inhales and exhales deeply]

135
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,543
Mmm.

136
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:29,092
[groans]

137
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:42,230
[exhales]

138
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:43,356
[sighs]

139
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,201
In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight

140
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,578
or at least pack an umbrella.

141
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:59,080
We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.

142
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,499
[birds chirping]

143
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,587
[Joyce] Where the hell are they?

144
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,089
- Jonathan?
- Check the couch!

145
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:09,299
Ugh, I did.

146
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:12,886
Oh... Got them.

147
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,347
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

148
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:18,266
- Yeah, see you later.
- Where's Will?

149
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:19,469
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

150
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:20,643
- He's probably still sleeping.
- [sighs]

151
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,855
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

152
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,773
I told you this a thousand times.

153
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:29,485
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

154
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,242
- He came home last night, right?
- He's not in his room?

155
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:38,620
- Did he come home or not?
- I don't know.

156
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:39,954
- You don't know?
- No.

157
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:42,081
[stammering] I got home late.
I was working.

158
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,207
You were working?

159
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,209
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

160
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:46,753
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

161
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,547
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

162
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,549
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

163
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,801
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

164
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:56,554
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- [sighs] I can't believe you.

165
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:59,223
I can't believe you sometimes.

166
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,772
- [phone ringing]
- That's disgusting.

167
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,066
- [Mike] You're disgusting!
- Hello?

168
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:09,901
Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.

169
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:12,028
- [Karen] Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

170
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:13,279
- [Ted] Hey!
- Quiet!

171
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,073
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

172
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:16,532
Was that Will I heard back there?

173
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,117
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

174
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,619
Will didn't spend the night?

175
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:22,121
[Karen] No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.

176
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:23,539
Why? He's not home?

177
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:27,460
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

178
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:29,545
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

179
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,898
[school bell ringing]

180
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,404
That's weird. I don't see him.

181
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,030
[Lucas] I'm telling you, his mom's right.

182
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:57,949
He probably just
went to class early again.

183
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:00,535
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

184
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:02,537
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,873
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

186
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:08,584
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

187
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:14,257
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

188
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,509
[sighs]

189
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,846
[mimicking Dustin]
I'd go with Toothless.

190
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:23,391
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

191
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,226
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

192
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,311
[mimicking Dustin]
"I told you a million times."

193
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,439
- [chuckles]
- Do the arm thing.

194
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:31,566
Do it, freak!

195
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,822
- [bones cracking]
- [both groaning]

196
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,158
[Troy] God, it gets me every time.

197
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,328
- Assholes.
- [Mike] I think it's kinda cool.

198
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,581
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

199
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:48,541
Like Mr. Fantastic.

200
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,877
[Dustin] Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

201
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,967
[bell ringing]

202
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:01,012
[Barbara] So, did he call?

203
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:03,639
Keep your voice down.

204
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,308
Did he?

205
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,143
I told you, it's not like that.

206
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:11,481
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

207
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,483
We just...

208
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,110
made out a couple times.

209
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:19,572
"We just... made out a couple times."

210
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:20,990
Nance, seriously,

211
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:23,159
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

212
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:24,660
No, I'm not.

213
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:28,414
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

214
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:31,292
If you become friends with Tommy H.
Or Carol...

215
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:32,668
Oh, that's gross!

216
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:34,921
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

217
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,840
- Two-time thing.
- [chuckles]

218
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:43,971
You were saying?

219
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,858
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

220
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,610
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

221
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:58,986
[bell ringing]

222
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,364
Steve. I really, like...

223
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,282
Seriously, I have to go.

224
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,742
Wait, wait, wait. Let's...

225
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:06,702
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

226
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:09,705
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

227
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,041
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

228
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,835
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

229
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,087
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

230
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,172
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

231
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,591
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

232
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:23,636
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

233
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,888
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

234
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,223
You are crazy.

235
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,142
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

236
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,518
We can just...

237
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:32,520
We can just, like, chill in my car.

238
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:35,565
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

239
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:39,068
Steve... I have to study.

240
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:40,862
I'm not kidding.

241
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,239
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

242
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:46,993
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

243
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:48,619
[sighs]

244
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,543
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

245
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:57,753
To study.

246
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,925
[bell ringing]

247
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,268
Good of you to show.

248
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:16,022
[Hopper slurring] Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

249
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:19,775
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

250
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:20,860
- Oh, yeah?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

251
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:23,543
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

252
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,572
[officers laughing]

253
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:26,199
While you were drinking or sleeping,

254
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:29,243
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

255
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:30,328
Phil Larson called.

256
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,080
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

257
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:34,624
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

258
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,959
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

259
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:38,586
On a more pressing matter,

260
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:40,713
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

261
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,549
[muffled] Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

262
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,843
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

263
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,803
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

264
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:50,223
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

265
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:54,185
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

266
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,448
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

267
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:10,117
[sighs deeply] And I apologize again.

268
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,577
I'm going out of my mind!

269
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:15,248
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

270
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,333
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

271
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,960
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

272
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,753
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

273
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,421
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

274
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,173
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

275
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:27,218
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

276
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,804
He's not like... most.

277
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:33,766
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

278
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:35,685
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

279
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,812
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

280
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:39,855
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

281
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:42,233
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

282
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:45,361
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

283
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:49,156
Lonnie... [sighs]
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

284
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,575
[softy] Called him a fag.

285
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:54,579
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

286
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,457
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

287
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,584
[scoffs]

288
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:04,922
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

289
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,806
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

290
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,719
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

291
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:13,014
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

292
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,224
the kid is with a parent or relative.

293
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,809
[stammers] What about the other time?

294
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:20,229
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

295
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:22,356
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

296
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,566
The one!

297
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,484
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
- [sighs]

298
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,320
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

299
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:28,487
in the four years I've been working here?

300
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:29,739
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

301
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:32,950
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

302
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:34,754
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

303
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:37,496
Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie.

304
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,290
He will talk to me before he talks to...

305
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,334
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

306
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:45,421
[voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop.

307
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,381
Find him!

308
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,144
[man] Dr. Brenner.

309
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:03,773
[scientist] This way, gentlemen.

310
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,692
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

311
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:10,613
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

312
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,455
[air hissing]

313
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,676
[guns cocking]

314
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,429
[elevator humming]

315
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,564
[elevator thuds]

316
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:30,484
[squelching]

317
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:39,160
[low growling]

318
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:53,048
[indistinct growling]

319
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,430
[man 1] This is where it came from?
[man 2] Yes.

320
00:20:59,513 --> 00:21:00,514
[man 1] And the girl?

321
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,268
She can't have gone far.

322
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:08,105
[growls]

323
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,932
[music playing faintly]

324
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,240
[Ben] All right, and one more.

325
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,117
[man] Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

326
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:03,744
Hey, I don't know. I don't know.

327
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:06,163
[man] I don't know,
37 points per game average...

328
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:08,127
[Ben] Thirty-seven now, but...
[man] Mr. Basket.

329
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:30,563
[indistinct chatter]

330
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:39,613
Hey!

331
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:40,823
Come here!

332
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:42,866
Hey, come here!

333
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:49,582
You think you can steal from me, boy?

334
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,252
What in the hell?

335
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:57,631
- [bell ringing]
- [Mr. Clarke] Remember, finish chapter 12

336
00:22:57,715 --> 00:23:01,510
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

337
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,721
and other forms of science investigation.

338
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:07,683
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

339
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,811
[trailing off] It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

340
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,856
So, did it come?

341
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,316
Sorry, boys.

342
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,276
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

343
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:19,485
it came.

344
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,991
Yes!

345
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:25,868
The Heathkit ham shack.

346
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,411
[Mike] Whoa.
[Mr. Clarke] Ain't she a beaut?

347
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,538
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

348
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:30,789
Think bigger.

349
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,875
- California?
- Bigger.

350
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,335
Australia?

351
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,879
- [boys exclaiming]
- [Lucas] Oh, man!

352
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,840
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

353
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:41,008
Lucas!

354
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,468
- Sorry.
- [Dustin chuckles]

355
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:44,928
[radio tuning]

356
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:47,431
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

357
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:50,225
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

358
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:52,978
[Lucas] What are you doing?

359
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:54,229
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Dustin,

360
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:57,316
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

361
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,568
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

362
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:01,654
- [Mike laughs]
- [knock on door]

363
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:06,575
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

364
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:10,329
[overlapping chatter]

365
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,123
Okay, okay, okay.

366
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,168
One at a time, all right? You.

367
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:18,879
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

368
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:21,548
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:25,135
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

370
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:27,012
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

371
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:29,973
- Well, The Hobbit.
- It doesn't matter.

372
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:31,892
- He asked!
- [mockingly] "He asked!"

373
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,560
- [Mike] Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

374
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:35,604
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

375
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:38,982
One at a damn time. You.

376
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:42,277
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

377
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:43,737
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

378
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:46,323
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...
- We can show you, if you want.

379
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:47,741
I said that I know it!

380
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:49,743
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

381
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:51,745
- No.
- [boys clamoring]

382
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,957
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

383
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,250
Immediately.

384
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:00,129
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

385
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,296
no nonsense.

386
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,340
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

387
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:06,218
- The Hobbit.
- Shut up!

388
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,678
- Hey!
- [Mike] Stop it!

389
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:08,887
[boys bickering]

390
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:10,889
[softly] Do I make myself clear?

391
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:20,649
Do I make myself... clear?

392
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,444
[Mike and Dustin] Yes, sir.
[Lucas] Yeah.

393
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,999
Ring-a-ding-ding!

394
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,792
Anybody home?

395
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:40,502
[Will] Password?

396
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,546
Uh, Rada...

397
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,383
[stammering] Radaga... Radagast?

398
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,886
[Will] Yeah. You may enter.

399
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:51,430
[Joyce] Thank you, sir.

400
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,057
So, guess what?

401
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,602
I got off early and...

402
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,354
Ta-da! Poltergeist.

403
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:00,981
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

404
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,441
I changed my mind.

405
00:26:03,484 --> 00:26:05,364
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

406
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:07,905
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

407
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:08,989
Oh, yeah?

408
00:26:09,072 --> 00:26:10,741
Not even of clowns?

409
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:11,909
No.

410
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:14,369
What about my witch?

411
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:15,871
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

412
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:17,790
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

413
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:20,473
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

414
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,629
[sighs]

415
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:25,798
[Jonathan] Will?

416
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,466
- [shouting] Will?
- Will?

417
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:30,260
Will?

418
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:34,807
- Will?
- Will!

419
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,601
- [Jonathan] Will!
- Will?

420
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:39,228
[Joyce] Will!

421
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:40,979
Where are you?

422
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:51,573
Geez.

423
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:54,201
Your parents forget to feed you?

424
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:59,706
Is that why you ran away?

425
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:04,378
They, uh...

426
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:06,547
They hurt you?

427
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:11,134
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

428
00:27:11,218 --> 00:27:12,898
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

429
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,140
All right.

430
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:22,354
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

431
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,461
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

432
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,883
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

433
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,945
We got a deal?

434
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:35,576
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

435
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:39,037
My name's Benny. Benny Hammond.

436
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,831
See? Like this. Here.

437
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:43,834
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

438
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:47,379
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

439
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:51,508
[sighing]

440
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:55,762
[sighs]

441
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:57,764
Eleven?

442
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,100
What's that mean?

443
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,728
What's it mean?

444
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:06,064
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

445
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:07,858
She speaks.

446
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:09,610
"No"? No, what?

447
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,406
[clicks tongue] All right.
I guess no more food, then.

448
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:15,657
Eleven.

449
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,076
Yeah.

450
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,954
What's it mean?

451
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:24,124
Eleven.

452
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,003
All right, then.

453
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,838
[chuckles] Here you go.

454
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,673
Take it easy, take it easy.

455
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:33,967
[sighs]

456
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:36,678
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

457
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,889
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

458
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:40,599
kidnapped or something.

459
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,686
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

460
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,233
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

461
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:51,109
[fan rattling]

462
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:58,992
[rattling continues]

463
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:03,956
[rattling intensifies]

464
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,886
[Callahan] Will Byers?

465
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:22,057
[Powell yelling] Will!

466
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:25,560
[Callahan] Will Byers?

467
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,187
[hooting]

468
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,565
Come on, kid!

469
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:31,900
[Powell] Will?

470
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:36,822
- [Powell whistles]
- Hey! I got something.

471
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,790
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

472
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,843
[Callahan] You think
he got hurt in the fall?

473
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:52,129
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

474
00:29:52,212 --> 00:29:54,131
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

475
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:55,841
He would've walked it home.

476
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,933
[static]

477
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:06,727

478
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:07,811
[woman 1] ...get off work if I win.

479
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:09,563
[woman 2] Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...

480
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:12,441
[woman 3] ...but we will cover
whatever the damages are to your property.

481
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:14,192
- It's just, um...
- [woman 4] That's for sure.

482
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:16,903
- [overlapping conversations]
- [line ringing]

483
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:24,703
[Joyce] Is Lonnie there?

484
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:27,080
[woman] Lonnie isn't here right now.
[Joyce] Can you please...

485
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:29,041
- I told you, Lonnie's not here.
- Who is this?

486
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:31,126
- His girlfriend, Cynthia.
- Cynthia.

487
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:33,920
- Who the hell is this?
- Cynthia, this is Joyce.

488
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,756
- Who?
- Lonnie's ex-wife.

489
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,883
- I really need to speak to him...
- Lonnie's not here.

490
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,843
- Can you please put... No!
- Why don't you call back later?

491
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:41,136
No, not later. Now!

492
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,387
- Can...
- [line disconnects]

493
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:43,889
- Bitch!
- [Jonathan] Mom.

494
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:46,433
- What?
- You have to stay calm.

495
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:47,851
[chuckles]

496
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:51,938
[Joyce muttering]

497
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:55,108
[phone ringing]

498
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:56,234
[Lonnie] Hey, you've reached Lonnie.

499
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:58,528
Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.

500
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:02,366
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

501
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:04,951
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

502
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,203
[voice breaking] I need...

503
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:08,872
I just need you to call me back,
please, just...

504
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:11,458
- [answering machine beeps]
- [line disconnects]

505
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,293
- Damn it! Damn it!
- [car approaching]

506
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:15,045
- [sighs deeply]
- Mom?

507
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:16,129
What?

508
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:19,341
Cops.

509
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:37,734
- It was just lying there?
- Yeah. Cal?

510
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:42,322
- Did it have any blood on it, or...
- No, no, no, no, no...

511
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:43,907
Phil?

512
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,410
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

513
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,330
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

514
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:52,749
So...

515
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,876
maybe he came home.

516
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,003
[stammers] You think I didn't check
my own house?

517
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm not saying that.

518
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,551
- Has this always been here?
- [Joyce] What? I don't know.

519
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,470
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

520
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:08,265
You're not sure?

521
00:32:08,348 --> 00:32:10,434
- [Joyce sighs]
- [dog barking]

522
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,354
[barks]

523
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:21,236
Hey.

524
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,614
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

525
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:27,200
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

526
00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:28,512
[indistinct squelching]

527
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,809
[squelching stops]

528
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,822
- [Callahan] Hey!
- Jesus!

529
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,492
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

530
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:53,036
- [exhales]
- What's going on?

531
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,331
Hello?

532
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:59,501
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

533
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:00,919
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

534
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:04,130
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

535
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:06,508
[Callahan] Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

536
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:16,309
[Mike] We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

537
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:18,270
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says...

538
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:19,854
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

539
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,606
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

540
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,899
More reason to stay put.

541
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,026
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

542
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,159
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

543
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:35,662
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

544
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:36,997
What? Why not?

545
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,292
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

546
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,420
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

547
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:45,297
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

548
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,798
So we're under house arrest?

549
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:48,800
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

550
00:34:48,883 --> 00:34:51,177
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

551
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,804
- No!
- You're just pissed off

552
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:54,848
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

553
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:57,726
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

554
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,228
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

555
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:02,105
- Language!
- [groans]

556
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:05,191
Nancy, come back.

557
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:07,277
Come back!

558
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,780
[sighs] It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

559
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:12,532
You see, Michael?

560
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,909
- You see what happens?
- [shouting] What happens when what?

561
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:18,580
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

562
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,707
That is really unfair, son.

563
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,000
We care.

564
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:26,796
[sighs]

565
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,673
- Mike!
- Let him go.

566
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:33,803
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

567
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:36,097
What did I do?

568
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:41,019
Hey! What'd I do?

569
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:46,107
[boy] Will! [Man 1] Will Byers!

570
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:47,233
[man 2] Will!

571
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,152
[woman] Will, we're here for you, bud!

572
00:35:49,235 --> 00:35:51,029
[volunteers shouting indistinctly]

573
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,240
[Mr. Clarke] He's a good student.

574
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:57,744
- [Hopper] What?
- Will. He's a good student.

575
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:59,454
Great one, actually.

576
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,873
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

577
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:05,251
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

578
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,337
[Hopper] I always had
a distaste for science.

579
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,381
[Mr. Clarke] Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

580
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:11,800
[Hopper] Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

581
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:14,511
[Mr. Clarke chuckles] Ratliff?
You bet.

582
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:16,763
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

583
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:20,642
[Hopper] Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

584
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:22,769
Sarah, my daughter...

585
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:28,316
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

586
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,860
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

587
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:32,696
I never needed to look elsewhere.

588
00:36:33,238 --> 00:36:35,038
[Mr. Clarke] Your daughter,
what grade is she?

589
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:37,867
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

590
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,495
She lives with her mom in the city.

591
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:44,040
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

592
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:49,129
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

593
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,463
His kid.

594
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:04,477
Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike.

595
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:07,397
- Lucas?
- Hey, it's Lucas.

596
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,481
I know it's you.

597
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:11,735
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

598
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:13,445
I'm done. Over.

599
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,947
I'm worried about Will. Over.

600
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,074
[sighs] Yeah.

601
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,828
This is crazy. Over.

602
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:23,538
I was thinking...

603
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,876
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

604
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:28,960
He cast Fireball.

605
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:32,797
- Over.
- What's your point? Over.

606
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:37,594
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

607
00:37:37,677 --> 00:37:39,554
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

608
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:40,764
Over.

609
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:45,977
Meet me in ten. Over and out.

612
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,801
[whispers] What are you doing here?

613
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:20,178
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

614
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:23,097
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

615
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,433
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

616
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,310
So just... bear with me.

617
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:28,686
[window rattles]

618
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:31,356
What'd I tell you?

619
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:33,900
Ninja.

You like that ice cream, huh?

623
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,085
Smile looks good on you.

624
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,504
You know, smile?

625
00:38:57,048 --> 00:39:00,385
- [chuckles]

[knocking on door]

627
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:05,265
All right. You just sit tight.

628
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:08,726
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

629
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:13,606
- [knocking continues]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

630
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:17,235
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

631
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:19,571
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

632
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:22,407
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

633
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,368
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

634
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:28,288
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

635
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,623
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

636
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:34,669
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

637
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:37,380
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

638
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:40,800
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

639
00:39:40,884 --> 00:39:42,719
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

640
00:39:42,802 --> 00:39:44,602
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

641
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,722
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

642
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:48,365
- Your, uh, voice sounds different on the...

Hey, guys. You feel that?

652
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,273
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

653
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:39,984
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

654
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:41,194
Come on.

That's weird, I... don't see them.

686
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:28,676
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

687
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,345
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

688
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:33,556
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

689
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,224
You mean, you're not a slut.

690
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,143
That's not what I'm saying.

691
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:38,978
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

692
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:40,730
Shut up.

693
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:44,984
Bad Steve.

694
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:48,613
[groans] Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

695
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:51,240
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

696
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:54,202
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

697
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:00,541
[Steve grunts]

698
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,211
"Compared to the rate
of inorganic reactions,

699
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:07,048
the rate of organic reactions
is generally..."

700
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:08,591
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain falling]

701
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:13,096
[Joyce] Jonathan, wow.
You took these?

702
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:15,515
These are great.

703
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:19,602
[sniffling] Wow, they really are.

704
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,856
I know I haven't been there for you.
[stammers] I've been...

705
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,025
working so hard and I...

706
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:27,944
I just feel bad. I don't even...

707
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:30,488
barely know what's going on with you.
[chuckles]

708
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:33,324
All right?
I am sorry about that.

709
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:35,701
[Jonathan sobs softly]

710
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:37,995
Hey, what is it?

711
00:43:38,913 --> 00:43:40,248
What is it, honey?

712
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:44,418
- Nothing. [Sniffles]
- Tell me. Tell me.

713
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:46,546
- Come on. You can...
- No.

714
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:47,797
It's just...

715
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,800
[voice breaking]
I should've been there for him.

716
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:53,886
[hoarsely] No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

717
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,181
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

718
00:43:57,265 --> 00:44:00,935
He is... close.
I know it. [Stammers] I...

719
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:04,313
I feel it in my heart.
[sniffles]

720
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:07,859
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

721
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:09,193
[sniffles]

722
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:12,280
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this.

723
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:14,740
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

724
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:16,159
[both laugh]

725
00:44:17,076 --> 00:44:19,245
- I mean, that's it, right?
- Yeah.

726
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:21,122
[hoarsely] That's it.
That's the one.

727
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:22,665
- [sighs]
- [phone ringing]

728
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:27,628
- Hello?
- [static on phone]

729
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:29,338
- Hello?
- [static continues]

730
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:30,464
Lonnie?

731
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:32,300
- Dad?
- Hopper?

732
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,427
- [muffled breathing on phone]
- Who is this?

733
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,345
[breathing continues]

734
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:38,764
Will?

735
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,725
- Will?
- It's Will?

736
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,477
- [scrambled voice chitters]
- [static]

737
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,937
- [sobs]
- Mom, it's Will?

738
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:47,356
- [yelling] Who is this?
- [indistinct growling]

739
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,600
- [yelling] What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

740
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,152
Give me back my son!

741
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:53,029
- [electricity surges]
- [screams]

742
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:54,947
- [groans]
- Hello?

743
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:56,282
Hello, who is this?

744
00:44:56,365 --> 00:44:59,118
- Hello? Who is this?
- [sobbing]

745
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,662
- Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?
- [muttering incoherently]

746
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,414
- [sobbing] It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

747
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:04,707
- Yes.
- What did he say?

748
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,918
[sobbing] He just breathed.
He just breathed.

749
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:08,961
- [Jonathan] And was someone else there?
- I...

750
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:11,756
- Mom, who was there? Who was it?
- It was him.

751
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,550
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

752
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:15,760
[sobbing]

753
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:17,219
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Mike] Will!

754
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,723
- Will!
- [Lucas] Byers!

755
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:23,559
[Dustin] I've got your X-Men 134!

756
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,395
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

757
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:27,730
[Lucas] Seriously, Dustin?

758
00:45:27,813 --> 00:45:30,107
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

759
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:31,901
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

760
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,986
No, you're just being a big sissy!

761
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,990
[Dustin] Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

762
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:40,952
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

763
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:43,871
- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

764
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:45,957
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

765
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,167
- Shut up. Shut up.
- [rustling]

766
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,919
Did you guys hear that?

767
00:45:50,002 --> 00:45:52,380
- [rustling]
- [indistinct screeching]

768
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:55,091
- [rustling]
- [boys gasp]

769
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:14,485
