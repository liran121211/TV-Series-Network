[Hopper distorted] A trooper found
something in the, uh...

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,090
water that's at the quarry.

5
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,430
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

6
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,060
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

7
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,100
accidentally fell in.

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560

- Joyce.

a half hour ago.

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,720

He was here.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,090
He was...
He was talking with these.

00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800

- Uh-huh.

And... And, uh...

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,770
[stammering] And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,190
'Cause he was hiding...

26
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,360

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,176
- The thing that chased you?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,410
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,530
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's...

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,910
It's after him!

32
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,460
- He's in danger. We have to find him! We...
- What exactly was this thing?

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,976
It was some kind of animal, you said?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Uh, no, it was...

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,340
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

36
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,470
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,470
It didn't have a face?

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,970
- Joyce.
- [muttering] It didn't have a face...

39
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,350
Joyce, listen to me.

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,890

After Sarah...

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,070
I saw her, too.

43
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,230
And I heard her.

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,110
I didn't know what was real.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,370
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

46
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,490
And I had to pack all that away.

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,790
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

48
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,660

I think you should go to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

It'll give you the answers that you need.

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,090
She'll be okay.

180
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,510
We'll be okay.

181
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,260
My mom...

182
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,980
she's tough. [chuckles]

183
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah, she is.

184
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,480
Hey.

185
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,270
She is.

186
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,490
[coroner] Ma'am!

187
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,170
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!
- I don't...

188
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,990
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

189
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,830
- Joyce, wait a second.
- No!

190
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,040
- Mom!
- [coroner] Ma'am, I... Ma'am!

191
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,380
- [school bell ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

192
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,340
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

193
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,800
To look for Barb.

194
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,970
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

195
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,680
That's crazy.

196
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

197
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,310
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

198
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,060
just hanging out in my yard?

199
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,890
I don't think it was a mask.

200
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,770
But he had no face?

201
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,770
I don't know!

202
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,730
I don't know, I just...

203
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,400
I have a terrible feeling about this.

204
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,530
Oh, this is bad.

205
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,160
This is really bad.

206
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,280
What?

207
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,240
The cops...

208
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,080
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

210
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,710
- So?
- My parents are gonna murder me!

211
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,750
Are you serious right now?

212
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,920
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

213
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,510
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

214
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,930
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

215
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,930
don't mention the beers.

216
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,810
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

217
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,020
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

218
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,060
[scoffs] I can't believe you right now.

219
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,150
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.

220
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,150
Nancy, wait!

221
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,070
Nancy!

222
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,096
- [Jonathan] Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

223
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,540
[stammers] I need to think.
Just go on home.

224
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,580
Mom, will you just get in, please?

225
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,880
Mom.

226
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,710
Mom!

227
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,170
Mom.

228
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,640
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

229
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,470
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

230
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,970
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

231
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
We have to deal with the funeral!

232
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,310
The funeral?

233
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,310
For... for who?
[loudly] For that thing back there?

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,440
Okay, let me get this straight.

235
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,690
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

236
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,610
And there's a monster in the wall?

237
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,200
Do you even hear yourself?

238
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
I know it sounds crazy.

239
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,620
[stammers] I sound crazy!

240
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,500
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

241
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,750
It is crazy!

242
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

243
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,420
He talked to me!

244
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,340
Will is... is calling to me!

245
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,300
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

246
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,340
I don't care if anyone believes me!

247
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,010
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

248
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,180
[shouting] I am going to bring him home!

249
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,060
[yelling] Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

250
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,650
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

251
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,030
[Jonathan panting]

253
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,200
All right, show's over.

254
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
What?

255
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,170
- [radio frequencies tuning]
- [indistinct whimpering]

256
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,340
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

257
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,840
[Lucas] Yeah, I heard a baby.

258
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,970
What?

259
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,850
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

260
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,570
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

261
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,390
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

262
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,770
- That was Will!
- Mike...

263
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,060
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

264
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,360
Words!

265
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,190
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

266
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,490
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess...

267
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,886
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

268
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,966
I don't think it's about that.

269
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,660
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

270
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,410
- Like... like Professor X.
- Yeah.

271
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,160
Are you actually believing this crap?

272
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
I don't know, I mean...

273
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,040
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

274
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,340
He sounded a lot like that.

275
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,470
Did you guys not see what I saw?

276
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,800
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

277
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,430
He's dead!

278
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

279
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,036
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that?

280
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,740
- I just do!
- Then what was in that water?

281
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,900
I don't know!

282
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,190
All I know is Will is alive.

283
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,730
Will is alive!

284
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,150
He's out there somewhere.

285
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,860
All we have to do is find him.

286
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,700
[static crackling on radio]

287
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,990
This isn't gonna work.

288
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

289
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,040
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.

290
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,170
The Heathkit's at school.

291
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

292
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,470
I mean... look at her.

293
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,550
Wow.

294
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,680
- She looks...
- Pretty.

295
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,100
Good.

296
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,480
You look pretty good.

297
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,000
[whispers] Pretty.

298
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,960
Good.

299
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,840
Clear.

300
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,470
- You boys hear me all right in there?
- Loud and clear, Shepard.

301
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,260
Good luck in there, son.

302
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,640
[low growling]

303
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,880
[monster growling]

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

305
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,410
bearing us down towards the sea

306
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,250
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

307
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,000
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too..."

308
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,550
Nancy Wheeler?

309
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,510
If you'll come with me, please?

310
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,930
[Powell] This argument
you and Barbara had?

311
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,640
What exactly was it about?

312
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,850
[Nancy] It wasn't really an argument.

313
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,810
Barb just wanted to leave.

314
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,030
I didn't, so, I...

315
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,650
I told her to just go home.

316
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,860
Then what?

317
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,660
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

318
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,620
And the next day, you went back and...

319
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,120
saw a bear, you're thinking?

320
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't know what it was, but...

321
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,130
I think...

322
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,220
I think maybe it took Barb.

323
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,590
- You need to check behind Steve's house...
- We did.

324
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,010
There's nothing there.

325
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,770
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.

326
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,020
- What?
- [Callahan] Look.

327
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,350
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

328
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

329
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

330
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,360
Leaving town, maybe?

331
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,570
No.

332
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,860
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

333
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,320
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

334
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,620
Uh, Steve Harrington?

335
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,330
What? No!

336
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,580
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

337
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,750
It wasn't like that.

338
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,960
Like what?

339
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,920
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

340
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,750
We... we just talked.

341
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,880
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

342
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,906
[Hopper] So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

343
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,140
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

344
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,480
They're all Staties?

345
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,690
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

347
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,570
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

348
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,570
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

349
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,660
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

350
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,580
Considering what?

351
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,790
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

352
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,080
[indistinct chatter on TV]

353
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,420
[sighs]

354
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,420
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.

355
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,050
<i>...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty</i>

356
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,680
<i>and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.</i>

357
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,326
[reporter] <i>State trooper David O'Bannon,</i>
<i>thank you so much for your help.</i>

358
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,390
[O'Bannon] <i>Thank you, sir.</i>
[reporter] <i>Back to you...</i>

359
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,830
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

360
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,580
[man on PA] <i>Attention students,</i>

361
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,340
<i>there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.</i>

362
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>Do not go to fourth period.</i>

363
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,510
It's locked.

364
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,760
- What?
- Hey, do you think you can open it?

365
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,550
With your powers?

366
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,100
Boys?

367
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
[Lucas] Hey.

368
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,770
Assembly's about to start.

369
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,600
We know.
We're just, you know...

370
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,480
Upset.

371
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,916
[stammers] Yeah, definitely upset.

372
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,400
We need some alone time.

373
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,650
- To cry.
- [Mr. Clarke] Yeah, listen...

374
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,990
I get it. I do.

375
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,070
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

376
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,570
And then...

377
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,580
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

378
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,080
What do you say?

379
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,670
[stammers] I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

380
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,420
- Eleven...
- Eleanor! She's my, uh...

381
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,590
- Cousin.
- Second cousin.

382
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,880
[Mike sighs]
She's here for Will's funeral.

383
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,220
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

384
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,340
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

385
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,470
Thank you.

386
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,140
Uh, where are you from exactly?

387
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,600
Bad place...

388
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,390
- Sweden!
- I have a lot of Swedish family.

389
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,956
- [Dustin] She hates it there.
- Cold!

390
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,560
Subzero.

391
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,110
- Shall we?
- Yep!

392
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,900
[principal] <i>At times like these...</i>

393
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,820
it is important that we come together
as a community.

394
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,120
- We come...
- [door bangs]

395
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,620
Abort.

396
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,210
We come together to heal...

397
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,840
we come together to grieve...

398
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,880
- You lied to the police!
- I didn't lie!

399
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,220
[shouting] How naive do you think I am?

400
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,430
You and Steve were just talking?

401
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,760
[shouting] We slept together!

402
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,100
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

403
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,520
- It does matter!
- No! It is all bullshit!

404
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,810
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

405
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,836
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

406
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,780
I know it!

407
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,900
And no one is listening to me!

408
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,530
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

409
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,320
- I'm listening to you...
- No! You're not!

410
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,410
Nancy... Nancy!

411
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,200
Just leave me alone!

Shepard.
Where are you?

423
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,030
Can you describe to us

424
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,490
[Shepard] <i>I...</i>
<i>I can't make out my location.</i>

425
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,280
<i>It's hard to see.</i>

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,000
[Shepard breathing heavily]

430
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,330

- [yelling] Reel him back in!
- [man] Get him in.

[principal] <i>Will Byers' death</i>
<i>is an unimaginable tragedy.</i>

444
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,670
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

445
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,250
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

446
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,630
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

447
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,390
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

448
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,100
But before she comes up here,

449
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,350
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

450
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,600
Look at these fakers.

451
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,496
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

452
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,150
- [Troy chuckling]
- [laughs] What?

453
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,940
[Troy] Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

454
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,490
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
- [chuckling]

455
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,740
[Troy mocking] Oh,
he was such a great student.

456
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,120
[mock crying] Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

457
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,790
[Eleven] Mouth breather.

458
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,290
[indistinct mocking continues]

Hey! Hey!

462
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,310
Hey, Troy!

463
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,560
Hey, Troy!

464
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,600
You... you think this is funny?

465
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,100
What'd you say, Wheeler?

466
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,730
[stammers] I saw you guys
laughing over there.

467
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,940
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

468
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,070
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

469
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,780
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

470
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,870
[Troy] Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

471
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,910
Will's in fairyland now, right?

472
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,960
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

473
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,540
All happy and gay!

474
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,830
[Troy imitating fairy]

- [Troy grunts]
- [all exclaiming]

476
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,140
[Troy] You're dead, Wheeler!

477
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,930
Dead!

478
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,900
[indistinct murmuring]

479
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,650
[laughs] Dude, Troy peed himself.

480
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,240
[all laughing]

481
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,030
[giggles]

482
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,870
[panting]

483
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,500
[Dustin] Holy shit!

484
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,090
Hey! What's going on here?

485
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,250
Oh.

486
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,420
Mike! Let's go!

487
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,480
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

488
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,980
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

489
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,740
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

490
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,240
[Jonathan sighs]

491
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,450
[stammers] Can you just give me a second?

492
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,580
Of course.

493
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,630
Hey.

494
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,420
Hey.

495
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,970
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

496
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,590
I just...

497
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,800
[inhales deeply]

498
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,140
Can we talk for a second?

499
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,400
[Jonathan] It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

500
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,520
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

501
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,150
I don't know.

502
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,440
It's weird.

503
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,160
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

504
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,030
No.

505
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,580
And she was there one second
and then, um...

506
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,210
gone.

507
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,920
I figured she bolted.

508
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,340
The cops think that she ran away.

509
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,340
But they don't know Barb.

510
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,010
And I went back to Steve's...

511
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,760
and I thought I...

512
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,640
saw something.

513
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,020
Some...

514
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,270
weird man or...

515
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,770
I don't know what it was.

516
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,150
I'm sorry.

517
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,160
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

518
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm so sorry.

519
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,540
What'd he look like?

520
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,250
What?

521
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,580
This man you saw in the woods.

522
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,630
What'd he look like?

523
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,630
[stammers] I don't know.

524
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,430
It was almost like he...

525
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,550
he didn't have...

526
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,470

You know what it means?

541
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,100
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,560
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

708
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,400
But you capture the right moment...

709
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,650
it says more.

710
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,110
What was I saying?

711
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,740
What?

712
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,120
When you took my picture.

713
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,450
I shouldn't have taken that.

714
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,660
I'm, uh...

715
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,290
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,670
It's just...

717
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,290
That's it.

718
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,340
That's what I saw.

719
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,130
[Jonathan gasps]

720
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,800
My mom...

721
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,850
I thought she was crazy

722
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,680
'cause she said...

723
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,520
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

724
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,270
- And if he's alive...
- Then Barbara.

725
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,330
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

726
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,920
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

727
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,710
[laughing] I'll just be a minute.

728
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,890
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

729
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,076
Hey, you can't be back here.

730
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,736
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

731
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

732
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,956
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

733
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,100
I don't work with O'Bannon.

734
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,980
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

735
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,980
[smacks lips] Okay.

736
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,400
[both grunt]

737
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,030
[panting]

738
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,840
[gasps]

739
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,260
[exhales heavily]

740
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,070
[breathing heavily]

741
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,860
[car approaching]

742
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,240
[groans]

743
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,790
Babe...

744
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,210
Jesus, the hell happened?

745
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,510
[Joyce sobbing]

746
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,920
Lonnie.

747
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,590
