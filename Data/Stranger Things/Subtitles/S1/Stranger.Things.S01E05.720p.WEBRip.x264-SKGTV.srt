00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,810
[door beeps]

2
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,060
[woman] Thanks.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,120
[indistinct chatter]

4
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,200
[breathing heavily]

5
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,920
[indistinct chatter]

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,140
[sighs]

7
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,940
[doorknob rattling]

8
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,740
- No.
- [bangs door]

9
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,030
[sighs]

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,830
- [gun cocking]
- Hands up. Hands up!

11
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,460
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,726
How else do you think
I got in here?

15
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,790
[Hopper scoffs]

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,590
What's your name again?

17
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,380
It's Jim Hopper.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,170
Chief Jim Hopper.

19
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,140
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper...
[grunts]

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,180
- [man on radio] <i>Come again?</i>
- [grunts]

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,720
[both panting]

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,770
[indistinct radio chatter]

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,440
Hey...

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,020
you mind if I borrow this one?

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,440
- [beeps]
- [door buzzing]

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,400
[door locks]

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,410
- [liquid pouring]
- [Lonnie] Drink.

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,790
It'll calm your nerves.

29
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,120
Help you think straight, yeah?

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,750
I don't know what to do.

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,590
I know. I know.

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,260
[sniffs] This whole time...

33
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,600
I... I could... I could feel him.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,980
He was...

35
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,060
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,900
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles]

37
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,780
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,860
Now it's like I... uh...

39
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,160
[sobbing] God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

40
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,290
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

41
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,420
Like how everybody is looking at me.

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,420
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

43
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,420
You're not gonna like this,

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,090
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,470
It's in your head.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,850
[scoffs]

47
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,980
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

48
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,020
No, this is not that.

49
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,376
I mean, when something like this happens,

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,440
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

51
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,006
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

52
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,950
and you're saying his body is fake.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,490
He's in the wall.

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
I mean, how do you explain that?

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,580
- [stammers]
- It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

56
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,380
- At least go talk to a shrink or...
- [sighs]

57
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,510
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,470
Joyce, you just told me...

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,800
that Will is gone.

60
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,850
- What else is there to do?
- [sniffles]

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,390
Hey.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,530
[sniffles]

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,160
[Hopper] Will?

64
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,620
Will?

65
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,290
Will?

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,460
Will?

67
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,280
[Mike] What was Will saying?

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,570
Like home... Like home...

69
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,450
but dark?

70
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,780
[Lucas] And empty.

71
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,330
[sighs] Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

72
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,500
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

73
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,056
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,960
Like home.
Like his house?

75
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,300
Or maybe like Hawkins.

76
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,920
Upside down.

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,260
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

78
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,890
- [Lucas] What?
- Upside down.

79
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,770
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

80
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,810
Upside down.

81
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,520
Dark. Empty.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,940
Do you understand what he's talking about?

83
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,940
- No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.

84
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,070
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

85
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,950
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

86
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,740
But what if he was there?

87
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,780
What if we just couldn't see him?

88
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,830
What if he was on the other side?

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,080
What if this is Hawkins and...

90
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,750
this is where Will is?

91
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,460
The Upside Down.

92
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,250
Like the Vale of Shadows.

93
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,630
[Hopper] Will?

94
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,220
- Will?
- [alarm blaring faintly]

95
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,600
Will?

96
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,980
[alarm continues]

97
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,440
- [pressing button]
- [indistinct chatter]

98
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,360
[guards yelling]

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,280
I see him! Hey! Stop!

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
[Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows

101
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,590
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

102
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,640
<i>It is a place of decay and death."</i>

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,050
[Hopper] Will?

104
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,020
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.

105
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,860
It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it."

106
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,320
- [electricity crackling]
- [Hopper coughing] Will?

107
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,490
Will?

108
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,570
An alternate dimension.

109
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,490
But... how... how do we get there?

110
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,620
You cast Shadow Walk.

111
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,990
In real life, dummy.

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
We can't shadow walk, but...

113
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,460
maybe she can.

114
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,920
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

115
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,670
[sighing] Oh, my God!

116
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,310
[coughing]

117
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,350
[exclaims softly]

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,560
What the hell?

119
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,570
[rhythmic pulsing]

120
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,680
[gasps]

121
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,190
[Hopper] Hey!

122
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,280
Hey! Hey!

123
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
[theme music playing]

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,520
Hey, kid.

125
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,400
What's going on?

126
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,570
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
[stammers] On the couch.

127
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,730
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

128
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,580
How are you holding up?

129
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,330
What happened?

130
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,040
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

131
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,750
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

132
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,550
Jonathan, that's enough.

133
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,340
[sighs]

134
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,050
Can we talk?

135
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,300
Alone?

136
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,350
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

137
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,010
We all are.

138
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,190
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

139
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,770
Yeah. Well, you being here,

140
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,126
you're just making things worse,
like always.

141
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,190
- Worse?
- Yeah!

142
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,230
She took down that wall with an ax.

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,466
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

144
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,990
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

145
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,820
This isn't some kind of joke.

146
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,910
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

147
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,370
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

148
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,766
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

149
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,016
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

150
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

151
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,000
You hear me?

152
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,380
[sighs] Look, I'm on your side.

153
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,760
I'm here to help.

154
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,696
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

155
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,430
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.

156
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,680
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

157
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,480
If not for me, for your mother.

158
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,940
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

159
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,830
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

160
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,620
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

161
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,790
Looks good.

162
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,250
- [zipper closing]
- Here we go. [sighs]

163
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,340
You look nice, sweetie.

164
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,680
Anything else?

165
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,640
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

166
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,560
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

167
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,930
I'm fine. Thanks.

168
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,480
[whimpering]

169
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,630
Ugh.

170
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,230
Come on.
Time to go.

171
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,810
[groans softly]

172
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,940
- Come on.
- [sighs]

173
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,910
[Pastor Charles] <i>"Fear not,</i>
<i>for I am with you.</i>

174
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,660
<i>Be not dismayed, for I am your God.</i>

175
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,620
I will strengthen you.

176
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,870
Yes, I will help you.

177
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,630
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,090
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

179
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,720
How, if He is truly benevolent...

180
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,050
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

181
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,980
It would be easy to turn away from God...

182
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,310
but we must remember that nothing,

183
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,020
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

184
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,110
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

185
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,440
- and to surround Will and his family...
- [sniffles]

186
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,860
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

187
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,240
[shushes]

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,090
- [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

189
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,260
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

190
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,380
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

191
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

192
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,220
Thanks for coming out.

193
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,280
I see Will the Wise is back.

194
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,910
What's that shooting out of his cane?

195
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,410
Fireballs.

196
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,780
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

197
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,910
Oh, well...

198
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,040
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

199
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,330
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

200
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,050
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

201
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,420
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

202
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,510
You know?

203
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,050
Yeah.

204
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
So he needs the fireballs?

205
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,970
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

206
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,480
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

207
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,980
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

208
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,980
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

209
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,320
[both chuckle]

210
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,490
[gasping]

211
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,950
[breathing heavily]

212
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,090
[panting]

213
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,490
[dishes clattering]

214
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,630
[exclaims]

215
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,760
[Lucas] <i>Will! Will, it's us!</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

216
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,276
[Dustin] <i>Can you hear us?</i>
<i>We're here!</i>

217
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,600
[Will distorted] <i>Hello? Mom?</i>

218
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
[Lucas] <i>Why can't he hear us?</i>
[Mike] <i>I don't know!</i>

219
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,890
[Will distorted] <i>Mom, it's coming!</i>

220
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,190
She was there.

221
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,980
[church bell tolling]

222
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,820
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

223
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,360
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

224
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,990
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

225
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,160
that's my house.

226
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,120
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

227
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,580
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

228
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,960
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

229
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,960
You want to go out there.

230
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,840
We might not find anything.

231
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,260
I found something.

232
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,140
And if we do see it...

233
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,230
then what?

234
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,390
[sighs]

235
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,060
We kill it.

236
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,360
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

237
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,540
Are you serious?

238
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,000
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

239
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,250
This is a terrible idea.

240
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

241
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,880
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

242
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,970
You know that.

243
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,300
Your mom would.

244
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,890
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

245
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,350
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

246
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,810
when this thing is dead.

247
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,440
I don't know what in the world caused it.

248
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,690
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,450
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

250
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,570
Mr. Clarke?

251
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,580
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

252
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,780
[repairman] That right?

253
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,250
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

254
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,550
[engine starting]

255
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,600
[indistinct chatter]

256
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,870
[Mike] Mr. Clarke?

257
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,580
Oh, hey, there.

258
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,790
How are you boys holding up?

259
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,500
[munching]

260
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,000
We're... in... mourning.

261
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,840
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

262
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,210
[Mike] We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

263
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,470
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

264
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,470
So, you know how in <i>Cosmos,</i>
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?

265
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,680
Like, beyond our world?

266
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,260
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

267
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,430
Right, theoretically.

268
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,100
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

269
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,456
You guys have been thinking about

270
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
Hugh Everett's <i>Many-Worlds Interpretation,</i>
haven't you?

271
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,280
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

272
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,780
Just like our world,

273
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,320
but just infinite variations of it.

274
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,636
Which means there's a world out there

275
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,306
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

276
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,490
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

277
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,120
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

278
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,806
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

279
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,370
You know the Vale of Shadows?

280
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,936
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

281
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
[Mike] Yeah, exactly.

282
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,420
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

283
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,840
how would we travel there?

284
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,800
- Theoretically.
- [Mr. Clarke] Well...

285
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,350
Picture... an acrobat...

286
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,810
standing on a tightrope.

287
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,520
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

288
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,070
And our dimension has rules.

289
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,980
You can move forwards, or backwards.

290
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,070
But, what if...

291
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,280
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

292
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,490
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

293
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,870
- Right?
- Right.

294
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,250
Here's where things
get really interesting.

295
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,630
The flea can also travel this way...

296
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,840
along the side of the rope.

297
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,550
He can even go...

298
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,720
underneath the rope.

299
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,010
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.

300
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,340
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

301
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,680
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

302
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,350
So we can't go upside down?

303
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,770
No.

304
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,600
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

305
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,270
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

306
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,150
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

307
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,530
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

308
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,820
and then...

309
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,080
you create a doorway.

310
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,830
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

311
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,710
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

312
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,250
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

313
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,760
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

314
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,130
It would disrupt gravity,

315
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,180
the magnetic field, our environment.

316
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,680
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

317
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,470
Science is neat.

318
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,310
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

319
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,950
Whoa.

320
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,530
Hey, Chief!

321
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,250
- [knocking] Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

322
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,540
- [Powell] Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

323
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,300
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

324
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,800
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

325
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,550
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

326
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,736
and they didn't come back home.

327
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,230
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

328
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,560
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

329
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,290
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

330
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,270
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

331
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,240
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

332
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,820
Mirkwood.

333
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,150
What?

334
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,990
Okay.

335
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,780
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

336
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,540
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

337
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,080
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

338
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,090
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

339
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,710
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

340
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,840
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

341
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,720
Yeah.
[chuckles] It's funny.

342
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,890
[door closes]

343
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,850
- Is he off his meds again?
- [engine starts]

344
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,560
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

345
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,900
That's what I think.

346
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,030
[sighs] What are you doing?

347
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,740
What does it look like I'm doing?

348
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,390
You want to freeze to death all winter?

349
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,370
[hammering continues]

350
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,580
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

351
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,040
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

352
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,390
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

353
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,260
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

354
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,060
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

355
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
I just wanted to look around, you know?

356
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,730
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

357
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,400
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

358
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,530
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

359
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,410
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

360
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,636
But that's got to be what happened.

361
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,710
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

362
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,670
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

363
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,500
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

364
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,550
[Mike] Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

365
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,890
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

366
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,890
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

367
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,270
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

368
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,360
What's exciting about this?

369
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,950
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

370
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,966
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

371
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,080
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

372
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,500
Are you both seriously this dense?

373
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,710
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

374
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,170
Which means that's true north.

375
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,026
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

376
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,510
[sighs] Do you even understand
how a compass works?

377
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,850
- Do you see a battery pack on this?
- No.

378
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,930
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

379
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,810
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

380
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,310
So what's wrong with them?

381
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,456
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

382
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,586
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

383
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,980
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

384
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,780
the needle deflects to that power.

385
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,540
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

386
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,280
The gate would have so much power...

387
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,006
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

388
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,080
Exactly.

389
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,540
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

390
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,580
They should lead us to the gate.

391
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,780
[sighs]

392
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,140
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

393
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,470
- [exhales] What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

394
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,140
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

395
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,600
What? No.

396
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,730
Oh, no, I was just...

397
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,570
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

398
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,530
Well, uh...

399
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,940
listen, I'm really sorry.

400
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,780
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

401
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,620
Okay.

402
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,200
I panicked and...

403
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,370
[sighs]

404
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,080
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

405
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,580
[sighs]

406
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,800
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

407
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,130
Totally, but...

408
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,380
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

409
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,300
Any news about Barbara?

410
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,350
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

411
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Hey, listen.

412
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

413
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,360
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

[Lonnie] No!

The money!
Admit it!

436
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,180
You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

437
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,560
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now?

438
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,190
- I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,520
- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

He's wanted to go to NYU
since he was six years old!

450
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,090
So then he goes to NYU!

451
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,340
Get out.

Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind!

But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

that Will's still out there!

- [chuckles softly]

474
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.

475
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,500
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

476
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,340
He made me kill a rabbit.

477
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,210
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

478
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,010
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

479
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,430

Just, uh, point and shoot.

489
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,210
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

490
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,250
They must've married for some reason.

491
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,710
My mom was young.

492
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,170
My dad was older,

493
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,340
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

494
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,720
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

<i>Are you sure...</i>

523
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,150
[phone ringing]

524
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,530
[ringing stops]

525
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,250
[sighs] How much further?

526
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,420
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

527
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,710
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

528
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,250
I'm just saying.

529
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,760
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

530
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,510
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

531
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,720
[sighs]

532
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,020
Do you think she's acting weird?

533
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,690
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

534
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,900
I mean, weirder than normal?

535
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,610
I don't know.
Who cares?

536
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,620
[breathing heavily]

537
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,910
How far, Papa?

538
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,250
Farther than we've ever gone before.

539
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,630
- The bath?
- Yes.

540
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,260
Yes, the bath.

541
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,050
Is that okay?

542
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,350
Okay.

543
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,570
Mike.

544
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,030
Yeah?

545
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,650
Turn back.

546
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,280
What? Why?

547
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,450
I'm tired.

548
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,330
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

549
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,590
[sighs]

550
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,140
[Nancy] You never said what I was saying.

551
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,600
[Jonathan] What?

552
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,810
[Nancy] Yesterday.

553
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,440
You said I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

554
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,690
Oh, uh...

555
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,860
I don't know.

556
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,530
My guess...

557
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,740
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

558
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,290
But for that moment...

559
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,830
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

560
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,290
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

561
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,090
That is such bullshit.

562
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,550
[stammers] What?

563
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,260
I am not trying to be someone else.

564
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,850
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him...

565
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,560
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

566
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
He's actually a good guy.

567
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,810
[stammers] Okay.

568
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,190
Yesterday, with the camera...

569
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,320
He's not like that at all.

570
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,690
He was just being protective.

571
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,610
Yeah, that's one word for it.

572
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,530
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

573
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,120
No, I... I never said that.

574
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,466
He had every right to be pissed...

575
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,540
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

576
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,040
No.

577
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,210
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

578
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,170
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

579
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,260
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

580
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

581
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,350
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

582
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,640
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is."

583
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,730
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

584
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,690
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

585
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,690
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

586
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,690
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

587
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,400
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

588
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,650
who now works sales,

589
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,636
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

590
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,990
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

591
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
but now, hey, they get it."

592
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,660
[scoffs]

593
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,630
[scoffs]

594
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,510
[pounding on door]

595
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,300
Go away, Lonnie.

596
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,550
[continues pounding]

597
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,300
Seriously!

598
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I am gonna murd...

599
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,100
[whispers] What? What?

600
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,240
[Hopper sighs]

601
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,280
Oh, Jesus.

602
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,910
[scoffs]

603
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,800
Oh, no.

604
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,680
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

605
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,220
- We're headed back home.
- What?

606
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,580
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

607
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,970
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

608
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,600
And you're just realizing this now?

609
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,600
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

610
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,190
What do yours say?

611
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,820
[both] North.

612
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,360
- [Lucas sighs]
- Makes no damn sense.

613
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,400
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.

614
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,360
No, I don't think it's the gate.

615
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,280
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

616
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,120
Maybe it's something here.

617
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,620
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

618
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,370
It's not a magnet.

619
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,370
She's been acting weirder than normal.

620
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,356
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

621
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,420
Why would she do that?

622
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,460
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

623
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,880
Because she's a traitor!

624
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,930
[Mike] Lucas, what are you doing?

625
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,850
You did it, didn't you?

626
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,720
You don't want us to reach the gate.

627
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,640
You don't want us to find Will.

628
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,916
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously,

629
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,166
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

630
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,810
- No.
- Admit it!

631
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,990
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

632
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,150
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

633
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,030
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

634
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,200
Right, El?

635
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,870
[crying] It's... not...

636
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,500
it's not safe.

637
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,590
- [Hopper panting]
- [light bulbs clattering]

638
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,060
[panting] Okay.

639
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,730
Should be okay, I mean...

640
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,820
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

641
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,570
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

642
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,870
They bugged my place.

643
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,280
- What?
- They bugged my place.

644
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,830
They put a microphone in the light.

645
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,460
[sighs]

646
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,170
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

647
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,960
- I don't know...
- Who?

648
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,476
I thought they might be watching you, too.

649
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,760
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

650
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,010
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not...

651
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,140
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

652
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,600
What?

653
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,600
It wasn't him.

654
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,520
What?

655
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,730
Will's body, it was a fake.

656
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,320
[Joyce exclaims]

657
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,400
You were right.

658
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,080
This whole time, you were right.

659
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,210
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

660
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,500
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

661
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,590
Find Will?

662
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,920
Find Will?

663
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,380
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

664
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,140
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

665
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,470
Just think about it, Mike.

666
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,220
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

667
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,390
but she didn't.

668
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,470
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

669
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,140
- All right, calm down!
- No!

670
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,020
She used us, all of us!

671
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,480
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

672
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,780
Food and a bed.

673
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,070
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

674
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,150
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

675
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,596
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

676
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,080
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

677
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,200
She knows where Will is,

678
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,080
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

679
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,630
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

680
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,750
Shut up.

681
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,300
We're looking for some stupid monster...

682
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,590
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

683
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,010
I said shut up!

684
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,260
[grunting]

685
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,510
- Stop!
- [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.

686
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,996
- Stop it!
- [Dustin] Mike, get off!

687
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,980
- Stop it!
- [grunting]

688
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,390
[screams]

689
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Jesus!

690
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,320
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas, are you all right?

691
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,160
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

692
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,320
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- [Dustin] Come on, Lucas!

693
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,080
Why would you do that?

694
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,880
- [Dustin] Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

695
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,830
[distorted] What is wrong with you?

696
