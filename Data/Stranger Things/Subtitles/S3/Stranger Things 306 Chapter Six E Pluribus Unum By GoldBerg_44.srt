and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,

310
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,080
but you question
your brother's involvement?

311
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,710
That's correct.

312
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,290
Makes total sense.

313
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,090
- Um, you need help with that?
- No.

314
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,920
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so...
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

315
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,470
All right, so if we don't find a more
efficient method to stop these fans,

316
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,930
we're never gonna find help,
and your ice cream buddies are screwed.

317
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,720
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.
Jee-zus!

318
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,270
I'm just being realistic.

319
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,940
I mean, we've made it about
point-three miles in nine hours.

320
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,190
Then we had to walk three hours
down that tunnel,

321
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,990
so I'd estimate ten miles back
to the elevator,

322
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,070
which should take us approximately
twelve-and-a-half days.

323
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,660
Did you just do all of that in your head?

324
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,870
I'm good with numbers.

325
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,210
Holy shit. You're a nerd.

326
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,290
Come again?

327
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,080
You... are... a... nerd.

328
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,380
- Okay, you better take that back, nerd.
- Can't put the truth back in the box.

329
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,300
- But it's not the truth.
- Let's examine the facts, shall we?

330
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,130
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.

331
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,180
That was
a pretty straightforward equation.

332
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,390
Fact number two:
you're a political junkie.

333
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,980
Just because I don't agree
with Communism as an ideology...

334
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,940
Fact number three:
you love <i>My Little Pony.</i>

335
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,560
And what does <i>My Little Pony</i>
have to do with this?

336
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,570
Ah, let's recall the ponies'
latest adventure, shall we?

337
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,190
The evil centaur team and Tirek

338
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,610
turns Applejack into a dragon
at Midnight Castle,

339
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,220
and then Megan and the other ponies
have to use Moochick's magic

340
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

341
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,540
saving them from a lifetime
of enslavement.

342
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,200
All the pink in the world can't disguise
the irrefutable fact

343
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,080
that centaurs and castles
and dragons and magic

344
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,790
are all standard nerd tropes.

345
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,170
Ergo, <i>My Little Pony</i> is nerdy.

346
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,710
Ergo, you, Erica,

347
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,630
are a nerd.

348
