- He's showing me the location of the key

308
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,850

there is a vault.

- <font color="#ff00ff">[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]</font>
- And to open the vault,

316
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,450
you need to enter Planck's constant.

317

- Planck's what?
- Planck's constant.

318
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,160
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys,

319
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,080
and then we turn the machine off.

320
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,370
That's what he says.

321
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,210
All right, well, that shouldn't be
too hard. We can do this.

322
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,480
Joyce, did you hear the part
where he said the place was like

323
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,590
an impenetrable fortress?

324
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,510
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.

325
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,930
Yeah, there is. Our military.

326
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,050
- Who are coming.
- Well, we don't know that anymore

327
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,730
because you yelled at them
like it was a parent-teacher conference,

328
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,650
and then you hung up on them,
so we don't know what the hell's going on,

329
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,560
because now we're...
Wait, wait, what are we do... Oh!

330
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,020
Wait, that's right!

331
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,610
We're on our way to rescue our children

332
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,690

Fourth of July celebration!

333
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,280
You know what, if you can't handle this,
then just turn around

334
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,530
and drop me off first.

335
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,030

336
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,240

339
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,750
This interminable bickering
was amusing at first,

340
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,300
but it's getting very stale and we've
still got a long drive ahead of us.

341
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,140
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit

342
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,970
and get to the part where you admit
your sexual feelings for one another?

343
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,520
- Whoa!
- You are way off base, buddy!

344
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,060
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!

345
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,520
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know.

346
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,570
Probably reminds you
of a bad relationship,

347
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,150
and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man
to settle down with,

348
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,370
but, admit it, you're real curious to know
what he's like in the sack.

349
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,540
And you. Ha!

350
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,790
Well, you're just a big manbaby

351
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,290
who'd rather act tough
than show his true feelings,

352
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,460
because the last time
you opened your heart, you got hurt.

353
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,380
Owie.

354
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,720
And now, rather than admit these feelings,
you're dancing around one another

355
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,890
with this mind-numbing
and frankly boorish mating ritual.
