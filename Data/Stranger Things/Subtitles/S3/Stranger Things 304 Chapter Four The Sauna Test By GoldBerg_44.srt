Well, you know...

181
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,260
I could just take him out.

182
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,470
- Take who out?
- The Russian guard.

183
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,470
What? I sneak up behind him,

184
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,600
I knock him out, and I take his keycard.
It's easy.

185
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,890
Did you not hear the part
about the massive gun?

186
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,390
Yes, Dustin, I did.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,310

191
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,940

Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?

193
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,820
Listen, that doesn't count.

194

like he beat the shit out of you.

- You got a fat lip, crooked nose,

Now, we're a small-town paper,

trust.

224
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,190
- The trust of our community.
- Tom, if you just...

225
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,400
Do you know how I built that trust?
By placing my faith in something

226
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,610
the two of you don't seem to value
a whole lot:

227
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,990
facts.

228
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,450
Facts.

229
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,370
So, while we're here,
let's go over the facts.

230
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,790
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order
to stop pursuing this story.

231
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,050
Two: you falsely identified yourselves
as reporters,

232
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,470
repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.

233
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,430
Three: you broke into her home,
committing trespass.

234
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,470
Four: she almost died en route
to the hospital.

235
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,470
She would've died if we hadn't shown up!

236
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,060
Whatever disease that rat had
clearly passed to her...

237
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,520
Five!
Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.

238
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,220
You didn't know that, did you?

239
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Now...

240
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,490
disease-carrying rats?

241
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,570
The second coming of the plague?
Does this sound credible to you,

242
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,590
or perhaps does this sound more like
the delusions of a very sick old lady?

243
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,330
- I didn't know that.
- Her family's furious.

244
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,420
So furious, in fact,
they've threatened litigation.

245
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,670
- Litigation?
- That's crazy.

246
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,000
For once, we agree.

247
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,710
This is crazy.

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,480
In fact, in my entire professional career,

249
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,380
I've never dealt with anything
quite like it.

250
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,630
But hopefully,

251
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,720
hopefully, you've learned
something valuable here.

252
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,010
You've learned...

253
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,020
how in the workplace,

254
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,730
in the real world,

255
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,020

- I'm pushing!

- You're playing with my legs.
- I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.

512
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,400
- Come on!
- I'm gonna just shove you, ready?

and serve me some samples.

519
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,630
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.

520
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,420
Normal? How many times
have you seen him with a shirt on?

521
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,670
I mean, it's a little weird.

522
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
More than a little.

523
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,720
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.

524
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,140
- Plus everything else...
- But he's lounging at the pool,

525
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,430
which is, like,
the least Mind Flayer thing ever.

526
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,020
Not necessarily.

527
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,560
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

528
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,310
He only used me when he needed me.

529
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
It's like... like you're dormant.

530
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,490
And then, when he needs you,

531
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,780
you're activated.

532
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,950
Okay, so we just...

533
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,490
wait until he gets activated.

534
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,990
No. What if he hurts someone?

535
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Or kills someone.

536
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,620
We can't take that chance.

537
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,710
We need to find out if he's the host.

538
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,460
- Where are you going?
- I have an idea. Boys only.

539
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,460
- Seriously?
- Just trust me on this one.

540
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,270
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes,
until everyone leaves,

541
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,350
and we somehow get him
to come from here and...

542
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,940
get him into here.

We just have to figure out
how to get him in here.

548
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,220
- Then we lock him in...
- Heat him up...

at the lab
