Okay, you're freaking me out.

- Yeah.

189
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Yeah, it fell in the night.
It lost its magnetism.

190
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,120
- Oh, did it?
- And the same exact thing happened

191

at my house the day before.

Right? Why are all these magnets
suddenly losing their magnetism?

194
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,380
- Uh-huh?
- So, I went and saw Scott.

195
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,670

- Your child's science teacher?

He's pretty brilliant, actually.

199
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,600
And I asked him, "How is this happening?"

200
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,310
And he built this magnetic field
using an AC transformer

201
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,230
and plugging it into a solenoid.

202
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,690

which basically...

Scott was able to demagnetize
some of the magnets, and he thinks...

I don't care what Scott thinks!

He said you guys didn't come in

Heather wasn't feeling so hot today,

so we thought we'd take the day off
to nurse her back to health.
