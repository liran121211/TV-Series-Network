Look, all I'm saying is,
what harm is there in asking?

The harm in asking
is that Tom will say no.

it's gonna be, then Tom won't care.

In fact, he'll thank us.

of this AC transformer could exist.

810
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,530
A machine of some kind.

811
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,530
A machine?

812
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,330
But, in order to reach your house
and downtown, gosh,

813
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,290
that would take
billions of volts of electricity

814
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,620
and cost tens of millions of dollars.

815
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,670
But it is possible.

816
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,250
We cured polio in '53.

817

Landed on the moon in '69.

818
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,800
As I tell my students,

819
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,180
once you open up that curiosity door,

820
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,220
anything is possible.

- It's total nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

830
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,420
It's too specific. It's obviously a code.

831
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,810
- What do you mean, a code?
- Like a super secret spy code.

832
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,260
- That's a total stretch.
- <font color="#138ce9">ROBIN:</font> I don't know, is it?

Listen, just for kicks,

835
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,260
let's entertain the possibility
that it is a secret Russian transmission.

836
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,910
What'd you think they were gonna say,
"Fire the warhead at noon"?

837
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,930
- Exactly.
- And my translation is correct.

838
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,810
I know that for sure, so...

839
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,100
"The silver cat feeds."
<i>W</i> hy would anyone talk like that

840
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,350
unless they're trying to mask

841
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,960
- the meaning of their message?
- Exactly.

842
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,190
Why would anyone mask
the true meaning of their message

843
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
unless the message was somehow sensitive?

844
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,570
Exactly.

845
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,820
- So I guess that confirms your suspicion.
- Evil Russians.

846
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,160
I can't believe I'm about to agree
with this strange child, but,

847
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,660
yeah, totally evil Russians.

848
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,750
So how do we crack it?

849
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,790
Well, I guess we translate the rest
and hopefully a pattern emerges.

850
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,500
A pattern. Right, like maybe "silver cat"
is a meeting place?

851
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,630
Or a person.

852
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,630
Or a weapon.

853
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,130

to crack it, but...
