1
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,640
[faucet running]

2
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,271
[faint rumbling]

3
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,356
[dishware rattling]

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,068
[ominous rumbling building]

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,695
[pots and pans clanging]

6
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,947
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[woman gasps]

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,323
[dramatic music playing]

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,534
[woman grunts]

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,206
Sam.

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,104
[blades slowing]

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,071
[dramatic musical flourish]

12
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,201
[Sullivan] There were no signs
of any attacker. No bruises.

13
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,994
No signs of any struggle.

14
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,914
It's as if her attacker was a ghost.

15
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,084
Does this remind you of anything, Doctor?

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,503
No, it doesn't.

17
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,463
Are you sure?

18
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,007
Why are you here?

19
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,425
Really.

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,635
I'd like your opinion.

21
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,845
I was fired, in case you forgot.

22
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,016
A foreign government invaded our country,
all under your watch.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,353
There had to be consequences.
Certainly you understand that.

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,065
What I understand is that something…
something is going on in that town

25
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,902
that nobody… nobody fully comprehends.

26
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,614
And I also understand
that military strength is not the answer.

27
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,491
So what is the answer, Doctor?

28
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,201
More scientists?

29
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,912
Because it was
men of science, men like you,

30
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,664
who created this problem
in the first place.

31
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,707
[tense music playing]

32
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,335
Everything that has happened in Hawkins

33
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,420
can be traced back
to Brenner's little pet.

34
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:10,922
Wouldn't you agree?

35
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,219
[tense music intensifies]

36
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,929
[energy thrumming]

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,514
[bones snapping]

38
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,766
[tense music continues]

39
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,185
Dr. Brenner trained her
for this very thing.

40
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,729
Remote assassinations.

41
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,525
What you're suggesting is impossible.

42
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,193
-Is it?
-Eleven is dead.

43
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,196
-I'm not convinced.
-So, where has she been all this time?

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,781
There are rumors she's alive

45
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,409
and receiving help
from someone on the inside.

46
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,495
Are you saying I'm helping her?
Is that what you're saying?

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,874
If I wanted to chat, Doctor,
I would've picked up the damn phone.

48
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,170
Now, you can make this easy
and tell us where she is, or…

49
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,840
we can do this the hard way.

50
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,930
-[door clattering]
-[soldier 1] Not in here. Go! Go! Go!

51
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,641
-[soldier 2] Move!
-[soldier 1] Nothing.

52
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,769
[soldiers speaking indistinctly]

53
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
[woman] Why are you taking that box?

54
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,483
Those are Peter's old school projects.

55
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,569
You do not need those. Hey!

56
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,112
I'm talking to you!

57
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,364
Sam, do something.

58
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,995
[tense music building]

59
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,080
[helicopter whirring]

60
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,426
[Sullivan] I wanna know
everything he's done,

61
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,094
everyone he's spoken to in the past year.

62
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
And if we're lucky,

63
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,015
he'll lead us right to the girl.

64
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,022
[tense music swells, fades]

65
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,400
[theme music playing]

66
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,170
[siren wailing in distance]

67
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,089
[eerie, unsettling music playing]

68
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,425
-[Angela shudders]
-[EMT] Can you tell me your name?

69
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,011
-Um, Angela.
-Angela.

70
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,054
Do you know where you are, Angela?

71
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,433
-Um, Rink… Rink-O-Mania, I think?
-Rink-O-Mania. Very good.

72
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,394
-Now, where does it hurt, sweetie?
-My head.

73
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,603
[EMT] Your head hurts?

74
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,148
And my nose. [Angela whimpering, crying]

75
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,609
-[eerie, unsettling music continues]
-[Angela] I can't breathe.

76
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,778
[EMT] Just try to take some deep breaths.

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,032
Breathe slow for me, okay? That's it.

78
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,951
I know it's a lot of blood,
but you're going to be okay.

79
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,536
-[Angela] I don't think so.
-I promise.

80
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,456
Just need you to answer
a few more questions, all right?

81
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,833
-[unsettling music intensifies]
-[Angela] Okay.

82
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,918
[faint pulsing]

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
[Angela] No.

84
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,052
[Angela] I don't know.

85
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,970
[pulsing continues]

86
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,890
[Argyle] I know
this may be, like, upsetting and shit,

87
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,976
but that future prom queen
is gonna be fine.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,978
It's just, like, rubber wheels.

89
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,730
-[Jonathan] Plastic.
-[Argyle] Oh.

90
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,607
Not like hard plastic. Just…

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,152
-Just the soft kind.
-Totally.

92
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,197
But you ever wonder
why the wheels aren't wood, man?

93
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,615
Or metal?

94
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,535
So people don't get hurt
when they get shmacked.

95
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,703
-Oh.
-Yeah.

96
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,498
Because it happens
more than you think, man.

97
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,874
Roller-skate attacks.

98
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,002
Man. Hey, at least it wasn't an ice skate.

99
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,880
That nose would've been
sliced clean off, man.

100
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,298
[exclaims]

101
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,802
-It could've been so much worse.
-So much worse.

102
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,972
In the grand scheme of things,
it's just a little blip.

103
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,599
That's a funny word, man.

104
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,517
"Blip."

105
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,477
-"Blip."
-"Blip."

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,148
[both, in time to jaunty music]
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

107
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,113
[Jonathan and Argyle continue]

108
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,198
[grandiose opera music playing faintly]

109
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,414
[opera music intensifies]

110
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,336
-Mom?
-[door closes]

111
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:07,343
[yells] Well, well! Aren't you lot
a sight for sore eyes, huh?

112
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,595
-Hi, Murray.
-You kids like risotto?

113
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,389
[laughs] Yeah.

114
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,978
[Murray] There I was, headed down the I-5,
going to see a client in Ventura.

115
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,313
I'm looking for a motel
to stay for the night,

116
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,150
and suddenly, bam, it hits me.

117
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,485
"Didn't the Byers move here?"

118
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,737
Small world, isn't it? It's a small world.

119
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,865
[Murray] So I thought,
"Hey, you know what?"

120
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,534
"Why don't I drop in,
say hello to my old friends?" [chuckles]

121
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,952
It's so sweet of you.

122
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,830
-Sweeter of you to let me stay. [chuckles]
-[Joyce] And he cooks.

123
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,041
Mm, and cleans.
A regular little housewife.

124
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,460
[Joyce] You should stay.

125
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,713
I'd be tempted, Joyce,
except, you know, you have that, uh…

126
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,132
Right, that business trip.

127
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,925
Business trip? What business trip?

128
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,887
Oh my gosh. [chuckles]
I almost forgot to tell you guys.

129
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,265
-This thing came up at work…
-Can you pass me the olive oil?

130
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,349
That's wine.

131
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,270
And it turns out I have to go
to a conference tomorrow. In Alaska.

132
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,396
-Alaska?
-Tomorrow?

133
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,522
Crazy, right? [chuckles]

134
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,984
That's where they're based,
the Britannicas.

135
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,737
Joan and Brian Britannica.

136
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,530
[Murray sighs] Mm.

137
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,575
So do Eskimos, like,
still live in igloos,

138
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:17,580
or, uh, are they, like, fully-blown,
like, living in the… in the suburbs now?

139
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,207
Who is this?

140
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,917
So, Jonathan,

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,046
this means you're gonna have to,
you know, take charge while I'm gone.

142
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,714
-[Murray] Yeah.
-Wait.

143
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,466
What?

144
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,176
What's going on?

145
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,386
-Oh my…
-Your mom's going to Alaska.

146
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,846
You're going to Alaska?

147
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,972
[Argyle] Mm-hmm.

148
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,767
-What's going on in Alaska?
-The Britannicas are there.

149
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,185
-The Britannicas?
-Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,270
Jonathan, what is wrong with you?

151
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,233
-I think I know what's wrong with him.
-We just had a super stressful day.

152
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,192
Stress, huh?

153
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,028
This girl got shmacked
in the head today at the roller rink.

154
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,114
-Shmacked?
-Yeah, one of those vicious skate attacks.

155
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,201
-A skate attack?
-Yeah, but it wasn't an ice skate. It was…

156
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,163
-[Jonathan] It was a plastic skate.
-No, it was, like, rubber.

157
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,206
Rubber. Rubber.

158
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,667
-Rubber.
-[Argyle] You know what? I'm not sure.

159
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,836
Anyway, she looked like
she's gonna be fine.

160
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,297
-She's totally fine.
-She didn't look fine.

161
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,555
[Joyce] El, aren't you gonna finish your--

162
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,639
What…?

163
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,516
[footsteps receding]

164
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,270
-[Will sighs]
-What is going on, you guys?

165
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,523
Okay, I, uh, I sense tension. [chuckles]

166
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,442
Is it the risotto?
Everyone hates the risotto?

167
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
-Absolutely not. No, it's incredible.
-Mm-mm.

168
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,864
This risotto is shmackin', dude.

169
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,782
[chuckles]

170
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,701
Still have no idea who he is.

171
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,590
[delicate, somber music playing]

172
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,760
[Mike, echoing] What did you do?

173
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,886
What did you do?

174
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,765
-[Eleven, echoing] Angela!
-[Angela screaming]

175
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,268
[eerie audio distortion]

176
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,728
What have you done?

177
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,732
[echoing] What have you done?

178
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,861
[eerie audio distortion]

179
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,946
[sinister music playing]

180
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,198
[creature screeches]

181
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,576
[cries shrilly]

182
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,579
[screeches]

183
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,664
[chittering]

184
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,089
[sinister music continues]

185
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,299
[tentacles slithering]

186
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,224
[tentacles squelching]

187
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
[trilling]

188
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,479
[wet rustling]

189
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,826
[music builds in intensity]

190
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,788
[energy booms]

191
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,873
[sinister music fades]

192
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,891
[indistinct chatter in distance]

193
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,226
[distant clattering]

194
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,813
[indistinct chatter continues]

195
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,773
[boy 1] He sees all this? He sees us?

196
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,651
He'll shit his pants and cry for Mommy.
This guy's no fighter.

197
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,237
[boy 2] Hope he tries something.
Gives me a reason.

198
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,530
[boy 3] Hell, yeah.

199
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,949
Well, well, look who's decided to join.

200
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,617
What are you guys doing?

201
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,745
-We're gearing up.
-Preparing for the hunt.

202
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,330
[menacing music playing]

203
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,790
[wrench and bat clang]

204
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,917
Hey, man. Relax.

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,586
We're not killers like Eddie.

206
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,213
We just wanna talk to him.

207
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,673
Get him to admit his crime.

208
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,883
Yeah, a little friendly neighborhood chat.

209
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,762
Hey.

210
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,098
You didn't know Chris.

211
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,436
If you're not up to this, you can go home.
There's no judgment.

212
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,730
You'll still be one of us, all right?

213
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,026
No.

214
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,695
I'm good.

215
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,616
I wanna help.

216
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,994
All right.

217
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,706
Let's capture us a freak.

218
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,624
[menacing music swells, fades]

219
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,214
[Eddie panting]

220
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,966
[floorboards creaking]

221
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:39,925
[whispering] Shit.

222
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,719
Oh shit.

223
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,180
-[loud bang]
-Jesus…

224
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,473
[eerie musical flourish]

225
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,766
Delivery service.

226
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,850
[exhales]

227
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,566
So we got, uh, some good news
and some bad news.

228
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,612
-How do you prefer it?
-Bad news first, always.

229
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,821
[Dustin] All right. Bad news.

230
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,407
We tapped into the Hawkins PD dispatch
with our Cerebro,

231
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,576
and they're definitely looking for you.

232
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,953
Also, they're, uh, pretty convinced
you killed Chrissy.

233
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,915
Like, 100% kind of convinced.

234
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,542
-And the good news?
-[Robin] Your name hasn't gone public yet.

235
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,420
But if we found out about you,
it's a matter of time before others do.

236
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,799
And once that gets out,
everyone and their shallow-minded mother

237
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,175
is gonna be gunning for you.

238
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,135
Hunt the freak, right?

239
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,512
-Exactly.
-Shit.

240
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,888
So, before that happens,

241
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,599
we find Vecna, kill him,
and prove your innocence.

242
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,559
That's all, Dustin? That's all?

243
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,311
Yeah, no, that's pretty much it.

244
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,646
[Robin] Listen, Eddie,

245
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,732
I know everything Dustin is saying
sounds totally delusional,

246
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,026
but we've actually
been through this before.

247
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,654
I mean, they have a… a few times,

248
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,489
and… and I have once.

249
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,784
Mine was more human-flesh-based,
theirs was more smoke-related,

250
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,703
but bottom line is,
collectively, I really feel we got this.

251
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,289
We usually rely on this girl
who has super powers.

252
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:57,044
-But, uh, those went bye-bye, so…
-So we're technically in more of the--

253
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,629
-Kinda…
-Brainstorming phase.

254
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,672
Brainstorming.

255
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,758
[Dustin splutters]
There… There's nothing to worry about.

256
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
[scoffs]

257
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,014
[sirens wailing]

258
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,641
-[whispers] Shit.
-Tarp.

259
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,851
Tarp. Tarp.

260
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,895
[sirens increasing in volume]

261
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,613
[camera shutter clicks, echoes]

262
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,828
[indistinct radio chatter]

263
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,378
[officer] And after you talked to Wayne,
what happened?

264
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,589
I heard barking from the dog,

265
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,008
and then… he was just gone.

266
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,053
See anyone lurking about?
Who looks like they shouldn't be there?

267
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,140
No. No, no, there was nobody there.

268
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,767
-"Nobody."
-I already told this to Officer Daniels.

269
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,520
Did you look into Victor Creel?

270
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,480
-Sorry, what's that?
-[Daniels] Victor Creel.

271
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,150
Wayne got it in her head
that the old nut did this.

272
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,195
[clicks tongue] Victor's locked away.
Don't need to worry about him, all right?

273
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,866
Now, you said last you saw Fred,

274
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,367
he was by the picnic tables.

275
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,120
-Do I have that right?
-[car approaching]

276
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,622
Ms. Wheeler.

277
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,873
[resolute synth music playing]

278
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,042
He was by the picnic tables.
Is that correct?

279
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,377
Ms. Wheeler?

280
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,632
Does the picnic table ring a bell?

281
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,473
[skater] Whoo!

282
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,850
[skaters chattering indistinctly]

283
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,701
Hey, guys, there is a 4:00 p.m. showing
of Police Academy 3.

284
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,828
Could be fun.

285
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,122
Maybe we just stay home today.

286
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,250
What is this?
You guys just gonna mope around all break?

287
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,420
No one's moping.
It's just the movie is supposed to suck.

288
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,714
It… [sighs]

289
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,357
[knocks] Hey, El.

290
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,151
I, uh, made you some Eggos,
but they're getting kinda cold.

291
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,537
Hey, that's cool. Hop's cabin, right?

292
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,626
[sighs]

293
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,631
So, um, are we just
not gonna talk about it?

294
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,175
[Eleven, flatly] About what?

295
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,054
I don't know, just maybe,
like, about yesterday or…

296
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,681
everything.

297
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,225
[Eleven] There's nothing to say.

298
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,352
Yeah, I guess, um…

299
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,813
I guess I'm just a little, uh…

300
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,315
Guess I don't really understand.

301
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,027
Why didn't you tell me
what's going on here?

302
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,614
I mean, you know I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity back at home.

303
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,119
I mean, you've seen it.
I've been bullied my entire life.

304
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,079
I mean, I… I know what it's like.

305
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,831
No.

306
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,541
You don't.

307
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,460
Okay.

308
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,128
What don't I understand?

309
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,175
I am different.

310
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,260
[emotional music playing]

311
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,305
I do not belong.

312
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,099
You mean in Lenora?

313
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,856
-Anywhere.
-[sighs]

314
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,942
Come on,
you… you can't actually believe that.

315
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,528
Everyone looks at me like…

316
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,989
like I'm a monster.

317
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,908
They just don't know you.

318
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,327
You think I'm a monster too.

319
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,828
What?

320
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,747
Yesterday.

321
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,166
The way you looked at me.

322
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,085
You… You were scared of me.

323
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,546
No. No. [scoffs]
No, that's not… That's… That's not true.

324
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,964
I was surprised.

325
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,009
Maybe I was a little upset in the moment,
but, I mean…

326
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,428
I'm sorry. I just…
I didn't know what to do.

327
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,056
I mean, it just was so crazy.
It happened so fast.

328
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,725
But it doesn't change anything.
It doesn't matter.

329
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,602
I… I care for you…

330
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,729
so much.

331
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,773
"Care."

332
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,903
But you don't… you don't love me anymore?

333
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,447
What… Who… Who said that I didn't?

334
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,990
You never say it.

335
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,784
I say it.

336
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,371
You can't even write it, Mike.

337
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,087
"From Mike." "From Mike." "From Mike."

338
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,463
"From Mike." "From."

339
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,924
Okay, okay.
Eleven, you're being ridiculous.

340
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,759
What, like… What is this?

341
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,386
You know what I think of you.

342
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,597
You're the most incredible person
in the world.

343
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,351
And you can't let
these mouth breathers ruin you. Ruin us.

344
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,978
I mean, they're nobodies.

345
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,896
They're nobodies.

346
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,566
And you're a superhero.

347
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,651
[emotional music continues]

348
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,280
Not anymore.

349
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,033
[emotional music swells]

350
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,827
[TV playing faintly]

351
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,911
[doorbell rings]

352
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,998
Ten bucks says Mom forgot something.

353
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,499
[chuckles] Yeah.

354
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm not taking that bet.

355
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,422
Hi, does Jane Hopper live here?

356
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,049
Uh, yeah. Um, what is this about?

357
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,093
Is Jane's father or mother around?

358
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,345
Uh, no. No, her mom's out of town.

359
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,015
I'm her brother. Um, stepbrother. But, uh…

360
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm sorry, what… uh, what is this about?

361
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,521
You may or may not be aware of an incident
involving Jane at the Rink-O-Mania.

362
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,981
That was an accident.

363
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,442
-[officer] A warrant says otherwise.
-[Jonathan] A warrant?

364
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,861
Come on, that's crazy.
That doesn't need to happen.

365
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,988
-Hey there.
-[tense music playing]

366
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,156
You Jane Hopper?

367
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,619
[tense music swells]

368
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,831
[echoing]
You have the right to remain silent.

369
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,710
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

370
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,047
You have the right to an attorney.

371
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,675
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

372
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,094
[dramatic music playing]

373
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,388
[Jonathan] Can you please tell us
where you're taking her?

374
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,390
[Mike] Are the cuffs really necessary?

375
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,060
Officers, answer me.

376
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
Eleven. Eleven, listen to me. Okay?

377
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,692
Eleven, will you please look at me?

378
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,653
Everything's gonna be fine.

379
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,529
I am going to fix this. Okay?

380
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,991
Just… Just stay calm
and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?

381
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,953
-[siren wails]
-Just… All you have to do is trust me.

382
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,288
I promise.
I'm gonna get you out. I promise!

383
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,168
[panting]

384
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,338
-Has Mom's flight left yet?
-[whispers] Shit.

385
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,590
[plane engine whooshing]

386
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,884
[woman on PA] Ladies and gentlemen,

387
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,553
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.

388
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,390
Please make sure your seat belts
are securely fastened.

389
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,810
[inhales, exhales sharply]
Do you think I should've just told them?

390
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,440
What? Told who?

391
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,817
The kids.

392
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,318
About Hopper.

393
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,030
It… It just felt so wrong
to lie to them like that.

394
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,074
Mm. Right, right, right.

395
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,909
Well… [inhales]

396
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,036
…I'm not exactly an expert in parenting.

397
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,538
[chuckles]

398
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,583
But, for what little it's worth,
I think you did the right thing.

399
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,918
The responsible thing.

400
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,420
Responsible.

401
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,549
Your children,
bless their mischievous souls… [chuckles]

402
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,967
…they like to get involved.

403
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,762
This way, what?
They play too much Nintendo,

404
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,931
eat too much junk food, smoke some ganja,

405
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,266
pound some beers,

406
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,976
experiment sexually.

407
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,438
-What's the worst that can happen?
-[plane PA beeps]

408
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,439
Excuse me, ma'am?

409
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,483
Sorry to interrupt, but you're gonna
need to fasten your seat belt.

410
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,653
[chuckling] Of course. Mm.

411
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,196
Buckle up.

412
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,701
Like this is really gonna save me
if we crash.

413
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,786
[dramatic music playing]

414
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,651
[indistinct chatter]

415
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,032
[chains rattling]

416
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,452

[metal clanging]

418
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,972
[heavy breathing]

419
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,729
[in Russian] What is this, American?

420
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,816
What is taking you this long?
Are you tired today?

421
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,901
Pig.

422
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,070
What do you say?

423
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,488
Asshole!

424
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,950
[Hopper grunting]

425
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,537

[pants]

427
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,249
[in English]
Your Russian is getting better.

428
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,333
So is your acting.

429
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,835
All right. Come on, what is it?

430
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,546
I bring news from America.

431
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,297
I heard from your friends.

432
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,675
They're bringing your money to Alaska.

433
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,218
When?

434
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,386
Today, I hope.

435
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,140
If my pilot gets the money,
he will bring it in his plane tomorrow.

436
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,143
Then you can hitch a ride
back to your country.

437
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,394
I get rich,

438
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,688
and you're a free man.

439
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,899
-Sound too good to be true, yes?
-It does.

440
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,944
This pilot, you sure you can trust him?

441
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,739
His name is Yuri Ismaylov.
He's a smuggler.

442
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,367
Supplies American goods
to some of us guards here,

443
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,453
including me on lucky occasions.

444
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,746
Cigarettes, peanut butter, Playboys,

445
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,082
the best America has to offer.

446
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,084
-Great. So he's a criminal.
-Of course.

447
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,503
Who else do you want
to do this job? Gandhi?

448
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,839
[Enzo chuckling]

449
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,675
[sighs] You're worried
about your woman, is that it?

450
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,511
I can see why you like her, American.

451
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,722
When I talked to her,

452
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,766
I can tell by voice
that she's very pretty.

453
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,769
-Feisty too. I like that.
-[menacing music playing]

454
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,855
Shame we won't meet.

455
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,609
You promised me that she would be safe.

456
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,902
And she will be.

457
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,904
Let me handle Yuri.

458
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,364
You have more important things
to worry about.

459
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,493
Remember, you miss that plane tomorrow,

460
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,411
I am still rich,

461
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,705
and you're still stuck in Kamchatka.

462
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,041
So whatever it is
you're planning, American,

463
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,709
best get to it, yes?

464
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,378
[in Russian] Antonov!

465
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,341
Finish with your American toy,
we need him on the tracks.

466
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,469
Yes, yes.
I am just putting him in his place.

467
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,097
[spits, mutters in Russian]

468
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,435
Nosy bastard.

469
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,064
[in English] Where do you want it?

470
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,066
[menacing music swells]

471
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,069
[grunt echoes]

472
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,573
[Nancy] You're saying that this thing
that killed Fred and Chrissy,

473
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,992
-it's from the Upside Down?
-If the shoe fits.

474
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,162
Our working theory
is that he attacks with a spell

475
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,122
or a curse.

476
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,084
Now, whether or not he's doing
the bidding of the Mind Flayer

477
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,670
or just loves killing teens,
we don't know.

478
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,047
All we know is
this is something different.

479
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,007
-Something new.
-Doesn't make sense.

480
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,175
It's only a theory.

481
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,053
No, Fred and Chrissy don't make sense.

482
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,264
-I mean, why them?
-[uneasy music playing]

483
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,974
Maybe they were just in the wrong place.

484
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,309
-Were both at the game.
-And near the trailer park.

485
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,811
We're at the trailer park.

486
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,523
Uh, should we maybe not be here?

487
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,277
There is something about this place.

488
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,196
Fred started acting weird
the second we got here.

489
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,448
[Robin] Acting weird as in…?

490
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,158
Scared,

491
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,119
on edge,

492
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,287
upset.

493
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,955
Max said Chrissy was upset too.

494
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,373
Yeah, but not here.

495
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,792
She was crying in the bathroom at school.

496
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,548
Serial killers stalk their prey
before they strike, right?

497
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,801
So, maybe Fred and Chrissy
saw this Vecman--

498
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,094
-Vecna.
-Dunno about you,

499
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,180
but if I saw some freaky wizard monster,

500
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,516
I would mention it to someone.

501
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,517
Maybe they did.

502
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,354
I saw Chrissy leaving Ms. Kelley's office.

503
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,900
If you saw a monster, you… you wouldn't go
to the police. They'd never believe you.

504
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,486
-But you might go to your--
-Your shrink.

505
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,991
[suspenseful synth music playing]

506
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,247
Whoa, whoa, Nance. Nance!

507
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,207
Where you going?

508
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,752
Oh, there's just something
I wanna check on first.

509
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,378
Something you wanna share with us?

510
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,964
I don't wanna waste your time.
It's a real shot in the dark.

511
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,091
Yeah, okay. Are you out of your mind?

512
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,926
Flying solo with Vecna on the loose?

513
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,763
No, it's too dangerous.
You need… You need someone to…

514
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,725
Here. I'll stick with Nance.

515
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,185
Take the car, check out the shrink.

516
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,228
-Don't think you want me driving your car.
-Why?

517
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,022
-I don't have a license.
-Why?

518
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,148
I'm poor.

519
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,442
-I can drive.
-No, never again. Please.

520
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,943
Anybody but you. No.

521
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,071
-No chance.
-[Dustin] Come on.

Pretty much.

00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,948

like, way back in the '50s.

00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,790
by about 30 years?

701
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,708
Yeah.

702
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,378
Which makes spooky Victor Creel
like 70 years old.

703
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,796
-Yep.
-[bell chimes]

704
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,300
So, he's a grandpa murderer

705
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,220
who can turn invisible
and lift people into the air.

706
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,680
It doesn't make sense. I know.

707
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,933
That's why I said
it was a shot in the dark.

708
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,268
I know. I just thought
that by "shot in the dark,"

709
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,521
you were being modest or hiding
something super solid up your sleeve

710
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,232
that you were gonna wow us with later.

711
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,235
But this is
really, truly a shot in the dark.

712
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,364
Like, we are snipers with blindfolds on
who've been spun around 50 times.

[bell dinging rapidly]

714
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,534
Coming!

715
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,662
Hi. Sorry, we're in a bit of a rush.

716
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,122
Could we get the keys
to the basement archives?

717
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,791
Of course. Give me one sec.

718
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,378
Did I come off mean or condescending?

719
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,171
-No.
-Right.

720
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,256
[plucky music playing]

721
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,592
Sorry. It's just, you seem annoyed.

722
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,885
You don't know me well.

723
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,055
I don't really have a filter
or a strong grasp of social cues.

724
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,848
-Okay.
-If I say something that upsets you,

725
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,769
just know that I know it's a flaw.
Believe me, my mother reminds me daily.

726
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,354
-Got it.
-All right, ladies.

727
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,940
Here you go. Have fun.

728
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,900
Yep. We'll try.

729
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,860

[doorbell ringing]

731
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
Max. Hi.

732
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,747
Hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you over break,

733
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,166
but… do you have a minute to talk?

734
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,129
Um, yeah, of course. Of course.

735
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,634
Okay. She's in.

736
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,137
I'm missing collarbones, not eyes.

737
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,682
So,

738
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,935
we gonna talk about… it?

739
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,188
Huh? Sorry, talk about what?

740
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,483
Your temporary insanity earlier today

741
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,986
when you basically
threw yourself at Nance?

742
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,489
-That's not what happened.
-Pretty sure that's what happened.

743
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,867
It was public.
There were a lot of witnesses.

744
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,036
You implying I still
have a thing for Nance?

745
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,203
No. I'm not implying.

746
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:55,958
I'm stating. And, as it relates
to your steadfast refusal to date Robin,

747
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,169
it's pretty much
the only logical explanation.

748
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,920
That's not the only one.

749
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,547
And as for Nance,

750
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,592
I was just trying to protect a friend.

751
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,553
-A friend, Henderson. Okay?
-Okay.

752
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,264
Don't wanna find her
with her eyes sucked out of her skull

753
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,515
by this Vecna creep.

754
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,934
[chuckles] You're bright red
in the face right now.

755
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,686
I'm not. I don't wanna talk about it.

756
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,897
I'll punch you so hard
your teeth will fall back out.

757
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,815
Whoa. Too far.

758
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,362
-Not cool. Sorry.
-Not cool. It's okay.

[clock ticking]

760
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,329
It's just,
with everything that's happening,

761
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,497
with all the murders,

762
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,583
it's… it's making everything worse again.

763
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,919
You've experienced trauma, Max,

764
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,757
and when you keep your feelings,
your pain, bottled up the way you do,

765
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,468
it doesn't take much
to trigger them again.

766
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,012
So now, when it rains, it storms.

767
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,139
Yeah, I know.

768
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,812
Do you think you're ready
to talk more about that night?

I live next door to where it happened.

I'm sorry?

774
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,493
To where Chrissy was murdered.

775
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,787
The cops asked me a bunch of questions.

776
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,415
Did they talk to you?

777
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,334
I mean, I know you were seeing Chrissy.

778
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,503
Max, you know I can't talk about Chrissy

779
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,712
or any other student.

780
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,839
Yeah, but, I mean,

781
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,175
what if there was a serial killer
on the loose in my neighborhood?

782
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
Did Chrissy mention anything?

783
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,097
Anything about who might have done this?

784
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,559
Max, I'm… I'm sorry,
I… I really can't discuss this.

785
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,770
You wouldn't want me talking
to any other students about you, right?

786
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,399
If I were dead and it would
help catch the killer, then yeah,

787
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,817
I most definitely would.

788
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,445
Well, let's leave that up to the police,
shall we?

789

[discomforting music playing]

790
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,365
Yeah, you're right.

have this under control.

-Sure.

Anything… juicy over there?

Nothing new.

900
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,398
Yep, same here.

901
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,567
Victor seemed like a normal guy.

902
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,986
Dead family, missing eyes,

903
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,571
took a plea deal, sent to Pennhurst.

904
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,489
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

905
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,413
What are we looking for exactly?

906
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,082

[knocking rhythmically]

908
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,758
Any mention of dark wizards
or alternate dimensions?

909
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,510
Things in that vein?

910
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,179
I don't know. Okay?

911
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,100
It's starting to seem like
this was just a big waste of time.

912
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,436
You're obviously bored.
Why don't you call Steve?

913
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,354
I'm sure he'll pick you up.

914
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,690
And I mean,
I'm not really in danger here, so…

915
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:31,325
You do know that Steve and I are,
like, totally not a thing, right?

916
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,076
What?

917
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,080
So, I figure you and Jonathan
are still going strong

918
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,916
'cause you guys are
going to college together.

919
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,420
You're one of those unstoppable
power couples, but I… I just…

920
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,049
I wanted to make sure that you knew

921
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,842
that Steve and I are just friends.

922
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,136

that's adding any tension between us.

925
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,396
It wasn't.

926
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,945
Holy shit. The Weekly Watcher.
I can't believe they have this.

927
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,948
Don't they write about,
like, Bigfoot and UFOs?

928
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,701
First, UFOs are absolutely real.
Bigfoot I'm still on the fence about.

929
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,163
But may I remind you we are
looking for information on dark wizards?

930
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,583
If someone's gonna write about that,
it's gonna be these weirdos.

[eerie music continues]

"Victor Creel claims

00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,818
"The murder that shocked
a small community."

939
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,945
Ha, ha. That's very funny.

940
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,364
I'm not kidding.

941
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,448
Get over here.

942
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,995
"According to several insiders,

943
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,998
Victor believed his house was haunted
by an ancient demon."

944
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,668
"Victor allegedly hired a priest
to exorcise the demon from his home."

945
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,295
Pretty novel for the '50s.
Exorcist wasn't out yet.

946
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,338
Keep… Keep going.

947
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,343
Okay, so Victor claimed
this exorcism failed,

948
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,761
but it angered this demon,

949
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,264
which then murdered his family,
removing their eyes.

950
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,350
Victor believed he was spared
as a punishment.

951
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,269
That's pretty convenient for Victor.

952
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,146
Yeah, or super inconvenient.

953
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,275
Victor was declared legally insane
by the court, right? What if this is why?

954
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,819
It sounds insane.
Just didn't go public because--

955
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,405
The plea bargain. The records were sealed.

956
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,575
What if a demon did invade Victor's home?

957
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,245
It's just, this demon
wasn't any old demon.

958
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,872
It was Vecna.

-Dustin, do you copy?
-[Dustin] Yeah, I copy.

960

So, Nancy's a genius.

961

Vecna's first victims date back
all the way to 1959.

[Owens] Sorry about all the theatrics.

I… I didn't mean to scare you.

990
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,857
But you got yourself into
quite the little predicament, didn't you?

991
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:36,444
You know, I relocated you guys to Lenora
because I thought, you know,

992
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,073
"Safe town, small, dull,
far from Hawkins."

993

I think so. Yeah. I'll just… uh…

Some more coffee and, um, I'll have a…

998
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,587
How about the club special?

999

Never too late in the day for breakfast,
that's what I say.

1003
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,641
Am I in trouble?

1004
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,186
For the roller skate thing?
No, no, no, no.

1005
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,271
We'll make that go away. Don't even…

1006
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,981
don't even worry about that.

1007
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,858
That's not why you're here?

-[eerie music playing]
-To be honest with you, kid, I…

1009
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,945
I wish it was.

1010
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,616
Last night, I saw something.

1011
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,702
Something I've been dreading
for some time.

1012
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,622
I don't know how to say this
other than just to say it.

1013
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,208
Hawkins is in danger.

You have fought this evil before
and you've won.

[Eleven screaming]

1019
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,056
But this evil, it's like a virus.

1020
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,643
Each time it returns,
it comes back stronger,

1021
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,020
smarter, deadlier.

1022
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,691
A war is coming to Hawkins.

1023
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,321
Where you at, freak?

1024
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,616
[dramatic synth music playing]

1025
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,623
-[Jason] You sure Eddie was here?
-Yeah. I… I'm… I'm positive.

1026
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,542
Let's check around the back.

1027
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,961
Around the back.

1028
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,387
[Owens] There are good people,
brave friends,

1029
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,098
who have helped you
fight your battle in the past.

1030
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:33,186
But they alone can't win this war,

1031
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,313
not without you.

1032
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,651
I know it's not fair to ask more of you,

1033
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:43,196
but I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think this was the only way,

1034
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,741
if I didn't think you were
the only one who might have a shot

1035
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,412
to hit this thing so hard
it can't get back up.

1036
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,832
I don't have my powers.

1037
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,295
What if I told you there was a way…

1038
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,630
a way to bring them back?

1039
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,049
[dramatic music playing]

1040
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,135
[helicopter whirring]

1041
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:09,264
I feared this moment would come,
so I've been preparing,

1042
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,475
developing the means
to restore your abilities.

1043
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,647
A program has the potential
to not just bring them back,

1044
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,858
but bring them back stronger than before.

1045
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,154
But there are others
who don't believe in you,

1046
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,197
who think you are the cause.

1047
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,824
I believe they're wrong.

1048
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,744
I believe you're the cure.

1049
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,954
That's why, if we're really gonna do this,

1050
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,874
I'm gonna ask that you leave with me now.

1051
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,667
The reservation's under "Byers."

1052
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,920
[Owens] But you should know
there is a very real possibility

1053
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,797
this program fails.

1054
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,092
And if it does,
you will never see your friends again.

1055
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:50,805
My friends in Hawkins, are they in danger?

1056
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,724
[dramatic music continues]

1057
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,317
[Owens] I'm afraid
your friends in Hawkins are very much…

1058
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,069
-Can I see Fred's file?
-Yeah.

1059
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,862
…in the eye of the storm.

1060
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,449
You may feel you need to go to them now,

1061
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,492
but if you do,

1062
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,869
you will risk everything,

1063
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,329
risk everyone.

1064
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,668
[echoing] Max, I know something's wrong.

1065
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,172
[shrill, high-pitched noise]

1066
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,717
[music increases in intensity]

1067
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,641
-[thunder rumbles]
-[gasps, pants]

1068
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,102
[Kelley] Max, what you've been through…

1069
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,019
[grunts]

1070
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,437
Billy!

1071
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,314
[Kelley] …it's a lot for anyone.

1072
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,982
And it's okay to not be okay.

1073
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,610
Max? What is it?

1074
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,821
[Dustin, echoing] Max! Max!

1075
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,532
[Vecna] Max.

1076
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,076
[Owens] They're not
the only ones in danger.

1077
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,370
It's life as we know it.

1078
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,956
-This is why I'm here.
-[purposeful music playing]

1079
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,375
Because I believe you are our best hope.

1080
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,293
Our only hope.

1081
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,463
What if I'm not good?

1082
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,966
What if I'm the monster?

1083
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,759
I don't know you that well, kiddo,

1084
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:14,681
but I'm betting the fate of the planet
that you're one of the good ones.

1085
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,725
But you've spent too much of your life

1086
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,812
being told what to do by people like me.

1087
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,230
I know that.

1088
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,817
So, you say the word
and I will take you back home.

1089
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,235
Or…

1090
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,362
come with me now.

1091
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,531
Find out for yourself.

1092
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,492
[purposeful music continues]

1093
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,460
[car rumbling]

1094
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,503
[determined music playing]

1095
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,966
[audio distortion]

1096
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,219
[clock ticking]

1097
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,974
[clock chimes]

1098
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,691
[ticking continues]

1099
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,831
[chimes ominously]

1100
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:13,550
[delicate, unsettling music playing]

1101
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,510
[ticking continues]

1102
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,306
[chimes]

1103
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,197
[Vecna] Max.

1104
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,992
[growling]

1105
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,662
[clock ticking]

1106
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,843
[ticking continues]

1107
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,106
-[rhythmic unsettling audio distortions]
-[ticking continues]
