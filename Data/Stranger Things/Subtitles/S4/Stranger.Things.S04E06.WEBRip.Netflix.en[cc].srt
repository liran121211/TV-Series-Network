when that happened?

Wait, what?

11
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,145
Eddie.

12
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,939
Where was Eddie when you saw this?

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,609
-He… He was in the…
-[tense music playing]

14
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,277
…in the boat, like I said.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,236
[Powell] Right.

16
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,697
[officer] Right. Right.

17
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,658
But then, uh… [clicks tongue]

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,536
…who lifted Patrick out the water?

19
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,582
What…

20
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,460
You're not listening to me.

21
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,506
-Why aren't you listening to me?
-Jason, we are listening.

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,925
No, you're not. You're not.

23
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,051
Eddie, he's…

24
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,345
Eddie is a vessel.

25
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,180
Just a vessel.

26
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,181
A vessel?

27
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,140
For Satan.

28
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,977
He's made a pact with the devil.
Now he has his powers.

[tense music continues]

You don't believe me.

We're just, uh,

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,615
processing all of this, that's all. Okay?

33
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:56,991
[Callahan] Yeah.

34
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,003
How do you expect to stop the devil
if you don't believe he's real?

Where's the girl?

48
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,816
[weakly] I told you.

I don't…

50
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,654
I don't… I don't know.

51
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,491
There are two proposed explanations
for what is happening.

52
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,952
Explanation one,

53
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,497
an invisible boogeyman
from another dimension

54
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,291
is slaughtering these kids.

55
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,918
Explanation two,

56
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,629
Dr. Brenner's special little pet
has gone rogue again

57
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,673
and he and his lackeys

58
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,758
are now seeking to cover it up.

59
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,305
Perhaps in the hopes
of selling their pet to the Soviets.

60
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,016
Now,

61
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,603
which explanation sounds plausible to you?

62
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,688
Hmm?

63
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,025
[sobs] I don't know.

64
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,737
There's still a chance
to redeem yourself, Mr. Wallace.

65
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,408
Where is she?

66
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,997
[suspenseful audio distortion]

67
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,379
No! [Wallace struggling]

68
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,423
No! No!

69
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
[grunting]

70
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,885
No!

71
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,970
[door slam echoes]

72
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,398
[exhales]

73
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,860
[Brenner] Do you know what happens
when someone has a stroke?

74
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,114
The blood supply to the brain is cut off.

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,160
It scrambles the signals in the brain
to the point where the mind

76
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,953
can forget how to do things.

77
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,664
To eat. To speak.

78
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,041
To walk.

79
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,918
When you were attacked last year,

80
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,171
I believe that your signals
were scrambled in much the same way.

81
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,631
[mysterious music playing]

82
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,093
But just as a stroke victim
can learn to walk again,

83
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,304
I believe you, too,
can return to your full power.

84
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,727
Your abilities are still in here.

85
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,896
You just need to remember.

86
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,358
[beeping]

87
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,195
Everything that took place in my lab

88
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,114
was captured on videotape.

89
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,743
Every success and every failure.

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,581
It's important for you
to not just see your past,

91
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,626
but to fully re-experience it.

92
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,421
In doing so, I believe we can

93
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,297
repair your broken signals.

94
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,052
As we saw tonight,
that process has already begun.

95
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,303
[player whirring]

96
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,602
If this all happened,

97
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,230
why don't I remember?

98
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,649
Because you do not want to.

99
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,029
Our brains have
a defense mechanism in place

100
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,032
to protect it from bad memories.

101
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,993
From trauma.

102
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,371
You buried these memories long ago.

103
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,084
[Eleven] Papa.

104
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,880
When I was in there,

105
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,591
I saw something.

106
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,259
[eerie distorted audio]

107
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,760
There was blood.

108

[sinister music playing]

109
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,181
So much blood.

110
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,767
That was another memory,

111
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,020
a… a more powerful one,

112
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,355
invading from your subconscious.

113
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,358
You have demons, Eleven.

114
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,111
You have demons in your past.

115
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,073
That is why we must proceed carefully.

116
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,243
One step at a time,

117
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,829
one memory at a time.

118
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,790
-[mysterious music playing]
-If we go too fast,

119
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm afraid you could
become lost in the darkness.

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,670
[tank door whirring]

121
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,592
And if you are lost…

122
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,138
so are we all.

Hey, Eric. I'm taking five.

You just took five.

Yeah, well, tell Milo
to take it easy on the onions next time.

totally and royally suck.

I can't stand to see
those dull eyes of Eddie's break again.

137
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,702
I really, really can't.

138
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,121
At least he can drink himself
into feeling better.

That's what my mom does.

140
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,040
[Robin] Why don't we give it a trial?

141
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,793
"Hey, Eddie.
Uh, good news first this time."

142
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,130
"We got you some Dustin-approved junk food
and that six-pack you requested."

143
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,840
"Oh yeah, and we found Vecna."

144
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,927
"Bad news is that he's in that other,
darker, much scarier dimension,

145
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,305
and the gate's closed,
so we have no way of getting to him."

146
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,349
"He's entirely shut off to us,
so basically you're screwed."

147
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,560
"And, no, I know
you were already screwed,

148
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,313
but now you're doubly, triply screwed."

149
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,315
Wait. Maybe we don't put it like that.

150
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,775
"We're one step closer to finding Vecna."

151
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,861
That's what we say.
That's what's important.

152
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,780
See, Robin? Positive spin
can make all the difference.

Uh-huh.

Officer Callahan here and myself

164
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,022
arrived first on the scene.

165
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,691
We made our way
to the shore of Lover's Lake,

166
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,778
about ten yards from that house
you see behind me.

167
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,947
It was there that we found the victim,

168
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,409
an 18-year-old senior from Hawkins High,

169
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,078
Patrick McKinney.

-Oh my God.
-…his body, it was disfigured…

I mean, where is the FBI?

-There was an eyewitness on the scene…
-That's what I want to know.

We got a serial killer on the loose.

We have also identified
a person of interest.

Two o'clock at town hall,

182
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,363
where anyone from the Hawkins community
is welcome. But right now,

183
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,282
I've got work to do,
and I appreciate your understanding.

184
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,451

Dustin, can you hear me? Wheeler?

[tense music playing]

187
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,748
Eddie. Holy shit.

188
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,791
Are you okay?

189
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,087
Nah, man.
Pretty… Pretty goddamn far from okay.

190
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,839

I can't feel my butt.

Can't feel my butt.

197
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,037
Can you guys feel your butts?

198
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,456
[Will] I can feel my butt.

199
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,417
Everyone needs to be
on their best behavior, okay?

200
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,502
[Argyle] Why are you looking at me
when you say that?

201
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,921
-[Jonathan] I didn't.
-[Mike] They're just really religious.

202
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,007
Yeah, and I'm super spiritual, dude.

203
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,635
Yeah, I think they're spiritual too.
Just in a different way.

You elf-skin! You dried neat's tongue!

00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,872
This is my kind of party.

213
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,207
I've been bitten.

214

[emphatically] Can you not see

219
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,803
that we are filming?

220
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,180
[director] Come on.

221
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,267
All right, stay in it, Tabitha.
Stay in it.

222
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,605
Hi, we're looking for Suzie.

223
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,398
Don't know, don't care.

224

How many times do I have to tell you?

228
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,618
That is not a toy.

Third floor, second door on your left.

240
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:25,823
You make sure to give that selfish
four-eyed shit a nice little shove for me.

241
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,449
[spluttering] Absolutely.

242
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,909
Eden, I…

243
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,580
I will shove her for you. I will…

244
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,874
I will do anything for you.

245
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,586
[sighs] Well, great, she's not here.

-[Mike] Suzie!
-Yeah?

250

Who the heck are you?

251
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,099
And what are you doing in my room?

252
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,435
-Sorry, that's… that's fair.
-No, listen.

00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,270
-We're Dustin's friends.
-[Mike] Yeah.

259
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,335
You said an hour.

260
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,753
[Murray] I underestimated.

261
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,255
[Joyce] I thought you were dead.

262
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,757
Might as well be.

263
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,218
We are truly in hell if hell froze over.

[Murray panting]

265
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,308
There's nothing south,
but two miles north I saw some smoke.

266
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,768
Could be a town, a house.

267
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,687
Maybe somebody there knows
where we can find this prison.

268
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,773
The top-secret prison.

269
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,857
Really?

270
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,858
Right.

271
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,445
[panting] Any luck with our friend?

272
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,947
What do you think?

[Murray chuckles]

274

Hey!

Dipshit!

276
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,213
We're outta here. Last chance.

-Where's the prison?
-[Joyce sighs]

278

I told you.

Yuri will help you for the right price.

280
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,471
I told you, we're wasting our time.

281
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,557
-Half.
-What?

282
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,310
-What?
-You heard me, you stubborn bastard.

283
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,478
Half the reward.

Twenty thousand.

00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,856
-Thirty thousand.
-Twenty-two.

286
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,024
Twenty-five.

287
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,944
All right.

[Yuri laughs]

289
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,407

You thought I was serious?

293

He thought I was serious.

294
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,041
[imitating Yuri] I got you!
I got you good!

There's only one thing you get
if you take this deal.

297
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,007
You get to live.

298
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,967
You are not killer.

299
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,385
Oh, you're right.

300
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,386
He's not a killer.

301
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,429
No.

302
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,431
Thing is, we don't need to kill you.

303
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,433
We can just leave you here.

304
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,686
Because there's nothing for miles

305
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,814
-and no one will find you.

-Bears.
-Bears.

Who knew you could see your own future?

311
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,870
Shall we fly out of here, little bird?

312
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,622
Uh, da, da.

Wait.

316
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
You should go east, not north.

317

My warehouse is there.
Supplies, guns, truck.

318
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,853
We will need to reach prison by nightfall

00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,938
if you hope to save your friend.

320
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,775

I hope you're ready.

[in Russian] What is wrong
with your American friend?

338
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,595
He has lost his spirit to live.

339

-[chuckles]
-And he is not my friend.

340

[in English] Isn't that right, Cursed One?

341
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,978
You have lost your spirit to live.

342
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,272
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

Big talk, but weak inside.

Tell him to eat.

350

Or he endangers us all.

We have a big fight ahead of us.

I saw six men enter this room.

Six.

358
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,101
Just like us.

359
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,728
They came out

362
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,987
But when night fell,
they were thrown into that pit out there.

363
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,739
But not alone.

364
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,825
You heard those roars, yes?

365
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,038
That is a monster.

366
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
-Not from this world.
-[intense stinger plays]

367
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,710
[Hopper grunting]

368
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,090
Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds...

369
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,883
And all six men…

370
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,885
You speak no sense.

371
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,638
If they plan to kill us tonight,
why waste this food on us?

372
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,390
They want us strong.

373
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,558
So we can fight it.

374
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,852
To test its strength.

375
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,105
To train this monster for war.

376
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,566
But last week, the men got their weapons...

377
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,611
then scattered like fools.

378
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,905
We stick together...

379
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,782
Perhaps we stand a chance!

380
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,410
Perhaps we live to see another day.

381
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,872
[all] Till tomorrow!

382
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,040
[music builds to climax]

00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,458
[in English] Let me guess.

384
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,919
This…

385
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,340
…it's about nine feet tall?

386
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,426
Thin, white skin?

387
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,136
No face?

388
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,847
No eyes?

[eerie, foreboding music playing]

392
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,156
How do you know this?

393
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,450
[in English] 'Cause I've seen one.

394
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,367
[Antonov translates]

395
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,493
And I've fought one.

396
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,453
[Antonov translates]

397
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,371
And all your theories about it,

398
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,041
they're all wrong.

399
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,251
[Antonov translates]

400
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,212
You know why they feed
captive predators live prey?

[Antonov translates]

402
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,676
Because if they don't, the predator
gets bored and it stops eating.

403
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,345
[Antonov translates]

404
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,472
It needs the thrill of the hunt.

[Antonov translates]

406
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:37,022
We're not here to train this monster
with swords and axes.

[Antonov translates]

408
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,941
We're here to entertain it.

[Antonov translates]

410
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,944
And this food…

411
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,741
this food isn't to make us strong.

412
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,161
It's to, uh, make us plump.

413
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,205
[clattering]

414
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:58,251
So we're full of the nutrients and protein
that a growing monster might need.

415
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,506
[translates into Russian]

416
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,925
[Hopper] So eat up, boys.

00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,635
Enjoy.

00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,513

Three.

You know,

sometimes

429
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,358
it's helpful to take a step away
for a moment.

I spent years with One.

445
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,250
Right here.

446
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,794
In this very room.

447
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,921
Where is he?

448
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,466
Maybe we'll save that story
for another day.

449
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,094
It doesn't have a happy ending,
I'm afraid.

450
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,555
But he was a lot like you.

451
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,641
Everything was hard for him.

452
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,228
Then, out of nowhere,
he walked in here and it was like

453

something had changed.

454
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,150
And I asked him what's different,
and he said…

455
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,948
he said he had figured it out.

456
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,576
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

457
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,871
Something that made him sad.

458
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,666
But also angry.

459
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,918
Do you

460
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,337
maybe have a memory like that?

Do you remember the day
a strange woman came to see you?

That

469

00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,080
And who told you that?

474
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,164
Papa.

and the people here…

00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,849
are not what you think.

planned for you today.

Are you ready?

00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,572
Yes, Papa.

484
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,865
Good.

485
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,950
Seventeen, would you open the door?

00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,785
-Yes, Papa.
-Off you go.

[machinery whirring]

490
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,311
We should've just told her the truth.

491
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,687
And risk everything?

492
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,481
No.

493
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,192
She'll find out soon enough.

494
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,382
[Steve] Dude, I'm telling you,
you're taking us the wrong way.

495
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,717
It's north. I'm positive.
I checked the map.

496
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,428
You do realize Skull Rock,
it's a super popular make-out spot?

497
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,429
Yeah. So?

498
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,307
Yeah, well, it wasn't popular
until I made it popular.

499
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,101
All right? I practically invented it.

500
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,436
-We're heading in the wrong direction.
-Steve.

501
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,524
-Where are you going? Steve!
-Stop whining. Let's go. Trust me.

502
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,361
[Max] Okay, so apparently
we're going this way now?

503
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,613
I swear to God, if they get us lost…

504
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,909
Hey.

505
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,536
You okay?

506
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,662
Uh, yeah.

507
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,748
I'm fine. Just…

508
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,668
thinking about Patrick. You know?

509
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,253
Yeah.

510
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,922
I mean, it's… it's like,

511
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,299
why him?

512
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,845
But then, I remember this one day,

513
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,013
he… he came to practice with a black eye.

514
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,517
He said he fell, but clearly he was lying.

515
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,647
It's like everyone Vecna targets

516
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
has something in their life.

517
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,445
-Something that's--
-Hurting them.

518
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,865
Haunting them.

519
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,949
[eerie music playing]

520
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,950
Yeah.

521
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,454
I… I didn't really know Patrick,

522
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,081
so it was easy to just

523
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,792
look the other way, I guess.

524
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,337
But I did know you.

525
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,384
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.

526
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,844
It's not your fault.

527
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,013
-No.
-I disappeared.

528
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,848
No, no, you didn't.

529
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,476
I just didn't look hard enough.

530
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,478
Okay?

531
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,480
But I see you now.

532
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,857
I see you.

533
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,362
[scoffs]

534
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,158
Oh my God, they're so adorable.
I just wanna squeeze 'em, you know?

535
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,996
If I'm permitted to see a silver lining
in this end-of-the-world doom and gloom,

536
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,876
it would be the rekindling of old flames
that never should've been snuffed out.

537
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,379
I didn't mean that as a hint or anything.

538
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,464
Right.

539
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,510
But if I did mean it as a hint,
would that be so terrible?

540
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,470
To wish for happiness for my friends?

541
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,597
[scoffs] You think I'm not happy?

542
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,681
I… I'm sure you are.

543
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,850
It's just, the other day,
I mentioned Jonathan

544
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,186
and you flinched
or winced or something like--

545
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,396
I didn't flinch or wince.

546
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,315
-Okay.
-Jonathan and I are fine.

547
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,358
-Got it.
-We're good.

548
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,818
Right.

549
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,111
It's just…

550
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,781
[Nancy sighs]

551
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,115
[emotional music playing]

552
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,368
He was supposed to be here for the break,

553
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:33,790
and then he backed out at the last minute
for some vague, mumbly Jonathan reason.

554
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,084
And, to be honest, I'm not that surprised

555
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,294
because I've been
feeling him pulling away.

556
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,130
And I don't know
if it's because we're 2,000 miles away

557
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,550
or if he met someone new or what.

558
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,343
And now I can't find out why

559
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,638
because apparently he's blown up
his family's house phone or something.

560
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:53,518
So, yeah, if… if the mention of his name
caused a slight muscle spasm on my face,

561
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,312
that's… probably why.

562
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,359
Seems like a perfectly reasonable reason
to flinch, wince, or something.

563
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,824
You said, "the happiness of your friends."

564
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,660
So does that make us friends?

565
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,537
As in, officially?

566
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,456
Uh, yeah. I… I mean, right?

567
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,208
Right.

568
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,670
[Steve] Oh, boom!

569
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,089
Bada bing, bada boom.
There she is, Henderson.

570
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,382
Skull Rock.

571
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,343
In your face, man.
In your stupid, cocky little face.

572
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,387
Doesn't make sense.

573
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,098
Yeah, yeah. Even with it staring you
in the face, you can't admit it.

574
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,183
Can't admit you're wrong, you butthead.

575
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,185
[Eddie] I concur.

576
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,479
You, Dustin Henderson, are a…

577
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,149
total butthead.

578
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,026
Jesus, we thought you were a goner.

579
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,528
Yeah, me too, man.

580
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,447
Me too.

581
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,579
How long have you known
Eddie was killing these kids?

582
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,664
It was his trailer
where Chrissy was killed,

583
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,834
and you expect us to believe
he was made a suspect just this morning?

584
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,129
The truth is we've been
following several leads,

585
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,757
and, yes, Eddie Munson was one of them.

586
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,636
And we are now doing everything
in our power to find him.

587
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,803
[all clamoring]

588
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,348
[Powell] In the meantime, for your safety,

589
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,558
we will be enforcing a strict curfew.

590
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,727
-What?
-That's your solution?

591
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,688
-Hide from him?
-We're already doing that.

592
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,523
It's been days. Days!

593
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,151
So you tell me why
he's not behind bars right now.

594
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,863
I understand you all are upset,
but I promise you,

595
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,531
we will find him.

596
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,658
[Jason] No.

597
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,576
[crowd falls silent]

598
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,454
You won't.

599
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,956
Jason?

600
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,917
Son, how about
we talk about this in private?

601
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,670
Why? So you can keep me quiet?

602
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,130
So you can keep the truth from coming out?

603
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,966
I don't know about the rest of you,

604
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,802
but I can't bear to listen
to any more excuses and lies.

605
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,137
-That's enough.
-I agree, I've had enough!

606
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,222
[scattered yelling]

607
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,224
In fact, I think we've all had enough.

608
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,225
[applause]

609
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,984
[microphone feedback]

610
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,111
Last night…

611
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,198
[unsettling music playing]

612
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,744
Last night, I saw things,
things I can't explain.

613
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,291
Things the police don't wanna believe.

614
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,045
And things that
I don't wanna believe myself.

615
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,172
But I know what I saw. I know.

616
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,968
And I've come to accept an awful truth.

617
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,681
-These murders are ritualistic sacrifices.
-[crowd gasping]

618
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,143
We've all heard how satanic cults
are spreading through our country

619
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,769
like some… some disease.

620
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,187
And Eddie Munson

621
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,982
is the leader of one of these cults.

622
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,484
A cult that operates here in Hawkins.

623
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,279
The mall fire.

624
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,531
All those unexplained deaths
over the years.

625
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,326
Some people say our town is cursed.
They just don't know why.

626
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,037
Now… Now we do.

627
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,580
Now we know.

628
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,877
They call themselves Hellfire.

629
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,462
That's bullshit!

630
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,840
The Hellfire isn't a cult.
It's a club for nerds.

631
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,884
-[Mrs. Sinclair] Erica!
-Just the facts.

632
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,801
[Jason] A club.

633
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,930
A club. A harmless club.
That's what they want you to think.

634
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,183
But it's a lie.

635
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,185
A lie designed to conceal the truth.

636
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,895
[breathes shakily]

637
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,608
And now this cult
is protecting its leader, Eddie.

638
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,776
Hiding him.

639
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,071
Allowing him to… to continue his rampage.

640
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,283
Last night, I became overcome
with this feeling of… of hopelessness.

641
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,953
Then I remembered Romans 12:21.

642
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,873
"Do not be overcome by evil."

643
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,043
"But overcome evil with good."

644
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,504
And God knows there's good in this town.

645
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,215
So much good. It's in this room!

646
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,009
It's in this room, right here, right now.

647
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,512
So I came here today, humbly,

648
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,305
to ask for your help.

649
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,349
To join me in this fight.

650
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,353
Let us cast out this evil
and save Hawkins together.

651
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,230
[crowd murmurs quietly]

652
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,315
[crowd shifts uneasily]

653
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,542
What are y'all just sitting around for?

654
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,876
You heard the kid.

655
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,962
[ominous music playing]

656
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,219
[Powell] Hey.

657
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,472
I want you all to hear me
loud and clear on this.

658
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,059
Anyone interfering with this investigation

659
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,811
will be arrested.

660
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,022
Hey! Hey!
We will be implementing a curfew.

661
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:54,610
If you are not in your house after sunset
with the doors locked,

662
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,862
you'll be written up.

663
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,698
And it's gonna go
on your permanent record.

664
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,582
[Suzie] Okay, that is a lot to process.

665
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:12,461
I mean, that might be seriously
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

666
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,005
I know, it's hard to believe.

667
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,506
But it's true. All true.

668
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,553
I dial in to this computer
and find a location,

669
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,347
and at this location is the Nina Project?

670
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,348
Exactly.

671
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,935
And the Nina Project
is the code name for a video game?

672
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,897
No, it's not just a video game.
It's a video game console.

673
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,399
It's basically America's answer
to Nintendo.

674
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,984
Americantendo.

675
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,152
That's a stupid name.

676
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,406
You're right, it is a stupid name,
but, Suzie, it's 16-bit.

677
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,741
Sixteen-bit?

678
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,869
-Why have I never heard of it?
-Because it's top secret.

679
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,289
-That's why we're doing this.
-Yeah, right. It's for the promotion.

680
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,750
The first people to find
the secret location receive a--

681
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,044
-Americantendo?
-Uh, an Americantendo.

682
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,880
So you drove 3,000 miles
over your spring break

683
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,216
so I can help you get
a new video game console

684
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,383
no one has ever heard of?

685
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,760
[all] Yes.

686
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,677
[scoffs]

687
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,472
-But it's not for us. It's for Dustin.
-Right.

688
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,683
Exactly. It's for Dustin.
For Dustin's birthday, which is…

689
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,477
In two months, three days, five hours.

690
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,312
-[door opens]
-I don't know what you're doing,

691
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,773
but I am not spending
my entire day babysitting.

692
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,942
-Pull your damn weight.
-Language!

693
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,069
Oh no, am I gonna burn in hell now?

694
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,111
You tell her, Eden.

695
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,906
-Out of my room.
-Don't touch me, you little shit!

696
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,951
-[synth music playing]
-Okay, so can you help?

697
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,286
I would do anything for Dustybun,

698
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,957
but I'm afraid there's been
an unfortunate development.

699
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,378
After changing Dusty's grade,
I was wracked with the most awful guilt.

700
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,505
Suzie, I am incredibly disappointed.

701
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,841
Father could see my soul was tortured,
and he wrenched a confession out of me.

702
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,385
I wanted to help him.

703
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,680
Not only was I breaking the law,
I was dating an agnostic.

704
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,765
An agnostic!

705
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,351
-I've never seen Father so angry.
-…starting today.

706
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,477
He needed me.

707
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,521
-Naturally…
-Father, no!

708
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,690
…after learning the terrible truth,

709
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,441
he confiscated my computer.

710
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,986
And Father is not one to change his mind.

711
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,072
I'm as likely to see it again
as I am my poor Dustybun.

712
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,032
Where is it?

713
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,033
His study.

714
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,994
He uses it for work now.

715
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,164
And Father's always working,
and his door is, like, permanently locked.

716
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,083
-[Will scoffs]
-I'm really sorry.

717
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,418
Truly.

718
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,671
But it looks like you came
all the way here for nothing.

719
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,881
-[breaker powering down]
-[Eden] Cornelius!

720

-[Cornelius shrieks]
-[breaker powering up]

721
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:23,968
[tense music playing]

722
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,885
Unless…

723
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,762
Unless?

724
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,222
There might be a way.

725
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,890
But we're gonna need help.

726
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,059
And I mean a lot of help.

727
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,854
All right.

728
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,481
[tense music continues]

729
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,955
Guys?

730
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,123
Are you down here?

731
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,708
Guys?

732
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,129
[pants] They should've been back by now.

733
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,339
They should be back.

734
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,841
-What time was the movie?
-Uh, four hours ago.

735
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,469
Hate to break it to you, Mrs. Wheeler,
but they lied to you.

736
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,055
-♪ Liar, liar, pants on fire ♪
-Holly.

737
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,183
We don't think they're actually involved
with Eddie, do we?

738
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,852
I think at this point,
anything's possible.

739
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,606
-Our children are not murderers, Ted.
-Don't put words in my mouth.

740
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,317
See, she does that, twists my words.

741
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,277
-You're calling the theater?
-[keypad beeping]

742
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,488
-[inhales] The police.
-[line ringing]

743
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,453
When I got to the shore,
I tried calling you guys, but, uh…

744
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,083
my walkie was busted, man.

745
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,125
Drenched.

746
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,171
So, uh, I did the thing
that I do now, apparently.

747
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,298
I ran. [chuckles]

748
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,176
Do you know what time this was?
The attack?

749
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,137
Yeah, no, I… I know
exactly what time it was.

750
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,391
My walkie wasn't the only thing
that got soaked.

751
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,896
-9:27.
-Same time our flashlights went kablooey.

752
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,689
Which means what, exactly?

753
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,568
That that surge of energy
was Vecna attacking Patrick.

754
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,695
[Robin] Well, we're one step closer.

755
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,531
We know how Vecna attacks.

756
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,199
And where he attacks from.

757
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,577
So now we just need to sneak into
his lair in the Upside Down

758
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,162
and drive a stake through his heart.

759
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,330
If he has a heart.

760
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,582
A stake? Is he like a vamp?
Is he a vampire?

761
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,876
-It was a metaphor.
-A bullet should work on him, right?

762
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,378
I say we chop his head off.

763
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,672
All of the above,
but we can't do any of that

764
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,217
-'til we find a way into the Upside Down.
-We need El to get her powers back.

765
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,554
Everything was way easier.
We had this girl. She had superpowers.

766
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,056
Superpowers. Yeah, you mentioned her.

767
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,352
Hey, uh, Henderson's not,
uh, cursed, is he?

768
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,229
[Steve] Cursed? No, no. He's fine.

769
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,982
-[mysterious music playing]
-Mental? Absolutely.

770
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,817
Boom! [echoes]

771
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,613
Bada… bada… boom.

772
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,991
I was right.

773
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,493
Skull Rock was north.

774
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,704
-Seriously? You're serious?
-Mm-hmm.

775
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,456
-This is Skull Rock. Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

776
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,876
You're totally, absolutely,
100% wrong. Right now.

777
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,918
Yes.

778
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,254
And no.

779
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,422
Oh my God.

780
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,258
This worked correctly
when we left the Wheelers'.

781
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,469
Correct when we got in the car on Curly.

782
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,512
But it started to slip
the further east we went.

783
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,098
Now it's way off.

784
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,684
When I was leading us here,
I wasn't wrong.

785
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,728
The compass was.

786
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,897
So you're using faulty equipment.
You're still wrong.

787
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,899
Except it isn't faulty.

788
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,234
Lucas, remember what can affect a compass?

789
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,778
-An electromagnetic field.
-Yep.

790
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,780
Sorry. I must've skipped that class.

791
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,700
In the presence
of a stronger electromagnetic field,

792
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,578
the needle will deflect
towards that power.

793
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,165
So either there's some
super big magnet around here, or…

794
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,082
There's a gate.

795
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,752
But we're nowhere near the lab.

796
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,255
But what if, somehow,
there's another gate?

797
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,007
A gate that we don't know about.

798
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,301
It'd have to be smaller.
Way less powerful.

799
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,011
-Snack-size gate.
-How? Why?

800
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:58,057
No idea. All I know is that something
is causing this disturbance,

801
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,893
and the last time we've seen
anything like it, it was a gate.

802
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,771
And I hope it is
because then we'd have a way to Vecna.

803
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,148
And a shot at freeing Max from this curse.

804
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,818
[Steve] Where are you going?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

805
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,239
Eddie's still a wanted man.
We can't just go hike in the woods.

806
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:18,827
This little steel capsule might be the key
to saving both Max and Eddie.

807
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,164
What say you, Eddie the Banished?

808
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,625
[mysterious music trails off]

809
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,629
I say you're asking me
to follow you into Mordor,

810
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,674
which, if I'm totally straight with you,

811
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,759
I think is a really bad idea.

812
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,178
But, uh, the Shire…

813
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,014
the Shire is burning.

814
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,183
[mysterious music playing]

815
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,813
So Mordor it is.

816
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,529
What is Mordor?

817
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,991
Get your stuff, dude. Let's go.

818
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,368
[music fades]

819
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,829
[Brenner] Today,

820
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,040
we are going to play a game.

821
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,627
The rules of the game are quite simple.

822
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,297
Stay in your circle.

823
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,966
If you leave your circle,

824
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,884
you lose.

825
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,388
The last person standing in their circle

826
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,975
will get to spend
an extra hour of free time

827
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,227
in the rainbow room.

828
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,979
-[tense music playing]
-[Brenner chuckles]

829
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:31,734
Now, even though we are going to be
competing against one another…

830
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,319
Two.

831
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,613
Six.

832
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,700
…I don't want you to approach this
any differently than one of our tests.

833
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,951
Yeah?

834
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,495
Now, this is very important.

835
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:48,250
If you allow anger or emotion

836
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,461
to invade your thoughts,

837
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,589
you will fail.

838
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,008
I promise.

839
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,177
Do you understand?

840
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,013
[children] Yes, Papa.

841
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,682
