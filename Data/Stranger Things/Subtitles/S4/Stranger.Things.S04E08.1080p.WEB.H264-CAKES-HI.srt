Holy shit, dude. Check it out.

[Will] How far is Nina from Vegas?

206
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,555
From Vegas?

207
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,224
Um, as long as
Suzie's coordinates are right,

208
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,101
about another 90 miles. Why?

209
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,646
Well, once we save her, El,
we should stop on the way back.

210
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,191
El could make us, like, super rich,
and we'd never have to work.

211
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,029
We could just play D&D and Nintendo
for the rest of our lives.

212
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,822
Yeah. Totally.

213
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,624
We're gonna make it, Mike.
She's gonna be okay.

214
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,496
Yeah, I know. I… I know she is.

215
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,250
But… But what if
after all this is over, she…

216
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,629
Sh… she doesn't need me anymore?

217
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,505
No, o… of course she'll still need you.

218
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,132
She'll always need you, Mike.

219
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,926
I keep telling myself that, but I…

220
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,303
I don't believe it.

221
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,889
I mean, she's special.

222
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,474
She was born special.

223
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,143
Maybe I was one of the first people
to realize that.

224
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,480
But the truth is,
when I stumbled on her in the woods,

225
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,981
she just needed someone.

226
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,568
It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny.
It's just simple dumb luck.

227
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,279
And one day she's gonna realize
I'm just some random nerd

228
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,448
that got lucky
that Superman landed on his doorstep.

229
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,408
I mean, at least Lois Lane

230
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,911
is an ace reporter
for the <i>Daily Planet,</i> right? But…

231

[Mike scoffs]

232
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,289
- Sorry.
- No.

233
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,376
No, I… it's so stupid,
given everything that's going on.

234
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,753
It's just… I… I don't know, I just…

235
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,087
Uh…

236
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,631
You're scared of losing her.

237
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,384
[tender, emotional music playing]

238
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,260
Can I show you something?

239
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,447
[chuckles]

240
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,199
This is amazing.

241
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,159
Did you paint this?

242
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,704
Yeah. Yeah. I mean…

243
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,039
I mean… I mean, El asked me to.

244
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,459
She commissioned it, basically.
I mean, she told me what to draw.

245
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
Anyway, my point is,

246
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,547
see how you're leading us here?

247
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,841
You're guiding the whole party,
inspiring us.

248
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,426
That… That's what you do.

249
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,012
And see your coat of arms here?
It's a heart.

250
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
And I know it's sort of on the nose,

251
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,057
but that's what
holds this party together. Heart.

252
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,145
Because, I mean,
without heart, we'd all fall apart.

253
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,939
Even El. Especially El.

254
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:10,195
These past few months,
she's been so lost without you.

255
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,283
It's just, she's so different
from other people, and…

256
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,953
[haltingly] …when you're…
when you're different,

257
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,455
sometimes…

258
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,999
[sighs] …you feel like a mistake.

259
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,170
But you make her feel like
she's not a mistake at all.

260
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,172
Like she's better for being different.

261
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,935
And that gives her
the courage to fight on.

262
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,467
If she was mean to you

263
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,719
or she seemed like
she was pushing you away,

264
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,805
it's because she's scared of losing you,
like you're scared of losing her.

265
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,599
And if she was going to lose you,

266
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,851
I… I think she'd rather just
get it over with quick.

267
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,352
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

268
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,856
So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.

269
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,441
And she always will.

270
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,194
Yeah?

271
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,111
Yeah.

I knew… I knew that was him.

305
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,676
He was sending us a message,
letting us know he's back.

306
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,971
That's when I came to see you.

Your friends are in terrible danger.

it will reach a breaking point.

00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,922
Not yet.

370
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,136
But there… there was something else.

371
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,639
He showed me gates.

372
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,182
[haunting music playing]

373
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,809
Four gates.

374
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,062
Spreading across Hawkins.

375
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,859
And these gates, they looked like
the one outside of Eddie's trailer,

376
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,528
but… they didn't stop growing.

377
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,448
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.

378
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,033
This was our Hawkins.

379
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,035
Our home.

380
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,999
[Max] Four chimes.

381
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,126
Vecna's clock.

382
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,422
It always chimes four times.

383
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,507
[music pulses ominously]

384
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,591
Four exactly.

385
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,886
I heard them too.

386
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,435
He's been telling us his plan
this whole time.

387
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,479
Four kills.

388
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,981
Four gates.

389
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,069
End of the world.

390
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,362
If that's true…

391
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,866
He's only one kill away.

392
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,785
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

393
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,245
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.

394
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,998
[keypad beeping]

395
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,877
[line ringing]

396
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,425
- [busy signal droning]
- [phone clattering]

397
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,968
- [Dustin] Anything?
- [Max] No.

398
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,762
Rang a few times,
then went to busy signal.

399
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,645
[Steve] Maybe you punched it wrong.
Try again.

400
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,240
- [Max] I didn't punch it in wrong.
- [Steve] Well, I don't know.

401
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,108
[Dustin] I think she knows
how to use a phone.

402
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,395
[Steve] I'm just saying,
she could've typed it in wrong.

403
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,314
[line ringing]

404
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,732
[busy signal drones]

405
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,109
- Same shit.
- [Lucas] How is that possible?

406
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,862
Joyce has this telemarketer job.
Always on the phone.

407
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
Mike won't stop whining about it.

408
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,784
Yeah, but this phone's been busy
for, what, three days now?

409
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,369
That's not Joyce.

410
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,746
No way. Something's wrong.

411
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,915
[Nancy] She's right.

412
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,751
It can't be just coincidence. It can't be.

413
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,172
Whatever's happening in Lenora
is connected to all of this.

414
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,257
I'm sure of it.

415
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,678
But Vecna can't hurt them.

416
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,265
Not if he's dead.

417
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,351
We have to go back in there.
Back to the Upside Down.

418
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,186
- [Steve] Whoa, no, no, no. What?
- Nope.

419
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,670
- Let's think this through.
- What is there to think through?

420
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,525
- We barely made it out of there.
- Yeah, because we weren't prepared.

421
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,945
But this time, we will be.
We'll get weapons and protection.

422
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,073
We'll go through the gate,
we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him.

423
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,366
Or he'll kill us.

424
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,452
The only reason you survived
is because he wanted you to.

425
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,205
- He's not scared of us.
- And for good reason.

426
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,458
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.

427
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,960
Sorry, what are we calling him now?

428
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,187
- [Dustin, Lucas] One.
- Vecna.

429
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,421
- Henry.
- Right.

430
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,965
We've learned something new
about Vecna/Henry/One.

431
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,258
He's a number like Eleven,

432
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,636
only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering
version of her with really bad skin.

433
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,347
But my… my point is, he's super powerful.

434
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,392
Could turn us inside out with a snap
of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.

435
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,977
[Dustin] Then why fight fair?

436
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,397
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives <i>us</i> an upper hand.

437
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,149
We know Eleven's strengths.

438
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,276
And weaknesses.

439
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,694
Weaknesses?

440
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,237
When El remote-travels,

441
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,033
she goes into
this sort of trance-like state.

442
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,409
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

443
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,620
That would explain
what he was doing in that attic.

444
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,080
Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,

445
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,626
I'll bet you he's back in that attic,
physical body defenseless.

446
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,794
Defenseless? What about the army of bats?

447
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,130
True. We'll have to find a way past them.

448
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,423
Distract them somehow.

449
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,967
- And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?
- No idea.

450
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,761
But once they're gone,

451
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,262
he doesn't stand a chance.

452
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,307
It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula
in his coffin.

453
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,975
That all sounds good in theory,

454
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,061
but there is no pattern
to Vecna's killings.

455
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,646
Not one that I can decipher.

456
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,814
We don't know
when he's going to attack next.

457
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,692
- Don't even know who he's going to attack.
- Yeah, we do.

458
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,778
I can still feel him.

459
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,113
- [ominous audio distortion]
- I'm still marked.

460
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,449
Cursed.

461
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,661
I ditch Kate Bush,

462
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,871
I draw his focus back to me.

463
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,122
Max.

464
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,290
You can't.

465
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,126
He'll kill you.

466
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,961
I survived before.

467
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,464
[dire synth music playing]

468
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,632
I can survive again.

469
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:01,554
I just need to keep him busy long enough
so that you guys can get into that attic.

470
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,057
Then you can chop his head off.

471
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,144
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up
with some explosive Dustin cooks up.

472
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,481
I honestly don't care
how you put this asshole in his grave.

473
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,399

00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,308
[tense music playing]

892
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,785
Should be up on our right.

893
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,411
There's nothing out here.

894
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,495
[van jittering]

895
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,499
[sleepily] Mmm. We there already?

896
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:11,461
- Already? It's been nine hours.
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.

897
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,296
What are we looking for, my dudes?

898
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,174
- Some sort of facility.
- A fence. A building.

899
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,884
Any signs of life would be nice.

900
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,763
Since when did we decide Nina
was a building and not a small woman?

901
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,349
Sounds like a small woman to me.

902
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,809
It's not a small woman.

903
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,186
Small woman out in this desert
would be hard to see.

904
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,648
- How is he still high?
- Sure you got your measurements right?

905
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,731
Yes, they're right.

906
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,234
- You're 100%, right?
- Yes.

907
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,403
Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.

908
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,656
- Are you really questioning Suzie?
- She's a genius, Jonathan.

909
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,783
- Even geniuses make mistakes.
- Well, she didn't.

910
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,287
If that small woman is small enough,
she could fit behind a small tree.

911
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,413
Stop! Just…

912
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,248
[brakes screech]

913
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,376
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

914
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,795
I am stopping us before we get more lost.

[dramatic stinger]

916
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,341
- [Jonathan] Give me the coordinates.
- [Will] Um, okay.

917
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,803
Longitude is 116 degrees,
five minutes, and 17...

918
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,054
Slow down. Slow down.

920
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,432
Nina!

921
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,604
Nina.

922
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,397
Nina?

923
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,776
[echoes] Nina!

924
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,703
[chuckling] Holy macaroni.

925
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:30,498
All right. You just go straight down.
Like, straight… straight…

926
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,462
Right on the money, as I said.

927
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,589
- It just doesn't make sense.
- [Argyle] Yo, dudes!

928
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,717
My dudes!

929
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,843
Jesus Christ.

930
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,637
Come check this shit out!

931
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,055
What is it?

932
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,182
Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes!

933
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,601
Come on! Hurry!

934
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,395
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!

935
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,440
Okay.

936
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,400
So no small woman named Nina.

937
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,320
But you said <i>any</i> signs of life,
am I right?

938
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,238
Right.

939
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,321
Well,

940
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,245
these are no regular
tire tracks, brochachos.

941
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,580
I mean, look at the tread
on these monsters.

942
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,000
They're fatties.
And you know what that means.

943
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,084
Military.

944
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,586
We gotta go.

945
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,130
[dramatic music playing]

946
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,296
Well, I wouldn't do it
if I didn't think she was ready.

947
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,132
But either way,
I don't think we have any other choice.

948
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,550
<i>- Do you?</i>
- No, I don't.

949
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,634
<i>Yeah.</i>

950
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,345
- It might take me some time though.
- Just… As fast as you can.

951
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,390
It's gonna take us two hours
to get to Nellis as it is.

952
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,850
And, Ellen, one more favor.

953
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,186
Can you send somebody over
to a Max Mayfield's house?

954
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,273
There are some kids there
that just need looking after, okay?

955
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,276

Why the long face, Doc?

960
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,911
We just wanna talk.

Where is Dr. Owens?

972
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,726
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.

973
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,648
I know you wish to go to him,

974
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,359
and there's nothing I can do to stop you

975
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,860
from forcing open that door.

976
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,905
But if my men hear you coming,

977
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,781
they will kill him.

And alone, you will never find your way
out of this desert to your friends.

Here's what we're going to do.

981
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,963
You and I are going to complete
our work together.

982
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,550
And when I decide that you are ready,

983
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:11,594
we will return to Hawkins, together.

984
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,847

985
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,476
[exhales] Why are you doing this?

986
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,728
Because there's no other choice.

987
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,021
There is a choice.

988
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,899
Only one that is right.

989
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,027
And you make the right choices?

990
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,779
I try.

991
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,198
Did you make the right choice with Mama?

992
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,533
Four-fifty.

[electricity hums]

994
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,955
Your mother was sick, Eleven.

995
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,458
She was a danger to herself and to others.

996
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,294
She brought a gun into the hospital.
She killed a man.

997
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,837
Hospital?

998
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,838
No.

999
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,300
A prison.

1000
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,970
Everything I have done
was for your own good.

1001
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,388
For your own protection.

1002
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,139
And Henry?

[chilling music playing]

1004
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,144
You kept Henry in that lab.

1005
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,645
With the children.

1006
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,063
Was that for our good?

1007
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,857
Was that a right choice?

1008
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,485
I had no idea what Henry would do.

1009
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,487
I cared for you.

1010
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,697
I loved you. I loved all of you.

1011
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,781
Even Henry?

1012
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,324
Yes.

1013
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,204
I was trying to help Henry,
to understand him. Yes.

1014
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,498
Yes, I cared for him.

1015
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,126
Even after what… what he did?

1016
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,920
Yes.

1017
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,006
Because I knew I had failed him.

1018
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,592
So this morning,

1019
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,721
you said you believed
he was always alive in the darkness.

1020
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,391
Is that why I was searching the darkness?

[eerie snarling]

1022
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,190
Was I looking for him? For Henry?

1023

No. No.

1024
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,779
We were focused on the Soviets.

1025
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,780
You knew that.

1026
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,949
"Papa does not tell the truth."

1027
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,034
Henry said that.

1028
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,787
And now you trust Henry?

1029
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,999
Henry, who's manipulated you
like some puppet?

1030
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,296
You are the one
who released him from his prison.

1031
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,173
You.

1032
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,344
And now you are angry with yourself

1033
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,429
and you're taking your anger out on me

1034
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,014
and you're risking everything.

1035
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,098
No.

1036
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,600
No, you.

Because you could not stop.

1049
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,587
You could not let him go.

1050
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,883
I came here
to try and understand who I was.

1051

To see if I…

1052

It is not me.

1079
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,793
Is this legal?

1080
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,673
Actually, I think it's a felony.

1081
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,590
Right.

1082
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,844
But it guarantees one thing.

1083
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,139

- [Dustin] How's she feeling?
- Light. But durable.

1086
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,146
Deadly.

1087
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,941
- But reliable.

1088

[in regular voice]
…from Eddie the Banished.

1091
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,579
Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle.

1093
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,416
You get it?

1094
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:36,793
"Bat-tle."

1095
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,378
B-A-T.

1096
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,466
No? [groans]

1097
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,759

Dustin Henderson.

1104
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,940
Promise me?

1105
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,236
I wasn't planning on it.

1106
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,113
Good.

1107

- Good.
- Good. [laughs]

1108
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,951
Hey, Sinclairs.

1109
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,205
How are those, uh… those spears coming on?

1110
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,750
Flip that damn thumb around.

1111
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,834
What?

1112
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,297
It's too loose, Lucas.

1113
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,799
This isn't a basketball game

1114
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,510
where they blow the whistle
when your shoes fall off.

1115
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,095
Okay, okay, for the record,

1116
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,722
my shoes never fell off.

1117
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,265
Okay, for the record,

1118
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,352
it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off
when you're riding the bench.

1119
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,312
Yet, for some reason,

1120
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,939
you show up to every game.

1121
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,941
Mmm, except the one that mattered.

1122
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,692
Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.

1123
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,654
Bull. Mom and Dad
can't force you to do shit.

1124
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,448
Well, even though
you're a bench-riding loser,

1125
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,866
you're still my brother.

1126
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,367
Just the facts.

1127
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,183
- [Steve] It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?

1128
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,669
That was Dan Shelter.
He graduated, like, two years ago.

1129
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,796
- So?
- So he's in college.

1130
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,881
Which means he was visiting
on spring break.

1131
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,218
<i>Fast Times</i> was returned,
like, I don't know, a week ago?

1132
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:10,096
Right? Unless she's got
some horn dog brother we don't know about.

1133
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,931
Which is possible.

1134
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,350
Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?

1135
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,309
- Steve.
- Nah.

1136
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,270
- What?
- I don't care.

1137
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,040
I don't understand why you do either
with everything that's going on.

1138
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:23,901
Honestly, this feels like a perfect time
for that little pull of the rug because…

1139
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,405
In the face of the world ending,
the stakes of my love life

1140
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,198
feel spectacularly low.

1141
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,743
Yeah. I mean, I get you there,

1142
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,413
but… I still have hope.

1143
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,294
- Not everything has a happy ending.
- Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know.

I'm not talking about failed romance.

1147

I just…

1148
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,222
I have this terrible,

1149
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,309
gnawing feeling that…

1150
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,063
It might not work out for us this time.

1151
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,191
You think we shouldn't be doing this?

1152
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,321
I think we're mad fools,
the lot of us, but…

1153
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,825
[sighs] …but if we don't stop him,
who will?

1154

1155
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,374
We have to try, right?

01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,129
Yeah.

01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,384

I know.

1172

You're angry with me.

1173
