We used to store them in these silos,
but we haven't used this one in years.

In fact, there…
there's no bomb here at all.

82

It's just a big ol' empty space.

83
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,037
So we repurposed it to hold something
much more powerful than a missile:

84
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,080
you.

I know.

104

You're frightened of me.

105
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,439
Perhaps, in our time apart,
you may have even grown to hate me.

106
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,526
But all I've ever wanted to do

107
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,486
is to help you.

108
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,907
And right now,
I think you very much need my help.

109
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,494
Your gifts have been stolen.

110
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,830
I believe I know why.

111
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,333
And I believe I know how to get them back.

113
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,462

361
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,862
[Eleven breathes heavily]

362
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,077
[indistinct voice continues]

363
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,756
[unsettling music continues]

364
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
[eerie audio distortion]

365
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,697
[orderly] Well, well.

366
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,908
Look who finally decided to join us.

367
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,287
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

368
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,788
Where am I?

369
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,040
I guess you're still not quite awake, huh?

370
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,376
Am I in Hawkins?

371
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,503
[electricity buzzes]

372
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,047
[eerie music intensifies]

373
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,592
[music fades]

374
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,760
[orderly] Well, well.

375
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,305
Look who finally decided to join us.

376
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,932
[disconcerting audio distortion]

377
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,143
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

378
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,528
Don't go too far, sleepyhead.

379
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,406
Lessons begin promptly at 10:00.

380
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,949
[jarring stinger plays]

381
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,618
[Eleven gasps, breathes shakily]

382
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,746
[door opens]

383
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,832
[distressing music playing]

384
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,681
[distressing music builds]

385
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,849
[orderly] Well, well.

386
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,102
Look who finally decided to join us.

387
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,812
[ominous stinger plays]

388
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,773
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

389
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
[music swells, stops]

390
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,151
[machinery whirring]

391
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,236
Heart rate's now 120 BPM.

392
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,529
[monitor beeping]

393
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,324
-She's rejecting it. [sighs]
-[Brenner] Give her time.

394
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,244
No, no, no. We shouldn't have
just thrown her in like this.

395
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,497
-She's gonna drown in there.
-[Brenner] No.

396
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,166
No, she is going to swim.

397
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,759
[machine whirring intensely]

398
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,969
[Argyle] Oh man.

399
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,389
[Argyle grunting, groaning]

400
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,350
Okay. This is not the way
it's supposed to go, okay?

401
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,936
Oh man, oh man, oh man.
Okay, this is so messed up.

402
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,313
This is so messed up!
This is so messed up!

403
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,274
Okay. Dude's probably got,
like, a family, kids, you know.

404
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,860
All that shit.
We gotta go to the cops with this.

405
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,406
Lay it all on 'em. Your superpowered
girlfriend, bad government dudes,

406
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,366
-Upside Down dimension planet thing--
-No.

407
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,951
But… But listen!

408
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,913
The bad government dudes are after
your super girlfriend, right? Right? Okay.

409
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,499
So maybe cops can help us
find out where she is.

410
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,708
They're gonna kill her.

411
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,585
-If they kill her, they're gonna kill us.
-Hey!

412
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,838
They might kill us before they kill her.

413
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,256
-I dunno, man.
-Argyle!

414
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,050
-Don't know what order they wanna go.
-Listen! Hey!

415
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,510
-Eeny meeny miny moe…
-Argyle!

416
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,970
-Listen!
-What?

417
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,306
Look, I think we can
figure this out, okay?

418
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,308
We just gotta open our minds.

419
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,727
Open our minds?
That's an open grave in front of me, man!

420
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,231
-Open my mind? What are you talking about?
-Listen. Hey, dude! Hey!

421
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,859
Just relax, okay?

422
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,111
-Yeah.
-Why don't you just go to the van…

423
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,114
[panting] …and do your thing, huh?

424
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,866
-Purple Palm Tree Delight.
-Right.

425
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,701
-[Argyle chuckles]
-Right.

426
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,785
It's all worn off.

427
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,870
It's just worn off.

428
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,455
I'm all emotional.

429
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,124
-You're emotional.
-[chuckles] Okay.

430
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,625
[both breathing heavily]

431
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,711
-I'm sorry.
-You're fine.

432
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,129
-Jonathan.
-Yeah?

433
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,214
More weed? Is that really a good idea now?

434
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,175
Got a better idea to keep him calm?

435
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,594
Let's just get this done.

436
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,431
[tender, emotional music playing]

437
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,147
[Will] You can't let him get to you.

438
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,442
He's stoned out of his mind.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.

439
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,360
[Mike] That doesn't mean he's wrong.

440
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,615
I mean, if that guy would've lived
one more second, one more second,

441
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,575
then w… we would know where she is.

442
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,495
Wh… Why didn't he just say the number?

443
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,290
I should've explained myself.

444
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,835
Maybe Eleven would've taken me with her
and things would be different, but…

445
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,588
-No.
-I didn't… I didn't know what to say.

446
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:12,594
Sometimes I think it's just scary
to open up like that.

447
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,138
To say how you really feel.

448
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,851
Especially to people
you care about the most.

449
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,646
Because, what if…

450
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,856
what if they don't like the truth?

451
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,235
[tender music continues]

452
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,278
[Argyle] Does anybody know
the dead dude's name?

453
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,197
-What?
-The dead dude.

454
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,324
I'm making him a headstone.

455
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,577
You do realize we spent all morning
hiding the body.

456
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,331
Well, I'll just write, uh,
"Here Lies Unknown Hero Agent Man."

457
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,752
Yeah. "Saved Argyle, Jonathan,
Will, and Mike from certain death."

458
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,714
You… You're gonna write our names
on the pizza box?

459
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,925
They're pretty common names.

460
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,302
Okay, dude. Uh, do your thing.

461
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,304
Jesus Christ. [sighs]

462
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,182
Come on, man.

463
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,184
That's his pen.

464
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,811
What?

465
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,604
Unknown Hero Agent Man,

466
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,274
that's the pen he gave me
right before he died.

467
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,608
[Argyle] Piece of shit.

468
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,735
Why would he give me a pen
that didn't work?

469
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,821
[Argyle scribbling with pen]

470
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,906
[inquisitive synth music playing]

471
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,077
[scribbling continues]

472
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,996
[Argyle] Come on.

473
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,706
Hey, man, I'm using that.

474
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,874
What are you doing?

475
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,169
Something fell outta that pen, man.

476
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,421
Wh… What is it?

477
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,217
It's the number.

478
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,761
We've had it this whole time.

479
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,221
We got his digits, man?

480
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,725
[wet plop]

481
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,185
[squelching]

482
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,063
[indistinct chatter in Russian]

483
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,148
[sighs]

484
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,610
[in Russian] Did I tell you
it's okay to break?

485
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,362
Over there, there is a hand.

486
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,572
A HAND!

487
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,532
Are we animals?

488
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,784
-[dramatic musical flourish]
-[metal swishing]

489
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,328
[Antonov] Psst!

490
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,913
Hey, Ivan. Ivan!

491
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,175
-[clanging]
-Stop calling my name.

492
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,552
You trying to get me in trouble?

493
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,929
I don't know what they've told you,

494
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,473
but it is all lies.

495
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,016
I'm here by mistake!

496
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm sorry. I cannot help you.

497
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,439
I can make you rich.

498
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,489
See this American?

499
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,616
He comes from money.

500
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,036
Old money.

501
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,957
[in English] Tell him, American.
Tell him how you will make him rich.

502
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,387
You're a real help, American,
you know that?

503
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,640
A real help.

504
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,560
Hey.

505
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,521
[claps hands]

506
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,065
You want to die here?
You want to die? Is that it?

507
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,317
That's what we've been brought here to do.

508
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,528
So, that is it? You give up, then?

509
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,613
[exhales]

510
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,371
What about your woman, huh?

511
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,749
She's captured, yes, but still alive.

512
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,376
We can still save her.

513
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,586
[clicks tongue] "Save her."

514
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,007
That is amusing to you?

515
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,760
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

516
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,764
The closer I get with Joyce,
the more danger she's in.

517
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,057
[melancholy music playing]

518
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,309
You're not thinking straight, American.

519
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
No, I think I am.

520
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,399
For the first time in my life,
I think I'm thinking straight.

521
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,946
I used to think I was cursed.

522
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,866
Ever since I was 18.

523
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,035
Got some letter of induction in the mail.

524
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,913
Uncle Sam wants me
to go fight some war in the jungle.

525
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:14,085
Charlie's moving south like a plague
'cause of commie bastards like you, and…

526
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,629
You know, I'm happy enough to go.

527
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,341
Prove to my old man
I'm not the piece of shit he thinks I am.

528
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,847
I get over there, I must test well,
and they put me in the Chemical Corps.

529
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,516
There I am. I'm just… a kid, you know.

530
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,435
I'm 18 years old, 8,000 miles away,

531
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:35,482
and I'm mixing up
these… 55-gallon drums of Agent Orange.

532
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,235
With just these kitchen gloves, you know?

533
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,323
We used to clean out
these buffalo turbines after a run

534
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,158
and just be inhaling the stuff.

535
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,576
No masks, nothing.

536
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,958
"It's not chemical warfare.
It's just herbicide to kill plants."

537
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,171
"Harmless." That's what they told us.

538
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,092
Then I got back to real life,

539
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,428
and these guys I worked with,
the ones that made it back,

540
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,348
they started trying
to get back to normal, you know?

541
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,059
Having families.
And then things started going wrong.

542
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,439
Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb.

543
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,777
Crooked spines, eyes popped out.

544
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,906
The horror…

545
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,327
followed us, clung to us.

546
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,164
My wife Diane, she wanted a baby.

547
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,249
[sighs]

548
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
I did too.

549
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,254
We had a baby, and she was, um…

550
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,673
she was born healthy.

551
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,424
She was perfect, you know. Sara.

552
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,177
And then she died.

553
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,887
[woman] Blood pressure's dropping.

554
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,931
[Hopper] It wasn't an easy death. She…

555
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,141
suffered.

556
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,518
[muffled wailing]

557
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,311
I knew the risks, but I, um…

558
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,314
I hid them.

559
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,528
And then Diane left me.
She didn't blame me. Not with words.

560
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,613
After that, I was just…

561
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,077
I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol.

562
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,582
And then people
started coming into my life.

563
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,338
This girl El, and Joyce just happened,
and I told myself they needed me.

564
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,674
But that wasn't true.

565
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,720
That's a lie. They didn't need me.

566
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,307
I needed them.

567
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,686
I needed them.

568
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,274
You were right, what you said last night.
I knew the risks,

569
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,484
breaking out of here, but I did it anyway.

570
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,156
The minute I sent for Joyce,
the minute I sent for her,

571
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,117
I sentenced her to death.

572
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,828
Just like I did with Sara.

573
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
[melancholy music continues]

574
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,795
Everyone I love, I hurt.

575
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,762
See, I was wrong this whole time.

576
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,640
I wasn't cursed.

577
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,853
I am the curse.

578
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,606
[distant, shrill snarling]

579
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,110
[snarling continues]

00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,738
[unsettling, tense music playing]

581
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,910
[snarling continues]

582
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,746
I've heard rumors of a monster.

583
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,915
From America.

584
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,003
I don't know
if what you say is true, American,

585
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,799
if you're truly a cursed man,
but you're right about one thing.

586
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,760
We are going to die in here.

587
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,845
[unsettling music intensifies]

588
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,867
[knocking echoes loudly]

589
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,452
[door hinge creaks]

590
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,871
Can I help you?

591
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,249
We need to look around.

592
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,334
[tense synth music playing]

593
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,461
[door creaking]

594
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,048

[ominous stinger plays]

597
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,766
[Wayne] Yep.

598
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,769
I think it's some kind of leak.

599
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,441
I haven't had a chance to fix it
with everything going on.

600
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,402
Pack your things. We're moving you.

601
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,154
[sighs]

602
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,823
[disquieting synth music builds]

603
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,249
[woman] The devil is here.

604
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,668
I can feel his presence…

605
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,340
growing stronger each day.

606
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,926
But I know Chrissy's in heaven now,

607
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,971
looking down at us, smiling.

608
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:17,930
[scattered sobbing]

609
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,725
Happy to see all the lives
she touched and brightened.

610
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,770
But I also know she's frustrated.

611
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:25,980
Angry.

612
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,650
That the monster
that did this to her is still out there.

613
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,319
Still.

614
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,654
Hurting others.

615
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,366
[growing muffled]
How can he live, while my angel is gone?

616
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
-I know God has a plan…
-[clock chimes]

[eerie audio distortion]

620
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,546
[sobs] Lord, I've prayed.

621
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,467
And I just do not understand it.

622
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,760
[sobs]

623
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,303
[echoing] I see no reason.

624
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,472
I see no reason.

625
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,808
[Jason] So I finally
got ahold of Cappelletti.

626
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,309
[tense music playing]

627
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,811
Photos for the '86 yearbook.

628
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,437
Hot damn.

629
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,649
[Andy] Sinclair?

630
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,067
Goddamn traitor.

631
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,736
Only reason he'd lead us to a dead end.

632
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,029
The Hellfire Club.

633
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,366
-They're hiding Eddie.
-Maybe we should bring this to the cops.

634
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,576
The cops who think
Chrissy's a drug dealer?

635
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,995
Who are letting this… this psycho
go around killing people?

636
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,873
I'm just saying,
what if this cult is doing shit to us?

637
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,459
-Doing what?
-They already know we're after them.

638
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,047
-What if they cursed us or some shit?
-Patrick thinks he's cursed.

639
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,757
-[all chuckling]
-[Jason] Hey!

640
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,175
None of this is funny.

641
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,138
Look, I don't believe
in that supernatural crap, all right?

642
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,223
But this cult is dangerous.

643
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,891
We have to be smart about this.

644
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,686
I made a list.

645
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,771
Everywhere these freaks have been seen.

646
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,024
We divide and conquer.
Check 'em out one by one. Smoke 'em out.

647
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,943
We should add Reefer Rick's house to this.

648
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,069
What?

649
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,195
Reefer Rick.

650
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,156
He's Eddie's supplier.

651
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,868
He's supposed to be in prison,
but someone spotted him back in his house.

652
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,537
Now my parents are freaking out and shit.

653
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,414
It's probably nothing.

654
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,623
I don't know.

655
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,625
No, that's good. That's good.

656
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,128
No stones unturned.

Yeah, that's not creepy.

-[wood snaps]
-[nail clinks]

663
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,748
What exactly are we supposed to be
looking for in this shithole?

664
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,999
[Nancy] We're not sure.

665
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,460
We just know this house
is important to Vecna.

666
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,379
Because Max saw it
in Vecna's red soup mind world?

667
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,923
-Basically.
-Great.

668
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,301
Maybe it holds a clue to where Vecna is.
Why he's back. Why he killed the Creels.

669
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,346
And how to stop him
before he comes back for Max.

670
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,514
We don't think he's in here,

671
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,642
do we?

672
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,185
Guess we'll find out.

673
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,144
Ready?

674
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,021
-Mm-hmm.
-[tense music playing]

[door thuds]

676
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,153
[Vecna] Max.

677
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,906
What are you doing in here,

678
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,033
Max?

[doorknob rattles]

680
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,912
It's locked.

681
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,789
Should I knock, see if anybody's home?

682
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,873
[Robin] No need.

683
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,836
I found a key.

[whistles]

687
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,996
[Lucas] Looks like someone
forgot to pay their electric bill.

688
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,958
Where'd everyone get those?

689
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,879
Do you need to be told everything?

690
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,257
You're not a child.

691
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,883
-Thank you.
-Huh.

692
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,845
Back pocket.

[tense music continues]

694
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,358
[Nancy] They just left everything.

695
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,778
I guess a triple homicide
isn't good for resale value.

696
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,906
[Max] Hey, guys?

697
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,826
You all see that, right?

698
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,245
-[Dustin] Yeah.
-[Steve] Yeah.

699
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,042
Is this what you saw?

700
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,210
In your visions?

701
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,173
[chime echoes]

702
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,925
I mean, it's… just a clock.

703
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,427
Right?

704
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,271
Like a normal old clock.

705
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,982
Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks?

706
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,570
Maybe he's, like,
a clockmaker or something?

707
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
I think you cracked the case, Steve.

708
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,950
[Nancy] All I know is

709
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,119
the answers are here.

710
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,288
Somewhere.

711
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,001
Okay, everyone stay in groups of two.
Robin, upstairs.

712
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,755
Come on. Let's go.

713
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,885
[Steve sighs heavily]

714
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,221
-Was that a sigh?
-No, I did not sigh.

715
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,724
-Why'd you sigh?
-I didn't sigh. Just come on, dude.

716
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,977
-I heard you.
-W… We're just always partners, okay?

717
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,604
[Dustin] You have a problem with that?

718
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,190
[Steve] It'd just be nice
to, I don't know, mix it up a bit.

719
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,401
-[Dustin] I'm boring you? Is that it?
-No, the opposite…

720
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,319
-[electricity buzzing]
-[music builds to climax]

721
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,404
[Yuri grunts]

722
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,905
[lid clatters]

723
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,616
Ah.

724
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,243
Hey, Yuri.

725
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,246
Yuri, I need to take a piss here.

726
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,331
Just give it up. He can't hear you.

727
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,667
I really do have to go, Joyce.

728
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,335
This isn't some ploy to escape.

729
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,295
[Murray sighs]

730
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,673
[Murray sighs]

731
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,633
-He can't hear.
-What?

732
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,594
[jars rattling]

733
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,932
Joyce, what are you doing?

734
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,016
[Joyce grunts]

735
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,685
-Joyce! Joyce!
-[grunts]

736
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,147
-Joyce!
-My leg is too short.

737
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,982
Can you grab that shard with your foot?

738
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,068
Perhaps, you know,
we should talk this through first.

739
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,695
What is there to talk through?

740
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,905
-We cut our binds, break free.
-[determined music plays]

741
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,115
Yes, okay. Then what?

742
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,159
-Then you take him out.
-Take him out?

743
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,077
You know karate.
You said you were a black belt.

744
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,037
We're 10,000 feet in the air, Joyce.

745
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,415
I take him, who flies this plane?

746
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,417
All right, so don't knock him out.

747
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,752
Just get his gun
and make him turn us around.

748
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,546
Get his gun. Just like that, huh?

749
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,507
-Is black not the highest color?
-Yes.

750
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,385
-It's just…
-Just what?

751
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,388
I've never fought
in a real-world scenario, okay?

752
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,849
I've only sparred with the other students.

753
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,392
How old?

754
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,561
It doesn't go younger than 13.

755
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,937
Thirteen?

756
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,648
But Jeremiah is 16.

757
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,484
Almost. His birthday is next month.

758
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,944
And… And Jeremiah is a ferocious fighter.

759
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,363
Lightning fast. Very skilled.

760
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,241
And I beat him.

761
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,076
That one time.

762
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,414
And certainly Yuri is not
trained or skilled like Jeremiah.

763
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,208
So, yes.

764
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,918
Yes, you're right.

765
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,003
I can defeat Yuri.

766
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,379
Absolutely.

767
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,383
Thank you for talking it through.
I feel much better now.

768
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,927
[Murray laughs] Yeah.

769
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,428
[Joyce scoffs]

770
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,056
[plane engine whooshing]

[Eleven panting]

773

[eerie vocalizations]

774
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,321
[mischievous laughter]

775
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,614
[Eleven inhales sharply]

776
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,038
[Eleven groans]

777
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,500
[frustrated sobbing]

778
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,584
No.

779
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,510
[unsettling music builds, stops]

780
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,054
[gasps, pants]

-[indistinct chatter]
-[chip clattering]

782
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,892
[orderly] Well, well.

783
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,062
Look who finally decided to join us.

784
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,983
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

785
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,068
[low, menacing music playing]

786
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,074
Stop this!

787
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,659
Let me out!

788
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,954
[panting]

789
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,457
[menacing stinger plays]

790
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,385
[sighs]

791
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,931
[ominous music playing]

792
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,698
[Brenner] In 1786,

793
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,035
Nicolas Dalayrac
wrote an opera called Nina.

794
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,203
["Quand le bien-aimé reviendra"
by Dalayrac playing]

795
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,121
[whispers] Papa.

796
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,875
It's the story about a young woman
whose lover was killed in a duel.

797
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,462
Nina was so traumatized
that she buried the memory.

798
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,090
It was as if it never happened.

799
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,010
Every day, she would return
to the train station

800
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,887
to await her lover's return.

801
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,348
A return that would never be.

802
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,434
If only Nina could know the truth.

803
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,936
This… This isn't real.

804
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,021
[Brenner] No.

805
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,397
But it once was.

806
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,775
A memory.

807
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,984
[Brenner] Very good.

808
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,029
How?

809
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,572
Never mind how.

810
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,948
[Eleven] Let me out.

811
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,325
I want out!

812
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,327
[Brenner] I'm sorry, Eleven.

813
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,663
You'll have to find your own way out.

814
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,165
Leave your train station.

815
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,958
Stop waiting.

816
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,043
Focus.

817
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,003
Listen.

818
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,546
Remember.

819
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,131
I don't understand.

820
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,299
[breathes shakily]

821
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,968
[yelling] I don't understand!

822
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,553
[Eleven's voice echoing]

823
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,596
Well, well.

824
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,514
[aria stops]

825
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,766
Look who finally decided to join us.

826
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,518
[eerie music playing]

827
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,436
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

828
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,065
[Brenner] Focus.

829
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,108
Listen.

830
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,609
Remember. [echoing]

831
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,406
[orderly] Well, well.

832
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,742
Look who finally decided to join us.

833
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,994
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

834
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,500
[young Eleven and Eleven, overlaid]
I'm sorry. Am I… in trouble?

835
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,960
[gasps]

836
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:13,961
[orderly] Trouble?

837
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,879
No.

838
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,340
No, why do you think that?

839
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,426
You're just missing out on all the fun.

840
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,720
Training starts any minute.

841
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,054
Okay.

842
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:26,849
Hey.

843
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,601
There's nothing to be nervous about.

844
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,603
You're going to do great today.

845
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,522
I just know it.

846
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,108
[keypad beeps]

847
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,737
[eerie music playing]

848
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,824
-Good morning, children.
-[all] Good morning, Papa.

849
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,160
How are we feeling today?

850
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,828
[all] Good, Papa.

851
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,663
Good.

852
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,873
Number Twelve.

853
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,125
Would you be so kind and open the door?

854
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,835
[Twelve] Yes, Papa.

855
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,296
Please, follow me.

856
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,591
[intense music playing]

00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,680
[machinery whirring rhythmically]

858
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,313
-How's she doing?
-Very well.

859
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,606
She's swimming now.

860
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,567
Good. 'Cause I just
got off the phone with Stinson.

861
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,320
[sighs] We don't have much time.

862
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,323
Well then,
she'll just have to swim faster.

00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,246
[mysterious music playing]

864
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,141

[vehicle approaching]

867
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,859
-[Mike] There's one. Argyle, slow down.
-[Argyle] There's one what?

868
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,528
-Slow down.
-[Argyle] Stop barking orders.

869
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,738
[Mike] Argyle! Slow down!

[line trills]

874
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,336
Is it ringing?

875
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,672
No, it's just making
a bunch of weird noises.

876
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,340
[Will] Busy?

877

-[Mike] Listen to this.
-[modem dial-up sounds]

878

WarGames.

880
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,723
[Jonathan] What?

881
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,311
Oh my God, we're not calling a phone.

882
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,730
We're calling a computer.

883
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,566
[whimsical music playing]

884
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,735
I don't know if Nina's a computer
like Joshua or Owens' lab,

885
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,822
but Unknown Hero Agent Man
gave us access to it for a reason.

886
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,034
We just need to find the computer.
We find Owens, then warn him.

887
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,327
Then we warn Eleven.

888
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,495
I just need a hacker.

889
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,330
The only hacker that I know lives…

890
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,624
