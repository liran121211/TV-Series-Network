1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
[dramatic music echoing]

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,094
[owl hooting]

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,848
[Jonathan] I'm sorry. I'm having trouble
understanding any of this.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,560
I mean, what exactly is going on
in Hawkins? What's doing these killings?

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,938
-That's what we're trying to ascertain.
-Where is El, like, right now?

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,650
-For her safety, it's best you don't know.
-This is insane! This is insane!

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,571
So this training to get El's powers back,
how long is it gonna take?

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,948
-Could take weeks, could take months.
-Months?

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,701
Until then, agents Harmon and Wallace
will stay with you.

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,202
We're not in danger.

11
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,579
Our friends live in Hawkins.

12
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,164
My family lives in Hawkins.

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,750
I'll work to contain the situation
until Eleven is ready.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,004
In the meantime, it is of vital importance
you do not speak to anyone about this.

15
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,630
[scoffs] No. No way.

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,009
-I know this is difficult to understand.
-It's not difficult. This is impossible.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,388
There are factions within our government
who are working directly against Eleven,

18
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,475
who are, in fact,
searching for her as we speak.

19
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,101
We can't risk contact.

20
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,188
If they learned about any of this,
it will jeopardize Eleven.

21
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,775
And if Eleven is jeopardized,
so are your friends.

22
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,193
And so is your family.

23
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,613
[scoffs] So, what? We're just supposed
to trust that you're the good guys?

24
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,739
Whoever you are?

25
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,657
We're friends of Owens.

26
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,868
[dramatic music continues]

27
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,828
Eleven trusted us.

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,164
Now we're asking the same from you.

29
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,795
For you.

30
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
[Jonathan sighs]

31
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,258
[Will sighs heavily]

32
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,847
[door slams]

33
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,651
[dramatic music continues]

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,366
[tires screech]

35
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,372
[dramatic music builds]

36
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,253
[Max] It was here.

37
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,420
Right here.

38
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,423
A grandfather clock?

39
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,301
-[clock chiming]
-[audio distortion]

40
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,720
It was so real.

41
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,389
[clock ticking, chiming]

42
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,433
[Max] And then,
when I got closer, suddenly I just…

43
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,520
-[Dustin] Max, come on.
-[Steve] Max?

44
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,938
…I woke up.

45
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,314
[eerie audio distortion]

46
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,566
[panting]

47
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,193
[Dustin] It was like
she was in a trance or something.

48
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,445
Exactly what Eddie said
happened to Chrissy.

49
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,660
That's not even the bad part.

50
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,373
Fred and Chrissy,
they both came to Miss Kelley for help.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,959
Uh, they both were having headaches,

52
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,753
bad headaches
that wouldn't go away. And then…

53
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,881
then the nightmares.

54
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,758
Trouble sleeping.

55
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,303
They'd wake up in a cold sweat.

56
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,013
Then they started seeing things.

57
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,848
[unsettling rustling]

58
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,807
[screaming echoes]

59
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,517
Bad things.

60
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,561
From their pasts.

61
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,604
[moans]

62
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,397
These visions, they just…

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,692
they kept on getting worse and worse,
until eventually…

64
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,862
everything ended.

65
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,113
[police radio chatter]

66
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,740
[police sirens ringing]

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,491
Vecna's curse.

68
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,535
Chrissy's headache started a week ago.

69
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,955
Fred's, six days ago.

70
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,793
I've been having them for five days.

71
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,087
I don't know how long I have.

72
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,797
All I know is that,

73
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,925
for Fred and Chrissy,

74
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,928
they both died less than 24 hours
after their first vision.

75
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,765
And I just saw that goddamn clock, so…

76
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,391
[Max breathes shakily]

77
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,686
…looks like I'm gonna die tomorrow.

78
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,772
[distant clang]

79
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,359
Stay here.

80
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,406
[lamp clattering]

81
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,161
[uneasy music playing]

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,926
[distant clattering]

83
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,972
[footsteps approaching rapidly]

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,808
[all yelling]

85
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,979
-It's me!
-Lucas?

86
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,106
-It's me.
-Jesus, what's wrong with you?

87
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,192
-I'm sorry.
-I could've taken you out with this lamp!

88
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,986
[panting] Sorry, guys. Sorry.

89
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,363
I was… I was biking for eight miles.

90
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,906
[grunts, pants]

91
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,909
[panting] Give me a second. Shit.

92
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,287
-We've got a code red.
-What?

93
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,454
[intense music playing]

94
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,539
Dustin.

95
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,085
I've been with Jason, Patrick, and Andy,
and they've gone totally off the rails.

96
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,922
They're trying to capture Eddie,
and they think you know where he is.

97
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,383
You're in terrible danger.

98
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,510
All right. Yeah, that definitely sucks,

99
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,929
but we've got bigger problems
than Jason now.

100
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,056
[clock chiming]

101
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,142
[clock ticking and chiming]

102
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,396
[intense music builds to climax]

103
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,608
[opening theme music playing]

104
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,504
[inquisitive synth music playing]

105
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,130
[doorbell rings]

106
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,716
-[Mrs. Sinclair] Would you get the door?
-I'm busy!

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,885
[Mrs. Sinclair] I said get the door.

108
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,595
This is unbelievable.

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,433
Hey there. Is, uh, is Lucas home?

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
Negative.

111
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,353
You know where he is? [chuckles]

112
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,564
Uh, we're just…
We were supposed to go out and--

113
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,526
Go out? I see he's taken
a step down from Max.

114
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,486
-[door slams]
-[menacing music playing]

115
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,738
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

116
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,701
Uh, well, you're the little sister
who plays Dungeons & Dragons, huh?

117
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,911
What's it to you?

118
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,080
Do you know Dustin Henderson?

119
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,040
Know him? I've bled with him.

120
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,709
Chances are,
he's with your cheater boyfriend.

121
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,504
Oh, if and when you do find Lucas,

122
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,383
please tell him I've been
covering for his ass for two days now.

123
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,969
Each day of covering
costs ten bucks, with a DPR.

124
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,139
That's a daily percentage rate of 7.9%.

125
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,642
Another week of this
and he's buying me a goddamn Nintendo,

126
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,060
with Duck Hunt.

127
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,397
Where the hell's Sinclair?

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,315
That's what we're about to find out.

129
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,192
We've been tricked, boys.

130
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,278
[tires screech]

131
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,032
[Steve grumbles]

132
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,452
Okay, be honest. Uh…

133
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,745
You guys understand any of this?

134
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
-No.
-Pretty straightforward.

135
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,748
Oh, straightforward, really?

136
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,125
What's confusing to you?

137
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,335
So far, everyone Vecna
has cursed has died,

138
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,880
except for this old Victor Creel dude
Nancy found.

139
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,423
He's the only known survivor.

140
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,467
If anyone knows
how to beat this curse, it's him.

141
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,386
That's assuming he was cursed,
which we don't even know.

142
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,890
How can Vecna have existed in the '50s?
It doesn't make sense.

143
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,018
Far as we know,
Eleven didn't create the Upside Down.

144
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,436
She opened a gate to it.

145
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,898
The Upside Down has probably been around
for thousands of years. Millions.

146
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,066
I wouldn't be surprised
if it predated the dinosaurs.

147
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,943
-Dinosaurs? What are we--
-[Lucas] Okay.

148
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,822
But if a gate didn't exist in the '50s,
how did Vecna get through?

149
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,116
-How's he getting through now?
-[Lucas] And why now?

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,826
And why then? Just pops out in the '50s,

151
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,078
kills one family,
and he's like, "I'm good."

152
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,414
And poof, he just disappears. Just… gone?

153
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,875
Only to return 30 years later
and start killing random teens?

154
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,918
No, I don't buy it.

155
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,085
[exhales, sighs]

156
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,378
Straightforward, my ass.

157
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,424
Honestly, Henderson, a little humility
now and then, it wouldn't hurt you.

158
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,467
Sorry.

159
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,140
[delicate, intense music playing]

160
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,270
Any idea what she's writing?

161
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,526
[Dustin] Did she sleep?

162
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:47,944
I mean,

163
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,613
would you?

164
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,156
[door opens]

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,699
[footsteps descending stairs]

166
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,203
Okay, so…

167
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,705
-[Robin sighs]
-…we have a plan.

168
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,873
[music continues]

169
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,375
[Robin] Thanks to Nancy's minions,

170
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,711
we are now rock-star psychology students
at the University of Notre Dame.

171
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,338
-I'm now Ruth.
-And I'm Rose.

172
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,965
Ruth?

173
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,801
Nice GPA.

174
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,802
[Nancy] Thanks.

175
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,472
So we called Pennhurst Asylum,
told them we'd like to speak with Creel

176
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,766
for a thesis we're co-writing
on paranoid schizophrenics--

177
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,767
To which they said no.

178
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,686
But we landed
a three o'clock with the director.

179
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,773
Now all we have to do is charm him
and convince him to let us talk to Victor.

180
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,942
Then maybe we can rid Max of this curse.

181
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,610
[Steve] About that.

182
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,280
We've been doing
our Victor Creel homework, and, uh…

183
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,490
[sighs] …we got some questions.

184
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,658
Lots of questions.

185
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,910
So do we.
Hopefully, Victor has the answers.

186
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
Wait… Wait… Wait a second. Uh…

187
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,498
Where's mine?

188
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
[dramatic music builds, halts]

189
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,795
Nancy, you're outta your mind
if you think I'm babysitting again.

190
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,881
First, they're not babies anymore.
And Max is in real danger.

191
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,593
-She needs people around her.
-I know. But why me?

192
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,178
Oh my God, you have a Tom Cruise poster.

193
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,139
You have a Tom Cruise poster.

194
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,307
That's old.

195
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,725
-It's just…
-[Robin laughs]

196
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,270
-Can you please not touch anything?
-I can't do anything here, Nance.

197
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,023
Maybe I can be helpful
with this asylum director dude.

198
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,358
I don't know.
I could turn on my… my charm.

199
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,193
-Not the charm we need.
-Ouch.

200
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,445
No, I just… [sighs]

201
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,948
I did a little digging last night,
and it turns out this Dr. Hatch

202
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,660
is a distinguished fellow
of the American Psychiatric Association

203
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,871
and a Harvard visiting scholar, okay?

204
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,999
This is a lifelong student of the world.
If we're gonna win him over,

205
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,251
we're gonna have to convince him
we are too.

206
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,586
That, like him…

207
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,672
-[music box playing]
-…we are true academic scholars.

208
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,842
[whispers] Holy shit.
There's a little ballerina in here.

209
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,182
Academic scholar? She's giving you
an academic scholar vibe? Yeah.

210
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,726
-No, but…
-[Robyn sighs]

211
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,894
…she will.

212
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,814
Oh, please, tell me you're joking.

213
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,942
[truck horn blares]

214
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,028
[Joyce] It's busy. It's still busy.

215
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,783
Did I do something wrong?
It says dial one, then the number, which--

216
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,578
-You can check on your kids later.
-I don't understand why it's still busy.

217
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,374
Joyce, there are certain things
one can be late to in life.

218
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,958
A dentist's appointment.

219
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,544
A one-year-old's birthday party,
because who cares?

220
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,129
Little idiot's not gonna remember it.

221
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,591
But for what is essentially
a ransom exchange,

222
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,969
for that, for that,
I think you very much need to be

223
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,805
on time.

224
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm sorry. I'm very tense.

225
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,935
Clearly.

226
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,607
[grandiose Russian music playing]

227

[dog barking]

229
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,914
[Antonov] Head west, through forest.
You will see a church with a gray roof.

230
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,375
Wait inside. Yuri will meet you there.

231
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,627
So you heard from her?

232
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,422
Yeah, they arrived last night.

233
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,465
They're meeting Yuri soon.

234
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,635
If all goes well,
by tomorrow night you're home,

235
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,595
eating Enzo's with your sexy woman.

236
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,930
She's not my woman.

237
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,351
Of course not.
She saves your life because of friendship.

238
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,853
[guard speaks in Russian]

239
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,021
[Antonov] Look, American,

240
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,524
do not put too much hope into this dream.

241
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
I have thought long about this,

242
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,570
and I give you odds of success

243
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,822
fifty to one.

244
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,907
[tense music playing]

245
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,245
You don't even seem nervous, American.
I'm impressed.

246
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,247
You're a cool cat.

247
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,417
Like Steve McQueen. The Cooler King. Yeah?

248
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,377
-[chuckles]
-Let's hope not.

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,298
Of course not,
because Cooler King went back to cooler.

250
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,551
So, you must be better than McQueen today.

251
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,470
I change mind.

252
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,555
Now I give you odds

253
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,682
a hundred to one.

254
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,604
Our nosy friend again.
Where do you want it?

255
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,189
Just not my face.

256
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,442
Of course not.
Must be pretty for your woman.

257
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,903
She's not my woman. [grunts]

[music crescendos]

266
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,440
[announcer in English] Amazing you can get
this many people and have it this quiet.

267
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,193
Keep in mind that…

268
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,486
Where are you going?

269
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,447
[scoffs] I'm just getting something
to drink.

270
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,492
Is that allowed or…
How does this house arrest work?

271
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
You're not under arrest.

272
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,494
Right.

273
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,539
No, no, you're… you're here to protect us.

274
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,251
And watch TV, apparently.

[applause from TV]

280
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,531
[sighs] I… I mean, I don't think
they've thought this through.

281
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,285
If this goes on for a month, or months,
and people can't get a hold of us,

282
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,078
they're gonna totally freak out.

283
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,664
Meanwhile, my mom's
probably having a panic attack.

284
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,915
And what about Hawkins?

285
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,001
That lady's supposed
to keep it "contained."

286
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,379
Like you can contain any of this
without El. I mean…

287
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,047
Yeah.

288
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,425
[sighs]

289
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,511
If you keep staring at that,
it's not gonna change. You know?

Before the cops came,

293
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,613
me and El, we… we had a bad fight.

294
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,364
We never fight.

295
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,782
I mean, we fought before,

296
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,035
but just, like,
silly fights, stupid fights.

297
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,664
But, I don't know,
this one just felt more adult.

298
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,583
Like, it… it just felt more real.

299
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
Like, a fight you can't come back from.

300
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,299
Maybe I should've said something,
and if I would've said that thing,

301
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,260
then maybe she'd want me there with her,
wherever she is.

302
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,554
No. Look, Mike,

303
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,556
you're gonna see her again,

304
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,476
and whatever you didn't say,
you can say it to her then.

305
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,561
Okay?

306
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,521
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
She's gonna be okay.

308
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,527
She's not in Hawkins.
That's what we should be worrying about.

309
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,237
You don't trust Owens?

310
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,656
No. I don't know.

311
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,823
I mean,

312
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,867
he's been good to us and good to El,

313
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,911
but he wasn't able to protect me.

314
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,372
That was you guys who saved me.

315
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,539
That was you guys.

316
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,462
[sighs] Looks like
it's gonna be up to us again.

317
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,381
It always is, isn't it?

318
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,590
[laughs]

319
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,301

we can't stay here.

Listen,

322
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,393
let's assume these friends of Owens
are telling the truth.

323
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,895
We can't call Hawkins
without alerting the military,

324
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,480
putting El in danger.

325
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,399
Fine. Then we'll just go to them.

326
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
-Go to Hawkins?
-How?

327
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,070
What are you worried about?
Ponch and Jon out there?

328
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,738
They're half-asleep now watching golf.

329
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,616
No, Jonathan. I mean,
we don't have a car or money.

330
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,410
Then we'll hail ourselves a ride.

331
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,453
A cheap one.

What?

338
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,256
We're hungry.

339
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
I could eat.

Surf's up. Surfer Boy Pizza,
this is Argyle speaking.

345
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,194
We make everything fresh here
at Surfer Boy except for our pineapple,

346
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,529
which comes from a can.

347
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,283
But I still highly recommend slapping
some juicy pineapple on your pie.

348
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,577
Oh, fruit on your pizza's gnarly, you say?

349

Well, I say try before you deny. [laughs]

00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,291
Hello?

351
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,962
[surfer rock fades]

352
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,302
[sighs]

353
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,184
-I know you guys are staring at me.
-What, sorry?

354
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,519
-You said you needed something?
-Just hanging out.

355
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,355
How you think your eyes
boring into the back of my head

356
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,025
is protecting me from Vecna, I don't know.

357
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,910
-You can look at me now.
-Thank you. Sorry.

358
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:58,994
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

359
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,120
[Max sighs]

360
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,664
For you.

361
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
For you.

362
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,336
And, um, you.

363
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,758
Oh, and, um,
give these to Mike, El, and Will.

364
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,637
If you can ever get a hold of them again.

365
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,724
What are you doing? No, don't.
That's not for now. Don't open it now.

366
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,683
Don't… Okay.

367
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,935
[letters rustling]

368
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,937
I'm sorry. What is this?

369
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,979
It's, um…

370
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,899
it's a fail-safe.

371
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
For after.

372
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,320
-[distressing music playing]
-If things don't work out.

373
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,907
Wait, whoa.
Max, things are gonna work out.

374
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,825
No!

375
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,037
No, I don't need you to reassure me
and tell me it's all gonna work out.

376
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,874
People have been telling me that
my entire life and it's almost never true.

377
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,752
It's never true.

378
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,255
I mean, of course this asshole curses me.

379
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,633
Should've seen that one coming.

380
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,885
[distressing music continues]

381
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,095
[inhales deeply]

382
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,520
If we go to East Hawkins,
will this reach Pennhurst?

383
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,857
-Of course. Yeah.
-Why are we talking about East Hawkins?

384
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,608
[distressing music intensifies]

385
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,237
No. No. No!

386
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,073
Max, Max. Seriously.

387
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,784
Seriously, I'm not joking.
I'm not driving you anywhere.

388
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,829
If you think I'm going to spend
what is likely the last day of my life

389
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,165
in the armpit
that is Mike Wheeler's basement,

390
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,249
you're out of your mind.

391
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,751
Either take me where I need to go
or tie me down,

392
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,753
which is technically
kidnapping of a minor.

393
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,632
And if I live to see another day, Steve,
I swear to God, I will prosecute.

394
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,384
[determined music playing]

395
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,302
Open the door.

396
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,053
Uh, no.

397
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,180
I know a good lawyer.

398
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,059
[scoffs]

399
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,441
Henderson, that super walkie of yours
better reach Pennhurst.

400
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,571
-[clock chimes]

401
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,907

[chiming continues]

403

[chiming continues]

[sinister music swells]

[eerie music playing]

406
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,768
[Robin grunting]

407
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,191
I can't breathe in this thing,
and I'm itchy. I'm itching all over.

408
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,151
It's not all about comfort.

409
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,402
Okay? We're academics.

410
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,696
Who are evidently coming
straight from Easter brunch.

411
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,533
Also, this bra that you gave me
is really pinching my boobs.

412
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,663
Okay. Could you just let me
do the talking? If that's even possible?

413
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,873
It's not only possible, it's inevitable.

414
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,626
Because shortly,
I'll be dead from strangulation.

415
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,629
3.9 GPAs.

416
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,547
Both of you.

417
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,467
Impressive.

418
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,929
And this is a recommendation
from Professor Brantley.

419
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,557
Yeah, I know Larry. Quite well, actually.

420
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,310
Eh, you know what they say.

421
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,064
"Those who can't do, teach."

422
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,358
[Robin, Hatch chuckling]

423
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,363
Uh, yes, yes,
that's actually why we're here.

424
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,825
I mean, we can only
learn so much in a classroom.

425
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,742
Mmm.

426
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,662
And I'm sympathetic
to your struggle, truly.

427
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,541
But there is a protocol
to visiting a patient like Victor.

428
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,167
You put in a request

429
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,712
and then undergo a screening process,

430
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,089
at which point
the board will make a decision.

431
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,385
I can see you're disappointed.

432
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,803
[Hatch inhales]

433
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,139
But I'm more than happy
to give you a tour.

434
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,892
Perhaps you can even speak
to some patients in our low-security wing.

435
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,895
And we'd… we would love that.

436
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,523
It's just that, um… [clicks tongue]

437
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,234
…our thesis is due next month.

438
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,986
And you're out of time.

439
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,112
Whose fault is that?

440
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,031
Ours. Absolutely.

441
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,824
And I do apologize--

442
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,243
Don't apologize, Ruth. Screw that.

443
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,538
The fact is, we did put in a request
months ago and were denied.

444
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,082
And then we reapplied
and were denied again.

445
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,461
And coming here was
our last-ditch effort to save our thesis.

446
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,339
And I really…
I can't breathe in this thing.

447
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,383
Well, Rose, maybe you'd like
to go outside and get some air.

448
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,385
-Maybe I should, Ruth.
-Mm-hmm.

449
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,972
Because I'm starting to think
this whole thing is a colossal mistake.

450
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,891
I'm breaking out in a rash.

451
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,560
My boobs hurt.
And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.

452
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,063
May I call you Anthony?
These aren't my clothes.

453
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,566
I borrowed them
because I wanted you to take us seriously.

454
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,986
Because nobody takes girls seriously
in this field. They just don't.

455
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,656
We don't look the part or whatever.
But can I tell you a story?

456
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,159
-[inspirational music playing]
-1978, I was at summer camp.

457
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,454
And my counselor Drew
told me and everyone in Cabin C

458
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,082
the true story
of the Victor Creel Massacre.

459
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,126
And little Petey McHew…
You know Petey, right, Ruth?

460
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,044
Of… Of course.

461
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,507
Yeah. Little Petey McHew
started sobbing right there on the spot.

462
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,384
Full-on hyperventilating.

463
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,427
The other campers
couldn't sleep for weeks.

464
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,721
I couldn't either,
but not 'cause I was scared.

465
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,723
Because I was obsessed with the question,

466
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,685
"What would drive a human being
to commit such unimaginable acts?"

467
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,356
Other kids wanted to be astronauts,
basketball players, rock stars.

468
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,732
But I wanted to be you.

469
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,526
I wanted to be you.

470
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,779
So, forgive me if I'll now
try anything in my power,

471
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,281
including wearing this ridiculous outfit,

472
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,326
if I might get to speak to the man
that ignited my passion

473
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,621
and learn a little more
about how his twisted, but let's face it,

474
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,207
totally fascinating mind works.

475
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,335
So, yes, we don't
have the official paperwork,

476
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,213
but don't tell me
that cry-baby Petey McHew

477
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,841
wouldn't have gotten
an audience with Victor in moments

478
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,008
if he'd asked politely,

479
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,177
because you and I both know that he would.

480
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,220
[music trails]

481
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,014
[Robin] So… ten minutes with Victor.

482
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,559
That's all I ask.

483
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,356
I'm back in 30.

484
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,608
-[secretary] Mm-hmm.
-[dramatic music swells]

485
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,056
If things go sideways, I should mention
I'm now a black belt in karate.

00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,310
Hello?

487
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,603

-Hello--

[tense music swells]

492
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,034
Who are you?

493
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,245
I… Uh… We're looking for Yuri.

494
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,081
Why do you need to see Yuri?

495
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,334
It's actually, uh--

496
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,836
It's a private matter. Is Yuri here?

497
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,463
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,382
I don't know how to tell you this,

499
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,635
but you're a day late.

500
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,387
-What?
-You see damage to this hull?

501
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,600
Yuri was on sightseeing trip
to see polar bears.

502
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,604
And then bears got into plane

503
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,650
and pull him out of cockpit and kill Yuri.

504
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,318
-No.
-Yeah.

505
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,736
And he loved bears.

506
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,488
They broke his heart.

507
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,199
Or rather punctured it

508
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,201
with their bear claws.

509
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,621

I'm Yuri. I'm Yuri.

-Oh.
-[chuckles] Oh.

516
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,056
-Uh, you… you must be Joycey?
-Just Joyce.

517
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,933
-And you are?
-Murray.

518
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,351
-Murray?
-Yeah.

519
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,854
Yuri. Yuri, Murray, Yuri, Murray.
[laughs] We rhyme.

520
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,315
Yeah. I hear it. [Murray laughs weakly]
