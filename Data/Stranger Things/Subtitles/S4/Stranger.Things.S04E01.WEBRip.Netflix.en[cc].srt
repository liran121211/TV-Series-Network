184
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,425
-I want you home no later than 9:00.
-I'll try.

185
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,136
-No trying. You need to go to bed early.
-Why?

186
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,931
-It's a 6:30 flight, Michael.
-Yeah, I know, but--

187
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,975
No buts. Nine or no California.

188
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,685
And no sweetie pie.

189
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,602

190
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855

191
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,066

a whole week without you guys?

193
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,571

195
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:30,160

[Suzie] That's a negative, Dustybun.

198

Son of a bitch.

199
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,676
Try "Tigers86."

200
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,928
"Tigers86." Copy that.

201
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,221
[computer trilling]

202
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,268
Jiminy crickets, Dusty. I'm in.

203
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,561
Holy shit.

204
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,770
[pounding at door]

205
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,939
What's going on in there?
You're gonna be late.

206
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,357
Don't come in! I'm naked!

207
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm running out of time here.

208
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,737
Just hold your horsies, Dustybun.

209
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,452
Do you see it?

210
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,870
Yeah, I see it.

211
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,788
Yikes, Dusty.

212
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,789
Yeah.

213
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,003
[sighs]

214
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,297
I will repent later.

215
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,180
Then there's Heidi tomorrow night,
but the problem with Heidi

216
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,474
is that she's going
out of state for college.

217
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,645
Do I wanna start another relationship
that has no point other than sex?

218
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,230
I mean, I don't know.
Does that make sense to you?

219
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,066
-Robin, are you listening?
-Uh, yes.

220
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,902
-What did I just say?
-Something about sex with Linda.

221
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,528
No, I'm talking about Heidi.

222
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,572
-Cut me some slack, please.
-Well--

223
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,783
Your love life
is one of labyrinthine complexity.

224
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,619
It is 7:00 in the morning,
we have the stupid pep rally,

225
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,537
and I woke up looking like a corpse.

226
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,415
You're worried about a pep rally?
Expect me to believe that?

227
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,085
-Yeah? So?
-So we both know what this is about.

228
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,088
-Not buying that. This is about Vickie.
-Absolutely not.

229
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,298
-It is. You know what else?
-I don't care--

230
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,760
You gotta stop pretending to be
someone else when you're around her.

231
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,428
You just gotta be yourself.

232
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,473
You're literally quoting me to me.
You do realize that.

233
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,226
Maybe you need to listen to yourself.
Ever think about that?

234
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,561
I listened. Look at me.
Boom. Back in business.

235
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,814
-It's not the same thing. Okay?
-Well…

236
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,774
You ask out a girl and she says no.

237
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,860
Big deal. Nothing happens.
Maybe your ego's a little bruised.

238
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,738
I ask out the wrong girl,
and bam, I'm a town pariah.

239
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,950
I'd buy that, except Vickie
is definitely not the wrong girl.

240
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,910
We just don't know that, do we?

241
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,539
She returned Fast Times
paused at 53 minutes, 5 seconds.

242
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,333
Know who pauses Fast Times
at 53 minutes, 5 seconds?

243
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,503
-People who like boobies, Robin.
-Ew!

244
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,463
-Gross. Don't say boobies.
-Boobies.

245
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,092
Not a big deal, okay?
I like boobies. You like boobies.

246
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,220
Vickie likes boobies. Definitely.

to Christian Academy,

00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
I looked at my team,

298
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,930
and I said,

299
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,349
"Think of Jack."

until there's only one team left.

Just talk to Eddie.

"Just talk to Eddie."

Why don't you just talk to your coach
and get him to move the game?

326

-I think that's a great idea, Mike.
-Thank you, Dustin.

If I get in good with these guys,

332
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,908
I'll be in the popular crowd,
and then you guys will be too.

that we don't want to be popular?

and freaks for three more years?

00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,200
Could be a threat.

674
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,996

you did sabotage their U.S. operation

Yeah, like, the porcelain's cracked
and they tried to glue it back together.

696
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,632
Okay, okay. Uh, do you have rope

697
