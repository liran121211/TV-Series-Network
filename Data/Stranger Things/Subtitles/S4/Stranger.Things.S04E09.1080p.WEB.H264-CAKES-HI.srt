00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,716
[wind whistling]

00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,719
- [tools clattering]
- [indistinct chatter]

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,682
[Yuri grunts]

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,020
[Yuri humming softly]

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,604
[Murray] It's perfect.

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,606
- [Murray] Somewhere like…
- [Antonov] Yeah.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,943
[Murray] I can totally see it.
You in Indiana.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,486
- [Antonov] Indiana?
- [Murray] Yeah.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,574
Well, you have a certain stoic...
More Clint Eastwood than...

10
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,617
Good news, my friends.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,494
Katinka feeling better.

12
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,413
Shall we give her another try?

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,915
Why not? [chuckles]

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,541
Asshole.

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,961
[Antonov scoffs] This guy.

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,045
[Yuri grunts]

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,173
[exhales]

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,883
[sniffs, hums]

19
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,968
[machinery powering up]

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,928
[sighs]

21
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,597
[speaking in Russian]

22
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,724
[engine splutters, wheezes]

23
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,936
[engine continues spluttering, wheezing]

24
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,814
[engine jolts]

25
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,524
Yuri!

26
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,608
That's enough.

27
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,195
That's enough! Hey!

28
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,489
The hell you think you're doing?

29
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,908
Get your hands off me, potato head.

30
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,511
You're trying to break her, aren't ya?

31
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,912
Get us captured again
so you can get your reward? That it?

32
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,081
What do you two lizard brains know?

33
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,415
You're engineers now?

34
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,167
I know that sound is not good.

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,878
On contrary, those noises you hear,

36
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,963
that… [imitates engine whining]

37
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,964
…it's very good sign.

38
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,424
- Good sign, huh?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,302
My women make noise when I please them.

40
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,262
You don't know what that is like.
I understand.

41
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:40,350
But for those like me
who knows what and where to touch,

42
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,643
much noise.

43
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,103
[engine splutters]

44
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,273
[stops spluttering]

45
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,819
[spluttering resumes]

46
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,364
[light buzzes]

47
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,535
[Joyce inhales, groans]

48
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,411
Yeah.

49
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,790
These are the smallest I could find.

50
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,333
That's it for shirts.

51
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,170
- [Hopper grunts]
- Oh. Well…

52
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,214
Cute.

53
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,298
[Hopper chuckles]

54
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,509
Yuri has good taste. What can I say?

55
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,638
Um…

56
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,224
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

57
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,893
- [chuckles] I'll go over here.
- Okay.

58
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,857
[Joyce sighs]

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,781
[delicate, yearning music playing]

60
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,129
[sighs]

61
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,424
[Hopper grunting gingerly]

62
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,064
[inhales sharply]

63
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,959
[sighs]

64
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,254
What did they do to you?

65
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,341
Oh my God.

66
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,801
No, it's not that bad. It's… [exhales]

67
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,138
You know, I needed to lose weight anyway.

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,516
It's given me time to think, you know?

69
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,852
About who I've been and…

70
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,897
And what I've done.

71
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,153
I never should've sent you that message.

72
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,489
You didn't know what was gonna happen.

73
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,282
I knew it'd be dangerous.

74
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,492
So did I.

75
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,452
I made this choice.

76
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,498
And I would choose it again,
even knowing everything that I know.

77
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,082
I would.

78
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,003
Plus, you know,
we do have that date to get to. [chuckles]

79
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,087
Remember?

80
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,298
[chuckles] "Remember"?

81
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,676
I've been dreaming about it.

82
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh, yeah?

83
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,678
[Hopper] Yeah.

84
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,638
I have it all planned out.

85
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,265
Pray tell.

86
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,351
I'm getting two orders
of bread sticks. Two.

87
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,353
Those things knock your socks off.

88
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,938
Enzo puts some spice on 'em.

89
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,982
I don't know what it is, but it's good.

90
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,693
And you dip it in olive oil?
Forget about it.

91
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,530
And, uh, I'm wavering on the main course
between the veal and the lasagne.

92
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,907
But I think I gotta go
with lasagne, right?

93
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:48,162
So, you… you've been dreaming
about bread sticks and lasagne?

94
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,167
I've been on a diet of watery soup,
moldy bread, and maggots,

95
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,462
so, yeah, I've been dreaming
about bread sticks and lasagne.

96
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,714
I mean, sue me.

97
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,048
[chuckles]

98
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,218
Should I have been dreaming
about something else?

99
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,220
You tell me.

100
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,807
Well,

101
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,810
there's wine.

102
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,145
Oh, well, wine's good.

103
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,022
I was thinking about a nice "Cheeanti."

104
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,691
- Chianti.
- Chianti, right.

105
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,028
- Then there's dessert.
- You gotta have dessert.

106
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,195
Gotta have dessert.

107
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,822
And after that?

108
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,907
[tender, emotional music swells]

109
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,783
I don't know.

110
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,121
Use your imagination.

111
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,374
Who needs imagination?

112
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,252
[bright, hopeful music playing]

113
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,345
[Joyce moans]

114
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,055
[both exclaim]

115
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,600
[both moaning]

116
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,769
- [phone rings]
- [Joyce groans]

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,313
- Damn it! [sucks teeth]
- Remember, they're listening!

118
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,148
- [phone ringing]
- [dramatic stinger]

119
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,359
[owl hooting]

120
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,111
[Nancy] Okay.
I wanna run through it one more time.

121
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,863
[ominous music playing]

122
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,157
- Phase one.
- We meet Erica at the playground.

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,326
She'll signal Max and Lucas
when we're ready.

124
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,286
- Phase two.
- Max baits Vecna.

125
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,370
He'll go after her,
which'll put him in his trance.

126
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,791
- Phase three?
- Me and Eddie draw the bats away.

127
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,708
[Nancy] Four.

128
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,419
[Robin] We head into Vecna's
newly bat-free lair, and…

129
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,338
- [liquid sloshing]
- …flambé.

130
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,425
Nobody moves on to the next phase
until we've all copied.

131
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,221
Nobody deviates from the plan,
no matter what.

132
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,931
Got it?

133
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,014
[all] Got it.

134
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,269
[low, ominous music playing]

135
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,321
[tense, martial music playing]

136
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,501
- Be careful.
- Thanks, buddy.

137
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,628
[inhales] Here goes nothing.

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,423
[grunts]

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,928
[gate pulsates wetly]

140
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,477
[mutters sarcastically]
What does he want us to do, applaud?

141
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,692
[grunts] All right.

142
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,443
Let's go.

143
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,742
[gate squelches]

144
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,994
[Nancy grunts]

145
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,163
[Steve] Gotcha.

146
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,590
[yelps, pants]

147
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,435
[thunder booms]

148
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,024
Hey, guys, listen.

149
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,110
If things here start to go south,
I mean, at all,

150
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,028
you abort.

151
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,197
Okay? Draw the attention of the bats.

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,908
Keep 'em busy for a minute or two.
We'll take care of Vecna.

153
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,660
Don't try to be cute
or be a hero or something.

154
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,079
- Okay? You guys are just...
- [Steve, Dustin] Decoys.

155
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,332
Don't worry. You can be the hero, Steve.

156
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,625
[Eddie] Absolutely. I mean,

157
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,792
look at us.

158
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,420
We are not heroes.

159
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,050
[music pulses ominously]

160
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,760
Hey, Steve?

161
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,765
Make him pay.

162
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,434
[sinister industrial synth music playing]

163
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,788
[music swells]

164
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,873
[music fades]

165
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,501
[theme music playing]

166
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,109
[Jonathan] No, no.
Like I said, I… I've tried everyone.

167
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,695
Yeah, TWA, Pan Am, Eastern.

168
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,156
No, it doesn't have to be a one-way.

169
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,991
I'll take one seat, if you have it.

170
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,247
I mean, please,
there has to be something that you can do.

171
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,208
One of our family members
is really, really sick,

172
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,878
and I don't know
if she's gonna make it through the night.

173
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,048
Is there any way that you could just…

174
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,301
- No. No. No.
- [pensive music playing]

175
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,803
Like I said before,
I… I've tried them already.

176
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,684
Okay, well, is there any way
that I could speak to a manager?

177
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,605
There… There's no one there?

178
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,151
No, that's the problem. I can't call back.

179
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,779
[Jonathan continues indistinctly]

180
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,864

Hi.

1812
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:00,450
Hi…?

[Eleven] <i>Max wanted to have a sleepover.</i>

In fact, you can forget about college.

But, Jonathan...

1877

This isn't an earthquake.

1878
01:53:30,345 --> 01:53:31,345
I know.

- Okay.
- I promise.

"He could feel the hair stirring
on the nape of his neck,

1903
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:45,461

- We've been calling you guys like crazy.
- [Mike] I know.

1909
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:08,026
We came as soon as we heard.

When she will wake?

1916
01:56:00,495 --> 01:56:01,496
No.

1917
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:04,582
They say she might not.

1918
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:11,130
Her heart stopped.

1919
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:13,174
For over a minute.

1920
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:17,804
She died.

1921
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:22,892
I… I mean, clinically, but…

1922
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,061
Then she came back.

[inhales deeply]

1924
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:30,942
The doctors don't know how.

1925
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:35,488
They say it's a miracle.

1926
01:57:00,304 --> 01:57:01,889
I'm here, Max.

- Hi.

1931
01:58:09,957 --> 01:58:12,960
Uh, so these are blankets and sheets.

1932
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:16,464
And some… some clothes
and… and some kids' toys.

1933
01:58:16,547 --> 01:58:18,883
Wow. It's already so organized.

1934
01:58:18,966 --> 01:58:19,967
We appreciate that.

1935
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:22,053
- Do you want a tax receipt for it?
- Um…

1936
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:25,473
No. I don't think that we need one.
Thank you, though.

1937
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:30,520
But is there anything else
that we can do to help?

1938
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,359
[volunteer] Okay, then we sort by age.

1939
01:58:36,442 --> 01:58:40,738
We've got infants, girls,
boys, men, women…

1940

{\an8}Oh, if anything is in too bad shape,
we really don't want that.

1941

Hi.

- What are you doing here?
- I am…

1945
01:58:57,755 --> 01:58:59,882
I… I am making PB&Js.

1946
01:58:59,966 --> 01:59:01,801
Right, yeah. No. Duh. Of course.

1947
01:59:01,884 --> 01:59:05,012
Uh, I… I am also making PB&Js,
as it so happens.

1948
01:59:05,096 --> 01:59:06,347
[Vickie chuckles]

1949
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:07,431
Cool.

1950
01:59:17,358 --> 01:59:20,319
Hey, uh, I… I'm sorry
if that came out weird.

1951
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:22,655
I didn't mean it like,
"What are <i>you </i>doing here?"

1952
01:59:22,738 --> 01:59:26,492
I just meant, "What are you doing here?"
Like, "Nice surprise. Great to see you."

1953
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:27,493
Uh…

1954
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,954
- I didn't take it as anything negative.
- Okay, good. Good.

1955
01:59:30,037 --> 01:59:32,748
No, I… I'm sorry.
My brain's been a little frazzled lately.

1956
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:34,292
- 'Cause...
- Of everything?

1957
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:36,294
Yeah. [chuckles]

1958
01:59:36,377 --> 01:59:37,753
Yeah, and Dan.

1959
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:39,755
Um, he's my boyfriend.

1960
01:59:39,839 --> 01:59:41,716
Well, <i>was</i> my boyfriend.

1961
01:59:41,799 --> 01:59:43,593
He was visiting, took one look at this,

1962
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:46,179
and it's not what he was envisioning
for spring break.

1963
01:59:46,262 --> 01:59:48,639
He was like, "I'm outta here.
Back to Purdue. Good luck."

1964
01:59:48,723 --> 01:59:52,602
Which, ultimately, it's bordering on
a good thing, 'cause he was grating on me.

1965
01:59:52,685 --> 01:59:55,521
He is the type who trashes <i>Fast Times</i>
'cause it has no plot.

1966
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:58,107
I should've just ended things
right there and then.

1967
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:00,067
[knife clatters]

1968
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:01,235
Sorry. [exhales]

1969
02:00:02,236 --> 02:00:03,070
I'm so sorry.

1970
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:07,116
I am rambling about my dumb boyfriend
when there are people out there suffering.

1971
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,660
Who need… food.

1972
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:15,458
And I have just made a peanut butter
on peanut butter monstrosity.

1973
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:16,834
[Robin chuckles]

1974
02:00:17,752 --> 02:00:18,752
Um…

[tender, emotional music playing]

1976
02:00:25,927 --> 02:00:27,720
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1977
02:00:27,803 --> 02:00:31,515
Um, it's like sometimes my mouth
is moving faster than my brain,

1978
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:33,267
and it's like this runaway train,

1979
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:36,437
and I cannot seem to get it to stop,
no matter how hard I try.

1980
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:38,606
You know what I mean?

1981
02:00:38,689 --> 02:00:41,859
Uh, yeah, I think I know what you mean.

1982
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:45,571
It's a gift.

1983
02:00:45,655 --> 02:00:47,573
- Oh, for me?
- You're welcome. Mm-hmm.

1984
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:49,784
- You really shouldn't have.
- Oh, but I did.

1985
02:00:49,867 --> 02:00:52,119
- I just don't even deserve it.
- But I did.

1986
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:54,538
- I mean, thank you.
- Early birthday.

1987
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:57,500
Thank you so much. Oh, oh, wow.

1988
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:00,920
H2O?

1989
02:01:01,963 --> 02:01:03,547
Vital for all forms of life.

1990
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:05,675
[indistinct chatter]

1991
02:01:18,604 --> 02:01:19,772
[Dustin] Mr. Munson?

1992
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:27,613
I'm Dustin Henderson.

1993
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:28,948
Can we talk?

1994
02:01:30,032 --> 02:01:32,535
I can't imagine
we got anything to talk about.

1995
02:01:34,161 --> 02:01:35,496
My nephew is innocent.

1996
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:37,790
He's still missing.

1997
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:41,252
I'll put up as many posters as I need
until he's found.

1998
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:44,171
Good day to you.

1999
02:01:44,839 --> 02:01:45,881
I was with him.

2000
02:01:50,761 --> 02:01:52,596
I was with him when the earthquake hit.

2001
02:01:54,056 --> 02:01:56,642
[sorrowful synth music playing]

2002
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:59,061
And… where is Eddie now?

2003
02:02:14,952 --> 02:02:16,120
[voice quavering] I'm…

2004
02:02:16,996 --> 02:02:18,205
I'm so sorry.

2005
02:02:23,252 --> 02:02:26,589
[gentle, heart-felt chords playing]

2006
02:02:30,217 --> 02:02:32,595
[breathing shakily]

2007
02:02:53,074 --> 02:02:55,368
I wish everyone had gotten to know him.

2008
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,246
Really know him.

2009
02:03:01,665 --> 02:03:03,501
Because they would've loved him,

2010
02:03:04,085 --> 02:03:05,085
Mr. Munson.

2011
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:08,005
They would've loved him.

2012
02:03:10,299 --> 02:03:11,384
Even in the end…

2013
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:15,638
He never stopped being Eddie.

2014
02:03:18,432 --> 02:03:20,434
Despite everything.

2015
02:03:22,978 --> 02:03:24,980
I never even saw him get mad.

2016
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:27,566
He could've run.

2017
02:03:28,776 --> 02:03:30,986
He could've saved himself.

2018
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:34,490
But he fought.

2019
02:03:36,575 --> 02:03:40,746
He fought and died to protect this town.

2020
02:03:41,705 --> 02:03:44,959
This town that… hated him.

2021
02:03:46,627 --> 02:03:48,295
He isn't just innocent…

2022
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:51,507
Mr. Munson, he's…

2023
02:03:53,384 --> 02:03:54,677
He's a hero.

2024
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,761

Oh Jesus.

2029
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:52,902
Holy shit.

2030
02:04:54,153 --> 02:04:55,988
This place is a total disaster.

2031
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:57,489
[Jonathan] Yeah.

2032
02:04:58,365 --> 02:05:00,117
Well, that's a bit of a problem.

2033
02:05:00,201 --> 02:05:02,369
[Argyle] I get we gotta hide Supergirl,

2034
02:05:02,453 --> 02:05:05,664
but this isn't exactly
the Fortress of Solitude, man.

2035
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:08,501
It's more like a fortress of grodiness.

2036
02:05:08,584 --> 02:05:10,544
Come on, guys, seriously.

2037
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:12,755
I've seen Mike's room
look worse than this.

2038
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:14,173
[Argyle] Ah, brutal, dude.

2039
02:05:14,256 --> 02:05:15,925
- [pipes rumble]
- Ah! See?

2040
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,301
Water still works.

2041
02:05:21,222 --> 02:05:23,140
And, voilà. Cleaning supplies.

2042
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:25,100
[dramatic stinger]

2043
02:05:37,404 --> 02:05:39,114
[Jonathan] All right. That's good.

2044
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:40,991
Hold it right there.

2045
02:05:48,123 --> 02:05:50,292
What's he doing?

2046
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:55,965
[Jonathan] Looks like
he's gathering mushrooms.

2047
02:05:56,048 --> 02:05:57,841
He's a little on the eccentric side.

2048
02:05:57,925 --> 02:05:59,552
Welcome to the club, right?

2049
02:05:59,635 --> 02:06:01,178
Yeah, welcome to the club.

[Nancy hammering]

2051
02:06:07,393 --> 02:06:08,811
Hey, Nancy?

2052
02:06:08,894 --> 02:06:09,894
Yeah?

2053
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:11,814
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

2054
02:06:12,606 --> 02:06:14,108
Oh. I mean…

2055
02:06:15,651 --> 02:06:17,319
To be honest, I'm kinda glad you weren't.

2056
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:18,779
[tender, emotional music playing]

2057
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:22,408
I just mean, I'm glad you were with Mike.

2058
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:23,867
And Will.

2059
02:06:23,951 --> 02:06:26,787
And I'm… I'm glad you were here too.

2060
02:06:27,788 --> 02:06:29,268
Otherwise, who'd have been in charge?

2061
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:31,458
Steve? [chuckles]

2062
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:36,171
He's actually grown up quite a bit,
you know?

2063
02:06:38,215 --> 02:06:39,216
Yeah.

2064
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,300
Yeah, I'm sure.

2065
02:06:43,929 --> 02:06:44,929
Hey.

2066
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:47,599
Yeah?

2067
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:49,601
Are we okay?

2068
02:06:52,104 --> 02:06:53,104
Yeah.

2069
02:06:53,522 --> 02:06:54,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah, totally.

2070
02:06:55,691 --> 02:06:56,942
Yeah, it's… it's just…

2071
02:06:58,694 --> 02:06:59,695
You know, it's hard.

2072
02:07:00,738 --> 02:07:01,864
I feel like

2073
02:07:01,947 --> 02:07:04,450
life keeps throwing things
in the way of our big plans.

2074
02:07:06,785 --> 02:07:08,162
Yeah, sure seems like that.

2075
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:14,168
You think it's too late to throw
"saving the world" on your college resume?

2076
02:07:18,589 --> 02:07:20,591
Your… Your application letter…

2077
02:07:21,717 --> 02:07:24,303
Not that it matters at all anymore, but…

2078
02:07:25,512 --> 02:07:26,764
Did it ever come?

2079
02:07:30,726 --> 02:07:32,603
No. No, uh…

2080
02:07:33,687 --> 02:07:34,687
Not yet.

2081
02:07:49,828 --> 02:07:51,622
- [whooshing]
- [door creaks]

2082
02:07:53,415 --> 02:07:55,876
Did she… talk to you at all?

2083
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:57,795
Not much.

2084
02:07:57,878 --> 02:07:59,505
I mean, a little bit.

2085
02:08:01,215 --> 02:08:02,216
[Mike sighs]

2086
02:08:02,299 --> 02:08:03,299
Dr. Brenner.

2087
02:08:06,929 --> 02:08:08,764
He says that she wasn't ready.

2088
02:08:09,264 --> 02:08:11,141
And now she's starting to think
he was right.

2089
02:08:11,225 --> 02:08:12,476
That's crap.

2090
02:08:12,976 --> 02:08:14,978
If it wasn't for her,
if she hadn't left the lab,

2091
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:16,782
- Max wouldn't be alive right now.
- I know.

2092
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:19,191
It's just, she's, um…

2093
02:08:20,192 --> 02:08:21,652
She's never lost before.

2094
02:08:22,236 --> 02:08:23,278
Not like this.

2095
02:08:23,904 --> 02:08:26,115
- She'll have another chance.
- Let's hope not.

2096
02:08:26,198 --> 02:08:29,368
Let's hope One is dead and rotting.

2097
02:08:30,411 --> 02:08:31,411
He's not.

[haunting music playing]

2099
02:08:34,623 --> 02:08:38,127
[voice quavering]
Now that I'm here, in Hawkins,

2100
02:08:39,002 --> 02:08:41,004
I can feel him.

2101
02:08:42,047 --> 02:08:43,465
And he's hurt.

2102
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:44,758
He's hurting.

2103
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:48,011
But he's still alive.

2104
02:08:48,762 --> 02:08:53,267
It's strange, knowing now who it was
this whole time, but…

2105
02:08:54,852 --> 02:08:57,271
I can still remember what he thinks,

2106
02:08:57,354 --> 02:08:59,106
and<i> how</i> he thinks.

2107
02:09:01,525 --> 02:09:03,110
And he's not going to stop.

2108
02:09:03,902 --> 02:09:04,902
Ever.

2109
02:09:05,612 --> 02:09:07,781
Not until he's taken everything.

2110
02:09:08,323 --> 02:09:09,533
And everyone.

2111
02:09:11,326 --> 02:09:12,828
We have to kill him.

2112
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:15,622
And we will.

2113
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:18,083
We will.
