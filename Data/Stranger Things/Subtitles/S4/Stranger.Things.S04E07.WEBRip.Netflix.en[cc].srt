76
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,708
I understand the stakes quite well.

00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,836
Sometimes I wonder if you really do.

78
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,755
Or maybe you've just done all this

79
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,965
'cause you missed
your daddy-daughter time.

80

I've given you everything you asked for.

81
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,723
I've compromised my principles.
I've risked my life, my family's life.

82
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,851
All because you assured me
this would work,

83

that this was the only way.

84
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,147
But I don't see
any progress out there, Martin.

[Brenner] The truth is,
you're regressing, Eleven.

You're going backwards.

00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,133
Eleven, look at me.

93
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,395
Look at me.

I know you're frightened.

You're terribly frightened
by what you've seen.

But it's this very fear
that's now holding you back.

If you want Nina to succeed,

98

you cannot hide from the truth,
no matter how frightening it may be.

99
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,420
I saw what I did.

I am a monster.

That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales.

104

Reality, truth, is rarely so simple.

105
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,773
People are not so easily defined.

106
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,236
Only by facing all of ourselves,
the good and the bad,

107
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
can we become whole.

108
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,409
What if I don't wanna become whole?

109
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,036
Then that is a choice.

110
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,581
Your choice.

The door is always open.

This place

113
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,255
is not a prison.

114
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,259
This is.

115
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,348
You chose to trust me once.

116
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,727
I'm asking you to trust me again.

129

You wanted progress.

130
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,238
I'm giving it to you.

[Callahan] A walk?

136
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,681
At 9:00 p.m.?

137
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,849
[squeakily] To the lake.

138
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,101
We were gonna

139
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,437
take a little swim.

140
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,858

[Mrs. Henderson] Dusty.

142
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,987
Someone was just murdered there.

143
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,324
Yeah, we… we didn't realize that
until we got there.

144
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,658
That's why we didn't swim.

145
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,161
And Nancy,
was she with you at this night swim?

146
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,162
-No.
-Yes. Uh…

147
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
We're not sure.

148
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,708
[Dustin] She was there.

149
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,461
Then she left.

150
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,422
-It's all a little confusing.
-That's when you guys came.

151
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,924
Right. Then they dared me
to say what I said.

152
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:34,967
Oh, yeah.

153
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,552
-About the killer.
-[laughing]

154

You're lucky you didn't get shot.

155
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,473
Have you had any contact with Eddie?

156
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,851

00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,144
God, no.

158
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,897
-Nope. Absolutely not.
-No. We haven't heard from him.

159
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,315
-We barely know the guy.
-Who?

160
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh, that's a bunch of bull.

161
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,486
-[both] Erica!
-I mean, you realize they're lying.

162
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,945
The whole couch is on fire.

163
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,989
-[both] Erica.
-Just the facts.

164
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,867
Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?

165
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,578
-[high-pitched] No.
-Lying to cops is a crime, son.

166
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,748
-I'm not lying.
-The fire is consuming us.

167
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,959
Threaten them with a little jail time.
Maybe that'll loosen their lips.

168
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,003
-Okay--
-You wanna send our kids to jail?

169
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,923
-We need to take this seriously.
-He didn't mean it like that.

-Jesus.
-Shh.

174
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,105
We're gonna try a more civilized approach.

One at a time.

176
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,276
You first.

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,654
-Wait, what? Why me?
-Follow me.

178
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,406
I'm not even in Hellfire.

179
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,907
Do I need to cuff you?

180
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,284
Up.

[creatures chittering]

185
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,118
Oh… okay.

186
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,288
-That was close.
-Yeah.

187
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,497
[Eddie] Too close.

188
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,001
Oh, sh… shit.

189
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,043
Steve?

190
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,254
-Jesus.
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

191
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,673
No, no, no.
You're not. You're losing blood.

192
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,133
Come on, sit. All right?

193
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,342
[grunts]

194
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,469
[Nancy] All right.

195
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,264
-[music pulses ominously]
-Oh…

196
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,766
[Steve grunting]

197
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,810
Okay.

198
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,814
So the good news is I'm pretty sure
wooziness is not a symptom of rabies.

199
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,609
But if you start having hallucinations
or muscle spasms

200
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,154
or you start feeling aggressive,
like you wanna punch me, let me know.

201
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,572
-Robin.
-Yeah?

202
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,948
I kinda wanna punch you.

203
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,160
[laughs] Sense of humor's still intact.
That's a good sign.

204
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,119
Yeah.

205
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,624
-Okay.
-[Steve grunts]

206
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,042
Okay.

207
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,460
-You ready?
-Yeah.

208
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,711
Just do it.

209
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,837
[wet squelch]

210
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,963
[stifled groan]

211
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,548
Sorry.

212
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,466
It's okay.

213
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,970
-[grunts]
-Too tight?

214
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,806
-No, that's good.
-All right.

215
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,184
[grunting, panting]

216
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,185
Okay.

217
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,446
Thanks.

218
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,031
Yeah.

219
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,955
[thunder rumbling]

220
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,298
[Eddie] So, uh,

221
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,762
this place is like Hawkins,
but with monsters and nasty shit?

222
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
Pretty much.

223
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,642
Wait, watch out for the vines.

224
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,935
It's all a hive mind.

225
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,353
It's all a what?

226
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,480
All the creepy crawlies around here.

227
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,232
They're, like, one or something.

228
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,527
Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat,
you're stepping on Vecna.

229
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,070
Shit.

230
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,741
But everything from our world
is still here, right? Except people?

231
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,159
As far as I understand it, yeah.

232
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,996
So, theoretically,
we could go to the police station

233
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,540
and steal guns and grenades
and whatever we need

234
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,750
to blow up those bat things
that are guarding the gate.

235
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,920
I highly doubt
the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin.

236
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
But guns, yeah, sure.

237
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,758
Well, we don't have to go
all the way downtown for guns.

238
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
I have guns in my bedroom.

239
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,513
You,

240
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,098
Nancy Wheeler,

241
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,516
have guns, plural,

242
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,310
in your bedroom?

243
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
Full of surprises, isn't she?

244
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,147
A Russian Makarov and a revolver.

245
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,190
Yeah, you almost shot me with that one.

246
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,443
You almost deserved it.

247
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,947
For your modesty, dude.

248
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,158
[loud rumbling]

249
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,953
[Robin] Oh my god!

250
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,584
[all panting]

251
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,298
[creature baying in distance]

252
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,637
[creatures snarling]

253
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
So guns seem like
a pretty good idea to me.

254
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,189
Yeah, me too.

255
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,695
So what are we waiting for?

256
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
[ominous music playing]

257
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,544
[dark, industrial synth music playing]

258
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,287
[music trails off]

259
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,792
You know,

260
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,628
what we are to attempt is quite mad.

261
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,589
Even by your standards, American.

262
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,174
Yeah?

263
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,137
You got odds for us this time?

264
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,638
[scoffs]

265
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
I think…

266
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,397
a thousand to one?

267
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,481
[chuckles]

268
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,777
Even if we somehow kill this beast,
we still must escape.

269
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,404
We fail there,

270
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,490
I don't think they will be so kind
as to throw us back in a cell.

271
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
They will shoot us on sight.

272
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,911
We'd die as monster slayers.

273
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,663
You'll be a legend.

274
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,834
But still a traitor. You forgot traitor.

275
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,627
Monster slayer trumps traitor.

276
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,133
I bet Mikhail
will be proud of his pops, at least.

277
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,217
Mikhail?

278
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,385
-Mmm.
-No.

279
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,598
I can't do nothing right
with him anymore, it seems.

280
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,682
He will say,

281
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,644
"Papa, I bet that bald American
did most of the monster slaying."

282
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,397
He's that age, huh?

283
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,483
-Yeah, he is that age.
-[Hopper chuckles]

284
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,903
It is same for you, American?

285
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,613
With your new daughter?

286
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,494
The last time I was with El, she wanted
just about nothing to do with me.

287
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,370
I was just in her way, really.

288
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,500
I think back to the way I was with my dad
at that age. I was the same way.

289
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,752
The exact same way.

290
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,380
[emotional music playing]

291
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,134
I think it must be hardwired into us
to reject our fathers.

292
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,346
So we can grow and move on.

293
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,891
Become something of our own.

294
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,813
I hope that's what she's doing.

295
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,399
Coming into her own.

296
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,570
But still--

297
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,072
You worry.

298
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,742
To worry for our sons and daughters,

299
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,577
that is natural, isn't it?

300
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
Yeah.

301
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,083
But nothing about what El
has had to deal with is natural.

302
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,335
[jarring musical stinger]

303
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,503
That beast,

304
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,339
that monster in there,

305
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,426
it's a part of something
that wants to hurt El. To kill her.

306
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,137
I don't understand.

307
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,556
To be honest, neither do I.

308
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,976
All I know is that thing…

309
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,645
that thing shouldn't be here.
It shouldn't be alive.

310
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,566
Because it is,
it means it still isn't over.

311
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,028
I thought I was put here

312
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,531
to pay for what I've done.

313
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,869
But I might've been put here
for some other reason.

314
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,495
Maybe I…

315
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,748
maybe I can still help El.

316
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,793
Even if it's the last thing I do.

317
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,589
You almost sound religious, American.

318
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,799
Religious? I don't know about that.

319
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,721
But maybe I should
give that prayer thing a try.

320

'Cause if we wanna get out of here,
get back to El and Mikhail,

I have a very special delivery for him.

can help fill in the gaps.

is going to be about rules.

Ah, for some of you,

353
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,126
this may seem redundant.

it appears a refresher is required.

Last night, your sister Eleven
suffered a concussion

during her alone time in the rainbow room.

358
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,854
Now, she claims to not have
a memory of what happened.

359
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,483
But injuries of this nature
don't simply happen.

360
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,860
Someone did this.

00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,577
who's going to tell me what happened?

364
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,623
[uneasy music playing]

365
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,003
[Two] She must've… fallen.

366
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,841
Fallen?

367
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,885
You've seen her, Papa.

368
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,971
She's clumsy.

369
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,806
Stupid.

370
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,307
[bullies snickering]

371
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,604
Eleven, you may step back.

372
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,024
Number Two, please step forward.

373
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,865
[Brenner] Collar him.

374
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,201
[whoosh echoing]

375
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,913
[collar clinks]

376
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,085
[collar clasps shut]

377
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,591
Thank you.

378
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,934
You think because
you demonstrate some talent

379
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,688
that you're somehow immune
to the rules, is that it?

380
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,024
No, Papa.

381
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,651
That the rules don't apply to you
in the same way

382
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,945
that they apply
to your brothers and sisters?

383
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,363
No, Papa.

384
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
Then why did you attack Eleven?

385
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,786
-Did she tell you that?
-Are you asking the questions or am I?

386
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,663
Did you attack Eleven?

387
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,500
If she told you that,
then… then she's lying.

388
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,504
-[Two pants]
-[remote clicks, beeps]

389
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,714
Papa, please, you have to believe me.

390
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,840
Papa, please.

391
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,383
She's lying--

392
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,135
-[electricity crackling]
-[pained groaning]

393
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,221
[intense synth music playing]

394
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,307
Now,

395
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,059
shall we try again?

396
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,479
[remote clicking]

397
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,774
What happened?

398
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,108
It was an accident.

399
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,153
-[electricity crackling]
-[pained groaning]

400
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,327
[remote thrums]

401
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,831
[Two's wail echoing]

402
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,916
[thunder booms]

403
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,422
[Robin] Couldn't we have tried a road,
or something just slightly less creepy?

404
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,218
[Nancy] I think we're getting close.
We're almost out of here. Don't worry.

405
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,136
[Steve] Eddie.

406
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,681
Eddie. Hey, man. Uh…

407
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,558
Listen, I just, uh…

408
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,143
I just want to say thanks.

409
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,647
For saving my ass back there.

410
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,941
Shit. You saved your own ass, man.

411
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,486
I mean, that was a real Ozzy move
you pulled back there.

412
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,572
Ozzy?

413
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,532
When you took a bite out of that bat.

414
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,784
Ozzy Osbourne?

415
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,579
Black Sabbath?

416
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,957
-He bit a bat's head off onstage.
-I don't--

417
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,542
-You know? Doesn't matter.
-No.

418
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,253
It's very metal, what you did.
That's all I'm saying.

419
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,505
Thanks.

420
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,052
Henderson told me you were a badass.
Insisted on the matter, in fact.

421
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,971
-Henderson said that?
-Oh yeah. Shit.

422
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,389
Kid worships you, dude.

423
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:44,144
Like, you have no idea.
It's kinda annoying, to be honest.

424
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,648
I don't even know why I care
what that little shrimp thinks,

425
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,860
but, uh, guess I got
a little jealous, Steve.

426
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,825
I guess I couldn't accept the fact
that Steve Harrington

427
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,201
was actually

428
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,495
a good dude.

429
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,374
Rich parents, popular, chicks love him.
Not a douche?

430
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,918
No way, man. No way. That, like,

431
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,671
flies in the face
of all the laws in the universe

432
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,799
and my own personal Munson doctrine.

433
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,096
Still super jealous as hell, by the way.

434
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,308
Which is why I would never have
jumped in that lake to save your ass.

435
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,771
Not under any, uh… normal circumstances.

436
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,772
[branch snaps]

437
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,440
[growling in distance]

438
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,943
Nope.

439
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,156
Outside of D&D, I am no hero.

440
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,286
I see danger and I just turn heel and run.

441
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,998
Or at least that's what
I've learned about myself this week.

442
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,750
-Give yourself a break, man.
-See?

443
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,921
The only reason I came in here
was 'cause those ladies

444
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,381
came in straight after you.

445
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,676
Now, I was too ashamed
to be the one who stayed behind.

446
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,803
But Wheeler right there,

447
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,554
she didn't waste a second.

448
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,891
Not one second.

449
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,976
She just dove right in.

450
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,981
Now, I don't know what happened
between you two,

451
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,358
but if I were you,

452
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,736
I would get her back.

453
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,946
'Cause that

454
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,701
was as unambiguous a sign of true love

455
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,705
as these cynical eyes have ever seen.

456
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,457
[subdued, emotional music plays]

457
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,670
-[loud rumbling]
-Goddamn it!

458
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,755
Here we go again.

459
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,427
Second on my list
of least favorite things, earthquakes.

460
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,512
Seriously, I'm unsteady enough as it is.

461
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,810
Nancy!

462
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,396
Where are you going?

463
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,605
Nancy!

464
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,113
[tense industrial synth music playing]

465
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,033
Nancy!

466
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,456
[thunder booming]

467
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,417
Come on.

468
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,723
[Dustin] Steve, do you copy?

469
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,725
Nancy? Robin?

470
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,102
This is Dustin. Where are you?

471
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,856
We've been collared by the law.
I repeat, we've been collared by the law.

472
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,065
Do you copy?

473
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,150
[radio squawks]

474
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,195
Shit!

475
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,279
[flushes]

476
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,365
-Should we get lawyers?
-[Powell] We're not ready for that.

477
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,367
As far as we know,
nobody did anything wrong.

478
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,037
[Mrs. Henderson]
But what if they did do something wrong?

479
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,998
-Anything?
-Nothing.

480
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,920
-You don't think they went through…
-Through Watergate?

481
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,339
Without us? Without a plan?
Without weapons?

482
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,216
They wouldn't be that stupid.

483
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,467
Yeah.

484
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,636
They must just be laying low
'cause the law got us.

485
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,887
[Erica] "The law"?

486
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,806
What is this, Gunsmoke?

487
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,098
The Stupid and the Ugly?

488
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,434
Should I round up the posse?

489
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,186
-Saddle the horses?
-Erica.

490
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,688
Please, just go away.

491
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,940
Here's the deal.

492
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,776
Either you tell me what's happening

493
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,654
or I tell Dustin
what I found under your bed.

494
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:25,990
Please, no.

495
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,159
Spill your guts, cowpuncher.

496
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,078
-What'd she find?
-Nothing.

497
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,454
Is it gross?

498
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,956
-Scale of one to ten.
-A hundred.

499
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,082
A hundred?

500
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,918
The serial killer is a dark wizard
from the Upside Down.

501
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,419
And we've been looking for him,

502
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,505
but he's in the Upside Down,
which we can't reach.

503
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,215
At least we thought we couldn't,

504
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,551
until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.

505
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,096
That was the reason why we were there,
but these stupid cops grabbed us.

506
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,974
And if you tell anyone about this,

507
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,059
that's including Mom

508
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,310
and Dad

509
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,854
and Tina…

510
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,939
[Erica slurping juice]

511
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,235
…especially Tina,

512
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,278
I…

513
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,488
will smother you

514
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,657
in your sleep.

515
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,160
Do you understand?

516
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,871
Hmm…

517
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,831
Erica?

518
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,668
Do

519
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,545
you

520
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,213
copy?

521
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,383
The smothering in my sleep part,
but not much else.

522
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,719
Why would they open up a gate
at Lover's Lake?

523
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,929
-What?
-The commies.

524
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,931
-The commies didn't.
-Then who did?

525
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,350
-Nobody.
-So it just opened up for fun?

526
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,895
Erica, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

527
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,649
No, she doesn't,
yet she raises an essential question.

528
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,610
How did Watergate open up?

529
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,029
Only two gates have opened,
so far as we know.

530
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,947
One by El, one by the commies.

531
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,408
But it's not the commies
or El this time, so it…

532
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,493
[eerie music playing]

533
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,247
Holy shit.

534
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

535
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,168
"Wait, wait, wait," what?

536
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,212
There's one thing we've never understood.

537
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,466
Which is why Vecna's killing people.

538
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,176
What's his motive?

539
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,596
Killing teens?
It always just seemed too random.

540
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,306
Too prosaic.

541
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,685
On top of that, how does
the Mind Flayer figure into all this?

542
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,021
Maybe this is it.

543
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,023
This is the answer.

544
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,733
What is the answer?

545
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,360
You sure you just want water?

546
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,321
-We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper.
-Coke works. Thank you.

547
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,492
Okay, just hear me out.

548
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,744
How did El open the Mothergate?

549
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,038
She contacted the Demogorgon.

550
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,415
With psychic contact. Just like…

551
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,543
-Vecna when he casts his spells.
-Exactly.

552
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,629
So, what if, with each kill,

553
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,589
he's not simply killing them,

554
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,592
he's making a powerful
psychic connection with his victims?

555
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,177
A connection powerful enough

556
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,389
to rip a hole in the fabric
of time and space.

557
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,807
He's opening more gates.

558
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,891
Bingo.

559
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,560
Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house.

560
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,938
[police radio chatter]

561
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,565
-Why would he be opening gates?
-To take over the world.

562
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,526
Who do we know
that wants to take over the world?

563
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,527
The Mind Flayer.

564
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,321
So if the Demogorgon
was just his foot soldier,

565
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,615
Vecna's his five-star general.

566
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,536
A five-star general
with the power to open gates.

567
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,038
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.

568
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,541
Holy shit. That was incomprehensible.

569
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,003
You lost me at "Mothergate."
Please be kind. Rewind.

570
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,963
[Dustin] Okay, so remember the gate?

571
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,423
[Erica] Oh, no. I blocked that out.

572
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,717
[Dustin speaking indistinctly]

573
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,719
[Erica] So what was that giant laser?

574
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,179
[buzzing, rattling]

575
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,866
Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler.

576
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,661
Come on. I don't want to stay here
longer than we have to.

577
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,747
[eerie, mysterious music playing]

578
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,169
[Dustin speaking indistinctly and faintly]

579
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,767
Those aren't guns.

580
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,060
These heels are pointy,

581
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,104
but I was hoping for a deadly projectile.

582
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,024
-I don't understand.
-Maybe you left them somewhere else.

583
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,610
There's a six-year-old in the house.
I know where I keep my guns.

584
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,821
And also, I threw these away years ago.

585
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,533
[mysterious music playing]

586
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,542
Jesus. How many did you make?

587
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,044
You said you wanted to help.

588
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,506
I get that grades are important,

589
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,466
but perhaps studying can wait
till we get out?

590
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,885
These are from sophomore chemistry.

591
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,349
And this… this wallpaper,
this is old wallpaper.

592
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,811
And this mirror, this went to a yard sale.

593
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,188
And you…

594
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,233
you're not supposed to be here.

595
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,985
No, I gave you to Cousin Joanna
two years ago.

596
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,071
[mysterious music continues]

597
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,414
What is it?

598
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,418
Nancy? You're freaking me out.

599
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,673
I think the reason
that my guns aren't here

600
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,510
is because they don't exist yet.

601
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,639
They don't… exist?

602
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,766
This diary should be full of entries.

603
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,684
It's not.

604
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,311
The last entry is November 6, 1983.

605
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,938
The day Will went missing.

606
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,982
The day the gate opened.

607
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,986
We're in the past.

608
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,487
[eerie stinger]

609
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,739
[Steve] Dustin! Dustin!

610
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,285
Dustin!

611
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,828
Can you hear me? Dustin!

612
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,414
Du-- Hello? Hel… Hello?

613
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,375
-Maybe he really does have rabies.
-Hello! Hello?

614
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,418
What are you doing?

615
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,836
Hello!

616
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,715
He's here. Henderson.
That little shit, he's here. He's like…

617
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,092
He's in the walls or something.
Just listen.

618
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,427
Dustin.

619
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,596
Dustin! Dustin!

620
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,599
Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me?

621
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,477
[Dustin] That brings us
to the question you first raised.

622
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,772
How and why
is there a gate at Lover's Lake?

623
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,608
Let's analyze.

624
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,527
What do Eleven and Vecna have in common?

625
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,196
Dustin!

626
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,909
-Dustin?
-Dustin!

627
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,913
All right, either this kid can't hear us
or he's being a total douchebag.

628
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,415
-Will found a way.
-What?

629
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,666
Will.

630
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,920
He found a way
to speak to Joyce through the lights.

631
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,129
-[Steve] Lights?
-Yeah.

632
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,590
-The switch. Try the switch.
-Okay.

633
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,175
[Dustin continuing, faintly]

634
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,593
[Nancy] It's not working.

635
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,094
Guys?

636
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,389
You seeing this?

637
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,475
[energy thrumming]

638
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,437
[Dustin speaking faintly]

639
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,191
[mysterious, ethereal music playing]

640
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,788
[Dustin] …to open a tear
in time and space,

641
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,122
just like the Mothergate.

642
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,418
Whoa.

643
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,546
[ethereal music continues]

644
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,425
[Dustin] …are these like the Mothergate…

645
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,346
But a gate nonetheless.

646
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,726
[Steve exhales]

647
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,064
It…

648
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,733
tickles.

649
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,820
It kinda feels good.

650
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,032
Does anyone know Morse code?

651
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,909
[Robin, Steve] No.

652
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,787
Wait, does SOS count?

653
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,290
Is that…

654
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,625
is that good?

655
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,380
So our working theory is that Vecna
makes remote contact from his attic.

656
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,425
We don't know why.
We assume he can do it from anywhere.

657
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,510
[energy thrumming rhythmically]

658
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,139
-Are you even listening to me?
-I'm listening.

659
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,223
It's just…

660
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,728
You said you followed Vecna
through lights, right?

661
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,813
Yeah, why?

662
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,357
Because I think he's here.

663
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,197
[ethereal music builds]

664
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,876
It's working.

665
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,132
"S."

666
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,468
"O."

667
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,262
"S."

668
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,349
Hey, uh,

669
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,769
remember when I said
they wouldn't be stupid enough

670
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,187
to go through Watergate?

671
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,647
Yeah?

672
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,360
I overestimated them.

673
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,153
[wind rushing]

674
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,330
[Murray] Warden,
beautiful prison you got here.

675
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,376
How about this? Huh? [laughs]

676
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,877
How about that? Huh?

677
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,878
Huh?

678
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,005
-[Joyce groans]
-That's what I thought, yeah.

679
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,508
Warden. [chuckles]

680
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,093
So nice to meet you.

681
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:51,472
Uh, I'm Yuri, of course,
but allow me to introduce you to my very--

682
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,641
Shit.

683
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,684
-[muffled] Murray!
-I'm sorry.

684
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,186
What?

685
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,772
Can you please
stop playing with that thing?

686
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,024
I am not playing. I am practicing.

687
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,403
Will you please stop trying
to talk to me and stay in character?

688
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,614
Remember, you are frightened,
scared, confused.

689
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:13,619
-Yes, I am frightened, scared, and--
-Okay. All right. Yes. Good.

690
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,540
[in Russian] Yuri Ismaylov.

691
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,000
[laughing]

692
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,253
At last, we meet.

693
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,754
Comrade Major.

694
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,341
This is the Bauman spy?

695
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,177
[Yuri struggling, muffled]

696
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,138
He looks different.

697
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,682
Uglier in person, I know.

698
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,101
He also shaved his beard
to disguise himself.

699
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,394
Tricky bastard.

700
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,189
[in English] Silence, American scum!
Enough from you. Enough!

701
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,315
[Yuri moaning]

702
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,276
[laughs wheezily]

703
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,903
[in Russian] Now this one…

704
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,573
This one I would recognize
a continent away.

705
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:54,285
She was more beautiful
in her uniform, but still,

706
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,870
quite striking, isn't she?

707
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,248
Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.

708
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,542
But not so pleasing to the ears,
I am afraid.

709
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,878
[in English] Where is he?

710
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,797
What have you done with Hopper,
you vile commie pig?

711
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,048
[in Russian] As I said,

712
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,301
unpleasant.

713
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,928
But, I must say,

714
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,431
I, too, am curious.

715
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,850
The other American.

716
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,435
What did you do with him?

717
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,313
I don't know why,
but I imagine him on a rack,

718
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,858
in the cold, stretched thin,

719
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,985

Am I... close?

721
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,866
I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov,

the Peanut Butter Smuggler.

723
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,914
And you…

724
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,417
you are not the Yuri I have heard of.

725
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,463
I am…

726
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,006
I am not?

727
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,633
No.

728
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
No.

[menacing music plays]

730
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,308
The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose.

731
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,227
And you…

732
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,146

736
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,542
I hope we have not missed the show.

737
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,127
On the contrary, just in time.

This key here will give you access

They are being told the rules.

746

Rules for what?

747
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,749
I could tell you...

748
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,752
but that would spoil the fun,
now, wouldn't it?

[Murray chuckles]

750
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,842
You wait for the buzzer.

00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,635
You wait.

00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,889
You move before the buzzer...

753
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,350
you will be shot.

754
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,853
Is that understood?

755
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,524
Is that understood?

756
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,109
[prisoners] Yes.

757
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,410
I'd wish you luck

758
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,996

Try not to show any emotion
as I speak, okay?

772
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,638
Just keep playing the game

Two is still in the infirmary recovering.

He's being watched now,
but once he is released,

775
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,030
he and the others
are going to attempt to kill you.

00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,828
And Papa

779
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,455
will allow it to happen.

780
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,457
In fact, he wants it to happen.

781
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,376

Focus on the game.

785
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:10,392
There's a reason why Two and the others
were able to escape their room last night.

786
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,729
Why the security cameras were turned off.

787
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,064
Why Papa punished Two today.

788

They don't even realize it,

789
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,112

You frighten him.

796
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:41,131
He knows you are more powerful
than the others.

797
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,176
And he also knows he can't control you.

798

Why do you still help?

01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,229
to be different.

1266
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,357
To be alone

1267
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,275
in this world.

1268
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,491

[clock chimes]

1272
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:59,604
[Vecna] I see
you've been looking for me, Nancy.

1273
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,357
You were so close.

1274
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,110
So close to the truth.

1275
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:09,614
How was old, blind, dumb Victor?

1276
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,991
Did he miss me?

1277
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:15,245
I've been meaning to check back in,

1278
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:17,163
but I've been busy.

1279
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,249
[horrifying stinger]

1280
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,462
So very busy.

1281
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,384
[sinister organ music playing]

1282
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:39,269
-What'd I tell ya?
-Wow.

1283
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,105
This is amazing.

1284
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,482
It looks like a fairy tale.

1285
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,109
A dream.

1286
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,905
-[Virginia] Alice, no running.
-It's so big!

1287
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:52,866
This is nice.

1288
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,200
Yeah.

1289
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,162
-[Victor] Yeah.
-[One] Like you,

1290
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,956
I didn't fit in with the other children.

1291
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,500
Something was wrong with me.

1292
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,295
All the teachers
and the doctors said I was…

1293
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,130
"Broken,"

1294
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:08,924
they said.

1295
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,137
My parents

1296
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:18,850
thought a change of scenery,
a fresh start in Hawkins,

1297
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:21,061
might just cure me.

1298
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,397
It was absurd.

1299
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,653
As if the world
would be any different here.

1300
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,369
[solemn choir singing]

1301
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:40,538
[One] But then…

1302
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,752
to my surprise, our new home provided

1303
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:46,962
a discovery.

1304
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,424
And a newfound sense of purpose.

1305
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,720
I found a nest of black widows
living inside a vent.

1306
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,516
Most people fear spiders.

1307
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,935
They detest them.

1308
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:04,688
And yet,

1309
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,108
I found them endlessly fascinating.

1310
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:10,068
More than that,

1311
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,238
I found a great comfort in them.

1312
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,322
[whoosh]

1313
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:15,991
A kinship.

1314
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,202
Like me,

1315
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,163
they are solitary creatures.

1316
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,375
And deeply misunderstood.

1317
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:27,752
They

1318
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,588
are gods of our world.

1319
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,758
The most important of all predators.

1320
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,970
They immobilize and feed on the weak,

1321
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:40,598
bringing balance and order
to an unstable ecosystem.

1322
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:46,855
But the human world
was disrupting this harmony.

1323
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,732
You see,

1324
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,525
humans

1325
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,695
are a unique type of pest,

1326
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:54,863
multiplying

1327
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,073
and poisoning our world,

1328
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,909
all while enforcing
a structure of their own.

1329
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,705
A deeply unnatural structure.

1330
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,751
Where others saw order,
I saw a straitjacket.

1331
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:08,877
[clock ticking]

1332
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,297
A cruel, oppressive world

1333
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,008
dictated by made-up rules.

1334
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,052
Seconds, minutes,

1335
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:20,013
hours, days, weeks, months,

1336
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,140
years, decades.

1337
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:26,394
Each life a faded, lesser copy
of the one before.

1338
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:29,439
Wake up, eat, work, sleep,

1339
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:31,733
reproduce, and die.

1340
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,903
Everyone

1341
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,280
is just

1342
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:38,823
waiting.

1343
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:40,950
Waiting

1344
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:44,245
for it all to be over.

1345
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:49,667
All while performing
in a silly, terrible play,

1346
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,961
day after day.

1347
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,213
[ticking]

1348
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:54,339
I could not do that.

1349
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:58,802
I could not close off my mind

1350
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,386
and join in the madness.

1351
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,472
I could not pretend.

1352
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,975
And I realized

1353
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,770
I didn't have to.

1354
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,563

[whirring]

1358
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,324
I could make my own rules.

1359
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:25,995
I could restore balance to a broken world.

1360
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,413
A predator…

1361
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:30,625
but for good.

[rabbit struggling]

1365
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,510
As I practiced, I realized

1366
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:43,263
I could do more than I possibly imagined.

1367
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:47,142
I could reach into others,

1368
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,352
into their minds,

1369
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,729
their memories.

01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,193
I became an explorer.

1374
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,489
I saw my parents as they truly were.

1375
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:03,950
To the world,

1376
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:09,956
they presented themselves
as good, normal people.

1377
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,292
But like everything else in this world,

1378
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,793
it was all a lie.

1379
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:16,254
A terrible lie.

1380
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,967
They had done things, Eleven.

1381
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:23,386
Such awful things.

[baby wailing]

1386
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:36,441
I held up a mirror.

1387
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,944
My naive father believed

1388
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,448
it was a demon
cursing them for their sins.

1389
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,284
But my mother somehow knew.

1390
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,205
Knew it was I
who was holding up that mirror,

1391
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:55,460
-and she despised me for it.
-["Dream a Little Dream" playing faintly]

-She called a doctor, an expert.
-[static garbling signal]

1393
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,925
She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,

1394
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:06,012
even though it wasn't I who was broken.
It was them.

1395
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,640
And so she left me with no choice.

1396
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,600
No choice but to act.

1397
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:12,560
To break free.

With each life I took, I grew stronger.

More powerful.

1404
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:31,955
They were becoming a part of me.

1405
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,207
But I was still a child.

[electricity buzzing]

1407
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,710
And I did not yet know my limits.

1408
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,672
And it nearly killed me.

1409
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,645
He was arrested, blamed for the death
of my sister and mother,

1410
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:57,272
just as I had planned.

1411
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,149
But I was far from free.

1412
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,697
I woke up from my coma only to find myself
placed in the care of a doctor,

1413
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,824
the very doctor I had hoped to escape.

1414

Dr. Martin Brenner.

Papa.

1417
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,373
But the truth…

1418
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:20,128
the truth is he did not
just want to study me.

1419
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,256
He wanted more.

1420
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:25,967
He wanted to control.

1421
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:31,347
When Papa finally realized
he could not control me,

1422
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,100
he tried to recreate me.

[tattoo needle buzzing]

1424
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:38,062
He began a program.

1425
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,064
And soon,

1426
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:42,942
others were born.

1427
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,611
You were born.

1428
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,533
And I am so glad you were, Eleven.

1429
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,329
So very glad.

1430
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,629
They're not gone, Eleven.

1431
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,550
They're still with me.

[mysterious music playing]

In here.

1434
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,183
You tricked me.

1435
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,727
Tricked you?

1436
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,396
No, I saved you.

1437
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,775
You are a prisoner here,

1438
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,818
just like me.

1439
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:30,448
To your papa, you are nothing more
than an animal, a monster,

1440
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,283
a lab rat to be tamed.

1441
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,035
But the truth, Eleven,

1442
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:37,705
the truth is just the opposite.

1443
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,126
You are better than they are.

That is why you frighten him.
