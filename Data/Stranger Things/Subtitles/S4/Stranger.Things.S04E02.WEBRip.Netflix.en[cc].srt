41
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,931
We caught a body

Ah!

[Eleven chuckles happily]

57
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,816
[Mike] Oh, careful, careful, careful.
You're squishing your present.

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,234
It's a gift.

59
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,821
I, uh-- I handpicked those
for you in Hawkins.

60
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,617
I know you like yellow, but now
I'm realizing it's too much yellow.

61
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,078
I know you also like purple,
so I got purple as well.

62
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,747
So I kinda did, like,
a 70/30 split kinda thing.

63
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,874
-They're perfect. Thank you.
-Oh. Oh!

64
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,626
Hey. How you doing?

65
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,796
-Hey, Mike.
-How you doing?

66
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,797
Yeah, good, man.

67
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,632
Great. Uh, what's that?

68
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,636
Um, it's nothing.
Just this painting I've been working on.

69
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,804
Cool.

70
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,182
That's a rad shirt, man.

71
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,225
Ocean Pacific?

72
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,727
Oh, hey, Mike.
This is, uh, my friend Argyle.

73
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,187
Oh. Hey.

74
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,941
Oh no, no, no.

75
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,777
No, it's a shitty knockoff. Yeah.

76
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,947
But don't sweat it.
I'll get you the good threads out here.

77
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,242
I heard a lot about your sister.

78
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,327
[Jonathan] Uh.

79
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,456
[Jonathan clears throat]
O-Okay. Um, should we go?

80
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,208
Yeah, this is kinda awkward, man.

81
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,335
Yeah, so awkward.

82
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,463
-[upbeat surfer music playing]
-I really thought it was Ocean Pacific.

83
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,465
[Eleven] I have our whole day planned.

84
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,135
First, El Rodeo for burritos.

85
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,387
What, really? Burritos for breakfast?

86
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,555
Yes. Trust me.

87
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,474
Yeah, no, I… I trust you.
It's just, you know, a little weird.

88
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,102
Then, after burritos,
I want to go to Rink-O-Mania.

89
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,354
Rink-O-Mania, okay.
What's Rink-O-Mania?

90
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,356
It's the most fun place in Lenora.

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,191
They have skating and games.

92
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,527
Sounds awesome.
Are your friends gonna meet us?

93
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,237
Friends? What… What friends?

94
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,738
You know, Stacy and Angela.

95
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,450
-Angela?
-You'll meet them, I promise.

96
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,078
Just not today.
I want today to be about me and you.

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,263
[driver] Yes, sir.

[synth pop music playing]

102
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,442
Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn't
like a cheap, fake laugh either.

103
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,361
It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh.

104
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,780
Of course.
It's my Muppet joke. It's hilarious.

105
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,576
My point is that Vicki laughed
and everything was just like…

106
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,328
-It was perfect.
-But?

107
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,915
But I'm having this problem
where it's like, I should stop talking.

108
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,209
I have said everything I need to say.

109
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,587
But then I guess I get nervous,
and the words keep spilling out,

110
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,089
and it's like my… my brain
is moving faster than my mouth,

111
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,467
or… or rather my… my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm digging this hole for myself,

113
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,513
and I want to stop digging,
I'm trying to stop, but I can't.

114
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,598
And I'm doing it right now, aren't I?

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,225
Yeah, you are.

116
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,309
[Robin exhales]

117
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,853
Oh, I'm hopeless.

118
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,396
[Steve] Eh.

119
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,315
We both are.

120
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,569
If only we could just, like, combine.

121
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,113
Combine?

122
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,573
No, think about it.

123
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,452
I know exactly what I want,
and I've found the girl of my dreams,

124
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,579
but I can't get the courage
to ask her out.

125
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,582
-Mm.
-Meanwhile, you go on a million dates.

126
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,168
-And you have no idea what you want.
-Mm-hmm.

127
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,005
So if we just combined,
all our problems would be solved.

128
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,591
Because, I mean, alone, let's face it…

129
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,842
We totally suck.

130
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,344
Totally and utterly.

131
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,763
[gasps] Ooh, I think
I found our morning movie.

132
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,433
Doctor Zhivago.

133
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,811
Ugh, you know I don't do double VHS.

134
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,312
But it's about doomed love.

135
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,523
-Oh, well, that's relatable.
-Precisely.

136

Also, Julie Christie
is b-b-bonkers hot in this.

Like, seriously,
the most beautiful creature

138
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,781
I have seen in my life.

trailer park in east Roane County.

We don't have a lot of details now,
but we can confirm

141
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,082
that the body of a Hawkins High student
was discovered early this morning.

142
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,501
-Police have not released the name…
-Holy shit.

in the process of notifying the family.

You all right in there, Sinclair?

146
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,519
[Lucas] I'm good.

you're gonna split in two,

but you'll live.

[boy 2] Just hit it, man.

-[boy 2] Yo, just hit it.
-Yeah.

-[boy 2] Piece of shit.
-There you go. See?

…is newly appointed police chief
Calvin Powell,

161
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
who served as deputy under Chief Hopper.

162
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,395
What's this?
I thought we were watching ThunderCats.

164
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,357
What?

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
Yeah, it's on every channel.

166
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,321
As you can see behind me, Chief Powell
and the Hawkins Police Department

167
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,406
are actively investigating the scene…

168
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,200
They say who it is?

00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
No, not yet.

00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,412
Hey, maybe Chrissy
didn't stand you up after all. [chuckles]

171
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,164
Hey, don't say that.

[boy 2] A joke? Come on, someone just died
and you're making a joke out of it?

OD'd on heroin or some shit.

I'll tell ya, you start to believe
all those things they say,

185
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,627
that this town is cursed,

186
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,130

how can so many tragedies
befall a once-peaceful town?

on the police for answers.

00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,061
Is the new chief of police, Powell,
in over his head?

Or is he the very savior this town needs?

You're sure it was Chrissy?

212
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,512
Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing
she was in when I saw her with Eddie.

-No.

Eddie is suspect one now.

on the weekend.

No, I'm not saying-- I'm saying
that we can't presume anything, okay?

I started to think back, and…

I don't know.

He was scared, Dustin.

Really scared.

260
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,294
Maybe he was scared because,

261
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,631
you know, he…
he just killed someone, or…

262
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,383
maybe, um…

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,178

to make him sign it Enzo.

What's he doing in Russia?
He was captured, that's what.

314
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,749
Then he probably met some new friends.

315
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,377
And by friends, I mean the KGB.

316
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,048
And believe me when I tell you,
these people are the worst of the worst.

318

they will break him.

this could be real.

873
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,556
-Lipton?
-Spelled like the tea. 2121 Holland Road.

874
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,975
-That's out by Lovers Lake.
-Middle of nowhere.

875
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,518
It's a perfect place to hide.

876
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,860
[engine revs]

877
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,115
[intense stinger plays]

878
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,243
Um, hi, I'm Nancy Wheeler
from the Hawkins Tiger--

879
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,245
I've talked to enough reporters. Yeah.

880
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,248
[dog barking]

881
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,375
-[Nancy sighs]
-[light synth music playing]

882
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,085
Okay, well…

883
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,754
What about that one? With the flag?

884
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,008
Yeah, I tried them twice.
They were actually quite rude.

885
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,759
I am not doing that again.

886
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,220
I'm telling you, we've talked to everyone.

887
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,472
Nope. Not everyone.

888
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,769
Hi there. Hi.
Did you see something last night, huh?

889
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,272
-[dog whining]
-Oh, you wanna tell us everything?

890
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,024
Nancy, come on. Let's get outta here.

891
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,484
But he's just the cutest little witness.

892
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:29,990
Stay here.

893
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,378
Hi.

894
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,591
Uh, I'm a friend of Max Mayfield's,
over there.

895
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,763
You're Wayne Munson, aren't you?

896
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,431
Eddie's uncle?

897
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,141
That's right.

898
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,395
I heard you found the body.

899
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,982
-The neighbors, they were--
-Like to gossip.

900
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,736
And I'm not interested
in gossiping no more.

901
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,822
Certainly not to a reporter.

902
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,285
What gave me away?

903
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,499
Look, let me level with you, Mr. Munson.

904
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,711
The paper that I write for is… small.

905
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,423
We don't have the staff
to keep up with the big guys.

906
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,552
And I'm just… looking for something,

907
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,180
anything really,
about what happened last night.

908
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,098
Why?

909
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,935
Far as I can tell,
you all have it figured out already.

910
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,354
My nephew's a freak.

911
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,272
He killed that girl.

912
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,524
Ain't that about right?

913
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,693
Let me guess.

914
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,903
You've been speaking to the Hawkins Post?

915
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,489
Chuck Bailey?

916
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,783
Yeah, I used to work with him.

917
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,828
I mean, that guy
doesn't know his ass from his elbow.

918
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,083
Let me tell your side of the story.

919
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,671
[ominous music playing]

920
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,756
[dog barking]

921
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,217
[clock chiming]

922
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,055
[sinister audio distortion]

923
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,141
[clock ticking]

924
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,643
[Wayne] My nephew,

925
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,439
he may look dangerous,

926
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,066
but he didn't do this.

927
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,863
It just… ain't in his nature.

928
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,911
No matter what anyone says,

929
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,164
and they will say things, believe you me.

930
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,749
But…

931
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,127
this… wasn't Eddie.

932
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,923
The man who did this…

933
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,469
who killed that poor girl,

934
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,554
he's…

935
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,265
pure evil.

936
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,684
"Man"?

937
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,439
You think you know
who might've done this?

938
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,110
You ever hear the name

939
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,780
Victor Creel?

940
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,741
[ominous music intensifies]

941
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,916
[Wayne] I guess you're too young,
but back when I was a kid,

942
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,086
everybody knew the name Victor Creel.

943
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,630
He lost his mind.

944
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,299
Killed his whole family.

945
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,884
Kids and wife.

946
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,053
Took their eyes.

947
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,514
Cut 'em right out.

948
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,808
God.

949
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,267
[clock continues chiming]

950
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,561
[Wayne] That poor girl
I found this morning,

951
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,189
same exact thing.

952
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,149
So I'm thinking

953
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,068
maybe he broke out.

954
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,987
Victor Creel is still alive?

955
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,241
They locked him away in Pennhurst Asylum.

956
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,035
Yeah, as far as I know, he's still there.

957
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,121
That is, unless he broke out.

958
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,126
Like that… What's his name?
White mask and killed the babysitters?

959
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,127
[chimes]

960
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,628
[Nancy] Michael Myers?

961
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,381
-[clock ticking]
-[Wayne] Yeah, Michael Myers.

962
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,008
-[ticking]
-You ask me, Victor's like that.

963
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,137
He's a real boogeyman.

964
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,721
[wind rushing]

965
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,351
[dog barks, whimpers]

966
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,982
Um, I'll be right back.

967
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,568
[dog continues barking, whimpering]

968
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,783
Fred?

969
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,911
Fred!

970
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,498
Fred!

971
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,086
Fred?

972
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,631
Fred?

973
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,429
[sinister music swells]

974
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,514
[chiming, ticking]

975
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,610
[muffled weeping]

976
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,878
[flesh distending wetly]

977
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,880
Murderer.

978
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,548
Murderer!

979
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,717
-Murderer. Murderer!
-Murderer.

980
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,385
Murderer.

981
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:48,975
[all chanting] Murderer! Murderer!
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

982
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,229
Murderer! Murderer!

983
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,399
-Murderer!
-[Fred panting]

984
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,196
[clippers buzzing]

985
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,330
[ominous music playing]

986
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,420
[man in Russian] You are no longer men.

987
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,466
You are cogs in a machine.

988
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:25,845
A machine in service
of our great Motherland.

989
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,185
And if you are foolish enough
to attempt escape,

990
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,730
you will be hunted down.

991
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,692
You will be captured.

992
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,028
And then you will suffer greatly

993
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,781
as you perform your final act

994
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,533
for the Motherland.

995
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,995
There will be no second chances.

996
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,083
[in English] Run,

997
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,543
you die.

998
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,337
You hear, American?

999
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,510
[Enzo on tape] Your friend is… stuck.

1000
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,264
But you get me money, I make him unstuck.

1001
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,807
You must trust me.

1002
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,309
[Joyce on tape] How do I trust--

1003
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,770
Joyce, whoever Enzo is,
the answer is not on that tape.

1004
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,106
[woman speaking Russian
indistinctly on tape]

1005
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,734
[in English] You don't hear that?
In the background?

1006
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,694
So he's outside.

1007
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,988
Someone's talking. Not surprising.

1008
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,158
I think she's talking to Enzo.

1009
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,493
Play it again.

1010
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,498
[woman speaking Russian
indistinctly on tape]

1011
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,710
[in English] Can you translate that?

1012
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,546
Uh, I… I can't understand it.
It's too low.

1013
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,676
[dramatic music playing]

1014
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,557
[alarm buzzing]

1015
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,767
[men speaking Russian]

1016
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,898
[metallic clanging]

1017
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,775
[in English] Hey!

1018
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,193
[men chattering in Russian]

1019
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,447
[Enzo in English] But you get me
money, I make him unstuck.

1020
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,449
-Turn it up.
-You must trust me.

1021
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,285
[Joyce on tape] How do I trust you?
I don't know who you are.

1022
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,538
She… She wants to use the phone.

1023
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,332
She's mad at Enzo.

1024
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,583
[speaking Russian]

1025
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,293
-Calls him a "moosor."
-"Moosor"?

1026
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,378
-It's slang.
-For what?

1027
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,007
[Murray] Literally, "moosor" translates
to trash or garbage.

1028
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,051
Like "pig" here, often directed at cops.

1029
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,636
Cops?

1030
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,725
Or guards.

1031
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,024
Hopper's stuck.

1032
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,025
[Hopper grunts]

1033
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:49,322
And Enzo can get him unstuck.

1034
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,368
[Enzo] Yeah.
It's not exactly the Ritz, is it?

1035
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,666
Welcome to your new home, American.

1036
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,630
Enzo's a prison guard.

1037
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,715
Maybe Hopper bribed him.

1038
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,426
Sounds like Jim, doesn't it?

1039
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,136
[chuckles]

1040
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,056
-Joyce, where are you going?
-Bank.

1041
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,725
I'm gonna get Enzo his damn money,

1042
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,728
and we are getting Hopper back.

1043
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,605
Okay.

1044
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,399
[suspenseful music builds to climax]

1045
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,692
El?

1046
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,360
What the hell? Get out!

1047
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,196
-Not there?
-No.

1048
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,575
-Should've told me she was having trouble.
-I didn't know they were gonna be here.

1049
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,453
You knew she was having trouble for a year
and didn't tell me.

1050
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,664
-I didn't know she was lying to you.
-Which is why you were a douche all day?

1051
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,749
-I wasn't being a douche.
-You were.

1052
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,336
You were rolling your eyes, moping.
You were barely talking.

1053
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,548
-You basically sabotaged the whole day.
-She was lying to you.

1054
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,176
Straight to your face,
ever since you got here.

1055
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,804
And I've been a total third wheel all day.
It's been miserable.

1056
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,183
So, sorry if I wasn't… wasn't smiling.

1057
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,310
Yeah, whatever, man.

1058
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,772
Well, what about us?

1059
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,857
What?

1060
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,359
You're mad that I didn't talk to you?

1061
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,655
You made it super clear that you're
not interested in anything I have to say.

1062
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,783
-That's just not true.
-You've called maybe a couple times.

1063
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,535
It's been a year, Mike.

1064
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,954
Meanwhile, El has
a book of letters from you.

1065
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,540
-That's because she's my girlfriend, Will.
-And us?

1066
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,334
We're friends. We're friends.

1067
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,002
We used to be best friends.

[emotional synth music playing]

1069
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,715
Then maybe you should've
reached out more. I don't know.

1070
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,300
But why is this on me?

1071
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,885
Why… Why am I the bad guy?

1072
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,560
[sighs] Let's just…
Let's just find her. Okay?

-Uh-oh. Look who it is.
-[bully 1] She looks upset.

1082
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,425
You ruined my day.

1083
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,137
[chuckles] Oh no. Did we embarrass you
in front of your boyfriend?

1084
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,389
I want you to say sorry to me,

1085
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:05,393
and I want you to tell my boyfriend
that it was just a joke

1086
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,437
and that we are really friends.

1087
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,521
Or what?

1088
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,399
You gonna hurt us
with your mean stare again?

[Angela giggles]

1090
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,364
Sorry you can't cry to teacher today.

1091
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,075
You'll just have to cry
to your daddy instead.

1092
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,828
Oh, wait. Can't do that either.

-[Steve] Is that a foot?
-[Dustin] No, that's a shoe.

Is anyone home?

01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,952
He might be in here.

1142
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,704
So take the tarp off.

1143
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,748

Maybe he heard us. Got spooked and ran.

1148

Don't worry.
Steve will get him with his oar.

I know you think you're being funny,

has nearly died a hundred times,

Right. Yeah.

leave with somebody or…?

-We're not bullshitting you.
-We believe you.

1224
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,596
[exhales]

1225
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,640
[Dustin] Look,

1226
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,892
what I'm about to tell you might be

1227
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,896
a little… difficult to take.

1228
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,357
Okay.

1229
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,818
You know how people say Hawkins is…

1230
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,694
cursed?

1231
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,280
They're not

1232
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:40,366
way off.

1233
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,410
[eerie music playing]

1234
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,870
[Dustin] There's another world.

1235
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,123
[echoing screams]

1236
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,501
[Dustin] A world hidden beneath Hawkins.

1237
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:56,632
Sometimes it bleeds into ours.

1238
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,301
Like ghosts and shit?

1239
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,845
There are some things

1240
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,556
worse than ghosts.

1241
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,474
-[glass shattering]
-[gasps]

1242
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,644
[moaning]

1243
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,646
Help me!

1244
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,356
[moaning continues]

1245
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,485
[yells]

1246
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,155
[groans, grunts]

1247
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,533
[disembodied high-pitched shrieking]

1248
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,661
[panicked gasping]

1249
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,878
No, no, no…

1250
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,339
[Dustin] These monsters
from this other world…

1251
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,842
-Help! Somebody!
-…we thought they were gone.

1252
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,178
-Nancy, please!
-But they've come back before.

1253
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,846
That's why we needed to find you.

1254
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,892
If they're back again, we need to know.

1255
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,352
[sinister voice] Fred.

1256
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,024
[guttural growling]

1257
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,027
[Robin] That night,

1258
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,321
did you see anything?

1259
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,364
Dark particles, maybe?

1260
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,702
[wet squelching]

1261
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:09,079
[creature growling]

1262
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:12,124
It would almost look like dust,
swirling dust.

1263
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,377
No, man, there was nothing
you could see or, uh…

1264
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,255
or touch.

1265
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:21,508
[snarling]

1266
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,178
[whimpering] What do you want?

1267
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,518
I want you

1268
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,980
to join me.

1269
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,900
No, no, no, no.

1270
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,738
[malevolent music playing]

1271
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,453
[eerie choral music playing]

1272
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,877
[Eddie] You know,
I tried to wake her, man.

1273
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,796
She couldn't move.

1274
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:03,550
It was like she… she was
in a trance or something.

1275
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,136
Or under a spell.

1276
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,180
A curse.

1277
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,140
Vecna's curse.

1278
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,811
[bones cracking]

1279
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,199
Who's Vecna?

1280
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:33,080
An undead creature of great power.

1281
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,749
A spell caster.

1282
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,627
A dark wizard.

1283
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:45,384
[snarling]

1284
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:05,863
[creatures cracking, slithering]

1285
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,959
[creature scuttling]

1286
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,216
[eerie music builds]

1287
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,509
[creature squawking]

1288
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,724
[ominous closing music playing]
