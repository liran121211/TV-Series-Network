He was recommended to them by their friend Andr\u00e9 who runs a nice restaurant in town. All in all, he's working out quite well and they decide to have a gourmet evening on Thursdays to try and promote, in Basil's eye at any rate, a better class of client\u00e8le. Kurt gets along well with everyone and seems to have a particular interest in Manuel. When the big day finally arrives, they find themselves with only four guests booked for the dining room - which Sybil puts down to Basil's advert in the local paper saying 'no riff-raff' - and there seems to be something about Kurt that Andr\u00e9 forgot to mention. It's pandemonium as a manic Basil tries to make up for their collective lapses.\u2014garykmcd", "The cream of Torquay society turns out for a special gourmet night at Fawlty Towers. Expectations are high but so, unfortunately, is the chef. In fact, he's incapably drunk! A desperate Basil hurtles round to a friend's restaurant in a car that's about as reliable as his chef. His mission is to find a replacement main course - he's out for a duck.\u2014freddyjasonmyer"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578587", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 2267, "number_of_episodes": 12}
