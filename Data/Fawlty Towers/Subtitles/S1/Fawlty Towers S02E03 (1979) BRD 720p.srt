1
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,040
Oh, it's a lovely part
of the world, isn't it?

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,080
All those beautiful trees and fields
and variety of birds.

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,360
Yes, that's true.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,280
And you can just go there
and get away from it all,

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,040
away from the helter-skelter
of modern life.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,400
Because we all do need our
solitude, don't we?

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,120
Yes, we do.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,320
I mean, nowadays,
it's not easy to find the time to...

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,600
I don't know... Enjoy life.
Because there's always things to do.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,480
It's all so hectic, isn't it?

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,320
All of us just rushing around,
letting things get on top of us.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,400
And quite honestly, what's the point?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,280
- Have you finished?
- Um, yes.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
Thank you.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,800
I think those prawns might be a bit off.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,960
Oh, I don't think so.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,280
They do taste rather funny.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,760
No one else has complained.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, I really do think they're off.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,600
But you've eaten half of them.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
Well, I didn't notice at the start.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,760
You didn't notice at the start?

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,760
Well, it was the sauce. I wasn't sure.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
So you ate half to make sure?

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
My wife thinks they're off.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,920
Did you want another first course?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,080
No, thank you.

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,040
- Are you sure?
- No, really. Just the main...

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,320
We'll just cancel it.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,680
Deduct it from the bill,
is that what you mean?

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,640
- As it's inedible.
- Only half of it is inedible, apparently.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,720
Well, deduct half now, and if my wife

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,160
brings the other half up during the night,

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,280
we'll claim the balance in the morning.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, we'd like our lambs, please.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,280
Three we know have passed on this year,
all in their early 60s, so, I've cut out butter.

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,400
And I tell you...

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,400
Here. Thank you.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,440
No, really... It's all right.

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,000
But it's all gristle!

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,720
No, honestly.

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,680
Oh, there's a nice bit, see?

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,720
Oh, Doris, it's awful!

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,480
No, dear, it's not as bad as that.
I've had worse.

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,680
I don't know how they get away with it.

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,840
Everything all right?

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,480
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
Everything to your satisfaction?

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Oh, yes, thank you.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,600
Thank you.

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Why don't you say something?

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,680
There's no point, is there?

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
We just won't come here again.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,280
Then I'll say something.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,320
It won't do any good.
We're leaving tomorrow.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
Well, I'm going to.

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,560
I mean, we've been sitting here waiting
for nearly half an hour, and it...

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,520
- What's this?
<i>- Sí?</i>

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,200
I ordered the cold meat salad,
and I've been waiting about half an hour for it.

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
- Salad?
- Yes.

61
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
You want change?

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
No, I don't want to change...

63
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,000
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,360
I don't want this.

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,960
You say you no want change.

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,440
I want the salad.

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
Honestly. Go on.

68
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Oh, excuse me.

69
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,120
- Yes?
- We've been waiting for about half an hour now.

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,960
And I gave the waiter our order...

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,720
Oh, him. He's hopeless, isn't he?

72
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,040
I don't wish to complain,
but when he does bring something,

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,960
- he's got it wrong.
- You think I don't know?

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,080
You only have to eat here.
We have to live with it.

75
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,320
I had to pay his fare
all the way from Barcelona,

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
but you can't get the staff, you see.
It's a nightmare.

77
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,840
You were supposed to be complaining to him.

78
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,760
Ah.

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,160
- Sorry about that.
- Thank you.

80
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,680
Extraordinary!

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
- Excuse me.
- What?

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
Look!

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,040
Thank you so much. Enjoy your meal.

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,880
You haven't forgotten our lambs have you?

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,720
No, they're coming!

86
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
Excuse me.

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,520
There's sugar in the salt cellar.

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
Anything else?

89
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
I put it all over the plaice.

90
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,760
All over the place?
What were you doing with it?

91
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,120
All over the plaice!

92
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,720
Polly, would you ask Terry not to finish yet?
We need another one of these. There's sugar in it.

93
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,520
- What a sweet plaice.
- What?

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
I'll have it re-placed.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
Why is there sugar in this salt cellar?
What do you think we pay you for?

96
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,120
My staying power?

97
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,760
- The lambs?
- Yes, I'm getting them, I'm getting them.

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,360
Uh, excuse me.

99
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,040
Do you think we could
cancel our fruit salads?

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,960
Well, it's a little tricky,
chef's just opened the tin.

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,160
- Oh.
- Never mind.

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm sure it'll be very nice, thank you.

103
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
- There we are.
- Oh, thank you.

104
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,840
Yes, I do like really beautiful places...

105
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Busy this evening, isn't it?

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll tell you one of my favourites.

107
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,160
I said, "It's busy this evening."

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm talking to Mr Libson, Basil.

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,960
Good, well, that's a help.

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm sure you can cope.

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,240
Oh, yes, I can cope, dear. Coping's easy.

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,720
Not pureeing your loved ones,
that's the difficult part.

113
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Did you know, Bidiford Bridge
has all different sizes...

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
There's someone at reception.
Should I get it?

115
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
- Yes.
- My turn, is it? Fine.

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Oh, yes. So it is.
Funny it's been my turn for 15 years.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Still, when I'm dead, it'll be your turn, dear.
You'll be it.

118
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,080
Excuse me. There are two lambs here.

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,720
- I'll have them removed if they're bothering you.
- What?

120
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes?

121
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,320
Good evening.

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
Are those ours?

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,120
Not yet. Good evening.

124
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,560
I reserved a room by telephone
this morning. Mr And Mrs Hamilton.

125
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,120
Indeed, yes, I remember it well.
Ah, excellent. Hamilton, yes.

126
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
That's right.

127
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,560
May I welcome you to Fawlty Towers.
I trust your stay

128
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,600
will be an enjoyable and a gracious one.

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
Could we have those now?

130
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
Oh, by all means.

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,040
- Finished with them, have you?
- Absolutely.

132
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,160
Bon appetit.

133
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,480
I recommend the self service here.
It's excellent.

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,040
- That'll be all.
- What?

135
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,480
Your lambs are getting cold, Mr Johnston.

136
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,920
Colder.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
If you'd like them warmed up...

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
Forget it!

139
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,920
You could get your wife to sit on them.

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm so sorry,
but the rubbish we get in here.

141
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,600
If you'd be so very kind as to fill that form out.
Mr And Mrs Hamilton...

142
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,080
Ah, yes, we've put you in room 12
which has a charming panoramic view

143
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,800
overlooking the lawn.

144
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,640
What a drive, huh?

145
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,880
Everything on the wrong side
of the road, the weather...

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,040
What do you get for living in a climate like this,
green stamps? It's terrible!

147
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,640
Sorry about this.

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,280
Took 5 hours from London,
couldn't find the freeway.

149
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
Had to take a little back
street called the M5.

150
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,440
Oh, I'm sorry if it wasn't wide enough for you.
A lot of English cars have steering wheels.

151
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
They do, do they?

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
You wouldn't think there
was enough room for them inside.

153
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
See what I mean?

154
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,080
- What?
- Rub-bish.

155
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
May I introduce my husband?

156
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,720
All the rubbish we get in here.
Look at that.

157
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
- Basil.
- More rubbish, dear.

158
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,320
- What?
- More of that.

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Polly and Manuel are going, Basil.

160
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,120
Just dealing with Mr And Mrs Hamilton, dear.

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

162
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Manuel!
Manuel will bring your bags to your rooms.

163
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
I hope you enjoy your stay and...

164
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,880
Thank you.
Do we need to reserve a table for dinner?

165
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
- Dinner?
- Yes. Problem?

166
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,720
- Well, it is after 9:00.
- So?

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Well, we do actually stop serving at 9:00.

168
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
9:00?

169
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,880
If you could go straight in...

170
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,080
We've driven five hours to get here.
We'd like to freshen up,

171
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
have a drink first, you know?

172
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,960
- You couldn't do that afterwards?
- Do what?

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,280
You mean have our
drink-before-dinner after dinner,

174
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,400
freshen up, and go to bed.

175
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,040
If you could,
it would make things easier for us.

176
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,480
Shall we go to bed now,
would that make it easier for you?

177
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,520
We're a little tired, fella.
We want to clean up, be down in a few minutes.

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,960
Yes, but the chef does
actually stop at 9:00.

179
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,640
9:00! 9:00!

180
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
Humph!

181
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,080
So why does your chef stop at 9:00, huh?
He got something terminal?

182
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
No, but that's when he, in fact, stops.

183
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,880
Uh-huh. Now, look,
we drove from London to stay here, right?

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
Are you telling me that you can't stay open
a few minutes longer

185
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
so that we can eat properly?

186
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Well, we can do you sandwiches.
Ham... Cheese...

187
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,080
- We want something hot.
- Toasted sandwiches?

188
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,600
- You're joking?
- Not really.

189
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,880
"Not really." Can you believe this?
What the hell's wrong with this country?

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,240
Can't get a drink after 3:00, can't eat after 9:00!
Is the war still on?

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
No, but it's the staff, you see.

192
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,400
- We have to get the staff...
- How much?

193
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
How much of this Mickey Mouse money
do you want

194
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,440
to keep the chef on for half an hour?
One, two, three... £20, huh?

195
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,800
That enough?

196
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,280
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

197
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,040
Uh, excuse me. <i>Perdón! Perdón!</i>
Excuse me, please!

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,880
This way! <i>Por aquí.</i> This way, please.

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Gosh, that does look
absolutely marvellous, doesn't it?

200
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,240
Oh, um, Terry, I almost forgot.
Some guests have just arrived,

201
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,560
right at the last moment, as usual.
I'm sorry, but this puts us out

202
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,000
just as much as it puts you out.

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
It don't put me out, Mr Fawlty.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
No, but they want some dinner,

205
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
and they insist first
on scraping off some of the filth

206
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
that somehow got caked to them
cruising down the M5.

207
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,320
Well, I got my class tonight, Mr Fawlty.

208
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,760
- I'm ready, Terry!
- Right-o, Poll.

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,480
No! Wait!
Did I say I will make it up to you?

210
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,840
- Out of my own pocket.
- It's not the money, Mr Fawlty.

211
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,240
My karate means a lot to me.

212
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,840
Half an hour's overtime and a taxi.

213
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,640
Mr Fawlty, if I miss a week,
next week I don't get out in one piece.

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,800
An hour's overtime.

215
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,240
Sorry, Mr Fawlty.

216
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,600
What am I going to say to them?

217
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
Two hours.

218
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,320
- What?
- Two hours overtime.

219
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
I thought you said it wasn't the money.

220
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,040
It ain't, but I can't think
what to say to your guests.

221
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,640
Terry, I'd pay you two hours overtime
if I could afford it!

222
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
Sorry, Mr Fawlty.

223
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,880
An hour and a half.

224
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
- Cash?
- Cash.

225
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,680
An hour and a half, but I go at half past 9:00,
then I still get some of me class, right?

226
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
And I do the washing up?

227
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,080
You know how it is, Mr Fawlty.

228
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Yes, I pay you for an hour and a half,
you clear off after half an hour, that's how it is.

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,400
That's socialism.

230
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,400
Oh, no, that's the free market.

231
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,440
Come on, Terry.
Musn't keep the lady waiting.

232
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,960
- The lady?
- From Finland, Mr Fawlty, very pretty.

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,520
Tall, blonde...

234
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,200
This Finnish floozy
is your karate teacher, is she?

235
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, it's a sort of karate, ain't it?

236
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
- Right, give me that.
- What?

237
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,840
I pay you overtime to miss a class,
not to keep some bit of crumpet hanging around.

238
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,400
No, it's all right! I'm washing up,
I'll do the cooking, too.

239
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Go off and enjoy yourself. Don't worry about me.
Go have a good time. I'll be all right.

240
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Go and have a bit of fun with a Finn!

241
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,200
Come on, Manuel!

242
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,640
Where are you? Polly? Where...
Hey, wait for me!

243
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
If you'd care to sit over there.

244
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
Thank you.

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
Good evening.

246
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
- Evening.
- Good evening.

247
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,600
Is your room to your liking?

248
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,720
- Yes, it's very nice.
- Very nice, thank you.

249
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Oh, good.

250
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,360
I'll get you tonight's menu.

251
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
Oh, would you care for a drink
before your meal?

252
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,960
Scotch and water and a screwdriver, please.

253
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,360
And for you, madam?

254
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,760
The screwdiver's for me.

255
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,680
I see. Um, would you like it now,
or after the meal?

256
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
Now, please.

257
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,240
There's nothing I can put right?

258
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,360
- What?
- Absolutely.

259
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
So it's one scotch, and a screwdriver.

260
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,040
I think I'll join you.
Make that two screwdrivers, would you?

261
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,440
You'd like a screwdriver, as well?

262
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,920
You got it.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,760
So, it's one scotch,
and you each need a screwdriver.

264
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,000
No. Forget the scotch. Two screwdrivers.

265
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
I understand,
and you'll leave the drinks.

266
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,400
- What?
- Nothing to drink.

267
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,800
What do you mean, "Nothing to drink"?

268
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,240
Well, you can't drink the
screwdrivers, can you?

269
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,480
What else do you suggest
that we do with them?

270
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,400
Vodka and orange juice.

271
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,520
Oh, certainly, madam.

272
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,920
Make that two and forget
about the screwdrivers.

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
- You sure?
- We can manage without them.

274
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
As you wish.

275
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,040
"Relax in the carefree atmosphere
of old English charm..."

276
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Shh!

277
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
- "When you're there..."
- Shh!

278
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Hope we're not intruding
on your dinner hour.

279
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, not at all, no.

280
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
You're American.

281
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
That's right.

282
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,600
Where are you from?

283
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,040
- California.
- How lovely.

284
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,440
You're English, though.

285
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,600
Yes, but I've been over there 10 years now.

286
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,960
10 years. Do you ever get homesick?

287
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,840
Oh, yes, but I love it there.
The climate's so wonderful.

288
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,840
You can swim and sunbathe,
and then after lunch,

289
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,720
drive up into the mountains and ski.

290
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
How wonderful.

291
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,560
I like England and the English people,
but I sure couldn't take this climate.

292
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Harry finds it too gloomy.

293
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Oh, I don't find it too gloomy.
Do you, Sybil?

294
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
Yes, I do, Basil.

295
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,000
My wife finds it too gloomy.
I find it rather bracing.

296
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,120
What do you find bracing,
the damp, the drizzle, the fog?

297
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,800
It's not always like this. It changes.

298
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,840
My husband's like the climate. He changes.

299
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,280
This morning he went on for two hours
about the bloody weather.

300
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,840
Yes, it has been unusually damp
this week, in fact,

301
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,200
but normally we're rather spoiled down here
on the English Riviera.

302
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,760
Mr And Mrs Hamilton were
telling me about California.

303
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,960
You can swim in the morning,
and then in the afternoon,

304
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,760
you can drive up into
the mountains and ski.

305
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,280
Must be rather tiring.

306
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,920
Well, one has a choice.

307
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,400
I don't think it would suit me. I like it down here.
It's very mild all year round.

308
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,440
We have palm trees here in Torquay.
Do you have palm trees in California?

309
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,440
Burt Lancaster had one, they say.
But I don't believe them.

310
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
What the hell is that?

311
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,320
Vodka and orange juice.

312
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,320
- Orange juice?
- I'm afraid it's not fresh.

313
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760
- Isn't it?
- No.

314
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
We've just opened the bottle.

315
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,320
Fresh means it comes out
of an orange, not a bottle.

316
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,320
You'd like freshly squeezed orange juice.

317
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,680
As opposed to freshly
unscrewed orange juice.

318
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,400
Leave it to me.
I'll get chef onto it straightaway.

319
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
Sorry about that. A lot of English people

320
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
are used to the flavour of the bottle.

321
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
It's all right. It's just that back home,
fresh orange juice comes like running water.

322
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,640
Does it really?

323
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,200
It's so good for your skin, isn't it?

324
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,160
I'd love to go to California someday.
Looks so exciting.

325
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,840
<i>Never Love a Stranger.</i> Do you like it?

326
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,000
I love all Harold Robbins.
I've read this one three times.

327
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,320
<i>The Pirates</i> is his best.
I read them when Harry's away.

328
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,520
I don't have the time when he's home.

329
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,920
Who needs Harold Robbins
when you got the real thing?

330
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,440
How long have you been married, Mrs Fawlty?

331
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,640
Oh, since 1485.

332
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,080
There we are. Fresh orange juice.

333
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,520
Thank you.

334
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,400
But seriously, though,
his men are all so interesting.

335
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,360
Ruthless and sexy and powerful.

336
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,720
Who's this then, dear?
Proust? E.M. Forster?

337
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,120
- Harold Robbins.
- Yes, of course.

338
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,800
My wife likes Harold Robbins.

339
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,960
After a hard day slaving under the hair dryer,
she needs to unwind with a few aimless thrills.

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
Basil!

341
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,400
Have you ever read any?
It really is the most awful American...

342
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Well, not American... Transatlantic Tripe.
A sort of pornographic muzak.

343
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Still, it keeps my wife off the streets.

344
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,440
We both like him.

345
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh, oh, R... Robbins?

346
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,640
- What?
- Harold Robbins?

347
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,120
I thought you meant that awful man...
What's his name? Ah... Harold Robinson!

348
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Have you read any Harold Robinson?
Ah! Painful!

349
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,520
How about Waldorf salad?

350
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,720
Was that one? You're absolutely right.
That was a shocker!

351
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
Could you make me a Waldorf salad?

352
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Waldorf salad.

353
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,600
I think we're just out of Waldorfs.

354
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,520
- I don't believe this.
- It's not very well known here, Harry.

355
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
May I recommend tonight...

356
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm sure your chef knows
how to fix me a Waldorf salad.

357
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,360
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

358
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
- He's a chef, isn't he?
- You wouldn't prefer...

359
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,720
Just go see if he knows how
to fix me a Waldorf salad!

360
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,680
Of course, yes.

361
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
He's not positive... He's almost got it.

362
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,760
It's lettuce and tomato...

363
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,720
No, no! It's celery,
apples, walnuts, grapes!

364
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,040
In a mayonnaise sauce.

365
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,920
Incidentally, he did ask me to say

366
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,840
that he does especially recommend
the pate tonight.

367
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,880
- I don't want pate.
- Or the grapefruit.

368
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,040
The grapefruit, how's it done?

369
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,720
Well, it's halved, with a cherry in the...

370
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,480
- Centre.
- Look! I haven't paid you £20

371
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,600
to have some guy cut a grapefruit in half
and stick a cherry in the centre!

372
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,160
- Exactly.
- I want a Waldorf salad!

373
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,680
Absolutely. One Waldorf salad.

374
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,120
And a green salad for me.

375
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,400
One green salad.
And if we can't manage the Waldorf salad?

376
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,120
I want a Waldorf salad! And to follow,
a couple of filet mignons!

377
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,960
- Steaks!
- Steaks! Done rare! Not out of a bottle!

378
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,640
Not out of a bottle, right.

379
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,200
Would you care to see the wine list?

380
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Thank you.

381
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,040
May I ask, did you say you paid £20?

382
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,440
Yes. But it's, uh... Not the money.

383
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
My wife and I, we wanted dinner and...

384
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,120
This can't be right.
There's no reason chef couldn't stay.

385
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm awfully sorry. He's forgotten already.
Uh, walnuts, cheese...

386
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,800
No! No cheese!

387
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,640
It's celery, apples, walnuts, grapes!
In mayonnaise!

388
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,200
Right! Now, come on!

389
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,720
Uh...

390
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,040
Would you excuse me one moment?

391
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,760
Uh, excuse me.
Bottle of Volnay, please.

392
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,480
Of course. Thank you.

393
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,760
What's this about £20, Basil?

394
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
There's no celery! Would you believe it?

395
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,360
I'll find the celery. What about this £20?

396
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,800
He gave me £20 to keep the kitchens open...
Where does he put things?

397
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
- If you'd just look.
- I have looked!

398
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,280
There's no celery, there's no grapes.

399
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Walnuts! That's a laugh! Easier to find a packet
of sliced hippopotamus in suitcase sauce

400
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,520
than a walnut in this bloody kitchen!

401
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,040
We've got apples.

402
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,880
We'll have an apple party.
Everybody brings an apple

403
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,160
and stuffs it down somebody's throat!

404
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,280
Basil, I will find everything.
Just get a bottle of Volnay.

405
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,400
What's a Waldorf, anyway?
A walnut that's gone off?

406
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,960
It's the hotel, Basil.
The Waldorf Hotel in New York.

407
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,000
Wait! Wait.

408
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,520
Basil!

409
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,800
Everything all right?

410
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes, thank you.

411
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,920
- Never been better.
- Oh, good. And by the way, I wonder,

412
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,720
have you by any chance tried a Ritz salad?

413
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
- Ritz salad?
- It's a traditional Olde English thing.

414
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,840
It's apples, grapefruit,
and potatoes in a mayonnaise sauce.

415
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,720
No, I don't think I ever tried that.
Don't think I ever will, either.

416
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,480
That's probably pretty sound.
About this Waldorf salad of yours...

417
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
- Yes?
- Been having a bit of a tete-a-tete with chef.

418
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,800
We're all right on the apples,
absolutely no problem with them at all.

419
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
Now, on the celery front, uh...
Perhaps I should explain,

420
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
we normally get our celery
delivered on a Wednesday,

421
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,360
along with our cabbages,
onions, walnuts, grapes...

422
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,360
- But this week, the driver...
- Mr Fawlty...

423
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,760
- He was putting...
- I'm not interested.

424
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,200
He slipped forward and the van door
caught his arm and may have fractured it.

425
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
You don't have it.

426
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,440
We'll know tomorrow if they'll have to operate,
and to cut a long story short,

427
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,920
we don't have any, no.

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,120
But, um...

429
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
So, makes you think how lucky you are!

430
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,320
Doesn't it? I mean, here we all are,
with all our limbs functioning.

431
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,360
If you've got your
health, what else matters?

432
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
What a bunch of crap!

433
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh, do you think so? I always feel...

434
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
What the hell's going on here?

435
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,520
It says hotel outside!
Now, is this a hotel or isn't it?

436
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,800
Well, within reason.

437
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,120
You know something, fella?

438
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,080
If this was back in the states,
I wouldn't board my dog here.

439
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,520
Fussy is he? Poodle?

440
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,840
Poodle?

441
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm not getting through to you, am I?

442
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,760
I stay in hotels all over the world.

443
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,680
This is the first time I've had to bribe
a chef to cook me a meal,

444
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,440
then find out he doesn't even have
the Goddamn ingredients!

445
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
Holy cow, can't you see
what a crummy dump this is?

446
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,440
You listening to this, are you...

447
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,640
I'm talking to you!

448
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,120
- Terry, you can get out...
- Shut up and listen to me!

449
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,960
This ain't good enough!

450
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,520
Then you give me some half-assed story
about some delivery guy busting his arm.

451
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Look, Fawlty, if your chef couldn't find
the ingredients from that guy,

452
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
why didn't he get them from somebody else?

453
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,920
- Exactly. Hopeless.
- What?

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,440
- Completely hopeless.
- Right.

455
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
You're the manager, aren't you?
You're responsible.

456
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,520
- So what are you going to do about it?
- I'll have a word with him.

457
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,680
Have a word with him?
Man, you gotta tell him, lay it on the line!

458
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,840
Lay it on the line.

459
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,040
Say if he doesn't get on the ball,
you're gonna bust his ass!

460
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
- Bust his?
- I'll tell him!

461
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
No, I'll tell him! Leave it to me!

462
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,960
I've got it. I've got it.

463
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,760
- Bust his?
- Ass!

464
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, that!

465
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,400
And two green salads.

466
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,640
Here we are.

467
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,080
One green salad, and one Waldorf salad.

468
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,680
- But I thought, uh...
- Yes?

469
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,600
Would you excuse me one moment?

470
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,640
It's not good enough!
Do you hear me? Not good enough!

471
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,840
Mr Robinson hurt his arm!

472
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,800
That's a bunch of arse!

473
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
It's fine.

474
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,160
Why can't you make a Waldorf salad?

475
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,560
- Waldorf salad?
- Yeah.

476
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,760
Tomorrow you get the ingredients
for a Waldorf salad,

477
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,760
or I will break your bottom!

478
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Oh, no! You can't!

479
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,800
No, I mean it!

480
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,760
Everything all right?

481
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
- Yes, thank you.
- You're sure there's nothing...

482
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
- No, it's very good.
- Oh, good.

483
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
Oh, um...

484
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,280
Your chef.
Has he been with you long?

485
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,680
About six months.
He used to work at Dorchester.

486
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,080
At the Dorchester?

487
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,520
No. In Dorchester, about 14 miles away.

488
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
Here we are. Two green salads.

489
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,240
- Basil.
- Yes, dear?

490
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
Mr Hamilton has his Waldorf salad, dear.

491
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,640
No, chef couldn't make it.
Didn't have the ingredients.

492
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,800
I just smashed his backside about it.

493
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,800
But there it is.

494
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
What?

495
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,520
There's the Waldorf salad.

496
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
- Chef found the ingredients.
- It's fine.

497
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Well, if he found the ingredients,
why didn't he tell me?

498
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,280
Has he been struck dumb?
Somebody torn his tongue out

499
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,840
- in the last two minutes?
- Maybe Robinson's arm got better?

500
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,240
Ha ha! Ha ha!

501
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,720
I'm sorry about this.

502
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,840
It's all right.

503
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,280
- No, it isn't.
- It doesn't matter.

504
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,680
- It matters to me.
- I got my Waldorf salad.

505
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,160
- Excuse me.
- For God's sake!

506
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,880
- Chef, what's this?
- Bring that back!

507
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm so sorry. I'll get it back for you.

508
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,600
Sorry? I'll give you sorry!

509
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,320
- Get off your knees!
- Basil!

510
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,240
I haven't finished with chef yet, Sybil.

511
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,040
Why didn't you tell me you found them,
you stupid cow?

512
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Eh, chef? I haven't finished!
You can have it in a...

513
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,480
Sorry about that little confusion.

514
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,720
Chef hasn't been with us very long.
We've just reorganised the kitchen.

515
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,320
Thank you.

516
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,960
Oh, you haven't got your wine yet.

517
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,680
Basil! Won't be a moment! Basil!

518
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,160
Yes, my sweet?

519
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,160
Mr And Mrs Hamilton haven't got their wine.

520
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,920
- Fine.
- And, Basil?

521
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
Has chef put the steaks on yet?

522
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,840
I'll tell him.

523
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,920
Is your husband all right?

524
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Oh, yes. He's just had rather a long day.

525
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,560
There's just the two of you here, right?

526
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,960
We haven't had a proper
holiday for eight years.

527
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,120
Eight years?

528
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,120
Yes. I have to get away occasionally
just for a few hours.

529
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Even if it's just down to the hairdresser,
or a round of golf,

530
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,880
or a bridge evening with some of the girls,
drive in the country sometimes,

531
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,200
just on my own.

532
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,560
Pop down to Cornwall for the day sometimes.
It's beautiful there.

533
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,720
Your Volnay, sir.

534
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,240
You must visit Cornwall while you're here.

535
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,360
Incidentally, I've been talking to chef,
and we've sorted out what happened.

536
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,960
Um, apparently he thought that he'd, uh...

537
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,600
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Got two orders for waldorf salad,

538
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,320
and in fact, he had the ingredients,
until he made one,

539
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,760
he realised that he didn't have enough
for the second.

540
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
Don't let it bother you.

541
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,800
This will explain everything.

542
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,680
- What's that?
- A letter.

543
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,960
- A letter?
- A letter from the chef.

544
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,400
It explains everything.

545
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,560
Letter from the chef.

546
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,160
He wanted to apologise personally,
but I didn't want him wasting your time...

547
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,640
Look, forget about it, will you?

548
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,320
- I'll read it for you.
- I want my steak!

549
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,560
Won't be long. Um, "Dear Mr And Mrs Hamilton,
I hope you are well.

550
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,880
"This is just a brief note to say
that I take full responsibility

551
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,640
"for the dreadful mess-ups tonight.

552
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,480
"If I'd only listened to Mr Fawlty,
none of this fiasco would have occurred.

553
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,480
"I'd like to tell you
that such a cock-up

554
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,160
"has never occurred in my career before,
and now everything has been sorted out,

555
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,160
"I'll be back to my very best form."

556
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
Signed, Terr... Aw...

557
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,120
What are you doing?
What do you mean, you've burned it?

558
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,680
- I've had just about enough of this.
- Harry...

559
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,320
How could you forget about them?

560
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
I was making another Waldorf.

561
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
Making another Waldorf salad?

562
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,920
What are you making
another Waldorf salad for?

563
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Careful, I'm only a little fella!

564
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,360
What do you think
Mr And Mrs Hamilton must think...

565
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,200
Mr Hamilton, may I introduce Terry...

566
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,320
Where did he go?

567
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,280
Where's he gone? Did you see him?

568
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,320
Maybe he went to get something to eat.

569
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,680
- Come on, honey.
- What is it, Harry?

570
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
- We're leaving.
- What's happened?

571
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,680
I'll tell you later.

572
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,480
Yes, your steak will be ready in a moment.

573
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,600
He must have heard you coming,
panicked, and run out into the yard.

574
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,800
You know, after all the problems. We've...

575
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,120
Humph!

576
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
- How big a Butterball do you take me for?
- Butterball...

577
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,000
You think I don't know
what was going on out there?

578
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,640
Oh, bit of a debacle.

579
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm talking about you taking £20 off me
to keep the chef on, letting him go,

580
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,480
cooking the meal yourself,
then pretending he's still out there!

581
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
- Oh, that.
- Yes, that!

582
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,160
What have you got to say about it?

583
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,360
- Good evening.
- I asked you a question.

584
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm sorry that your meal
has not been satisfactory this evening.

585
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,640
Huh! What I'm suggesting is that this
place is the crummiest, shoddiest,

586
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,440
worst-run hotel in the
whole of Western Europe!

587
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,880
No! No! I won't have that!

588
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,280
There's a place in Eastbourne...
What's its name?

589
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,560
And that you are the British tourist
board's answer to Donald Duck!

590
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,080
Look, I know things have
gone wrong this evening,

591
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,840
but we've had thousands
of satisfied customers...

592
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,760
All right, let's ask them, huh?

593
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,240
- What?
- Let's ask them.

594
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,000
Are you all satisfied? Are you satisfied?

595
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,920
Major, are you satisfied?
You've been here seven years.

596
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,240
Oh, yes, I am...

597
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,640
- Ladies, are you satisfied?
- Yes, thank you, Mr Fawlty.

598
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,160
- Thank you for asking.
- Not at all.

599
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,440
- Mr Arrad, are you satisfied?
- Well, yes.

600
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,200
- Mrs Gurke, you?
- Oh, yes.

601
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,120
You see? Satisfied customers.

602
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,200
If this little hotel is not to your taste,
then you are free to say so, that is your privilege.

603
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,240
And I shall of course refund your money.
I know how important it is to you Americans.

604
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,200
But you must remember that here in Britain,
there are things we value more,

605
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,640
things that perhaps in America
you've forgotten about,

606
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
but which to we British
are far, far more important...

607
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,200
- I'm not satisfied.
- Wh... What?

608
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm not satisfied!

609
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
No, we're not satisfied!

610
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,800
Well, people like you never are, are you?

611
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,360
What?

612
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,920
There's nothing I could do
to please a pair like you

613
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,560
short of putting straw in the rooms.

614
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,600
You're the rudest man I've ever met!

615
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
I haven't started yet.

616
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,040
And you're not going to.
You'll stand here nice and quiet

617
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,280
while these people say
if they're satisfied.

618
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
Move off that spot and I bust your ass!

619
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,240
- Everything's bottoms, isn't it?
- Yes, sir?

620
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,080
I think this is probably the worst hotel
we've ever stayed in.

621
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,560
The service here is an absolute disgrace!

622
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,960
- I agree.
- You do?

623
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,720
Yes. We had to wait nearly half an hour
for our main course,

624
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
and when it arrived, it was wrong.

625
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,200
I complained, but he fobbed me
off with some rubbish about...

626
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,400
My prawns were off.
When I told him, there was an argument.

627
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,360
And her meat was awfully poor.

628
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,000
And I asked you to fix my radiator three times,
and nothing's been done!

629
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,880
Satisfied customers, huh?

630
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,480
Hot dog.

631
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,600
This is... typical.

632
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,520
Absolutely typical.

633
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,000
The kind of...

634
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,800
Arse!

635
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,040
I've had to put up with from you people!

636
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,400
You ponce in here expecting to
be hand-waited on hand and foot!

637
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,600
I'm trying to run a hotel here!

638
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,120
Have you any idea
of how much there is to do?

639
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,280
Do you ever think of that?

640
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,640
Of course not! You're too busy
sticking your noses into every corner,

641
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,560
poking about for things
to complain about, aren't you?

642
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,480
Well, let me tell you something!

643
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,240
This is exactly how Nazi Germany started!

644
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,840
A lot of layabouts with nothing
better to do than to cause trouble!

645
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,560
I've had 15 years of pandering to the likes of you,
and I've had enough! I've had it!

646
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,360
Come on, pack your bags and get out!

647
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,000
- They're packed.
- Order 10 taxis, will you? I'll pay for 'em.

648
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,920
- Come on!
- What?

649
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,040
Everybody out! Come on, upstairs!

650
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Pack your bags! Adios! Out!

651
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,160
- But it's raining!
- You should've thought of that before.

652
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,640
Too late now! Come on, out!
<i>Raus, raus, raus!</i>

653
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,480
Basil! What are you doing?

654
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,160
Well, let me explain, my little work horse.

655
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,360
The guests and I had a bit of a chin wag.
And the upshot is, they're off.

656
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,920
- Off?
- Let me put it either they go, or I go.

657
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,800
Right! Right! Come on, everybody!
My wife's had a better idea.

658
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,560
I'm going instead! Well, goodbye, dear.
It's been an interesting 15 years,

659
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,120
but all good things must come to an end.

660
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,360
I hope you enjoy your new work here,
helping to run a hotel.

661
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,840
Goodbye, Major. Goodbye, ladies.

662
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,320
Give my regards to Polly and Manuel.
Bye, dear.

663
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,080
You've forgotten your keys, Basil.

664
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,440
So I have, dear. Goodbye, the rest of you.

665
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,880
I hope you enjoy your stay here.

666
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,640
Any complaints.
Don't hesitate to tell my wife.

667
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,080
Any hour of the day or night, just shout.

668
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,680
- Bye!
- Bye.

669
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,200
10 minutes? That'll be fine.

670
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,600
Hello, dear, I'm back.

671
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
What do you want, Basil?

672
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,600
A room, please.
Number 12 is free, I think.

673
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,320
Now, I'd like breakfast in bed
at half past 10:00 in the morning.

674
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,360
That's eggs, bacon, sausage, and tomato
with a Waldorf salad.

675
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,520
All washed down
with lashings of hot screwdriver...
