1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,880
- Number 17, please.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,840
Goodbye. Thank you so much.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
Hello, Fawlty Towers.

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
Oh, hello, Mr Hawkins.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
- I've arranged your car for 2:00.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,880
Well, you did say today, Mr Hawkins.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,840
- You do accept cheques?
- With a banker's card, yes.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,720
Well, we have to cancel the order then.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,600
Yes. No, no, 5:00 will be fine.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,320
Goodbye.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Polly, Brenda can't start till Monday.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,040
Would you mind doing
the rooms until then?

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,840
- Oh, no. I could do with the money.
- Oh, good.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
There you are.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Thank you, Mr Yardley.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Oh, hello. Can I help you?

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,960
- Yes...
- Girl,

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,400
would you give me change for this, please?

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,800
- Yes, Mr Thurston...
- What?

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,400
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,520
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,480
But I have a taxi driver waiting.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,920
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind
if you just gave me change.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,280
- Do you?
- No, no. Go ahead.

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
- There you are.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,040
Can you tell me
how to get to Glendower Street?

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,280
Now, I've booked a room and bath
with a sea view for three nights.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
- Glendower Street?
- Yes.

30
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,480
You haven't finished with me.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Missus...

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Mrs Richards.
Mrs Alice Richards.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,200
Mrs Richards,
Mr Thurston.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
Mr Thurston, Mrs Richards.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,240
Mr Thurston is the gentleman
I'm attending to at the moment.

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,400
What?

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Mr Thurston is
the gentleman I'm attending...

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
Don't shout. I'm not deaf.

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Mr Thurston was here before
you, Mrs Richards.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
But you were serving me!

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,080
I gave you change,
but I hadn't finished dealing with him.

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,280
Now, Glendower Street...

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,080
Isn't there anyone else in attendance?

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,760
Really, this is the most appalling service!

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,160
What a good idea!

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,160
Manuel, could you lend Mrs Richards

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,840
your assistance in connection
with her reservation?

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,640
Now...

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,800
I've reserved a very quiet room

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,000
with a bath and a sea view.

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,240
I specifically asked for a sea view
in my written confirmation,

52
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,960
so please make sure I have it.

53
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,080
<i>Qué?</i>

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,800
- What?
<i>- Qué?</i>

55
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
- K?
<i>- Sí.</i>

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,440
C?

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
KC?

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,040
KC? What are you trying to say?

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,000
No, no, no, no.
<i>Qué:</i> What.

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
K-watt?

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,160
<i>Sí. Qué...</i> What.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,640
- C.K. Watt?
- Yes!

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,960
Who is C.K. Watt?

64
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
<i>Qué?</i>

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,760
Is he the manager, Mr Watt?

66
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,320
- Manager!
- He is?

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
Ah, Mr Fawlty!

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
- What?
- Fawlty!

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,760
What are you talking about,
you silly little man?

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,000
What is going on here?

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
I ask him for my room,
and he tells me

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
the manager's a Mr Watt, aged 40.

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,680
No. No, no. Fawlty.

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
"Faulty"? What's wrong with him?

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,640
It's all right, Mrs Richards.
He's from Barcelona.

76
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,600
The manager's from Barcelona?

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
No, no, no. He's from Swanage.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,320
- And you're in 22.
- What?

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
You're in room 22.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Manuel, take these cases
up to 22, will you?

81
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Very nice stay, Mr Fawlty.

82
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,040
Ah, glad you enjoyed it.

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,000
Polly, would you get Mr Firkin's
bill, please?

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,320
When will we see you again?

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,640
Oh, not for a few weeks.

86
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,840
You're not by any chance
a betting man, Mr Fawlty?

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,400
Er... Well, I used to be.

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
Only there's a very nice little filly
running at Exeter this afternoon.

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,640
- Really?
- Dragonfly.

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Ah.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
- Dragonfly?
- Yeah.

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,840
It's well worth a flutter,
but pay the tax on it before...

93
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,640
Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay.

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Very nice.

95
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Hope to see you again before long.

96
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
- There you are.
- Thank you.

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Goodbye, Mrs Fawlty.

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Goodbye, Mr Firkin.

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
A satisfied customer.
We should have him stuffed.

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Oh, Mr Fawlty,
3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly.

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,280
Right?

102
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,760
Yes, good luck!
Jolly...jolly good luck with it.

103
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Morning, Major.

104
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,760
Good morning, Fawlty.

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,720
Yes, dear?

106
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,280
What was that about
the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?

107
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,560
Oh, some horse
he's gonna bet on, I expect.

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,480
You're looking very spruce
this morning, Major.

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
- St. George's Day, old boy.
- Really?

110
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,000
Got a horse, have you?
What's his name?

111
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,600
Did you catch it, dear?

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
Dragonfly, Major.

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?
- No, no, no, no, no.

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,080
No, Basil doesn't bet any more, Major.
Do you, dear?

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,520
No, I don't, dear, no.

116
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,320
That particular avenue of pleasure
has been closed off for me.

117
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,960
And we don't want it
opened up again, do we, Basil?

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,880
No, you don't, dear. No.

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
The great warning-off
of May 8th, yes.

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
Good old Saint George, eh, Major?

121
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,360
Well, he killed a hideous
fire-breathing old dragon, didn't he?

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,680
Ran it through with a lance, I believe.

123
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,080
Mr Fawlty! Mr Fawlty!

124
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,920
Is Missus...room no like.

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She want speak to you. Is problem.

126
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,360
Ever see my wife making toast, Polly?

127
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,720
Why... Why'd he kill it anyway, Fawlty?

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,520
I don't know, Major.
Better than marrying it.

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,640
Marrying it?

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
But he didn't have to kill
it, though, did he?

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,200
I mean, he could've, uh,
just not turned up at the church.

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,120
Good morning, madam.
Can I help you?

133
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,520
- Are you the manager?
- I am the owner, madam.

134
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
- What?
- I am the owner.

135
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,440
I want to speak to the manager.

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,240
- I am the manager, too.
- What?

137
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I am the manager as well.

138
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,760
Manager. He manager.

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Oh, you're Watt.

140
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm the manager!

141
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,440
- What?
- I'm the manager!

142
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,960
Yes, I know. You've just told me.
What's the matter with you?

143
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,200
Now, listen to me.
I booked a room with a bath.

144
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,880
When I book a room with a bath,
I expect to get a bath.

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
You've got a bath.

146
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm not paying £7.20p per night, plus V.A.T.,
for a room without a bath!

147
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,280
Here is your bath.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,080
You call that a bath?
It's not big enough to drown a mouse.

149
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,960
It's disgraceful!

150
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,800
I wish you were a mouse. I'd show you.

151
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,160
And another thing.

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,360
I asked for a room with a view.

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,000
Deaf, mad, and blind.

154
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,160
This is the view as far
as I can remember, madam.

155
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Yes, yes, this is it.

156
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,240
When I pay for a view,
I expect something more interesting than that.

157
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,840
That is Torquay, madam.

158
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,960
That is not good enough.

159
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, may I ask what you
were expecting to see

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window?

161
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
Sydney Opera House, perhaps?

162
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?

163
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,760
Herds of wildebeest
sweeping majestically...

164
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
Don't be silly.

165
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,800
I expect to be able to see the sea.

166
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,080
You can see the sea.

167
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,600
It's over there between
the land and the sky.

168
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
I need a telescope to see that.

169
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Well, may I suggest
that you consider moving

170
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,560
to a hotel closer to the sea?

171
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Or preferably in it?

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
Right.

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Now, listen to me.
I'm not satisfied, but I've decided to stay here.

174
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,000
However, I shall expect a reduction.

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Why, because Krakatoa's
not erupting at the moment?

176
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,000
Because the room is cold,
the bath is too small, the view is invisible,

177
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,680
and the radio doesn't work.

178
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
No, the radio works. You don't.

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,920
What?

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,280
I'll see if I can fix
it, you scabby old bat.

181
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
- I think we got something then.
- What?

182
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,560
I think we got something then!

183
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
What are you doing?

184
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>Qué?</i>

185
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,560
Madam, don't think me rude,
but may I ask,

186
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,040
do you by any chance have a hearing aid?

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,160
A what?

188
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
A hearing aid!

189
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,840
Yes, I do have a hearing aid.

190
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Would you like me to get it mended?

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Mended? It's working perfectly all right.

192
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
No, it isn't!

193
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
I haven't got it turned on at the moment.

194
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,240
- Why not?
- The battery runs down.

195
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Now, what sort of a reduction
are you going to give me on this room?

196
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,320
- 60% if you turn it on.
- What?

197
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,120
My wife handles all such matters.

198
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm sure she will be delighted
to discuss it with you.

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,000
I shall speak to her after lunch.

200
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,320
You heard that all right, didn't you?

201
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
- What?
- Thank you so much.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Lunch will be served at half past 12:00.

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
Manuel! Manuel!

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
Are you going to the betting shop today?

205
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
- What?
- Oh, don't you start!

206
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,600
You go betting shop today?

207
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,880
Oh, <i>sí!</i> Betting shop, <i>sí!</i>

208
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,320
Now, I want you to put this
on this little horse,

209
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,720
Dragonfly, but... Big secret.

210
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,760
Sybil no know.

211
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,480
No, no, it's lovely.
It's just a bit buttery with my skin.

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,600
I think I need something more... more...

213
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,160
Topazy, for my colouring,
you know, more tonal.

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,520
Have you got...
Have you got Cosmopolitan there?

215
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,920
Page 42, you see Burt Reynolds?

216
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,840
Well, there's a girl standing behind him
looking at James Caan.

217
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,800
That sort of colour.

218
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
Mm.

219
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,720
Lovely. All right, I'll be in at 11:00.

220
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,080
- Oh, Polly...
- Hmm?

221
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,720
I've got to check the laundry.
Could you keep an eye on reception for me?

222
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
Sure.

223
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
Polly, Polly, where Mr Fawlty?

224
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,120
I don't know. What's the matter?

225
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,280
I have money for him.
He win on horse,

226
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,560
but big secret, shh!
Mrs Fawlty, shh!

227
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,760
Well, give it to me. I'll give it to him.

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Good afternoon, Miss Gatsby.
Good afternoon, Miss Tibbs.

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Good afternoon.

230
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,360
Good afternoon.

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
Good afternoon.

232
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
First they give me
a room without a bath,

233
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
then there's no lavatory paper!

234
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,640
Would you like some of ours?

235
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,800
We keep an extra supply.

236
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,840
Yes. Would you like some of ours?

237
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,840
Hello! Girl, there's no paper in my room.
Why don't you check these things?

238
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,840
That's what you're being
paid for, isn't it?

239
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,880
- We don't put it in the rooms.
- What?

240
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,640
We keep it in the lounge.

241
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,960
In the lounge?

242
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll get you some.

243
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Do you want plain ones,
or ones with our address on it?

244
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,560
Address on it?

245
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
How many sheets?

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,640
Well, how many are you going to use?

247
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Manager!

248
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
Just enough for one? Tell me.

249
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,840
Manager! Manager!

250
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,520
Yes? Testing... testing...

251
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,000
There you are. I've never met
such insolence in my life!

252
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
I come down here
to get some lavatory paper,

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,680
and she starts asking me
the most insulting,

254
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,480
personal things
I've ever heard in my life!

255
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,360
I thought she wanted writing paper.

256
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,600
- I'm talking to you, Watt!
- Watt?

257
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Are you deaf?
I said I'm talking to you.

258
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I've never met such insolence in my life.

259
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,960
She said people use it in the lounge.

260
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,680
- Yes, she thought...
- Then she starts asking me...

261
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,840
- No, please listen...
- appalling questions about...

262
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,560
I can explain. No, you see,
she thought you wanted to write.

263
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,720
Wanted a fight?
I'll give her a fight, all right!

264
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
- No, no, no. Wanted to write!
- What?

265
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,760
Wanted to write. On the paper.

266
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,160
Why should I want to write on it?

267
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,160
I'll have some sent up
to your room immediately.

268
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Manuel!

269
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,160
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?

270
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
- Turn it on.
- What?

271
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,600
Turn it...

272
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,120
Turn it on.

273
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,760
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.

274
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Where are they?

275
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,920
They're on your head, Mrs Richards.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
I've lost them.

277
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,000
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.

278
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
Excuse me!

279
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,360
- Now, I had them this morning...
- Mrs Richards...

280
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,400
When I was buying the vase...
I put them on to look at it,

281
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,840
and then I had them at tea time...

282
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,640
Mrs Richards!
Your glasses are there!

283
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,520
There? Who put them in there?

284
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
No, no, no! On your head!

285
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,080
- What?
- On your... Look,

286
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,880
on...

287
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
I'm sorry about that, Mr Fawlty.

288
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,280
Manuel asked me to give this to you.

289
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Oh! Thank you, Polly, and, Polly...

290
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,640
Not a word to the dragon, eh?

291
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,680
- No.
- Right.

292
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,800
Oh, Manuel,

293
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,440
get some loo paper, <i>muchos,</i> for 22.

294
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,600
Uh, twent... <i>Sí.</i>

295
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Are you blind?

296
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,800
There were on my head all the time.
Didn't you see?

297
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,840
- Yes.
- Didn't God give you eyes?

298
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,760
Yes, but I don't use 'em,
'cause it wears the batteries out.

299
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,280
Send my paper up immediately.

300
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,040
What's all that?

301
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,360
22.

302
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
Evening, Terry.

303
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,680
Do you like Cavaliera Rusticana, Terry?

304
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
I've never had it, Mr Fawlty.

305
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,120
You're in a good mood, Mr Fawlty.

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Had a little bit of luck on the gee-gees.

307
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,840

You seem very jolly, Basil.

318
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,160
Hmm?

319
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,440
You seem very jolly.

320
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,560
Jolly?

321
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes, jolly. Sort of... Happy.

322
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, happy. Yes, I remember that.

323
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,840
Not that I noticed, dear, no.

324
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,120
I'll report it if it happens, though.

325
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,040
Well, you look happy to me, Basil.

326
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
No, I'm not, dear.

327
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,120
All that dancing about,
singing and rubbing your hands.

328
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,920
Just my way of getting
through the day, dear.

329
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,920
The Samaritans were engaged.

330
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,440
I thought maybe you were in love. Hah!

331
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,320
Only with you, light of my life.

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,640
Or had a bit of luck or something.

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
Did Mr Hawkins deliver the tonics, Terry?

334
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Yes, he did, Mrs Fawlty.

335
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,440
Manuel! Manuel!

336
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,840
Oh, your horse, it win! It win!

337
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,440
Shah! Shah! Manuel...

338
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,480
You know nothing.

339
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,880
You always say, Mr Fawlty,
but I learn.

340
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,640
- What?
- I learn, I learn.

341
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
- No, no...
- I get better!

342
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
No, you don't understand.

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
- I do!
- No, you don't.

344
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
I... I do understand that...

345
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,240
Shah! Shah!

346
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,360
You know nothing about the horse.

347
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,160
I know nothing about the horse.

348
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Yes.

349
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,960
Ah.

350
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,200
Which horse?

351
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
What?

352
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,400
Which horse I know nothing?

353
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,080
My horse, nitwit!

354
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,520
Your horse, nitwit?

355
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,320
No, no, Dragonfly!

356
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,880
- It won!
- Yes, I know!

357
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,640
I know it won, too!
I put money on for you.

358
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,120
You give me money,
I go to betting shop...

359
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,360
Yes, I know, I know!

360
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Why you say I know nothing?

361
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
Look, look, look...

362
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
You know the horse?

363
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,920
Uh... Nitwit or Dragonfly?

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,080
Dragonfly! There isn't a horse called...
You're the nitwit!

365
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,200
What is "wit-nit"?

366
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,040
It doesn't matt...

367
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,200
I could spend the rest of my life
having this conversation!

368
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,760
Please, please try to understand
before one of us dies!

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
I try.

370
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,960
You're going to forget everything
you know about Nitwit.

371
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
No, no, Dragonfly.

372
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,600
Dragonfly! Yes!

373
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,080
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

374
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Eventually.

375
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,400
What?

376
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Eventually.

377
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
Uh, at the end.

378
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,440
No, no, no, forget it now!

379
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Now?

380
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
Well, pretend you forget!

381
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,280
Pretend?

382
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,960
Well, don't say anything to anyone
about the horse!

383
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,360
I know that.
You tell me that this morning!

384
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,960
- Basil...?
- So don't do it again!

385
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,200
Yes, dear?

386
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,320
It's Mrs Richards.

387
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,520
A fatal accident?

388
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,920
She's had some money stolen.

389
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
Oh, Mr Fawlty,

390
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I tell Polly.

391
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
That's all right, but don't tell anyone else,
not even me! You know nothing!

392
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,120
- Basil?
- Yes, dear?

393
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,560
You've got to help me handle this.
She's in a frightful state.

394
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,360
I can't get a word in edgewise.
She's had £85 taken from her room.

395
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,040
I said we'll search everyone,
but she insists we send for the police.

396
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,600
What do we do with someone like that?
She just keeps on!

397
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
Mrs Richards, how very nice to see you!

398
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,400
Are you enjoying your stay?

399
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,240
There's no need to shout.
I have my hearing aid on.

400
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,400
Mrs Richards,
I've explained to my husband...

401
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,600
I've just been up to my room.
£85 has been taken from my bag,

402
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,000
which I had hidden under the mattress.

403
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,160
Oh, yes?

404
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,600
It's a disgrace!
I haven't been here a day.

405
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,840
- What sort of staff do you employ?
- Mrs Richards...

406
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
If you knew anything at all
about running a hotel,

407
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,920
this sort of thing wouldn't happen!

408
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,480
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

409
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
What?

410
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,200
Wait, wait, wait.
I haven't got it turned up enough.

411
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,480
Basil!

412
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,200
I said I suggest...

413
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,680
Oh, my head, my head!

414
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,920
Has it come away?

415
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
Did you bang your head?

416
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes! Yes!

417
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,240
Oh, dear. Let me have a look.

418
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,880
You'd better go and lie down
before something else happens.

419
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,040
Shut up!

420
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
Why don't you call the police?

421
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,240
We will, the moment
we've searched the rooms.

422
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
My money's been taken!

423
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,120
Yes, yes, I know. Try not to speak.

424
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,120
Is this a piece of your brain?

425
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,400
£85.

426
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,920
Take my arm.

427
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,160
I don't need your arm, thank you.

428
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,840
I can get down the stairs
perfectly well by myself.

429
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,640
Down the stairs?
Don't stop when you get to the basement.

430
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.

431
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,400
Are you sure you can manage?

432
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,240
And if you give us any more trouble,
I shall visit you in the small hours

433
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,920
and put a bat up your nightdress.

434
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,280
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

435
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,000
The odd moment like that,
almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?

436
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,360
It's nice to share a moment like that,
isn't it? It's what marriage is all about.

437
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,720
I know. I read it on
the back of a matchbox.

438
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,720
Basil, sometimes...

439
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,440
Seriously, Sybil, do you remember
when we were first...

440
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
manacled together?

441
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,560
We used to laugh quite a lot.

442
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes, but not at the same time, Basil.

443
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,120
That's true. That was a warning, I guess.
Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?

444
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Zoom! "What was that?"
"That was your life, mate."

445
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,640
"Oh. That was quick. Do I get another?"

446
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,800
"Sorry, mate, that's your lot."

447
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Basil.

448
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
Back to the world of dreams. Yes, dear?

449
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,080
What are we going to do?

450
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,480
Give it another 15 years?

451
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,880
- About the money. Do you...
- Aw, she's left it in her room,

452
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,000
or eaten it or something.
We'll get Manuel to go through the room.

453
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,120
Polly can check the lounge...

454
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,240
- I saw Polly with money just now.
- Well, there you are.

455
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Quite a bit, too.
She was counting it in here.

456
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,080
Well, it's probably hers.

457
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,280
No, she's been very short lately.
I'll ask her...

458
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,520
Well, you can't.
You can't just ask her like that.

459
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,400
- Why not?
- It would be terribly rude,

460
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,560
asking someone if money is theirs.
That would be so embarrassing!

461
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Rubbish, Basil.

462
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,120
Hello, Fawlty Towers.
Polly Sherman?

463
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,120
Yes, certainly, I'll get her straightway.
Hang on.

464
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,240
Polly!

465
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
Terry, where's Polly?

466
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
In there.

467
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,680
- She saw you with the money!
- What?

468
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,320
She saw you counting
the horse money!

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
She's just coming...
Oh, hello, dear.

470
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,880
Here she is. Found her in here.

471
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,040
As I was just saying, Polly,
my wife would like a word with you

472
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,440
about a slightly delicate matter.

473
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,400
It's not delicate, Basil. Don't be silly.

474
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,320
He thinks it's embarrassing
for me to ask you

475
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,200
about that money I saw you with
earlier on in the office.

476
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,440
I wondered if someone had handed it in.
Mrs Richards has lost some.

477
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,120
The money? In the office?

478
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,960
You were counting it, weren't you?
Did someone hand it in?

479
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,520
Oh, no.
No, it's mine.

480
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,080
Yours?

481
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,840
I won it.

482
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,760
You won it?

483
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,160
On the horse Mr Fawlty got a tip on.

484
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
I hope you don't mind, I...

485
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,960
No, no, not at all.

486
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,800
I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly.

487
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,200
Oh, I don't.

488
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,360
Only I was in the town,
and I passed the betting shop,

489
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
and I thought, "Well, why not?"

490
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,920
Well, why not indeed?
Jolly good question, eh, dear?

491
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,640
Pity you didn't let me
put something on, really.

492
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,120
You realise how much we would've won?

493
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,080
£75 for a £5 stake. Still, you know best.

494
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,880
Those were the odds, were they, Basil?

495
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,440
Yes, that's right, dear. 14-1.

496
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
I listened in on the wireless
just to make sure it had triumphed.

497
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,520
Enjoy your winnings, Polly.

498
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,040
- Thank you.
- Polly.

499
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
- Yes, Mrs Fawlty?
- What was the name of the horse?

500
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
The name? Uh...

501
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,680
I've gone blank.

502
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,920
- Birdbrain!
- Birdbrain?

503
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,080
No, no, that came in third.

504
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,320
Uh...

505
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
Fishwife!

506
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
- What?
- No...

507
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,000
No, not that. Small...

508
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,280
Fly! Fly!

509
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
Flying Tart!

510
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,080
No, no, no, it got off to a flying start,
and it's name...

511
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,320
was Dragonfly!

512
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,120
Thank you, Polly.

513
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,400
If I find out the money
on that horse was yours,

514
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,160
you know what I'll do, Basil.

515
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,480
You'll have to sew 'em back on first.

516
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,560
- Ah, Major!
- 6:00, old boy.

517
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,840
Oh, so it is. Uh, Major...
Can I offer you, uh...

518
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Oh, very decent of you. Just a quick one.

519
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,840
Going to a memorial service.

520
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,520
Ah.

521
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,160
Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?

522
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,960
- What?
- For a memorial service?

523
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,840
Oh, I didn't like the chap.
One of those. Know what I mean?

524
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,720
- Cheers.
- Uh, Major...

525
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,480
Could you do me a favour?

526
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,440
Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy.

527
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,440
No, no, could you look
after some money for me?

528
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,280
I won it on that horse.
Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?

529
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,080
She goes through my pockets some nights.

530
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,880
Oh, absolutely. Which horse?

531
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,800
- Uh, Dragonfly.
- When's it running?

532
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
No, it ran today. I won that on it.

533
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh. Well done, old boy.

534
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,160
No, could you keep it?

535
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,200
No, I couldn't do that,
very decent of you...

536
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,840
No, could you keep it just tonight?
It's Sybil, you see? Secret.

537
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,200
Ah, a present.

538
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Sort of, yes.
Don't mention it.

539
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,760
Mum's the word.

540
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,640
I'll get it from you in
the morning and bank it.

541
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
Understood, old boy.

542
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
Cheers.

543
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,440
There you are, Mr Mackintosh.

544
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,320
- Good morning, Mr Fawlty.
- Good morning, ladies.

545
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Hello. Fawlty Towers.

546
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,440
Watt!

547
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,360
I didn't say anything.

548
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,600
Have you called the police yet?

549
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,640
Excuse me, I'm trying
to take a telephone call.

550
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,680
Have you called them yet?

551
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,840
- Yes, yes, we have.
- When are they going to be here then?

552
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,600
As soon as possible.
They're very busy today.

553
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
Busy. Humph!

554
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,280
Lot of bloodshed at the Nell Gwen
Tea Rooms last night. Hello?

555
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,120
Certainly, yes. Mrs Richards?

556
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,240
Mrs Richards! Sorry.
Telephone for you.

557
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,680
- Here.
- Yes?

558
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
What's this for?

559
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,200
- Uh, telephone calls?
- But I haven't made any.

560
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,960
- Uh... Cigarettes?
- I don't smoke.

561
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,560
There's nobody there.

562
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,120
Hello? Yes, yes, I know she is.

563
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,360
Yes. It's your sister!

564
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,600
Well, what is it for?

565
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,720
Umm... Drinks?

566
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,320
Drinks? Me?

567
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,560
We've been cut off.

568
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,600
Hello?
Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her.

569
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,360
Even the phones don't work.

570
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,160
Your sister says you've had an offer
of £87,000 for your house in Brighton.

571
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,360
87,000? Give it to me.

572
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
Don't be a fool, Stephanie.

573
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,120
92,750 I said, and I'm not taking
a penny less. You tell him that.

574
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Why don't people listen?

575
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,920
Well?

576
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,600
Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?
Let's enjoy ourselves.

577
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,840
Oh, thank you very much.

578
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh, Major! Major! Um, can I have it now?

579
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
- What, old boy?
- The money.

580
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,320
The money I gave you last night?

581
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,880
What... What is all this about?

582
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,040
You remember I gave you some money

583
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
just before you went
to that remembrance service?

584
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,840
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.

585
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
I don't remember that, old boy.

586
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,520
It was for a chap you didn't like.

587
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
- You know, he was one of those?
- One of those what?

588
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
Well...

589
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,200
- Pansy?
- Yes.

590
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,360
Which one?

591
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,880
No, no, no, no.
You were in your best suit.

592
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,840
Was I? Oh, yes, of course!

593
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,280
I went to the theatre, of course!

594
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,160
- No, no...
- Yes, yes, with Winnie Atwell, yes.

595
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
Winnie Atwell?

596
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
Well, Marjorie Atwell then, Marjorie.

597
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,720
I always call her Winnie because...
Well, because she looks like Winnie.

598
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
She's not black.

599
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,200
Black? Churchill wasn't black.

600
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,080
Look, look, look,
I gave you £75. You put it in there.

601
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,600
What do you mean by telling me
you called the police?

602
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
You've done no such thing.

603
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Your wife's just told me
you're still searching the rooms.

604
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,160
Well, I thought she'd called them.

605
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,560
You lying hound!

606
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,520
- Mrs Richards...
- Go and call them now, immediately.

607
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,680
Mrs Richards, we will,
the moment we've searched...

608
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
Right. I shall call them myself then.

609
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,960
Couldn't we just wait until...

610
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,400
I've never seen such a place!

611
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,600
All right, Mrs Richards.

612
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,360
Would you like to use
the office phone?

613
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,640
What?

614
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,480
In here. Thank you.

615
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,080
Basil! Get the key and check her room.

616
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,200
Right.

617
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,720
I found it, Fawlty!
It was in my pocket! Yes, in my new suit!

618
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
- Major, shh!
- In here, you see?

619
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,280
- Stuffed right down.
- Can I have it?

620
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,680
I don't know how it got there,
you, see, because I make a point

621
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
of keeping my money in my hip pocket.

622
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,560
Yes, please! Please!

623
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,160
- What, old boy?
- Can I have it?

624
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
Oh, yes, yes, the money.
Yes, yes, of course.

625
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,120
Good God, it's gone!

626
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,560
No, no, in there!

627
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,600
- Basil?
- Here it is!

628
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,520
- What's that?
- I found it, Mrs Fawlty.

629
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,640
The money.

630
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
Oh, that's marvellous! Mrs Richards!

631
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,840
- What?
- We found your money.

632
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,440
- No!
- The Major's found your money.

633
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,120
- No! N...
- What?

634
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,720
Thank you so much, Major.

635
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
There you are.
I told you it would turn up.

636
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,520
What is it, Basil?

637
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,680
Bit of luck, eh, Fawlty?

638
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,280
It's £10 short.

639
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
Oh, dear.

640
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,400
It's not!

641
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,960
£10 short?

642
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,640
Oh, my God!

643
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,200
Don't worry, we'll have a whip round!

644
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,560
Basil, stop!

645
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
What's he doing now?

646
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,160
What on earth do you
think you're doing?

647
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,920
I'll look for the missing £10 immediately,
Mrs Richards.

648
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,360
- Where exactly did you find it, Major?
- In my pocket.

649
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,040
- In your pocket?
- Yeah, yeah. Not this suit. In my new suit.

650
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,680
Would you mind if I popped up
and had a look?

651
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,040
No, no, not at all.

652
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,960
I'll see if I can find it.
Won't be a moment.

653
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,280
Uh, it's in with the, um, the, uh...

654
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,560
- Did you say it was in your pocket?
- Yes, yes.

655
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,920
What was it doing in your pocket?

656
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,080
Can I explain?

657
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,120
You're not explaining anything.
You're completely loopy.

658
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
Mad as a March hare!

659
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,000
Yes, yes, I am.
Yes, I am completely loopy.

660
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
That's why I gave him
the money to look after.

661
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,440
You see, there's been a mistake.

662
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,560
That money there is in fact mine.

663
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
- Yours?
- Yes, as the Major will confirm,

664
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,440
you see, I was saving it up
for a present for my wife.

665
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,440
That's why I couldn't say
anything just now,

666
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,840
but I gave it to the Major last night...

667
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,400
What rubbish! This is my money.

668
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,920
- No, the Major will verify what I've said.
- Hmm?

669
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
- Could you verify that, Major?
- What, old boy?

670
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,280
Hush... The money.
I gave you last night,

671
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,040
for my wife's present?
I gave it to you

672
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,880
- just before you went to the theatre?
- The theatre?

673
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,000
Well... Yes. You... You remember?

674
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,560
That money I won on the horses!

675
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,720
A horse?

676
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,640
Why are you whispering?
What are you saying?

677
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,200
- He says he won it on a horse.
- Won it on a horse?

678
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,200
Shah! It doesn't matter!
Do you remember me giving it to you?

679
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,440
Oh, think! Please think!

680
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,720
What was the question again?

681
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,840
Oh, the money, the money! Do you...

682
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,120
Manuel! Manuel!
Manuel! Manuel!

683
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,440
You remember I had some money yesterday?

684
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,640
The money I won on the horse?

685
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Oh, <i>sí.</i>

686
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,920
Tell Mrs Richards.
Tell her I had the money yesterday.

687
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,400
Ahem-hem!

688
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,880
I know nothing.

689
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,200
What? What?

690
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,520
I know nothing.

691
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,000
- No, no...
- Nothing.

692
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,120
No, no, forget that!

693
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
I forget everything. I know nothing.

694
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,720
- You can tell her!
- No, I cannot.

695
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,200
Yes, yes, tell her!

696
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,640
Tell her. Please! Please!

697
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,560
Tell her. Tell her!
Tell her! Tell her, or I'll kill you!

698
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,440
Oh. Ha ha!

699
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,200
No, I know nothing.

700
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,880
I am from Barcelona.

701
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,120
I'm not listening
to any more of this rubbish!

702
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm going to finish my breakfast,

703
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,640
and when I come back,
I want the rest of my money.

704
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Give it to her, Basil.

705
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,200
I can't find it. Give her 10 from the till.

706
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,160
Right!

707
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,400
What are you doing?

708
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm going to give her
the shirt off my back, too!

709
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
You see? I know nothing.

710
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
I'm gonna send you to a vivisectionist.

711
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,280
Now...

712
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
Good afternoon, Mr Fawlty.

713
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,880
Good afternoon.

714
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,680
You got a Mrs Richards staying here?

715
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
- Yes.
- Oh. Ah, well,

716
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,760
only she bought this yesterday,
asked us to deliver it.

717
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,960
The thing is,
she left some money behind.

718
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,200
Keeps it in this.

719
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,800
95 quid. Look.

720
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,640
The cleaner found it this morning.

721
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,960
Almost threw it in the bin. Lucky, eh?
Is she around?

722
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,000
Nope. I'll give it to her.

723
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh. Thanks, Mr Fawlty. Goodbye.

724
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,440
Mm... Mwah!

725
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,840
We found her money!

726
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,240
Where?

727
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,760
She... It doesn't matter.

728
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,480
I'm £10 up on the deal!

729
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,640
£10 up?

730
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Yes, it's 95... Even if I give her 10,
I'm still 10 up!

731
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,600
Polly, for the first time in my life, I'm ahead!
I'm winning!

732
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,120
Hello, Mrs Richards.
How lovely to see you.

733
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,760
Your beautiful vase that you bought
yesterday has just arrived. Now, remind me,

734
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,440
the money that you have there,
is it yours or mine?

735
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,840
I told you. It's mine.

736
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,040
You're absolutely sure?

737
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,280
Yes, I am.

738
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,640
- But you're still £10 short?
- Yes.

739
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,680
Polly, give Mrs Richards this, would you?

740
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,960
What's that?

741
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,280
This is mine.

742
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
What's that, Basil?

743
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,720
- It's mine.
- What?

744
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,280
It's the money I won on the horse.

745
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,480
Oh, yes, right. Polly asked me
to put it in the safe for her.

746
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,480
So, that's all sorted out,
and this is your money, Polly.

747
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,840
And this is your beautiful vase,
Mrs Richards.

748
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,760
Fawlty!
You did give me that money!

749
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,560
You won it on that horse!

750
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Aah!

751
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,320
That cost £75!

752
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
Oh, I am sorry, Mrs Richards.

753
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,560
We must pay you back. There you are. One...
