1
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,920
You said you'd go.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
I didn't say I would, I said I might.
I've got to do the accounts tonight.

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,800
You don't have to do the accounts tonight.

4
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,440
- I do.
- It's always the same.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,720
Whenever I want to go out,
you've always got some excuse.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,280
It's not an excuse.
It's just that tonight...

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,480
It's not just tonight, it's any night
I want to go out with any of my friends,

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,200
anyone at all, any other members
of the human race.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,440
Yes, I wouldn't call the Sherrins
members of the human race.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm cooped up in this hotel all day long.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,640
You never take me out, the only bit of life I get
is when I get away with some of my friends.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Well, you must get away more often, dear.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,920
They all think you're peculiar.
You know that, don't you?

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,520
They've all said at one time or another,
how on earth did the two of us ever get together?

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,840
"Black magic," my mother says.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,360
She'd know, wouldn't she? Her and that cat.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Shall I get you the wine list?

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,640
- Mr Fawlty?
- "Mister"? Please, call me waiter.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll go get a chair and
you can really tuck in.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
There's some stuff in
the bin you might like,

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,720
potato peelings, cold rice pudding,
that sort of thing...

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,640
Not exactly haute cuisine,
but it'll certainly help to fill you up.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,280
Sybil, may I introduce the gentleman

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,040
who's just opened the self-service
department here? Mister...

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,960
- Carnegie.
- Mr Carnegie, the scavenger gourmet from...

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
The public health department.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,280
Yes, wh... Where were you born?
Scavenger or down here in the West country?

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,160
Public health department?

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,440
Here's the invoice for the
meat, Mr Carnegie.

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,160
- It's the six-monthly checkup.
- The meat was delivered on Wednesday.

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,640
Yes. That would appear to be satisfactory.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,200
Oh, good.
Hope you didn't mind my little joke just now.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,480
Thank God we English
can laugh at each other, eh?

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,600
That's our... Our new chef, just... Just left.
Just popped out for a quick prayer, I expect.

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,960
- Mr Fawlty?
- Hello.

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,440
These premises do not come up
to the standard required by this authority.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,840
Unless appropriate steps
are taken instantly,

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,840
I shall have no alternative but
to prosecute or recommend closure

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,200
to the appropriate
committee of the council.

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,280
Specifically, lack of proper cleaning routines,
dirty and greasy filters,

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,480
greasy and encrusted deep fat fryer,

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,920
dirty, cracked, and stained
food preparation surfaces,

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,720
dirty, cracked, and missing wall and floor tiles,
dirty, marked, and stained utensils,

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
dirty and greasy interior surfaces
of the ventilator hoods.

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,080
Yes, about the deep fat fryer...

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,280
Inadequate temperature control
and storage of dangerous foodstuffs,

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,800
storage of cooked and
raw meat in same trays,

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,320
storage of raw meat above confectionery,

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,560
with consequent dripping of meat juices
onto cream products,

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,040
refrigerator seals loose and cracked,
ice box un-defrosted,

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
- and refrigerator overstocked.
- Yes, say no more.

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Food handling routines suspect,

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280
evidence of smoking in
food preparation area,

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,840
dirty and grubby food handling overalls,

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,960
lack of wash handbasin...
Which you gave us a verbal assurance

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,920
you'd have installed
on our last visit six months ago...

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,720
And two dead pigeons in the water tank.

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,040
Otherwise, okay?

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,440
As I said, I shall refrain from serving

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,200
a food hygiene notice today,
but I shall return tomorrow.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,960
If the items on this list have not been rectified,
I shall take immediate action.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,720
I have not had time to inspect the bedrooms
and common passageways,

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,280
but I shall be doing so tomorrow.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,520
Yes, of course.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,080
The only gourmets
you'll find scavenging in this kitchen

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,760
will be kamikaze ones.

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,480
Thought we was in trouble
there for a minute.

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,200
We are in trouble.

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,760
Piece of cake.

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
Have you read this piece of cake?

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,960
They gotta do that, ain't they?
It's part of their job.

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,000
Terry, this kitchen is filthy!

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,680
Filthy Towers, eh?

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,880
- Now, look...
- All kitchens are filthy, Mr Fawlty.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,000
In fact, the better the
kitchen, the filthier it is.

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,880
Have you ever read George Orwell's
experiences at Maxim's in Paris?

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
No, do you have a copy?
I'll read it out in court.

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,360
Don't just stand there gossiping.
Go upstairs.

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm trying to point out
to our alleged chef...

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Go upstairs and get Manuel,

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,320
then check the bathrooms for soap and paper
and get those pigeons out of the water tank.

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes, my little commandant.

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,480
And see how many fire
extinguishers are missing.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Come on, Polly. We'll start in here.

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,800
Not in here, puss.

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Manuel, I'm sorry. This is an emergency.
Important, <i>sí?</i>

87
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,960
The health inspector's just been,
things wrong with hotel.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
We put them right by tomorrow, all right?

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,560
- Now, Manuel, go up to the roof, <i>sí?</i>
- Yes, <i>sí.</i>

90
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,520
No, no, come. I haven't told you yet.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,120
- Go to the water tank.
- Water.

92
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,400
- Water tank. Water on roof, in tank.
<i>- Sí, sí, sí.</i>

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Two dead pigeons, in tank. Take out.

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,080
It's not difficult, Manuel.
This is not a proposition from Wittgenstein.

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,200
Listen, two dead pigeons. Water tank.

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,400
- What is funny?
- How they get up there?

97
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,880
How'd they... They flew up there.

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
That's right.

99
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
Will you stop... Will you just...
Will you pull...

100
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,000
Not pigs! Pigeons!

101
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,120
<i>- Qué?</i>
- Pigeon, pigeon.

102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Like your English.
"Plety, piffle, pig, pigeon!" Pigeon.

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,960
"Piggy on..." Ah!

104
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,400
- What is that?
- Is my hamster. "Piggy-on."

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,400
- Hamster?
- Sí, sí. No, pidge-on.

106
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,280
- Manuel, it's a rat.
- Pidge-in.

107
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,680
- It's a rat!
- No, no, is hamster.

108
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,200
Of course it's a rat.
You have rats in Spain, don't you?

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,240
Or did Franco have them all shot?

110
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,520
No, is hamster.

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,120
- It's a rat.
- No, I think so too.

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,520
I say to man in shop, "Is rat."

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,320
He says, "No, no, no. Is a special kind of hamster.
Is Filigree Siberian Hamster."

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,640
Only one in shop.
He make special price, only £5.

115
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,400
Have you ever heard
of the Bubonic Plague, Manuel?

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,040
It was very popular here at one time.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,840
A lot of pedigreed hamsters
came over on ships from Siberia.

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,320
- What you do?
- Sorry, this is a rat.

119
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,280
- No, no! Is hamster!
- Is not hamster.

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
Hamster are small and cuddly.
Cuddle this, you'd never play the guitar again.

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,640
- Where you go? Where you take him?
- I'm sorry Manuel. He's got to go.

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
- Go? No, no, no!
- Yes.

123
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,720
- He mine. He stay with me.
- Now look! This is a hotel!

124
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,160
The health inspector comes tomorrow.
If he sees this, I, closed down.

125
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,080
No warning, closed down. <i>Finito.</i>
You, out of work. Back to Barcelona.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,640
He no hurt. He in cage.
He safe. Please! Please!

127
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,320
- Good morning, ladies.
- What's the matter?

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
He take my hamster!

129
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,800
Please, no, Mr Fawlty! I love him!

130
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,840
- How could you?
- He take it from my room!

131
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,120
- There, there.
- It'll be all right.

132
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,840
- You can keep it in our room.
- That's right, we'll keep it in our room, Mr Fawlty.

133
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,480
We'll look after it.

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,120
A rat! A rat!

135
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,120
No, no. Is Siberian Hamster, Filigree.

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
It's all right, it's only a Siberian Hamster.
Just getting rid of it.

137
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,880
- Polly, Polly! He take my hamster.
- What?

138
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,400
Mr Fawlty take my hamster!
He crazy, he think is rat!

139
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,200
- Manuel.
- Hmm?

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,440
Prepare yourself for a shock.

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,600
- Why didn't you check?
- What?

142
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,560
You mean he's had it for a whole year,
and you've only just found out?

143
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,120
- Supposing the health inspector had seen it?
- I know.

144
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
He could have closed us down.

145
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,840
What are you going to do with it, Basil?
You can't keep it in here.

146
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
I know.

147
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,360
And don't let it loose in the garden.
It'll come back in the house.

148
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,120
Can't we get you on <i>Mastermind,</i> Sybil?

149
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,360
Next contestant, Sybil Fawlty from Torquay,
special subject, the bleedin' obvious!

150
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000
I wasn't going to let it go in the garden.

151
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,600
What are you going to do with it?

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
I don't know. I'll take it away.
Let it go. Give it its freedom.

153
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,840
You can't do that, Basil.
He wouldn't be able to defend himself.

154
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
He's a rat, isn't he?

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,880
He's domesticated, aren't you?

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
You're domesticated, you do all right.

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,200
Basil!

158
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,320
He won't get mugged
by a gang of field mice, will he?

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,040
Basil, he's Manuel's pet.
We have a duty to it.

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,920
Perhaps we could find a home for him.

161
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,080
All right! I'll put an ad in the papers!
Wanted, kind home for enormous savage rodent.

162
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,480
Answers to the name of Sybil.

163
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
Look, I'll take him out into the country...

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,600
No! I cannot abide cruelty
to living creatures.

165
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,320
Well, I'm a creature,
you can abide it to me.

166
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,160
You're not living.

167
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
Look, Manuel, we were just wondering...

168
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,000
Mrs Fawlty, please understand.
If he go, I go.

169
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
Well, goodbye.

170
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,920
Please listen.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,600
You know, we really can't keep him here.
The health inspector wouldn't...

172
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,200
Mrs Fawlty, he here one
year, he do no harm.

173
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,240
But, Manuel, listen. If they see your rat,
they could close the hotel down.

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,400
Perhaps it would be simplest
to have him put to s-I-e-e-p.

175
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,960
Who? Him or the rat?
We might get a discount if we had 'em both done.

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,200
"Spleep"?

177
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,560
Manuel, I've rung my friend.
It's all right. She'll take him.

178
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
She has lots of animals,

179
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
and it's not far from here,
you can go see him whenever you want.

180
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
Come on, we'll take him there now.

181
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,480
- But he forget me!
- Rats are like that.

182
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,920
- Don't get involved with them.
- I think it's the best solution, Manuel.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,040
Oh, he'll be happy. You'll see.

184
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,520
Sad, isn't it?

185
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,680
Well, look at it from the
point of view of the rat.

186
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,960
- What?
- Would you want

187
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,840
to spend the rest of your life
with Manuel waiting on you?

188
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,040
We've been through the cupboards,
you're doing the walls,

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Terry, the filters, checked the fridges...

190
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,320
Come here.

191
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,440
Right, that's done.
Now, Sybil, everything done here?

192
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
Have you put the lid on the tank, Basil?

193
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
That's why I've been on the roof
the last 40 minutes.

194
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,400
- And you took the pigeons out?
- No, I left them in. They're nearly done.

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,920
Now, walls?

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,080
I've checked everything.

197
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,880
Terry, the hoods. We've done the cupboards?

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,400
- It's all been done, Basil.
- The fridge.

199
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,800
- Have we got it all separate?
- Basil, I told you, it's all been done.

200
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,560
- Seals on the old fridge, the floor?
- I've checked it.

201
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,440
Just running over the bleeding obvious, dear.
So, all is shipshape and Bristol fashion, eh?

202
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,920
All ready for ode snoopy drawers?

203
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,560
- Is this about that rodent?
- Leave him alone, Basil, he's upset.

204
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,680
He's not going to cheer up
mooning about like that, is he?

205
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
Just let him be.

206
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,720
It doesn't help him, you encouraging it.
You've got to get his mind off it.

207
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,040
Well, Manuel, what do you think?
Looks good, doesn't it, eh?

208
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,160
All clean and shining bright?

209
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,160
So empty, without him.

210
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,960
Yes, but those walls look good, too.

211
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
And the hoods, gleaming like that,
isn't that a marvellous sight?

212
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,520
Please leave me alone. I get over it.

213
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,960
Yes, no point in letting it get you down.

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,800
Plenty more fish in the sea, eh?

215
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,960
- Don't!
- What?

216
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,840
Don't hit me. Always you hit me.

217
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm not hitting you,
I'm trying to cheer you up.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
Let him be, Basil.

219
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,920
Look, look... Don't look at me
with those awful cow eyes.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
Wh... Why don't you go
to the cinema tonight?

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Why don't you and Polly go to the ice rink?

222
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,440
Why don't you...
Cheer up, for Christ's sake!

223
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,560
Basil!

224
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,960
I cannot stand this awful self indulgence!

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,960
Leave him alone, Basil,
he's just depressed.

226
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,720
Manuel, my wife informs me
that you're depressed.

227
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,560
Let me tell you something,
depression is a very bad thing.

228
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,400
It's like a virus.

229
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,520
If you don't stamp on it,
it spreads throughout the mind,

230
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,120
and then one day, you wake up in the morning,
and you can't face life any more.

231
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,440
And then you open a hotel.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,240
We didn't win the war
by getting depressed, you know?

233
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,800
- Manuel!
<i>- Cómo?</i>

234
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
- Not so sad.
- No?

235
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
No, no. It's too much.

236
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,960
- Too much?
- Much too much.

237
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,160
Just a little bit sad.

238
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
- There's the food.
- Ah, <i>gracias.</i>

239
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Don't forget the water.

240
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Ahh, Terry, Terry.
Let me have a bit of that.

241
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
- That's fillet.
<i>- Sí, sí,</i> he like it. Please.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
Want some béarnaise with it?

243
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
No, no... Is chostelorol.

244
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,960
Shoo.

245
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,680
Basil?

246
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you, Mr Higgins.

247
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
Thank you.

248
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,640
- And here's the picture.
- What?

249
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,600
The picture. The one in your room.
You said you liked it.

250
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
- Uh...
- Polly!

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,400
- Shh! Wait!
- Polly.

252
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
No, I'm sorry. I really don't...

253
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,760
Just a fiver...
You can have it on approval.

254
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,000
Sorry.

255
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,560
It's for my sister's eye operation.

256
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,160
You bastard!

257
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,280
- Polly!
- Oh, what?

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,400
- He gone!
- What?

259
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
He gone! He escape!

260
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
But how did he get out of the cage?

261
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,880
I leave door open so he
can exercise in shed.

262
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,240
You dago dodo!

263
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
- You got it all over your front.
<i>- Qué?</i>

264
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,320
<i>- Mucho</i> salo.
- What you do?

265
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,040
- Is dirty.
- Don't matter, what about Basil?

266
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,080
- Mr Fawlty to you.
- No, no. Basil!

267
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,840
<i>Está aquí.</i>

268
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,520
- Now go and clean it.
- Ah, <i>sí, sí.</i>

269
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,280
Jolly good, Polly.
That's the way to snap him out of it.

270
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,960
- Morning, Fawlty.
- Hello, Major. There are the papers.

271
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
That's where I left it.

272
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,520
Strike, strike, strike.

273
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,840
Why do we bother, Fawlty?

274
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,720
Didn't know you did, Major.

275
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,800
Boycott made a century.

276
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,760
Stay where you are, old chap.

277
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,640
Don't move.

278
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,360
- Terry, give these a rinse, will you?
- I have.

279
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Well, they're still dirty.
Put them in the dishwasher.

280
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,040
- Do you need any help, Major?
- Don't move!

281
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,120
Vermin.

282
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,080
- We haven't got any, this week, Major.
- Hmm?

283
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,520
No Germans staying this week, Major.

284
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,120
May I have that?

285
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,480
Goin' to shoot him, Fawlty.

286
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
- Major?
- Hmm?

287
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,080
Not legal actually, any more, murder.

288
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,520
But they're animals, Fawlty!

289
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
Oh, yes, yes.
Still, forgive and forget, eh?

290
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
- Forgive 'em?
- Well, pretend we do.

291
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,880
But they spread disease, Fawlty.

292
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,800
He was sitting there, on that table,
eating the nuts, if you please.

293
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
He's really gone this time.

294
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,840
About that size, that... With the tail.

295
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,920
Tall?

296
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
- What did you say he was?
- Vermin. A dirty rat.

297
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,160
- How long ago?
- About two minutes ago.

298
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
Stay there, Major. Stay there.
If you see him, give me a shout.

299
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,360
Will do.

300
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm just cleaning behind the
fridge, Mr Fawlty.

301
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,880
Basil.

302
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,200
Basil... Cheesies.

303
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,880
- Bas...
- Yes?

304
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,000
Here I am!

305
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,840
- Hello, Mr Fawlty.
- That's for me, is it?

306
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,440
Thank you. Hmm.

307
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
- Shall I get you some more? There's plenty...
- He's called Basil, is he?

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,640
Don't play dumb with me. I trusted you.
You're responsible for this.

309
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,960
"My friend will look after him,
Mr Fawlty!"

310
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,200
Just...

311
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,160
Come on. Come on out.
Come on. Basil's here.

312
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
- Have you got him?
- He's under there.

313
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
Right. I'll get him.

314
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,800
Cleaning behind the fridge?

315
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,400
Well, you've got a lot on your mind.
We didn't want to worry you, Mr F...

316
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,080
What do you mean? A public health inspector

317
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,720
coming after a 24-hour warning
and a rat loose in the hotel,

318
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,960
is that what you mean?

319
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,560
- He must have escaped, Mr Fawlty, and come back.
- Come back?

320
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
They home.

321
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,520
Oh, I see. He's a homing rat, is he?

322
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh, yeah. Rats are amazing
creatures, Mr Fawlty.

323
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
I read about one once.

324
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
His owner had gone down to Penzance...

325
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,880
Yes, yes. I read about that.

326
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,600
When the chef got filleted
with his own carving knife?

327
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,000
- No, honest, scout's honour.
- We'll find him, Mr Fawlty!

328
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,960
Well, if you could. That would be lovely,
before they close us down. Super!

329
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,840
Well, let's have a little Basil hunt, shall we?
And then we'll deal with the sackings later on.

330
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,680
- I'll do the cellar.
- I'll do this floor.

331
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,000
Manuel, you check your room.

332
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,880
Start in the bar. He was there two minutes ago.
I'll do the kitchen.

333
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
I've done all them.

334
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,920
- Oh, Mr Carnegie. Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Fawlty.

335
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,120
Hello. Nice to see you.

336
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,640
Would you like coffee
before we adjourn to...

337
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
No, thank you.
If we start upstairs with the water tanks.

338
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,120
- Ah, good idea.
- What?

339
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,840
Good thinking, about starting upstairs.

340
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,760
- Sybil, would you like to show Mr Carnegie up?
- I was just going to, Basil.

341
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,000
And I'll keep an eye on things down here,
find something to get on with.

342
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,920
God! What was that?

343
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,400
Bloody television exploding again.
I'll deal with it, you go upstairs.

344
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,920
- That was a gun!
- Yes, it did sound like it, didn't it?

345
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,520
- Moths.
- What is going on here?

346
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,360
I'll get him!
He'll come back for the nuts, you know?

347
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,760
He was sniffing around here just now.

348
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
Sorry, sorry, Major.

349
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
It wasn't the television at all.
It was just this gun.

350
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
I'll put it under lock
and key straightaway.

351
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
Why was he firing it in the hotel?

352
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
Shooting starlings.

353
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,960
- In the bar?
- Through the window. I'll lock it away.

354
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,600
- Is it licensed?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

355
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,960
You do realise that under
the health and safety act

356
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,240
it is your responsibility?

357
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,040
Oh, yes. I'm terribly sorry.
It's never happened before, Mr Carnegie.

358
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
I'll have to notify the police, of course.
They will take steps.

359
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,680
<i>Qué? Polly, qué ha pasado?</i>

360
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,480
- It's all right, Manuel.
- Is he all right?

361
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,760
- Yes.
- He no dead?

362
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
No, it was just the Major
letting the gun off.

363
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,920
- The Major tried to kill Basil?
- Kill Basil?

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,560
No, not Mr Fawlty.
I mean Basil, my little...

365
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,840
Ratatouille!

366
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,360
Basil. The little...

367
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,840
Ratatouille.

368
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,000
The chef calls the Ratatouille Basil,
because he puts quite a lot of basil in it.

369
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,640
He put Basil in the Ratatouille?

370
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,440
Yes!

371
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
He's from Barcelona.

372
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,880
You know, typical Latin, really.
Would you like to...

373
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
- Why you do this?
- I 'aven't, I 'aven't!

374
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,120
Polly say you put Basil in ratatouille.

375
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,080
I haven't made any bleeding ratatouille!

376
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,240
Manuel!

377
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,960
Well, why you say he put
Basil in ratatouille?

378
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,800
I had to say something.
That was the health inspector.

379
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Now, will you calm down?

380
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,360
- Where is he?
- Oh, I don't know!

381
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,240
- Perhaps he dead.
- Oh, 'e's all right.

382
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,520
Give us the veal.
I've got to get lunch ready.

383
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,480
How you know he's all right?
The Major fire his gun, perhaps he hit. I find him!

384
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,680
Sorry, Polly.

385
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,040
Oh, pick 'em up quick,
before 'e gets in here.

386
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
That's it, Major. You've nearly got it.

387
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,840
The thing is, not a word about rats.
You were shooting a starling, all right?

388
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
- A starling.
- Yes.

389
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,040
- Through the window.
- Right.

390
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,920
But, Fawlty,
how did the starling get in the bar?

391
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
No, no, no. You were in the bar.

392
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,000
- I was in the bar?
- Yes!

393
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,120
Yes, I was!

394
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,600
And the starling was in the garden,
and the rat was nowhere at all.

395
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
Well, I didn't see him.

396
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,320
Say good night to the folks, Gracie.

397
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,720
- All right, Terry. Everything under control?
- Yeah. Is he still...

398
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,880
No, he started upstairs.
God knows where that rat is.

399
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Tch! Oh, puss.

400
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
Come on, puss.

401
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,680
Out you go.

402
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,720
Oh, uh... I put some...

403
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,360
- Terry?
- Yeah?

404
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
There was a piece of veal down here.

405
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
Yeah, I got 'em all up, Mr Fawlty.

406
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,480
- What?
- We picked 'em all up.

407
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
- Got the veals, Terry?
- Yeah, here they are, Poll.

408
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,840
Terry, listen to me.
What do you mean, "You picked them all up"?

409
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,000
Manuel knocked 'em over.
We picked 'em all up.

410
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,320
- Oh, my God!
- What's the matter?

411
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
One of them's got rat poison on it.

412
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,080
Sorry, sorry!

413
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,880
Veal's off, sorry.

414
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,000
- That's veal?
- No, no, this is... Veal substitute.

415
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,400
We're giving it a try,
and it's a bit of a disappointment, I'm afraid.

416
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,720
In fact, it's no substitute at all.

417
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,520
Polly, would you take the
order again, please?

418
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,440
Thank you, thank you so much.

419
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm sorry about that.
Would you like the lamb or the plaice?

420
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,040
Veal substitute?

421
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,800
Well, it's Japanese, actually,
soya beans and essence of cow.

422
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,280
Seals?

423
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,640
We've moved all the meat into this one,
and we've put the confectionery...

424
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
Ahem! A bottle of the Beaujolais, please.

425
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,880
Certainly.

426
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
- And the wash handbasin?
- We ordered it yesterday.

427
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,040
Here's the acknowledgement of the order.

428
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,840
Well, it would appear that this kitchen
is now in a satisfactory condition.

429
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,120
I shall be writing to confirm...

430
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,480
Sorry, it slipped.

431
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,680
...the outstanding points,

432
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,400
and someone will be dropping in
to carry out a future random inspection

433
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
to make sure these standards
are being maintained.

434
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800
- Thank you.
- Marvellous.

435
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
It's 10 to 1:00.

436
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
I'd like to take lunch here, if I may?

437
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
Certainly, Mr Carnegie.

438
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,960
I couldn't help noticing
you had some veal over here...

439
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,520
- Veal?
- Yes, it's Dutch.

440
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
It's not Dutch, actually. It's Norwegian.

441
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
- Norwegian?
- Yes.

442
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,080
Not the absolute apex, quite honestly.

443
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,840
Terry, the veal is Dutch, isn't it?

444
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,760
Norwegian, Mrs Fawlty.

445
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,960
I've been in this business 20 years,
I've never heard of Norwegian veal.

446
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,560
They've only just branched into it.

447
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,280
I don't think it's a winner, frankly,
more of a veal substitute.

448
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,960
It's got a lot of air pockets in
it, that sort of thing.

449
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,400
- The lamb is Dutch.
- Dutch?

450
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,600
English, I mean. We call it Dutch 'cause
it's as good as the veal. Better, honestly.

451
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,720
- I prefer the veal.
- How about lobster?

452
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,360
Would you prefer lobster?
A couple of lobsters?

453
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,560
It's frightfully good at the moment.
It's not expensive this week.

454
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,960
We've got so much, we're having a sale
to try and shift it all. 75p each, two for £1.

455
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,280
- Can't say fairer than that.
- Just the veal.

456
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,320
If you like the veal...
Perhaps you'd prefer the chicken?

457
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,240
Basil, he wants the veal.

458
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,240
- Could I make a phone call?
- Yes, of course. Through here.

459
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,960
What's all this about
rat poison on the veal?

460
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
He's put rat poison on one,

461
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,800
they've got mixed up,
and nobody knows which is which now.

462
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
Well, what happened to the one the cat ate?

463
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,800
- The cat?
- That's no good.

464
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,400
- That might have poison on it too.
- Well, where is it?

465
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,680
- What?
- Where's the cat's slice?

466
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,480
Up here.

467
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,400
Right. Now, how's the cat?

468
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,680
How's the cat?

469
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,480
We're about to take the life
of a public health inspector

470
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,400
and you want to know "How's the cat?"

471
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,360
It's gone to London to see the Queen!

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,560
What are we going to do?

473
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
- He's all right!
- Great!

474
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,760
Hooray! Hooray! The cat lives!

475
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,880
The cat lives! Long live the cat!

476
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,360
What are we going to do?

477
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,760
Mr Fawlty, if the cat is all right,
that means that slice is all right.

478
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,200
- But how long would it take to work?
- That stuff? Two minutes.

479
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,640
He had this 10 minutes ago at least.

480
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,440
- It's a bit chewed there.
- I'll give it a trim.

481
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,320
You're driving over to Babbacombe
this afternoon?

482
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
Yes, we're...

483
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,920
What is a plate of veal doing there?

484
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,520
I'll just relieve you of it, shall I?

485
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,920
Do sit down, Mr Carnegie.

486
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
- He just has, Basil.
- On a plate of veal.

487
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,360
- Has it put you off?
- What?

488
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,600
Has it put you off the veal? At all?

489
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm not eating that one,
if that's what you mean.

490
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
Stop! Halt!

491
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,000
Sorry, I think there might be another one.
Excuse me.

492
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,920
Ah, yes. Lucky guess.

493
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,280
- Well, who's responsible for putting them there?
- Manuel, our Spanish waiter.

494
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,680
Thank you.

495
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,160
Now, would you care to take
a seat right here? Please.

496
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,840
- Does he do it often?
- Oh, no, no.

497
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,040
It's the first time.
Sometimes looks as if he's going to.

498
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,400
We always catch him, of course.

499
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
Here's your veal, Mr Carnegie,

500
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
- And one green salad.
- Thank you.

501
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
Ah, bon. Good appétit.

502
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,640
Well done, Terry.

503
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,520
Sorry, not hot enough.

504
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,880
Not big enough, sorry.

505
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,120
- What?
- Not big enough, sorry.

506
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Excuse me. Really, Polly!

507
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
- What are you doing?
- Well, if that's the one, these are okay.

508
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,840
- What?
- If that's the poison one,

509
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,680
these are all right.

510
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,280
Brilliant!

511
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
- Great, right. Okay.
- Basil, what is going on?

512
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,240
That was the poisoned one. The cat had it.

513
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,920
- The cat!
- Poisoned?

514
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes, so that one must be okay, hmm?

515
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,600
Basil...

516
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,040
- Sorry, just getting you a proper sized one.
- It was big enough. It was all I wanted.

517
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,240
Well, it could have been a bit hotter.

518
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
- Well, not much, but...
- Look...

519
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,840
Yes, yes. It's just coming.
Won't be a second.

520
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,680
Manuel, would you...

521
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,560
Here.

522
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,480
- What?
- Look, he's all right. Look!

523
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,000
- He can't be.
- Well, he is.

524
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Here ya are, Poll.

525
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
- Oh.
- He can't be!

526
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,000
What do you mean?

527
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,880
- He was vomiting.
- Vomiting?

528
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,080
That's just fur balls, Basil.

529
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,840
- What?
- That's just fur balls.

530
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,480
He does that all the time in the summer.

531
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,640
But... But if he's all
right, that one might...

532
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
- Polly, Polly! Too much.
- What?

533
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,760
Too much. Too much of a good thing always
leaves one wanting less, I always find.

534
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,240
- Ugh.
- What's wrong now?

535
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,360
We wouldn't want you to think

536
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,360
that just because you were one
of her Majesty's civil servants,

537
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,080
we were showing you any excess favouritism.

538
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm sure you wouldn't want that.

539
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh! So you're the rat inspector!

540
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Sorry, Fawlty! Starling inspector.

541
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,160
Starling inspector?

542
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,080
- One for you.
- Thank you.

543
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,280
- And one for you.
- Thank you.

544
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
- Do you mind?
<i>- Qué?</i>

545
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,600
We'll have one Windsor
soup, one paté, please.

546
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,120
- One Windsor...
- Shh!

547
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,000
If the cat's slice is all right,
that might be the poisoned one.

548
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,640
- No, no.
- Yes, he's right.

549
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,880
- And if the cat's one is all right...
- Which it is.

550
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
- We can give him that, can't we?
- Right!

551
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,320
- Mr Fawlty?
- Shut up!

552
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,120
- But, Terry, that's got things on it.
- That's all right, Mrs Fawlty.

553
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
What the eye don't see,
the chef gets away with.

554
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
- Mr Fawlty?
- What is it?

555
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,440
Table seven!

556
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,720
- What?
- Basil!

557
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,520
Sorry, it's just coming.

558
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,920
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

559
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, madam.

560
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,320
I was just trying to give an order to your waiter,
and he walked away while I was doing it.

561
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,600
- Hmm?
- He wasn't paying attention at all.

562
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,920
I'm so sorry. What were you saying?

563
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,480
The waiter wasn't listening
when I was giving him our order.

564
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,280
He seemed more interested
in my fiancée's legs.

565
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
Really? May I?

566
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,840
I don't think so.

567
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,400
In fact, I think there's
a bread roll down there.

568
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,600
- May I give my order?
- Oh, please. Of course.

569
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,120
We'd like one Windsor soup
and one paté, and then a...

570
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,520
Just doing my shoelace up.

571
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,920
Are you going to take my order?

572
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,720
Yes. Polly, would you take...
Take the order here, please, on this table?

573
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,440
Thank you so much.

574
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,080
We'd like one Windsor soup.

575
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,320
One Windsor.

576
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
- One paté.
- He's there, he's there.

577
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,560
- What?
- They're there.

578
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,400
- What do you mean, "They're there"?
- It's all there.

579
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,200
There, there, there, and there.
All there for your enjoyment.

580
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,320
And one paté?

581
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,960
Manuel, would you get
the bread roll, please?

582
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,160
No, no, no. Get the box!

583
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,560
We have a box, a bread box.

584
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,520
For any bread that has gone past its prime.

585
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,960
- And you'd both like the...
- The veal.

586
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,120
The veal's off, I'm afraid.

587
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,040
How can it be? You've only just started.

588
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,760
- Shh, shh!
- Don't "shh" me!

589
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,400
Sorry, but the veal is, in fact, off.
It was never really on. That's a misprint.

590
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,920
- A misprint?
- Yes. It should say...

591
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,280
Eel.

592
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
Eel scallop...

593
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,520
Oh, stop it, will you? Just leave it!
Wait until after the meal!

594
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,520
No. We have to get it, I'm afraid.
Health regulations, before it moulds.

595
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,680
Well, I'll get it then.

596
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,680
No, no! Please. Please, allow us.
All part of the service.

597
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,720
So that's one paté, and one Windsor...soup!

598
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,120
Here's your veal, Mr Carnegie.
Sorry for the delay.

599
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,040
- He's just been given veal!
- Uh, no, no. That's veal substitute.

600
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,800
- Veal substitute?
- It's not very good.

601
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,360
It got rather held up on the boat.
On the way over from...

602
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,560
- Japan.
- Norway.

603
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
It's a sort of a...

604
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,160
Japo-Scandinavian imitation veal substitute,
and I'm afraid that's the last slice, anyway.

605
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,480
- We're leaving.
- Okay, if you insist.

606
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,280
By all means. Be my guest. Thank you.

607
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,400
I want a taxi.

608
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,320
- Polly, would you arrange a taxi, please?
- It's in the bag.

609
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,760
- Is your veal...
- In her bag!

610
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,920
In her bag?

611
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,320
- What?
- Excuse me.

612
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,600
- Do you know where you're going to?
- Can you recommend a restaurant?

613
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,240
Yes, of course. What sort of...

614
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,800
Where is somewhere that serves
really good veal, Polly?

615
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
- Somewhere in the...
- Oh, veal. Yes, of course.

616
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,480
A really good restaurant.
Wait, just a minute, because I...

617
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,120
I do remember a place
where I had some really good veal once.

618
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,960
Only I just can't think of the name of it...
It was, umm... Ooh!

619
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,640
La-di-da.

620
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Did you see <i>Annie Hall?</i>

621
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,760
La-di-da.

622
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,200
Annie who?

623
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,520
What are you doing?

624
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,840
- What?
- He had his hand in my bag!

625
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,120
- What?
- No, no, I...

626
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,280
You know something?

627
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,640
You're getting my dander up,
you grotty little man!

628
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,120
You're asking for a bunch of fives!

629
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
- Bomb scare!
- What?

630
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
There's been a bomb scare.

631
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,920
- A bomb scare?
- Yes.

632
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,160
Yes. That's why he was searching in your bag.
He didn't want to alarm you.

633
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,960
- May I?
- Well, I don't...

634
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,160
Just one moment.

635
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,600
- We had a call, you see.
- Well, shouldn't you get everybody out?

636
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,800
That's why we were looking under your table.
We just didn't want to draw attention...

637
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
Uh, waiter.

638
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,040
- Waiter?
<i>- Un momentito.</i>

639
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,360
<i>Sí?</i>

640
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,480
Some cheese and biscuits
and a coffee, please.

641
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,760
- Anything to follow?
- I've ordered some cheese and a coffee.

642
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,280
- Certainly.
- Coffee, please, Sybil.

643
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,600
Here we are, Mr Carnegie.

644
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,560
Polly, would you get the biscuits, please?

645
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,480
Here they are, Fawlty.

646
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,600
Cheddar, Danish bleu, Edam?

647
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,080
A little Danish bleu, please.

648
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,560
Certainly.

649
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,480
- Edam?
- No, thank you.

650
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
Biscuits?

651
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,440
Would you care for rat?

652
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,200
Just the biscuits then, please, Polly.

653
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,160
Black or white?

654
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,320
- Black or white?
- Black, please.

655
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,880
- Was that a...
- There we are.

656
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,280
Here are the biscuits.

657
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,400
Cream crackers, digestives, Ryvita?

658
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm afraid it's started to rain again.
