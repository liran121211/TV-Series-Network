1
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,080
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,440
- Hello?
- What a shame.

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,640
- Manuel?
- Operator, what is going on?

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,480
Oh, I know.

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,040
I've been trying to get through
to the speaking clock.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,920
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,960
Well, it's engaged.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,960
How awful.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
It's been engaged for ten minutes.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,720
How is this possible?
My wife isn't talking to it.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Hold your head back. That usually stops it.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,120
The speaking clock has taken
the phone off the hook.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,360
Or there's been a light
shower within 20 miles.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,680
Well, you'd better not go on
if it's getting on the bedspread.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,000
Unobtainable. The clock's been cut off.
Obviously didn't pay its bill.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,640
Call me back when you've staunched it.

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,600
I don't know why she stays with him.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,240
Oh, that's pretty.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,520
Hello, you got the guide.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,000
Good evening, Mr Johnson.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
Evening, any messages?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,000
Three, I think.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,000
Three? Everybody wants you, don't they?

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,320
I wouldn't say that.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,200
Ah, well. You're only single once.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,120
Twice can be arranged.

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,400
- What, Basil?
- Nothing, my dear.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,560
We got enough bananas this week, dear?

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,040
So Harry says,
"You don't like me any more. Why not?"

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,760
And he says,
""Cause you got so terribly pretentious."

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,360
And Harry says, "Pretentious, <i>moi?"</i>

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
I'll just try that number.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,120
Oh, that's awfully good, isn't it?

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>"Moi, "</i> ha ha!

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,840
Did you hear it, Basil?

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
- What, dear?
- The joke.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
Oh, a joke. No, I heard you laugh.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,840
I thought perhaps he
was having a tea party.

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
Tea party?

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh, now I understand the banana reference,
you mean you think he looks like a monkey.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
Only from some angles.

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,200
Well, from my angle, he's very attractive.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,400
Attractive?

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,080
You know, easy and amusing and charming.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,640
Charming, eh?

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
Well, he's certainly covered in charms.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
I've never seen so many medals
'round one neck in my life.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,120
He must be the bravest
orangutan in Britain.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,720
What is the point of
decorating yourself like that?

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
They're not just for decoration,
they have symbolic meaning.

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,280
Sybil, that type would wear
a dog turd round its neck

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,200
if it was made of gold.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,400
Basil, you're so ignorant sometimes.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,920
One of them happens to be a rhino's tooth.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,360
One's an ancient Egyptian
fertility symbol...

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,600
Well, that must come in handy.

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,800
It's not supposed to be handy, Basil.

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,080
It goes back to the dawn of civilisation.

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,000
By the look of his forehead, so does he.

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,240
Tell me, Basil, what is it about the
Mediterranean type that antagonises you so?

61
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Is it because women find them attractive?

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,640
- Sybil...
- You seem to think

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
that we girls should be aroused
by people like Gladstone and Earl Haig

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,160
and Baden-Powell, don't you?

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,560
Well, at least they had a certain dignity.

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,840
It's hard to imagine Earl Haig wandering
round with his shirt open at the waist,

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,520
covered with identity bracelets, isn't it?

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,240
Well, he didn't mind the medals, did he?
The military decorations?

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
That's not the point.

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,840
I suppose the reason you confuse them
with monkeys is that monkeys have fun.

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,120
They know how to enjoy themselves.

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,440
That's what makes them sexy, I suppose.
I never thought of that.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,520
I telephoned earlier. The name is Abbott.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh, yes. There hasn't been
a cancellation, I'm afraid,

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,600
so it is still a room without bath.

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,000
- That's fine.
- Oh, good.

78
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,920
Will you just fill that in for me, please?

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,800
Yes, we're terribly busy at the moment.

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
Just enjoying myself. Good evening.

81
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Good evening.

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,680
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
That felt better.

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
Thank you, Mr Abbott.

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,400
Oh, Dr Abbott, sorry.

86
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,480
- Doctor?
- Yes?

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm terribly sorry, we hadn't been told.

88
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,240
- We hadn't been told you were a doctor.
- Oh.

89
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,240
How do you do, Doctor?
Very nice to have you with us, Doctor.

90
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,400
Thank you.

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
You're in room five, Doctor.

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
And Mrs Abbott, how do you do?

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
Dr Abbott, actually.

94
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,600
- I'm sorry?
- Dr Abbott.

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,960
Two doctors.

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,520
- You're two doctors?
- Yes.

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
How did you become two doctors?

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,360
Most unusual. I mean,
did you take the exam twice, or...

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,080
No. My wife's a doctor.

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I'm a doctor.

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,000
You're a doctor, too.
So you're three doctors!

102
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,360
No, I'm just one doctor.
My wife is another doctor.

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,600
Manuel.

104
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,720
Your room is at the top of the stairs
and on to the left.

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
Oh, I see! I thought when
you said two doctors...

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Manuel, would you take the doctors'
cases up to number five, please?

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,880
Yes, this way please, Doctors.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,120
When you said that you were two doctors,
I thought perhaps you were a doctor of medicine

109
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,760
and perhaps a doctor of...

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
Did you get through all right?

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
One was busy. I'll try again in a minute.

112
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,720
I forgot to ask,
any news on a room for my mother?

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,320
Oh, yes.

114
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,360
Number 16 has decided to stay, I'm afraid.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
I tried a couple of other places for you
but everywhere's full at the moment.

116
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Oh, well, no hassle.
She won't mind sharing with me.

117
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
Lucky mum!

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,920
I'll just go and try that number again.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
Here, use this one.

120
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,760
Oh. Thank you.

121
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,040
May I ask...

122
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,520
The sign on the chain
by the Egyptian fertility symbol,

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,280
what is that?

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,320
It's, um... Greek astrological sign.

125
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,920
Oh, it's beautiful. Where did you get it?

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,960
Um, Colchester, I think.

127
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,120
- Colchester!
- Hello.

128
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,480
Can I speak to John Lawson, please?

129
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,680
All right, I'll hold on.

130
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,680
So, your mother will be arriving tomorrow?

131
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,120
Yes, first thing. She's getting
the overnight train down from Newcastle.

132
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,520
Newcastle?

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Yeah, visiting grandchildren. She's 77.

134
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,080
77.

135
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,280
Isn't that amazing?

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,160
Old people are wonderful

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
when they have so much life, aren't they?

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
Gives us all hope, doesn't it?

139
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,040
My mother, on the other hand,
is a little bit of a trial, really.

140
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
You know, it's all right
when they have the life force,

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,000
but mother, well,

142
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,680
she's got more of the death force, really.

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,880
She's a worrier...

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
No, it's all right. I'll hold.

145
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,600
She has these, well,
morbid fears they are, really.

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
Vans is one.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Rats... Doorknobs...

148
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,920
Birds, heights, open spaces...

149
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,560
Confined spaces...

150
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,680
It's very difficult getting the space
right for her, really. You know...

151
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,160
Footballs, bicycles, cows...

152
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,560
And she's always on
about men following her.

153
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,240
I don't know what she thinks
they're going to do to her.

154
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,960
Vomit on her, Basil says.

155
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,400
Can I leave my number? He can call me back.

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
- And death.
- I see. Right.

157
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,480
She's frightened of death.

158
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
I've told her there's
nothing she can do about it.

159
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400
On about it the whole time, she is.

160
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,320
I mean, nature can only take its course.

161
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,920
The only thing you can hope for is that
it won't be long drawn out and painful.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,280
But she can't accept that.

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Oh, excuse me. Hello, John?

164
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,600
How are you? Oh, fine.
Just down for the weekend.

165
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,600
- Charming people.
- Hmm?

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
The Abbotts. Charming couple.

167
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
Yes, all three of them.

168
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,920
No, I'm all right for tonight.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,240
You know dear, that, um,
that outfit Mrs Abbott was wearing,

170
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,880
you should get yourself
something like that.

171
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
What, for the gardening, you mean?

172
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,520
No, I can't tomorrow night.
How about lunch?

173
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Yes, attractive woman.
How old would you say she was, Sybil?

174
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,400
- 48, 50?
- Oh, now, Sybil!

175
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,040
I really don't know,
Basil, perhaps she's 12.

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Favourite. Magic.

177
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,760
It's nice to have that kind
of person staying, isn't it?

178
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,600
Professional class, educated, civilised.

179
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,160
We've both ends of the evolutionary scale
this week, haven't we?

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,760
Good evening.

181
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,320
We're just going out for a stroll.
What time do you serve dinner?

182
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
7:30 till 9:00.

183
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,960
See you tomorrow then. Ciao.

184
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,720
Do you have a guide to Torquay?

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,880
A guide...

186
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
Um, oh dear.
I think we're out of them again.

187
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,840
Do you want to look at this one?
I got it in town.

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,960
Oh, thanks.

189
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,280
"What's on in Torquay."

190
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
One of the world's shortest books.

191
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,160
What?

192
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,200
One of the world's shortest books.

193
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,880
Like <i>The Wit of Margaret Thatcher</i>

194
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,280
or <i>Great English Lovers.</i>

195
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
He's very funny,
isn't he, Basil?

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,920
Thank you.

197
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,600
- Are you taking dinner here tonight?
- Sorry?

198
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,760
Are you dining here tonight,
here in this unfashionable dump?

199
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,040
I wasn't planning to.

200
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
No, not really your scene, is it?

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,680
Thought I'd try somewhere in town.
Anywhere you'd recommend?

202
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,160
What sort of food were you thinking of?
Fruit, or...

203
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,440
- Anywhere they do French food?
- Yes, France, I believe.

204
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,200
They seem to like it there,

205
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,360
and the swim would certainly sharpen
your appetite.

206
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,200
You'd better hurry.
The tide leaves in six minutes.

207
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,680
Excuse my husband's sledgehammer wit,
Mr Johnson.

208
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
There is a very nice
place, La Pomme D'Amour.

209
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,520
La Pomme D'Amour. The apple of love.

210
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
Yes, in Orchard Street.

211
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,360
Or that ancient Egyptian place,
the Golden Dog something...

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,120
Do enjoy yourself. We'll see you later.

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Thank you.

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,960
- I have had it up to here with you.
- What, dear?

215
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,880
You never get it right, do you?

216
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,640
You're either crawling all over them,
licking their boots,

217
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,240
or spitting poison at them
like some Benzedrine puff adder.

218
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Just trying to enjoy myself.

219
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,560
- Did you enjoy your beef?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

220
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,720
Good. Would you care for dessert?

221
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,040
- No, just coffee, thank you.
- Just coffee for me.

222
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
Two coffees, Sybil.
Two coffees. Here. Please. Dear.

223
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,640
Would you care for a
little something with us?

224
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
A little aperitif, cognac, brandy?

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
On us... with us... which we'll pay for,
on the house, as it were?

226
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, thank you.

227
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,080
I'd like a cognac, if I may?

228
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,640
- Dr Abbott?
- A port, thank you.

229
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,840
<i>Mon plaisir.</i>

230
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,080
- Coffee for you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

231
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,600
- And for you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

232
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,640
Have you been to Torquay before?

233
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,400
Not for a few years, no.

234
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,640
We had a free weekend, and we suddenly
thought we'd like to get out of London.

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,400
- Lovely. White or black?
- Black, thank you.

236
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
- And black for you, Doctor?
- Thank you.

237
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
Cognac for you, Doctor.

238
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,080
It's rather fascinating,
your both being doctors.

239
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,480
Port for you, Doctor.

240
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,160
At one stage,
I was contemplating becoming a surgeon.

241
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,400
A tree surgeon!

242
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
Thank you, Sybil.

243
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,000
Had to give it up.

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Couldn't stand the sight of sap. Ha!

245
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,960
It's a bit old, isn't it, dear?

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,720
My great-grandfather on my mother's side
was a doctor, so it was always felt I might...

247
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,480
Run a hotel.

248
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,680
Are you both in general practice?

249
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,240
No, I'm a paediatrician.

250
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
- Feet!
- Children.

251
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, Basil!

252
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,200
Children have feet, don't they?
That's how they move around.

253
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
You must take a look next time.
It's most interesting.

254
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
And you, Doctor, are you a...

255
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm a psychiatrist.

256
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,480
Very nice too, cheers.

257
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,320
I'll get you another one. Sorry.

258
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,920
A psychiatrist. How fascinating.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,560
We never had a psychiatrist
staying here before.

260
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,880
We had a faith healer
the first month we were open.

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,040
Really?

262
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,080
It's a relatively new profession,
psychiatry, isn't it?

263
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Well, Freud started about 1880.

264
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,520
Yes, but it's only now
we're seeing them on the television.

265
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,640
Here we are. I must... Excuse me.

266
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,480
- How long have you had this hotel?
- My husband and I...

267
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
Keep back, keep back.

268
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
- What is it?
- Abbott.

269
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,360
- What the matter with him?
- Psychiatrist.

270
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,000
Look at him. Look.
Look at the way he's listening, see?

271
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,800
He's taking it all in. She doesn't realise.

272
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,000
Look at the way she's talking.
They've got photographic memories.

273
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,240
Uh, Sybil!

274
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
- Sybil?
- Yes, Basil?

275
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Could I just bother you, dear?

276
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,920
- What is it?
- Just a little problem.

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,720
Nothing personal,
nothing of a private nature.

278
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Just in here...

279
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,920
Excuse me, would you?

280
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
What is it, Basil?

281
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Just take it easy, okay?
Just keep your distance.

282
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
- Remember who you are, all right?
- Remember what?

283
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,240
Just don't tell him too much
about yourself, all right?

284
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
Basil, I'm perfectly capa...

285
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,960
All right. All right.
What have you told him?

286
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,280
Nothing, we were talking about Scotland.

287
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
Scotland?
What's he want to know about Scotland?

288
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
Oh, Basil Fawl...

289
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,640
- Don't do that!
- Why are you so nervous?

290
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm not nervous!
I'm just saying take it easy, all right?

291
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
All of us, just take it easy, all right?

292
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,960
What's got into you?

293
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,520
Nothing's got into...
I'm just saying take...

294
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Can't I say "take it easy"
without starting a panic?

295
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
I mean, what is going on here?

296
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Mr Fawlty, take it easy.

297
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,640
Now look...

298
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,200
Get one thing clear, all right?

299
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
You don't tell me to take it easy.

300
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,360
I don't pay you to tell me to take it easy.
I pay you to take it...

301
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,360
No, I pay you to tell you to take it easy,
so take it easy, all right?

302
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,280
Listen, why are you getting so upset?

303
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,560
- I'm not.
- You liked him when he arrived.

304
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Look, look...

305
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,160
And just because you find
out he's a psychiatrist...

306
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm not bothered by that.

307
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
If he wants to be a psychiatrist
that's his own funeral.

308
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,440
They're all as mad as
bloody March hares anyway.

309
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,480
That's not the point.
How does he earn his money?

310
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,160
He gets... He gets paid
for sticking his nose...

311
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,840
- Oh, Basil.
- No, I'm going to have my say.

312
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,080
Into people's private, um... Details.

313
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
Just speaking for myself,
I don't want some total stranger

314
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,800
nosing around in my private parts...
Details! That's all I'm saying.

315
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,960
They're here on holiday.
They're just here to enjoy themselves.

316
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,360
- He can't!
- Can't what?

317
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,000
He can't tell me anything about myself
that I don't know already.

318
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,840
All this psychiatry,
it's a load of tommyrot.

319
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Here.

320
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,160
You know what they're
all obsessed with, don't you?

321
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
You know what they say it's all
about, don't you?

322
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,480
Hmm? Sex.

323
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,720
Everything's connected with sex.
Huh! What a load of cobblers.

324
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,800
Yes, you see, if they wanted to do that,

325
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
well, they'd have to close the hotel,
wouldn't they?

326
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,160
Yes, if you would, just sign that.
Thank you so much.

327
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,920
Yes. We were just speculating how people
in your profession arrange their holidays.

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,920
How often you can get away.

329
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,760
How often do you manage it?

330
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
Pardon?

331
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
How often can you and your wife manage it?

332
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,760
You don't mind my asking?

333
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,720
Not at all. Not at all.

334
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,040
About average, since you asked.

335
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,840
- Average?
- Mmm-hmm.

336
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
What would be average?

337
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
Well, you tell me.

338
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,280
Well, uh...

339
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,720
Couple of times a year?

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,480
What?

341
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,720
Once a year?

342
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,160
Well, we knew it must be difficult.

343
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,480
My wife didn't see how you
could manage it at all.

344
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,680
Well, as you've asked,
two or three times a week, actually.

345
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,560
- A week?
- Yes. Pretty normal, isn't it?

346
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,800
We're quite normal down here
in Torquay, you know?

347
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,400
And he says, "Pretentious? <i>Moi?"</i>

348
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,320
I always like a man who can make me laugh.

349
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,600
- Are you all right, Mr Fawlty?
- Mmm-hmm, yes, yes. Fine.

350
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,600
- What's the matter, Basil?
- Nothing, dear. Just talking to Dr Abbott.

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,640
If I had the money to go to a psychiatrist,
he's just the sort I'd choose.

352
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,200
I can't think of anything nicer
than having a good old heart-to-heart.

353
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,240
I'm sure they understand women.

354
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,000
- Sybil?
- What, darling?

355
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,480
Do you kn...

356
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Do you know what he asked me,
just now, out there?

357
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
What? What?

358
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,800
He asked me...

359
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,280
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Basil.

360
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm telling you the truth.
Honest as God's witness!

361
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,120
What's got into you today?

362
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,720
He turned round and asked
me, just like that.

363
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,720
- What did he say?
- He said...

364
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,200
His wife said...

365
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,360
They're talking about holidays, Basil.

366
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
I was just saying to them
about how difficult it is to get any.

367
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,160
Twice a year! Oh, my...What did I say?

368
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,840
- It doesn't matter.
- How was I to know?

369
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,480
Hello!

370
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,600
We were at cross purposes just now.

371
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,720
There you were talking about sex,
I thought you were talking about walks.

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
Not sex! Holidays, holidays!

373
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,520
Ha, sex. Ha, ha, ha.

374
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,640
No, my wife and I have
one about twice a year.

375
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,880
I mean a holiday, a holiday.

376
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,760
Whereas so far as a good walk goes,

377
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,000
we have a jolly good walk
about two or three times a week, average.

378
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,400
Well, we're just taking ours now.

379
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,600
Thank you. Well, enjoy it. Uh, the walk!

380
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
I'm so sorry.

381
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,880
My name is Raylene Miles.
I have a reservation.

382
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,280
Ahh, yes. That's right.
Would you be so kind as to fill this in?

383
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,160
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you.

384
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,760
Very nice.

385
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh, ah... Thank you.

386
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Your thing. I mean your charms!
Your charm, in the middle.

387
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes, I know.

388
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,680
- May I ask what it is?
- It's a Saint Christopher's medal.

389
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,040
- Saint...
- Saint Christopher.

390
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,320
Patron saint of travellers.

391
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,640
Hello, dear.

392
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
Saint Christopher's medal,
protects travellers.

393
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,120
Very pretty.

394
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,480
Yes, isn't she?
Where did you put the order forms?

395
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
- Down there, dear.
- Where?

396
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,840
Down here, dear. Um...

397
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,240
Hello! Can I have the key
for number six, please?

398
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,440
You're back early this evening, Mr Johnson.

399
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, well, got to be up early for mother.

400
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Thank you. We put you in number seven.

401
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,400
- Manuel!
- It's all right, dear. I'll take them up.

402
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,640
We have a Spanish porter
we're training at the moment.

403
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,800
It'd be quicker to train an ape!

404
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Never mind, Manuel.

405
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,080
Oh!

406
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,960
I was just wondering,
are you in fact Australian at all,

407
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
by any chance, may I ask?

408
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,600
Oh, dear. Is my accent that strong?

409
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,080
Oh no, no. It's just that you're quite tall,
so I thought, perhaps, you know.

410
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,920
Here we are, this is your room.
I hope it's to your liking.

411
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,960
A view of the English Riviera,
down there, behind the trees.

412
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,720
This is your bathroom, here we are...

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,400
Oh, light's not working. I'll just fix it.

414
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,720
Have you had a tiring journey?

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,240
Seven hours in the coach, is the...

416
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,040
Is the dining room still open?

417
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
The chef leaves at 9:00, I'm afraid.
We could always do you sandwiches.

418
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,880
I'd like a hot meal, really.

419
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,120
Is there a restaurant near here?

420
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,080
There's an awfully good little Welsh place,
Leek House, about five minutes' walk.

421
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
You'd have to go straight away.

422
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,640
That'll do fine.

423
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,680
Just turn left out at the gate and
straight on and it's on your right.

424
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,800
You left this downstairs.

425
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,280
Sorry! I was trying the switch!

426
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,880
Sybil! Sybil! Sybil! Sybil! I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was there!

427
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,680
- I was trying the switch.
- It's pathetic, Basil.

428
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
No, look, Sybil,
I was reaching round for the switch.

429
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
Don't bother.

430
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,680
The lights weren't working
in the bathroom, right?

431
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,800
Okay? So I went in, checked the fitting,
which was loose...

432
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,560
I've read about it, Basil.
The male menopause it's called.

433
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,760
Oh, and one word, if you're going to grope a girl,
have the gallantry to stay in the room with her

434
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
while you're doing it, hmm?

435
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm sorry. I do apologise for just now.
I was sort of feeling for the switch...

436
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, I realise. That's perfectly all right.

437
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,800
- I hope your wife didn't...
- Oh, no, no.

438
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,240
My wife, she's been on about that.

439
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,520
Uh, where was that restaurant again?

440
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,560
Out of the gate, turn left,
five minutes on your right. Leek House.

441
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

442
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,920
"Pretentious, <i>moi?"</i>

443
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
Yes? Can I help you?

444
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,440
Um... I was just wondering
if I could get, um...

445
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
A drink now?

446
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,560
A drink?

447
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,680
Well, a bottle of champagne.

448
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,360
- Champagne?
- Yes.

449
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,280
I see. You are aware of our rule
about visitors, are you?

450
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,440
Hmm?

451
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,240
No visitors in guests' rooms after 10:00.

452
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,960
- Oh.
- Of the opposite... sex.

453
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,800
- No, I wasn't.
- Ah.

454
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
But I am now.
So you'll send up the champagne, will you?

455
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,320
- What?
- The champagne.

456
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,120
- You're drinking it on your own, are you?
- Guess I'll have to.

457
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,280
Very well.
One bottle of champagne, for one.

458
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,400
- Thank you.
- And one glass.

459
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,600
That's all I'll need,
unless you'd care to join me?

460
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,200
No, thank you. Not while I'm on the job.

461
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,520
That's when I enjoy it the most.

462
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,440
Manuel, Manuel, Manuel.

463
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
Bottle of champagne, one glass, quick!

464
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,880
Mr Fawlty?

465
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,600
Did you know there's a
psychiatrist staying?

466
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes, yes I did.

467
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
Has he come for the Major?

468
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,840
- What?
- Has he come for the Major?

469
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,520
- No.
- Oh, good.

470
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
We were rather worried.

471
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm sure they have them in Birmingham too.

472
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,760
Good night, ladies!

473
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Just coming.

474
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,320
Won't be a moment.

475
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,240
This wall... We had some complaints
from downstairs

476
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,960
so I'm just giving it a check.

477
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,280
Yes, I think that's fine. No, hang on.

478
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,240
Nope, we're all right.
Fine. Well, sorry to disturb you.

479
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
- Good night.
- Good night.

480
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,720
- Can I help you?
- The bathroom?

481
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,360
Yes, second on the left. Thank you.

482
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,240
- Yes?
- It's just coming.

483
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,280
<i>Stupidísimo!</i> You continental cretin!
I'm sorry, I'll get you another one.

484
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,040
<i>Un otro. Pronto! Pronto! Pronto!</i>

485
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,840
Yes, fine, thank you.
I'm afraid that Spanish ape...

486
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,480
Sorry, person... bungled it again.

487
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
Dago birdbrain.

488
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,320
God knows how they ever
got an Armada together.

489
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,680
Still, I'll clear all this up.

490
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,160
If you... If you'd like to, uh...
Go back to your rooms...

491
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
Thank you.

492
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,840
Fawlty.

493
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,440
- Yes?
- Here, here.

494
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,600
I... I thought you ought to know.

495
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,040
- What?
- There's...

496
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,520
There's a psychiatrist in the hotel.

497
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,640
Yes, I know.

498
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,960
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

499
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,760
Oh. Well, apparently,
he's dressed up as a guest.

500
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
He is a guest, Major.

501
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,720
Oh, well, your guess is as good as mine.

502
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Perhaps he has come to get you.

503
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,840
Come.

504
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,560
Oh, thank you. On the table, please.

505
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,520
Thank you.

506
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
Yes?

507
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Whew! Filthy habit.

508
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,480
- The bathroom?
- Second on the left.

509
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,200
Aaah! Who is it?

510
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
- It's all right!
- Who is it?

511
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
- It's only me! Please!
- What do you want?

512
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,080
What's going on?

513
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Nothing! I didn't know she was in here.
I just came in to check the walls.

514
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you mind? Sorry.

515
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,240
I thought you'd gone to the restaurant.

516
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,720
I was just so tired.

517
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
That's fine. Sorry to disturb you.
Bloody walls.

518
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,160
You all right now?

519
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,000
- What was that?
- Hmm? Nothing, dear.

520
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
Why was she screaming? What were you doing?

521
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
What's going on?

522
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,120
Nothing. She thought there
was someone in her room.

523
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,440
- Someone in her room?
- Yes.

524
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,240
Have to charge her double then.

525
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,400
What were you doing in there?

526
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,120
- Is she all right?
- She is all right.

527
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,720
What were you doing in there?

528
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,520
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Fawlty.
I didn't realise it was you.

529
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
That's all right.
I'll tell you in a moment.

530
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,880
Silly of me. I didn't know it was him.
He came in to check the walls.

531
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,280
To check the walls?

532
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,880
Manuel. Manuel, quick.

533
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,240
Come on!

534
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,440
Quick!

535
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
Oh... 'elp...

536
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
<i>Socorro! Socorro!</i>

537
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,520
'elp! 'elp!

538
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,080
Basil.

539
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,040
Basil?

540
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,040
Mrs Fawlty, Mrs Fawlty!

541
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
Mrs Fawlty, Mr Fawlty...

542
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,800
- What?
- He hurt. He fall off ladder!

543
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,160
- Off a ladder?
<i>- Sí, sí.</i> Come, come, come.

544
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
- What was he doing up a ladder?
- He try to see girl.

545
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,400
- What?
- He try to see in room to see girl.

546
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,160
She make him crazy. Come, come, come.

547
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,280
I see.

548
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,600
I tell him careful, but he go to see girl.

549
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,760
Right.

550
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,680
Hello, dear. I was just going to, uh...

551
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
What the...

552
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,160
What in God's name do you think you're doing?
What did you hit me for?

553
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,480
How dare you!

554
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,000
How dare you!

555
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,680
Have you gone mad? What's got into you?

556
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,080
- You really don't know?
- No, I don't.

557
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,840
What were you doing up that ladder?
Come on!

558
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,560
I was trying to see the girl.

559
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,320
Is that so strange?

560
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,680
Stop hitting me!

561
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,680
Get away from this door and don't you
dare try and come in here tonight.

562
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,920
Mad.

563
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
She's gone completely mad.

564
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,800
Crazy, she go crazy.

565
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,760
- I mean what...
- Crazy.

566
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,040
I say to her, you try and see in girl's room,
and she go crazy.

567
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,600
What?

568
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,600
I tell her you go to see girl in room.
You crazy about this girl, okay?

569
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Okay, so...

570
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,120
You go up to try to look at her
and Mrs Fawlty, she go crazy.

571
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,840
You crazy little dago!

572
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,120
Now, that's how an Englishman would do it,
you see?

573
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,240
Now, a German, a German would go...

574
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,640
No, that's enough for tonight.

575
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
All right, we'll go on with your training
in the morning.

576
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,360
We're just training him
in the art of hotel management.

577
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,560
It's rather interesting actually.
He's from Barcelona, and one of the more...

578
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,640
Sorry, I missed the door.

579
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,240
- Oh.
- Everything all right?

580
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
Everything, uh, normal?

581
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine, well...

582
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,800
I'll leave you to it, then.
I mean to go to bed.

583
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,400
To sleep! To sleep, that is.

584
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,840
Perchance to dream, ha, ha.

585
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,400
Have a good night... Good night's sleep.

586
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,160
- Sleep well.
- Good night. And you.

587
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,280
Thank you, yes, I will.

588
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,000
God knows where.

589
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,440
I'll get you, you pilked-down ponce.

590
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,200
Are you all right?

591
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,600
- Hmm?
- Are you all right?

592
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,480
Yes, fine. Give me one of those.

593
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,120
Right, go on. Go on.

594
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,480
- Sybil, dear?
- What do you want?

595
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,560
- Got your tea for you, dear.
- Just leave it outside the room.

596
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes, all right, dear.

597
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,480
Um...

598
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,880
Sybil?

599
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm not speaking to you, Basil.

600
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,280
Could I just have my electric razor, dear?

601
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,960
Just for the guests?

602
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
Thank you, dear. Look, look...

603
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,120
- Basil, will you...
- Just let me explain.

604
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,480
Get your foot out of the door.

605
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,400
- Let me explain.
- I'm not interested.

606
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,600
When I said, "That girl,"

607
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,280
I wasn't talking about that ray...
Something, the Australian girl.

608
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,080
I was talking about the girl
in the room next to hers,

609
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,320
in Johnson's room!

610
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Johnson smuggled a girl
into his room last night.

611
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,960
That is the one I was trying to get a look at,
not that Australian hayseed.

612
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,400
Basil, you've had eight hours
to think of something.

613
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,840
Is that really the best
you can come up with?

614
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,080
You don't believe it.

615
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
- Oh, go away.
- Right, I'll get her.

616
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,920
I'll get her and show her to you.

617
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,680
- Yes, you do that.
- I will.

618
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,800
Right. All right.

619
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,760
Go.

620
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,080
Come.

621
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,960
Mr Johnson, did you want your guide back?

622
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,760
Oh, thank you, yes.

623
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,880
See you later. Thank you.

624
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,840
Okay, darling.

625
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,000
Right, the game's up.

626
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,200
Up there.

627
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,520
Bit of game pie, got stuck up there.

628
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,560
Right, everything back to normal.

629
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,280
Enjoy your walk.

630
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,040
There's enough material there
for an entire conference.

631
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,360
Ah!

632
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,880
Okay, all clear.

633
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,560
Right, that's it.

634
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,200
Aah! What are you doing?
Oh, jeez, what going on?

635
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,960
- I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.
- You scared the hell out of me!

636
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,800
I'm awfully sorry. There's a girl in there.

637
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,800
The bloke smuggled her in...
Oh, hello, dear.

638
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,200
Just explaining to Miss Miles
about our little problem,

639
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,120
with the extra guest, Mr Johnson's friend,
in six, last night.

640
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,040
What's that on your hand, Basil?

641
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,280
What... Oh, that's some stuff
in the cupboard, dear.

642
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,080
Something I knocked over.

643
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,360
Sorry! I got confused.

644
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,080
Sorry, I got confused.

645
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,920
Sybil! Sybil! Sybil!

646
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Sybil! Sybil! Sybil!
Look, I'll tell her to go.

647
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm gonna get the other girl
just to prove it to you,

648
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,400
but I'll tell Miss Miles to...

649
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,320
To leave. Out. Out!

650
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,200
Excuse me.

651
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,120
I do apologise, but I'm afraid
I shall have to ask you to...

652
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,120
Come in.

653
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,280
Sorry to bother you, I thought I'd better
apologise for my husband's behaviour.

654
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,520
No, please, really, Mrs Fawlty.

655
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,080
He's going through rather a disturbed time
at the moment.

656
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,440
No, please look,
I don't quite understand,

657
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,240
he does seem a bit worked
up about something,

658
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,960
but I'm sure there's some
quite innocent explanation.

659
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,920
Basil.

660
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,680
Hi, dear. Just checking the doors.

661
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,040
All right, what's going on?

662
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,800
I was in the bathroom.

663
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
Yes, she was, dear, so I just popped in

664
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,400
to have a look at these hinges.
You know, the ones we've...

665
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Do you really imagine,
even in your wildest dreams,

666
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,520
that a girl like this could possibly be interested
in an ageing, brilliantined stick insect like you?

667
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,480
- A girl like who, dear?
- This one, Basil.

668
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,480
The one you've been chasing
ever since she arrived.

669
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
Dear woman, are you out of your mind?

670
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,200
What are you doing in there?

671
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,000
You know the trouble
we've been having with these hinges.

672
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,760
Why would I... All right,
if you really want to know,

673
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,560
I came to apologise for
the incident just now,

674
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,840
when I thought she was
that girl in Johnson's room,

675
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,080
you know, when I put my hand on the...

676
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,880
Sybil, Sybil. Look...

677
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,000
If you think I've got
time to listen to any more

678
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,240
of your hopeless lily-livered
jellyfish lies...

679
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,040
They are not lies. I am trying to...

680
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,360
Why can't you be a man?

681
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,040
If you want to grope the guests,
why can't you at least be honest about it

682
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
without making up
some pathetic song and dance...

683
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
Shut up!

684
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,400
- Oh, you've done it now.
- No, I haven't. I'm just going to.

685
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm fed up with you,
you rancorous, coiffeured old sow!

686
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,640
Why don't you syringe the doughnuts out of your
ear and get some sense into the dormant organ

687
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,680
you keep hidden in that
rat's maze of yours?

688
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,560
- Basil, Bas...
- There is a woman in that room,

689
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
that Johnson smuggled in last night.

690
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,640
That's the woman I've been
trying to get hold of.

691
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,360
Right, right! Stand there.

692
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,320
Stand there and watch.

693
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,000
- Champagne?
- What?

694
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,520
Another bottle of champagne, perhaps?

695
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,640
I thought you said you rather enjoyed it
when you were on the job?

696
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,440
Have you got a screw loose?

697
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,800
A screw? No, no. It's just that I thought
that I'd rather formed the impression

698
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,840
that there was someone
in the room, there, with you.

699
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,240
A female person. Perhaps a lady.

700
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,400
An opposite person of the contradictory gender,
that sort of thing.

701
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,600
Mrs Johnson is in here, yes.

702
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,920
Oh, of course.

703
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,840
I should have guessed. Oh, yes. Of course,

704
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,680
the little woman, eh? The only thing is,

705
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
I thought you told my
wife that you were single?

706
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,360
I am.

707
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,360
I see. So who's this Mrs Johnson then?

708
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,600
The late President's wife, or...

709
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,360
She's my mother.

710
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,760
Your mother?

711
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,360
Oh, I see.

712
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,760
This bit of crumpet's your old
mummy, is she?

713
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
Oh, this is rich.

714
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,000
Old mother Johnson popped up
for a quickie, did she? May I meet her?

715
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,120
Certainly.

716
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,840
Mother Johnson, mother Johnson?

717
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,800
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

718
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,040
How do you do? Are you enjoying your stay?

719
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,280
Yes, thank you.

720
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,720
Well, I'll get the champagne.

721
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
This calls for a celebration.

722
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm on holiday.
