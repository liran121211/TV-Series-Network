1
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,920
- It's only a hundred.
- Nothing to them.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,880
- I said I'd pay it back in six weeks.
- Or knock it off your wages.

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,560
- She said it would be all right.
- Poll!

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,280
If he would have said "No"
three weeks ago when I asked him,

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,960
- I could have gotten the money somewhere else.
- Ask him this morning.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,240
I've asked him three
times, it's embarrassing.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,440
Tell him if he won't let you have
it, you'll go.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,240
- I've got to have it this weekend.
- Well, ask him.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,400
Me and you practically run
the bleedin' place for him.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,160
Ah, Polly. Your paintings brushes.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,720
- Thank you, Manuel.
- Here.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,640
Your change is 44p.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,160
What's all that?

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,120
I make a paella, a surprise tonight.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,440
My mother's recipe is mm-mmm.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,160
- But does Terry know?
- Perhaps Mr Fawlty say?

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,080
Anything wrong?

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,440
- Nothing you could do anything about.
- Are you sure?

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
Our 15th wedding anniversary today...

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,840
Guess who's forgotten?

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,240
Oh, no.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,720
I didn't think he'd forget this year.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Not after what happened
when he forgot last year.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,640
I shouldn't be so thin-skinned about it.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm just cursed with a sensitive nature.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,960
Still that's the way I am.
We all have our cross to bear.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Do you know what poem
that's based on, Polly?

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
- No.
<i>- Ode to Joy.</i>

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Hello, dear.

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,920
Polly, you won't forget to put some
more splits in the bar, will you?

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,680
I don't expect Polly will forget, Basil.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,320
- Just reminding her, dear.
- Oh, were you?

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,040
I thought so, yes.
It sounded like it to me.

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,960
You don't have to worry about Polly
forgetting anything important.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,240
- Don't I?
- No, you don't.

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,480
Good. How splendid.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,840
- She doesn't forget things.
- Doesn't she?

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
Can you remember the last time she did?

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,920
No, but then, my memory isn't very good.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
You can say that again.

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
Can I, dear? Thank you.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,840
I've forgotten what it was.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,840
Don't worry, Basil...

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,440
Provided you can remember
the things that matter to you.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Do I detect the smell of burning martyr?

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Mr Fawlty, it's your anniversary!

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
- Don't let on.
- What?

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm pretending I've forgotten.
I forgot last year and got flayed for it.

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,400
We've got some friends
arriving in about 10 minutes

50
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,720
for a surprise drinks party.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,920
Manuel's making a special
paella for tonight,

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
got some champagne,
but don't tell her I've remembered yet.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,520
Let's let her have a bit of a fume.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,320
Wouldn't it be simpler to boil her in oil?

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes, but not as economical.

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,360
Hi, Mr Fawlty, what time for the paella?

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
Er... 9:00, but, secret, eh?

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,080
Ah, <i>sí, sí.</i>

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,280
- Oh, Mr Fawlty.
- Hm-mmm?

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,240
- Have you decided about the car?
- The car?

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,840
The money for the car.

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
I spoke to Mrs Fawlty.
She said it was all right.

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,440
I don't think she quite understands

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,880
the cash flow situation
vis-à-vis the frozen assets...

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,400
It's only 100.
I'd pay you back in six weeks.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Let me think about it.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,720
I've got to know this weekend.
They won't hold it.

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,520
This week? You should have told me.

69
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,560
I told you three weeks ago.

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,320
Look, it's my anniversary.
I've got friends arriving. We'll discuss it later.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,480
When they get here,
give me a hand with the coats and drinks.

72
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,760
I scratch your back, you scratch mine, eh?

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,000
What's this, then?

74
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,400
Good morning, Mr Fawlty.

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,240
Good morning, ladies.

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Could I have a word with you, Basil?

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,120
Could it wait a few minutes, dear?

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,240
No.

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,560
Is everything all right?
You seem a little tense.

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Do you know what day it is today, Basil?

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,720
It's the 16th today, dear.

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,280
- It's the 17th, Basil.
- It's the 16th today, dear.

83
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,960
It's the 17th, Basil.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,920
We'll soon settle this.

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,600
Oh, yes, you are right. The 17th of April.

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,400
Well, well, well.

87
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,120
Does that stir any memories in you?

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
Memories?

89
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,400
Agincourt?

90
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,720
- What?
- Anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt.

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
Trafalgar?

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,160
Crécy? Poitiers? Yom Kippur?

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
Mr Fawlty,
Manuel says he's cooking a paella.

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
It's for Mrs Fawlty. Anniversary...

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
- I can do paella, you know.
- Yes, I know.

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,760
I have been to catering school.

97
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,040
Yes, but he is Spanish.
I thought it would be...

98
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,600
Gazpacho, chicken andaluz, eggplant español,
Franco Fritters, I can do it.

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,640
Of course you can.

100
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,480
But he's wanted to do it ever since he got here.
I thought it would be rather nice. Just tonight.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
I don't want to cause trouble.

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, you do.

103
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,680
Now, don't you start.
I don't want an argument.

104
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
- No, please, please!
- Be quiet!

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,040
I've told him I want you to do it.

106
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,880
Mrs Fawlty, she go!

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
- What?
- She leave! She go out!

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,680
What?

109
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,880
Sybil?

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Sybil! Sybil! Sybil, no!

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,640
You don't understand! I remembered.

112
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,440
There's a party. I've invited people over.
It's our anniversary!

113
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,040
Everything all right?

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Bit of a bump. Just smoothing it out.

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,040
- Are we too early?
- Oh, not at all. Come on in.

116
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
They're here! What do I say?

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,960
Say she's, um...

118
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,400
"She's um"... Oh, brilliant!

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
- Is a surprise party.
- Yes!

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
- She no here...
- Right!

121
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,440
That is surprise.

122
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,640
Hello, Bas.

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,760
- Say she's ill!
- She's ill.

124
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,920
- What?
- She's ill, Sybil.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
What would you like to drink?

126
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,360
- Syb, ill?
- Yes.

127
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,960
What's the matter?

128
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,320
Did you hear that? I said, "Syb-ill?"

129
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
- Yes.
- Have you got it?

130
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,000
No, I'm fine.

131
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,240
No, I call her "Syb." So, "Syb-ill."

132
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,120
"Bas-well."

133
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,560
Man-well.

134
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,400
- What's the matter, Basil?
- What have you done to her, eh?

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
- Roger!
- She knows my name.

136
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,680
She's been learning it all night.

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,680
- What's the matter, Basil?
- Nothing.

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,720
- With Sybil?
- Oh, with Sybil... Quite a bit, actually.

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
- Oh, dear.
- She's fine. Absolutely fine.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,520
She's feeling dreadful, but she'll live.
That's what counts in the long run, doesn't it?

141
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,960
I'll pop up and see her.

142
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,080
You don't want to bother.
Come on, have a drink.

143
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
- No, you go on. I'll see you in a minute.
- No, Alice. I wouldn't actually.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
- Let them have a natter.
- No, I mustn't.

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,640
She's up there on her own.
I'm sure she'd like a little company.

146
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,840
- Uh-huh.
- I know I would.

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
You wouldn't if you looked like her.

148
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,840
She's very swollen up. She's looks very...
You know what Sybil's like about her appearance.

149
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,640
Don't be silly.
She won't mind me seeing her.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,040
She would. I think she would.

151
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,920
It's her anniversary.
She's up there all on her own.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,160
Aghh!

153
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,240
The old leg, bit of a gyp.

154
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,480
Better have a drink. Come on through.

155
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
Poor Basil. Let me call her.

156
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,200
What?

157
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,600
Let me call her from down here
and see what she says.

158
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,520
- There's the phone.
- Come on, Bas. Let's have a drink.

159
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,920
- No, please.
- Come on.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,640
- Why not?
- She's having a bit of a sleep.

161
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,360
She can sleep all day, Basil.

162
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,480
- She won't mind me...
- But she's lost her voice.

163
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
- Lost her voice?
- Just like that.

164
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,520
- Come on.
- Coming, Roger. After you, Alice.

165
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,960
All right, Alice...
What would you like to drink?

166
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,120
Gin and it, Basil. Has the doctor been?

167
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
What's yours, Rog?

168
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,920
- Gin and tonic.
- Oh, yes, of course.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Basil, has the doctor been?

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,320
Er... Nuts?

171
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,480
They've had a row.
She's refused to come down.

172
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,560
You were just asking about the doctor?

173
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,600
- Yes.
- He hasn't been.

174
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,000
- I expect we'll get him over this afternoon.
- Well, what a shame.

175
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,760
Poor old Syb. On your anniversary, too.

176
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,920
- Hello, Polly.
- Hello, Mrs Tarry.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,040
Isn't it a shame about Mrs Fawlty?

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,560
Isn't it? The doctor said she's going
to be in bed for a couple of days.

179
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,640
The doctor hasn't actually been yet.
I don't know who you were thinking of.

180
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,800
But that man this morning,
he looked like a doctor.

181
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,600
He did, actually. That's true.
But he wasn't, unfortunately.

182
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,720
- He wasn't a doctor?
- No, he was a dentist.

183
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,240
- A dentist?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,800
What was a dentist doing here?

185
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,280
Staying in the hotel. He's a guest, you see?
Dentists do stay in hotels.

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,880
But they don't go telling
people's wives to stay in bed.

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,640
- He must have been talking about his wife.
- His wife?

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,200
Jolly good luck.
Nice to see you both. Cheers.

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
- Cheers.
- Up yours, Basil.

190
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,880
- I hope she's better soon.
- Yes, yes.

191
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Who, Syb,
or the dentist's wife?

192
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
Ha! Ha!

193
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
- You're both keeping well?
- Couldn't be better.

194
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,520
- And you, Basil?
- I can't complain.

195
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,200
I could, but it wouldn't do any good.

196
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,720
No, shame. On your anniversary.

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
All comes out in the wash, doesn't it?

198
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
We're thinking of having this room done up.

199
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,080
- Really?
- Sort of a Captain's cabin.

200
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,080
Charts on the wall, ropes, wheel in the corner,
that sort of thing.

201
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,920
Give it a bit of class.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Wasn't my idea, Roger.

203
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,000
Poor Sybil.

204
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Hello. How are you? Hello, Basil.

205
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Hello, Virginia.

206
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,880
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.

207
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
We've brought you a little surprise.

208
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,560
Oh, can I see?

209
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
Oh, cake? Lovely.

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,160
- Jolly nice.
- Did you make it?

211
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,120
Lots of extra marzipan.

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,440
She's not well.

213
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,360
- Sybil.
- Not well?

214
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,200
- She's in bed.
- That's not like Sybil.

215
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,000
She's lost her voice.

216
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,880
- What is it?
- We're not absolutely sure.

217
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,160
I bet she'd like a bit of that marzipan.

218
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
- Roger.
- Cheer her up, Bas.

219
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,720
Good idea. We'll take her up a slice.

220
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,840
- I don't think we'd better.
- Well, why not?

221
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,080
She really ought not to be disturbed.

222
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,280
- Oh, just a minute, Basil.
- It's not a very good idea.

223
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,880
What on earth's the matter with her?
Has the doctor been?

224
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,560
No, but the dentist's had a good look.

225
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,080
- The dentist?
- We called the doctor.

226
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,640
We described the symptoms
to him over the phone.

227
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,280
He said she ought to stay very quiet... Ah, Polly.
What would you like to drink, Virginia?

228
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
Medium sherry, please.

229
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
Mr Fawlty...

230
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,480
What are the symptoms?

231
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,000
She's lost her voice and
she's very puffed up.

232
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
Yes, what is it?

233
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
It's Terry. He being very difficult.

234
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
Puffed up?

235
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,960
He moved my pot.
He put his pot where my pot is.

236
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
Polly, what's "puffed up"?

237
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Beer for me.

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,520
- Put your pot somewhere else.
- I put it somewhere else, he move it again.

239
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,240
- What's puffed up?
- The eyes.

240
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,080
Tell him I said not to do it.

241
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,200
- What?
- The eyes.

242
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,800
I tell you he want to make trouble.
He push mop at my feet.

243
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
Her thighs.

244
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,600
Thighs?

245
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,240
Most of her legs, actually.

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,640
Just tell him. Go on.

247
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,880
Basil!

248
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Polly says her legs are all puffed up.

249
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,880
Are they?

250
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,760
No, Sybil's.

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
- What?
- Sybil's legs.

252
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,520
- Sybil's legs?
- Her thighs.

253
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,960
Oh, yes, just a bit. A tiny bit.

254
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,880
Mainly around the face... Around the eyes.

255
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,240
Her face is puffed up, she's lost her voice,
and her legs are a bit...

256
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,800
Expanded. Sad, isn't it?
Poor old sow. Ha! Ha!

257
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,760
- When's the doctor coming?
- Later. Soon.

258
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

259
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
- I'd better go up and have a look.
- What?

260
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,280
- She sounds ill.
- She is ill.

261
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,840
That's why we don't want
people talking to her.

262
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm not going to talk to her, Basil.
I'm going to look at her.

263
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,880
Look at her? She's ill, isn't she?

264
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,800
What's the bloody point of looking at her?

265
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,400
I am a nurse, Basil.

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Oh, no! I know!

267
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
Did you hear that, everyone?

268
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,920
All the years that I've known old Virginia,
she thinks I've forgotten she's a nurse.

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
You're a marvel.

270
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,360
- Please let me go.
- Hmm?

271
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
I want to look at Sybil.

272
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,960
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?

273
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,360
Because...

274
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,200
You've lost weight, haven't you?
Isn't that absolutely marvellous?

275
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,200
Mr Fawlty? I think you ought to tell them.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Oh. Right.

277
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,880
About the doctor coming this morning?

278
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,960
He came this morning. First thing.

279
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,920
Why didn't you say?

280
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,880
- He didn't want to worry you.
- I didn't want to worry you.

281
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
Is it serious?

282
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,320
- It might be.
- Oh, dear!

283
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Not completely serious...
But, slightly serious.

284
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
Poor Basil.

285
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,240
It's all right.
I'd just rather we didn't talk about it.

286
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,080
- Hello everyone!
- Hello.

287
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,640
Hello, Basil.

288
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,520
Hello, Reg.

289
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,920
- Sybil's not here, is she?
- No, no.

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
I told you so. I just saw her in town.

291
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
What?

292
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,520
In her car. In the high street.

293
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
No, no. That's another woman.

294
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,600
- What other woman?
- That woman who looks slightly like Sybil.

295
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,520
You know her, don't you?

296
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Like Sybil?

297
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes, very broad here. She's from the north.

298
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,920
Drives a red maxi?

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
Her husband does. I think she borrowed it.

300
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Perhaps she stole yours?
It's not out there.

301
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,680
It's in the garage, Rog.

302
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,320
- She looks like Sybil?
- Yes.

303
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,480
She comes from the North?

304
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
She has a Northern accent.
I assume she's from the North.

305
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
- You've spoken to her?
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,760
- What's her name?
- I don't know her name!

307
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,120
I only met her once. At a fete.

308
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,160
- Sorry, Basil, I didn't mean.
- No, of course.

309
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,040
By the way, where is Sybil?

310
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,000
- She's in bed.
- Oh, dear.

311
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,280
She's really not well.
She really mustn't see anybody.

312
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,600
- What? Not at all?
- No.

313
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
Can't we put our heads around the corner?

314
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,240
She mustn't have any excitement.

315
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,800
- Oh, Basil.
- What do you mean, "Oh, Basil"?

316
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,880
We are her oldest friends.
It can only do her good.

317
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,720
We've all come over here to see you both.

318
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,680
Sorry if you've been put out.

319
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,440
You have some drinks, plenty of nuts,
see your old friends, have some laughs.

320
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,800
If that isn't good enough,
I'll refund your petrol.

321
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,520
- Steady on, Basil.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
We understand. You're a bit upset.

323
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
Well, you know...

324
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,720
You know us well enough.

325
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,360
You should've called it off.
Waited until she's better.

326
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,200
- There just wasn't time.
- Wasn't time?

327
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,880
She only began to puff
up about an hour ago.

328
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,840
But you said the doctor
came first thing this morning.

329
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Yes, that's right. That was for the throat.
The puffing up started after he'd gone, okay?

330
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
- After?
- Yes, after. Are you taking notes?

331
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,920
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see her.

332
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,840
There is something very peculiar about all this.
I won't stand here while an old friend like Sybil...

333
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,840
It's perfectly Sybil. Simple's not well.

334
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,560
She lost her throat and her voice hurt.

335
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,600
The doctor said it was a bit serious.
Not a lot, a bit.

336
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
He went away, she started to puff up,
he's coming back later this afternoon,

337
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,960
and it's best for her to be on her own.

338
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,320
What is so peculiar about that?

339
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,200
Her driving around in the town.

340
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
What did you say?

341
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Sorry, just a joke. Can I have another gin?

342
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,080
Just a joke? She's down there, in town,
driving around? Is that what you think?

343
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,720
Of course it isn't.

344
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,640
Obviously, I've been standing here making up
crackpot stories about my wife being seriously ill.

345
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,880
No, of course not... It was just a bit funny
Kitty seeing that northern woman in the car.

346
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Funny? Oh, I see.

347
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,440
You think that was Sybil in the car
and not upstairs?

348
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, I understand. I've got it now.

349
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
What are we all waiting around here for?

350
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,640
Come on, everybody upstairs.

351
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,960
- Come on. All of you.
- No, Basil.

352
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,160
Everyone who thinks I'm a liar, come on up.

353
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
Of course, we don't.

354
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,560
- Hang on, old man.
- Don't get like that.

355
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
- Come and see Sybil.
- We don't want to.

356
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
It's best to leave her,
we'll see her another time.

357
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
When she's feeling better.

358
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,120
- Roger wants to.
- We mustn't disturb her.

359
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,280
- If Roger wants to...
- He doesn't, Basil.

360
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,240
- We could just say hello.
- Oh, Roger!

361
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,240
Right. All right! Fine!

362
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,400
Okay, then. Fine!

363
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,320
No problem! Suits me. Good idea.

364
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,080
I'll just pop upstairs and ask her to stop dying
then you can all come up and identify her.

365
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,720
- Basil!
- Polly, give me a hand.

366
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,120
Help yourself to a drink.
Make yourself at home. Relax!

367
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,240
Any more nuts?

368
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,680
- What are you doing?
- You won't have to...

369
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
What? Oh, no.

370
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

371
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,640
No! I won't.

372
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
Yes, you will.

373
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,680
It's easy. Put on her dark glasses,
and one of her wigs.

374
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,440
- I'll keep them away from you.
- Will you listen to me?

375
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,840
- We'll draw the curtains.
- They'd never believe I was Mrs Fawlty.

376
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,400
- Seeing is believing.
- I don't look like her.

377
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
You're a woman, aren't you?

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,760
- My face is too long.
- We'll shorten it.

379
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,720
You've lost your voice.
All you have to do is wave.

380
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
- Wave?
- Put one hand up and jiggle it about.

381
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
You'll soon get the hang of it.

382
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,880
Mr Fawlty...

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,520
I know you're very excited,
you might even be having a nervous breakdown.

384
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,240
I don't know. I'm no expert...

385
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,760
You must really see this
isn't going to work!

386
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,600
- Get that on.
- It isn't going to work.

387
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,960
- What's the matter?
- I'm not doing it!

388
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,400
You want to be in a Marx Brothers film,
that's your problem. I'm not interested.

389
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,720
- Not interested?
- No.

390
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,240
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

391
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,800
You said to say she was ill!

392
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
You invited them to come up here.
They didn't even want to!

393
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,440
You be Sybil. You get into the bed.

394
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,320
I'm too big! I've got a moustache!

395
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,640
What's this supposed to be?
A great big hairy bogey?

396
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,520
It's something you get
when you're puffed up!

397
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,400
I'll ruin you.
You'll never waitress in Torquay again.

398
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,880
Waitress? That's a joke.

399
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,840
I help out at reception. I clean the rooms.

400
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,400
I deal with the tradesmen,
I man the switchboard, I change the fuses,

401
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,000
if you think my duties include
impersonating members of your family,

402
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,800
you have one more screw
loose than I thought.

403
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm not doing it. Do you understand?

404
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,840
You get yourself out of it.
It's nothing to do with me.

405
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
A hundred for the car.

406
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
All right.

407
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
- Now!
- What?

408
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,840
- Now!
- Now?

409
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,760
Hello.

410
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,040
- Is not possible.
- What?

411
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,600
Is not possible for me. Please come.

412
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,840
- What is it?
- It's Terry. Please come.

413
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,200
He tell me I not know how to make a paella.

414
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,760
- He tell me...
- You tell him...

415
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,520
I tell him paella is Spanish,
not cockney stinking eel pie!

416
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,920
I make paella like my mama...

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm not interested.

418
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,840
My mama's recipe is big in Barcelona.

419
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,600
- Go away.
- Please, you come!

420
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,760
He called me ignorant wog motherboy crump.

421
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,960
Let go of me.

422
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,520
- Basil?
- Yes?

423
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,160
You tell Terry let you alone.

424
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,400
- Basil?
- Yes, Reg.

425
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
Go on. Go away.

426
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
Not you, Reg.

427
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Is big in Barcelona.

428
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,040
- Are we supposed to come up now?
- In a moment, Reg.

429
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,880
No, come on up now.

430
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,640
She's just touching up the worst bits.

431
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,280
How is she feeling?

432
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,200
I woke her and told her that you'd
come over and she's very pleased.

433
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,240
But she's very weak and her throat...

434
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,000
She has great difficulty
expressing herself.

435
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,560
Makes a change.

436
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,040
She'll be out to see you in a moment.
She's pretty quick with the ol'...

437
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,840
She's not bothering to make up for
us, is she?

438
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,080
No, no, no. Just, you know...

439
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,840
She asked me to thank you
and to say how very much

440
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,440
she's looking forward to seeing you all.

441
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,080
That's nice.

442
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,000
She can speak a little, then?

443
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
Not really, no. I see what you mean.

444
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,520
She wrote that down on one of the postcards
that she keeps by the side of the bed.

445
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,200
Did she stamp it?

446
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
Do you have an ashtray?

447
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,520
Yes, I'll get one.

448
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
- There's no need to...
- No bother. Just a second.

449
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,320
Mr Fawlty!

450
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,360
He put mince in it.
He put bloody mince in it.

451
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,600
Look what you've done!

452
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
Sorry! Sorry!

453
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,160
I tell him paella is fish dish.

454
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,120
- Go away!
- What I do?

455
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
<i>Arriba! Vamos!</i>

456
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,520
- This is fun, isn't it?
- Roger!

457
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Who wants to go to the boozer or play golf,
when you can come to one of Basil's do's?

458
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,600
Come on, Roger.

459
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,600
It can't be easy for him
with Sybil lying there ill.

460
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,440
- You know what I think about that?
- What?

461
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,720
Shh!

462
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,440
Here we are. I brought some nuts.

463
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,920
You shouldn't have.

464
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,440
If you could just take the ashtray.

465
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
- Oh!
- Sorry.

466
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,240
- Never mind.
- I'll get some more.

467
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,920
- We've got the crisps.
- I don't mind.

468
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
- The crisps will be lovely.
- Really?

469
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,440
- Crisp, Alice?
- Thank you.

470
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,960
- Arthur, would you like...
- Not for me.

471
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,840
- Would you like a crisp?
- Thank you.

472
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Hold them a moment. I'll get a brush.

473
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
A "Basil brush."

474
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,760
Ha! Ha! Very good!

475
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,280
Broom, broom!

476
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,920
Roger, what did you mean?

477
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
They've had a row.
She's refused to come down.

478
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,520
- Roger!
- He's embarrassed her into seeing us.

479
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm not interested!

480
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm not interested.

481
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,640
Don't you bother. Leave it to me.

482
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,280
Basil?

483
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,560
Basil, perhaps she's ready now?

484
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, yes. Good idea. I'll just have a look.

485
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,720
Not quite. Nearly.

486
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,160
Anyone care for another crisp?

487
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,400
No, no.

488
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,640
Have you got a choc ice?

489
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,600
I'll put them there, just help yourselves.

490
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,560
- Nice carpet, Bas.
- Thank you. A bit worn now.

491
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,320
I thought that was part of the pattern.

492
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,840
- Nice paper, Basil.
- We got it to go with the carpet.

493
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,600
- To go with it?
- That's right, Roger.

494
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,320
One of them will have to go.
My money's on the carpet.

495
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,480
Please!

496
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
You read a lot of Oscar Wilde, do you?

497
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,920
I don't know if you've ever
seen the moulding up there...

498
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,320
- Oh, dear!
- It's all right. I'll clean it up.

499
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
What time's the main feature?

500
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,560
Morning, Fawlty.
Lovely day for a round of golf.

501
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,800
Morning, Major. Yes.

502
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,400
- Anyone care to make up a four?
- No, we're going to see Sybil.

503
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,680
- Playing a match, is she?
- No, she's ill. Really quite ill.

504
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,520
She should be in bed.

505
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,480
Yes, she is. We're going to see her.

506
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,320
Another lot in there with her, is there?

507
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,480
May I introduce Major
Gowen, our oldest resident?

508
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,920
- Good morning, Major.
- Delighted to meet you.

509
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,320
Welcome to Torquay.

510
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
How do you do?

511
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
She's ready now. Come on in.

512
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,160
Not you.

513
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,400
- Sybil?
- Hello, darling, don't try and speak.

514
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
- The gang's here.
- Sorry you're not well.

515
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,560
Such a shame.

516
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,800
We thought we'd come wish
you happy anniversary.

517
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,960
Happy anniversary!

518
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,720
- What's happened?
- Reg has fallen over. You all right, Reg?

519
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Done my ankle.

520
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,120
- Oh, dear.
- You all right, Reg?

521
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
- Careful!
- It's so dark in here.

522
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,760
- Bloody light's not working.
- I tripped over something.

523
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,640
- Who's that?
- It's me.

524
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,520
- It's Kitty!
- Where are you, dear?

525
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,080
- Can't we have some light in here?
- All right, hang on.

526
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
Okay.

527
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,360
Now the light's on we
can see the screen.

528
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,240
- Oh, dear.
- Are you all right, Kitty?

529
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,200
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

530
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Come on up here. You both all right?
Come on round there.

531
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
You can see her from there.

532
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,000
Is everything all right? Here she is.

533
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,400
Hello, Sybil.

534
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,040
There's something there.
I can see it moving.

535
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
- It's a bit dark.
- Her eyes are very sensitive.

536
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,640
- She's got her glasses.
- I'll just draw the curtains.

537
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
Yes, I know. Trust me, dear.

538
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,800
There we are. Is that better?

539
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,600
Happy anniversary.

540
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
You poor dear.

541
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,800
How are you feeling?

542
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,600
Oh, shame.

543
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,480
You're very swollen.

544
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
Her thighs.

545
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,600
We brought you a cake.

546
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,760
Yes.

547
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,480
Have a bit, dear.

548
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Fifteen years, eh?

549
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,360
Happy anniversary.

550
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,680
I think she's feeling a little tired now.

551
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Yes, all that waving would wear anyone out.

552
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,360
Perhaps we'd better all...

553
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,480
What's in her mouth? That white stuff?

554
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,600
Just foam. From the excitement.

555
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,120
Fifteen years, eh?

556
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,640
Aghh!

557
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
What is it?

558
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,680
I just remembered something downstairs.
You stay here, have a chat with Polly...

559
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
Sybil! Sybil! Shan't be a moment!

560
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,160
A chat? Does anyone know semaphore?

561
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,560
Hello, dear.

562
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,960
I came back for my clubs. I'm not staying.

563
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,800
Oh, aren't you? Okay.

564
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,440
What?

565
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,360
I'm sure you know best.

566
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,840
You don't even want me to, do you?

567
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
What's that?

568
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,840
Fifteen years I've been with you!
When I think what I might have had.

569
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,040
Fifteen years.

570
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,080
You want me to go, don't you?

571
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,080
No, but you've obviously made your mind up.

572
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,120
- I won't forget this.
- Won't you, dear?

573
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,560
No, I won't.

574
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm going now. I think it's best.

575
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,880
All right, dear.

576
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,280
Bye, Basil.

577
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,000
Cheerio, dear.

578
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,640
Drive carefully.

579
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,920
- Get well soon.
- Look after yourself.

580
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,440
We'll have a little party
when you're feeling better.

581
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,280
I don't like leaving you like this.

582
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,280
Let me just have a little feel.
Just to see if...

583
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,360
Don't be frightened.
I'm not going to hurt you.

584
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,160
I'll just feel your glands.

585
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Don't be silly, Sybil.

586
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
Just trust me. It's for your own good.

587
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,680
Don't be silly... Aghh!

588
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,120
What's going on?

589
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,400
She hit me, Basil!

590
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,560
What?

591
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,360
I was trying to examine her.
She lashed out.

592
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,160
Don't hit our friends.

593
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,480
I know you're not feeling 100%,
but control yourself.

594
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm sorry, she's not herself today.

595
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,480
The doctor will be over here soon.
I'll give you a call, tell you what he says.

596
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,840
Anyone care for another drink?

597
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,120
- We ought to be going.
- That would be quite nice.

598
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,080
They're all the same, dear.
They're all the same. Believe me.

599
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,040
Oh, I know.

600
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,320
Now you forget all about it.

601
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,200
We're going to have a nice game of golf
and go out to dinner.

602
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,720
Did you get your clubs?

603
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,280
Awfully nice to have seen you all.
Thanks for coming over.

604
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,560
Not at all.

605
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,920
We must do this more often.
When they're fit again.

606
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,160
Sorry about all the injuries.

607
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,120
Perhaps when Sybil's better,
we can all get together.

608
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,040
How extraordinary.
We were just talking about you.

609
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,480
Basil Fawlty. We met once at a fete.

610
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,480
Let me show you where it is.
How is the north? Have you been there recently?

611
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,520
I'll explain everything in a moment.

612
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,680
What a coincidence.
She's thinking of buying one of our fridges.

613
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,000
Lovely to have seen you,
and sorry about the ankle.

614
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,760
Yes, keep the head back.

615
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,880
Great fun.

616
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,920
Whew.

617
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,400
Piece of cake.

618
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Now comes the tricky bit.
