1
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,080
And he loves pecans and walnuts

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,400
and he simply adores those
little cheese footballs,

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,160
don't you, my darling?

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,840
Oh, isn't he beautiful?

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,560
Very attractive little fellow. What is he?

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,120
He's a little Shih-Tzu.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,800
Is he really?

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, dear, what breed is it?

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,200
They're lap-dogs, aren't they?

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,720
A lap-dog?

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,920
Hard to imagine him
stalking a reindeer, what?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,640
- Major, another one?
- Why not? Why not?

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,160
- For you, Mrs Chase?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960
But Prince would like a
little saucer of warm milk.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
It's nearly our bedtime and...

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
Yes, Manuel!
Manuel will attend to its heart's desires.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm afraid I'm with the people tonight.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Manuel, <i>por favor, el perro microscopico.</i>

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,600
- Good evening, Dr Price.
- Good evening.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,880
- What can I get you?
- Scotch, please.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,400
I suppose it's too late to
eat, I missed dinner.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,880
What did you have in mind?

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
I rather fancy some sausages.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm afraid chef would
have locked them away.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,720
We could do you sandwiches...
Ham, cheese, tomato?

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,440
- Ham, thank you.
- I'll just arrange it for you.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,280
- Basil?
- Dear?

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,880
Could you make some ham sandwiches?

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,440
- Look, I'm...
- For Dr Price.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,480
Of course, yes, one moment, Doctor.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,520
- There we are, Major.
- Excuse me. Phone.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,800
Found another draft, have we?

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,480
We have to be very careful, Mr Fawlty,
he's not very strong.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
Indeed, yes. A rapid movement of air
could damage him irreparably.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,200
If only one could keep them
in airtight containers.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,240
Wouldn't be able to
breathe, would he, Fawlty?

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,520
He could try, Major, he could try.
Anything else for you?

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,360
Thank you, no, it's a bit late.
We'd better get upstairs.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,680
Quite, quite.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,760
Sorry to have kept you.
Doctor, one round, two?

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,800
- Just one, please.
- My pleasure.

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,520
No, she was the one
he had with him the third time.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,160
The first one was the dowdy one,

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,120
then his wife, then
her, and now this red...

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,360
Oh, yes, that must have been lovely, number 12.
Let's see.

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
Thank you.

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,240
How very lovely... Yes, that was them.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,520
Not much, they get less
fussy as they get older.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,680
Sorry about this.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,960
It couldn't matter less.
We're meeting in the morning.

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,960
- You've had a long journey.
- Get a good night's sleep.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,600
- Are you all right?
- Fine, fine, just a little...

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,720
Of course.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,480
You get straight to bed,
we'll pick you up here at 9:30.

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,600
We'll have coffee, go to the MD at 10:00.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
Fine, thanks. Okay, good night.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,880
- Bye.
- See you.

59
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,760
See you at 9:30 then.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,680
- Sorry.
- Harris? Oh, no, on his own again.

61
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh, no, I wouldn't have thought so.
He watches football.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
- Number 8, isn't it?
- Thank you.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,960
- Are you feeling all right?
- Not too good, no.

64
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,840
- Would you like a little hot something?
- No, fine, thank you.

65
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,040
- Well, if there's anything you need...
- Thank you.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
That wasn't him, that was a new one.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,760
Good night.

68
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,160
I said, "Good night."

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
Oh, good night.

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
Didn't hurt, did it?

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
Good manners cost nothing.

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,160
He's not feeling very well, Basil.

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
Only had to say "Good night."
it's not the Gettysburg Address.

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
Basil, when you're not feeling well...

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,360
Just two little words, dear,

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,480
that bring a little
happiness into the world.

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,600
Excuse me?

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,160
Yes, Mr Leeman, what can I do for you?

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Might I have breakfast
in bed in the morning?

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
- In bed?
- Yes.

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,080
- Of course, Mr Leeman.
- Yes, we can manage that.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,480
I'll call you back.

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,800
Is it your legs?

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm sorry?

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Most of our guests manage
to struggle down in the morning.

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,800
- A full breakfast or the continental?
- Oh, I don't...

87
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,240
Our chef does a very good full breakfast,

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,960
eggs, bacon, sausages,
tomato, fried bread...

89
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,360
The continental.

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,960
- You wouldn't care for kippers?
- Fine, kippers, thank you.

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,200
- Toast, butter, marmalade?
- Thank you.

92
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,840
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, thank you.

93
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
- Newspaper?
<i>- The Telegraph.</i>

94
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,120
Thank you, good night.

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,640
Rosewood, mahogany, teak?

96
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,960
I beg your pardon?

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,280
What would you like your
breakfast tray made of?

98
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't really mind.

99
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,320
Are you sure? Fine, go along,
have a really good night's sleep, then.

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,480
I'm hoping to get a couple of hours myself.

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,160
I'll be up in good time
to serve you your breakfast in bed.

102
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,960
If you can remember to sleep
with your mouth open,

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,360
you won't even have to wake up.

104
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll drop in small pieces
of lightly buttered kipper

105
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,360
when you're breathing
in the right direction,

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,480
if that doesn't put you out!

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Basil!

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
- Sausages, please.
- Just sausages?

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
Hmm, just sausages.

110
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,680
- Tea or coffee?
- Coffee, please.

111
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,440
- But is...
- No, not a saucer.

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,360
<i>- Cómo?</i>
- I said a bowl.

113
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,560
- A ball?
- Yes, and not cold like that.

114
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,120
That's too cold. I said tepid, didn't I?

115
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,320
<i>- Más grande,</i> Manuel. <i>De agua caliente.</i>
- Ah!

116
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
He could catch pneumonia from that.

117
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,240
And bring another cushion.
He's not high enough.

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Sausages on six, Terry.

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,760
- Coming up.
<i>- Más grande,</i> Manuel.

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
Another car strike. Would you believe it?

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Put these kippers back, would you, Basil?

122
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,800
We ought to get Butlin's
to run our car factories.

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,440
In the fridge.

124
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
These should have been eaten by...
When was the sixth?

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,720
- Oh, that's all right.
- It says on the packet, Sybil.

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,920
- They're all right, Mr Fawlty.
- The sixth?

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
That's just to cover themselves.

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,320
Eggs and sausages, Poll.

129
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,520
On the table, on the table.

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,760
No!

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
That!

132
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,120
Now, put that under him.

133
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
- The cushion! The cushion!
<i>- Sí.</i>

134
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,840
- He bite me!
- You frightened him.

135
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
<i>Qué?</i>

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
You make sudden movements like that,
of course he's going to bite.

137
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
Don't you have dogs in Calcutta?

138
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,520
Excuse me, but I have an order
for eggs and sausages for this table.

139
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,640
Yes, the sausages are for him.

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,320
- What's the matter, Manuel?
- He bite me.

141
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,720
Cut them up into little pieces.

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,240
No, not my eggs. The sausages.

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
Oh, sorry.

144
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,080
He bite Polly, too. You see?

145
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,040
If dogs are allowed in the dining room,

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,440
the staff should know how to handle them.

147
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,600
I'll cut them up in the kitchen, Mrs Chase.

148
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
Little pieces.

149
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
Kippers ready.

150
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,840
He hurt you, Polly?

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,520
- Basil, what are you doing?
- Do you know when the sixth was?

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Will you just take it upstairs?

153
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,120
- They're all right, Mr Fawlty.
- Are they supposed to be that colour?

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,960
Will you just take it up?
What's the matter, Manuel?

155
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,800
That hairy mosquito just bit us both.

156
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,080
- What?
- It's not right in dining room like that.

157
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,240
She pays extra for the dog.
Basil, it's after 8:00.

158
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,400
Poisoning is still an
offence in this country.

159
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Do get a move on, we've got a busy day,
I've got laundrymen coming.

160
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,160
The laundrymen. My God!

161
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,760
A woman's work is never delegated, is it?

162
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,440
- What are you doing, Polly?
- Just preparing some sausages.

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,400
Bangers à la bang.

164
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,360
Good morning, breakfast.

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
Breakfast.

166
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,240
Here we are. Another car strike.
Marvellous, isn't it?

167
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Taxpayers pay 'em millions each year,
they get the money, go on strike.

168
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
It's called socialism.

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
If they don't like making cars,

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,040
why don't they get
themselves another bloody job

171
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,880
designing cathedrals
or composing violin concertos?

172
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,000
The British Leyland Concerto,
in four movements, all of 'em slow,

173
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,520
with a four-hour tea break in between.

174
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,520
I'll tell you why, 'cause they're
not interested in anything,

175
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,560
except lounging about on conveyor belts
stuffing themselves with my money.

176
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,200
You don't mind if I turn the light off?
Well, enjoy your breakfast.

177
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,760
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
Not at all, thank you for mentioning it.

179
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
Unbelievable. Un-be-lievable.
Not a single bloody word.

180
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,520
You get up at 5:30 in the morning

181
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,920
so they can lounge
around in bed till midday

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,240
and do you get so much as a word of thanks?

183
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,920
- What's that?
- Forgot the milk.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Don't get talking to him,
you'll never get away.

185
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,560
Would you believe it?

186
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,840
I get him his breakfast,
I take it all the way upstairs,

187
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,000
I lay it in front of him,
hand him his newspaper,

188
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
I tidy the room, draw the curtains,
guess what he says?

189
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,400
- I said, "Guess what he says?"
- Mmm?

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
Nothing!

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Your friend! The one in eight.
Nothing, not a word.

192
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,080
Are you listening?
Hello, can anybody hear me?

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,440
Have I ceased to exist?
Have I suddenly become invisible?

194
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,040
- Sybil, Sybil, Sybil, can you see me?
- No.

195
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,560
Good, I'll go and lie down then.
No, I won't, I'll go and hit some guests.

196
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,880
Poor little toma-woma-boy. Oh, let me.

197
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,000
Dr Price's sausages.

198
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
- What is it, Polly?
- He's dead.

199
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
- Dead, who?
- Number eight.

200
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,520
Leeman? But Basil just
took him his breakfast.

201
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,680
- He's cold.
- Oh, no.

202
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,400
What's the matter with that dog?

203
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
He's dead.

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,600
He's certainly struggling
for life at the moment.

205
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,160
A dead dog in the breakfast room.

206
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Egon Ronay would knock off a star for that.

207
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,360
No, no, Mr Leeman dead.

208
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Well, that would explain a lot.

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,240
No, Mr Fawlty. Really. Poll just said so.

210
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
What are you on about?
I just took him his kippers.

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,120
Oh, my God!

212
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,960
Leeman's dead, I'm getting Dr Price.

213
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,040
I just put the milk down on the tray...
What are you doing?

214
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
- What are you doing?
- I told her. I told her the sixth.

215
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,320
- We could get 20 years for this.
- What?

216
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,360
The kippers, the kippers, oh, my God!

217
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Mr Fawlty, he's been dead for hours.

218
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,480
He's cold. He's been dead for hours.
He must have died in his sleep.

219
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
- Mr Fawlty!
- What? What?

220
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,440
He hasn't touched those kippers.

221
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,720
Well, look! Feel him.

222
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,840
- What?
- Feel him.

223
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,960
- He's stone cold.
- Yes.

224
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,120
Oh, joy! Thank you, God.
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

225
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm so happy! Hooray!

226
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,800
Sad, isn't it?

227
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,080
May I ask who...

228
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,920
Bit stuffy, isn't it? I'll open a window.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,720
- Who...
- Who found the body?

230
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,320
Polly did.

231
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,560
I was bringing him up the
milk, we'd forgotten it.

232
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,600
- You brought the milk with the breakfast?
- No, the breakfast was already up.

233
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,520
Who brought the breakfast? Who found him?

234
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,320
Oh, I brought the breakfast.

235
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,080
- What's that?
- That's a bit of it.

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,680
- Bit of what?
- A bit of the breakfast.

237
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,960
- You brought him his breakfast?
- Yes.

238
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,240
- So you told her he was dead?
- Yes.

239
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,640
Then why did you bring him...

240
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,840
Why did you bring him the milk then?

241
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,040
- Why?
- Yes, why?

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,920
When he said, "Mr Leeman was dead,"
I thought he said, "He's still in bed."

243
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,960
He didn't exactly say he was dead, Doctor.

244
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
I said he was pretty quiet.

245
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,760
- Quiet?
- Exactly.

246
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,440
What were you talking to him about?
Car strikes, was it?

247
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,640
Thank you, Sybil.

248
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,320
I don't understand.
He's been dead about 10 hours.

249
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,240
- It's so final, isn't it?
- Basil!

250
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,520
Wouldn't you?
I'd say it was pretty bloody final.

251
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,240
Do you mean to tell me
you didn't realise this man was dead?

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,160
People don't talk much in the morning.
I'm just delivering a tray, right?

253
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,360
If the guest isn't singing,

254
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,160
"Oh, what a beautiful morning,"
I don't immediately think,

255
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
"There's another one
snuffed it in the night.

256
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,360
"Another name in the Fawlty Towers
Book of Remembrance."

257
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,800
I mean, this is a hotel,
not a Burma railway.

258
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,960
Basil!

259
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
It does actually say "hotel" outside.
Perhaps I should be more specific.

260
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,840
"Hotel for people who have
a better than 50% chance

261
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,360
"of making it through the night."

262
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,680
What are you looking at me like that for?

263
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,160
Basil, there's a kipper
sticking out of your jumper.

264
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,960
There it is. I've been looking for that.
That's the other one.

265
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,280
We'll be downstairs, Doctor.

266
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
- Shall I ring the undertaker?
- Would you, Polly?

267
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,640
I've been up since 5:30, you know?

268
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,360
He was leaving today.
Some people are coming at lunchtime.

269
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760
We'll put them in another room.

270
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,360
We're full tonight. Oh, do put that away!

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
Get the body into the office
until the undertakers come.

272
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
- Now?
- When the Doctor's finished.

273
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,240
- What are you doing?
- Making up his bill.

274
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Who are you going to give it to?

275
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,560
We'll leave it in his wallet,
they're bound to look there.

276
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,840
Better not charge him for breakfast.

277
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,520
Mr Simkins? Fawlty Towers here.

278
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm afraid somebody's
died during the night.

279
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,600
When could you collect the body?

280
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,960
- Somebody, anybody, really.
- Good morning, good morning.

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,640
You're very cheerful this morning.

282
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Well, one of the guests has just died.

283
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,400
You are wicked.

284
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
Manuel, Manuel!

285
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Manuel, we go get the body.

286
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,040
- Polly! Polly!
- Yes, if you can.

287
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Would it be all right to move the...

288
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Could I use the phone, please?
I have to call the coroner.

289
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,200
The coroner?

290
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,160
I can't give him his death certificate,
I'm not his doctor.

291
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,560
I have to report his death to the coroner.

292
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,800
I see, of course. Come this way, Doctor.

293
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
- All clear?
- All clear.

294
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Is heavy.

295
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,960
Come on, come on!

296
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,880
Good morning, Manuel.

297
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,000
- Oh, good morning.
- Oh!

298
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,880
It's all right, leave it. It's heavy.

299
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,320
It's quite all right.
I'll put them like that.

300
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
- Don't bother.
- It's no bother.

301
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,640
- No, no, leave it alone.
- If I fold them like this...

302
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Yes, go away. Move, Manuel!

303
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
Move, move, move.

304
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,400
- I'll do it, Miss Tibbs.
- No, it's all right.

305
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,520
He's dead!

306
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,520
- Serves you right.
- Shh! Shh!

307
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,760
Oh, my God.

308
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,800
- Shut up, shut up!
- Oh, my God!

309
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,560
Slap her! She's hysterical.

310
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,920
- Murder! Murder!
- Slap her!

311
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,840
Oh, spiffing! Absolutely spiffing.

312
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
Well done. Two dead, 25 to go.

313
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,120
Quick, Polly, Polly!

314
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,160
I just dropped my ring.

315
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,720
Oh, there it is.

316
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,360
Oh, sorry, I'm in your way.

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,840
That's quite all right.

318
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,480
- Oh, is this your room?
- Yes.

319
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- Yes.

320
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,680
- Did you enjoy your breakfast?
- Yes, thank you.

321
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,880
Excuse us, do you think we could
go inside and get our...

322
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,720
- Not really.
- Pardon?

323
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,040
Well, it's being cleaned,
Mr Fawlty's doing it.

324
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,560
- But we want to get our things.
- We're going out, you see?

325
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,080
It'll only take a couple of minutes.

326
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,920
We're a little late, excuse me.

327
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,360
Excuse me. Mr Fawlty?

328
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
- Mr Fawlty?
- All clear?

329
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,360
- Mr Fawlty?
- Anybody about?

330
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,560
Mr and Mrs White want
to come into their room.

331
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,320
Oh, no.

332
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,560
Wait a minute!

333
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,280
Hello.

334
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,120
Can we come in?

335
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,280
I was explaining that
you were doing the room.

336
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,640
Yes, won't be five minutes.

337
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,000
Couldn't you do it later?

338
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,640
Pick that ashtray up, will you, Manuel, please?
The big one. Could we do it later?

339
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,880
When we've got our things.

340
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
It'll only be a couple of minutes.

341
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,760
Look, Fawlty, we want our things!

342
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,440
Right, yes, thank you so much.

343
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,560
- He's locked it.
- That's just a precaution.

344
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,840
Have you locked this?

345
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,880
Only slightly.

346
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
- Will you let us in?
- In a minute.

347
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,640
Get the coats, get the coats.

348
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,040
What's going on?

349
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
He's a bit of a perfectionist.

350
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,160
Ready!

351
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,160
What's been going on in here?

352
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,080
We tried rearranging the furniture,

353
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,120
but it didn't really work.
Manuel has your coats.

354
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,520
Oh-hh...

355
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,640
Oh-hh...

356
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,680
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

357
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,720
It's all right, he's from Barcelona.

358
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,960
- What's that noise?
- Oh, it's just my back.

359
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,520
No, no, that moaning.

360
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,640
Oh-hh...

361
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,960
Oh, yes. That's odd.

362
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,920
No, no, it's coming from the cupboard.

363
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,160
Well, we'll get some oil.

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,920
- Have a nice day.
- There's someone in there.

365
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
- What?
- Yes, listen.

366
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,560
No, no, no.

367
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,960
Good Lord, so there is.

368
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,320
- Let them out!
- Good idea.

369
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,080
- Right, well, um...
- Well, go on.

370
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,240
We're going to.
It's the next thing on the list.

371
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,920
If you do get a chance
to visit the museum...

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,960
Open it now, will you?

373
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,720
All right. Yes, right.

374
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,480
Oh, it's locked. Oh, damn.

375
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,000
- Where's the key?
- Yes, where is the key?

376
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,240
Do you have any idea, Polly, Manuel?

377
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,840
I expect we've left it
downstairs somewhere.

378
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,960
<i>Qué?</i>

379
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,440
- Where's the key?
- Key's in your pocket.

380
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,560
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

381
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
Well done, Manuel. Thank you very much.

382
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
- Right, well, we've got it now.
- Give it to me!

383
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,960
All right, all right, I will. I will.

384
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Miss Tibbs!

385
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
Now, I've warned you about this before.

386
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,320
You can hide in your own cupboard
but not in other people's!

387
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,880
I'm sorry about this,
you can't really blame her.

388
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
She doesn't have much in her life.
She has to make her own entertainment.

389
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,800
She has trouble with her arm.
That's why she goes in the cupboard.

390
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,600
- Exactly.
- Are you feeling better?

391
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,440
Her arm gets stuck there.

392
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,560
It's always happening to her.

393
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,040
He's dead.

394
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280
It's her husband. She hasn't got over it.
Died 30 years ago.

395
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
She doesn't mean any arm.

396
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
In the cupboard!

397
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,040
No more today, you've had enough.

398
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,640
Oh, my God, look at that!

399
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,160
Thank you, Manuel. Manuel, thank you.

400
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,600
That's enough. Thank you.

401
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,840
Anything else we can do for you?

402
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,240
It was so horrible, Mrs Fawlty.
You've no idea.

403
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,920
Oh, I know.

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,080
It was pitch black in there,
and that thing, with its hand.

405
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh, I know.

406
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,520
Now you have a little rest
and try to think of something else.

407
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
But anything could have happened.

408
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,840
Well, he was dead, dear.

409
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,040
A man is a man, Mrs Fawlty.

410
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, I know.

411
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,600
I shall speak to him about it.

412
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,880
- Speak to him?
- To Mr Fawlty.

413
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,560
We're his oldest residents.

414
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,960
Have a little rest first.

415
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,080
Frightening me like that.
I shall speak to him.

416
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Have a word with him in a little while
when you're feeling better.

417
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
I see, yes, thank you.

418
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,360
It's all right, dear.
They've got rooms at the Seaview.

419
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,480
- Tonight?
- Yes.

420
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,600
Well, let's have a look at it.

421
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,800
Yes, and if that's no good,

422
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,600
we'll try the one up by
the Prophylactic Emporium.

423
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,840
Okay.

424
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,840
- Morning, Fawlty.
- Hello, Major.

425
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,440
Any sign of the papers?

426
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,240
You've got it, Major.

427
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,720
Have I? Oh, yes, so I have.

428
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,840
Oh, I say, Fawlty, he doesn't look...
He doesn't look quite the ticket.

429
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,240
Well, Major, don't say anything to anybody,
but he's dead.

430
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,600
Ah. Shot, was he?

431
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,440
No, no, died in his sleep.

432
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,800
In his sleep?
Ah, well, you're off your guard, you see.

433
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes, yes.

434
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,120
Oh, Fawlty...
I shouldn't let him lie around here.

435
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,840
No, the undertakers are coming to get him.

436
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Ah, 'cause they attract the flies, you see.

437
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,480
Look, I've been waiting in there.
I haven't had any breakfast yet.

438
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,160
Oh, right, sorry. Coming, coming.

439
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,960
It's only sausages.

440
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,440
Mr Fawlty. Mr Fawlty.
I want a word with you, please.

441
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,160
Sorry about the delay, Doctor,

442
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
normal service has been resumed
as soon as possible.

443
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
More coffee?

444
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,360
Tea? Tea? I'll turn the radio down.

445
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,200
Oh!

446
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,840
- Miss Tibbs.
- Oh, no.

447
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
Would you believe it?

448
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,640
Why did you put him there?

449
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,520
He wouldn't fit in the safe
and the drawers were full.

450
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
Come on, Manuel.

451
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
Wonderful, isn't it? Our guests,

452
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,560
they give us trouble
even when they're dead.

453
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,600
- Where are you taking him?
- Kitchen.

454
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
- Polly!
- Just a moment.

455
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,520
Hello!

456
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
He's seriously ill.

457
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,760
- Oh, dear.
- Don't just stand there. Call a vet!

458
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,920
Right.

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
He's been poisoned.

460
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,760
On the table.

461
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Sorry about that. Bit overdone, I'm afraid.

462
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,360
We'll send 'em down the crematorium.

463
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,240
You can't keep a dead body in here,
where there's food.

464
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,880
- Can't we?
- Of course not.

465
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
Oh, sorry. Manuel.

466
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,120
Put him in there, in the basket.

467
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
- Not in here.
- What?

468
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,520
Not in the kitchen.

469
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,640
Oh, right.

470
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh, um, Sybil!

471
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,560
I'm looking after Miss Tibbs, Basil.
How are you feeling, dear?

472
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,800
Won't be two minutes, okay?

473
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
- Sorry about that, Doctor.
- Wash your hands first, please.

474
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,800
Oh, right.

475
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,440
And make sure this area is scrubbed
before any more food is prepared in here.

476
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Absolutely.

477
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,000
Sausages excepted.
You may cook them immediately.

478
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,840
- I'll take the risk.
- But of course. <i>Tout de suite.</i>

479
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,440
Leave it.

480
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,040
- No, no, I take it.
- Leave it.

481
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,320
- Is not time, please. No, no, no, please.
- I'm sitting here.

482
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,480
- Is no lunch till 12:00...
- I'm still having breakfast.

483
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,440
Is finish, all gone, breakfast kaput.

484
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,920
- I'm having sausages.
- Is not allowed.

485
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,720
Put that back. Look, I'm a doctor.
I'm a doctor, and I want my sausages.

486
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,680
I tell you, is finished.
Bye, bye, please. Bye, bye.

487
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Now look...

488
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,960
Is finish.

489
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,120
Give those to me. Come on, come on.

490
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,840
No, is no possible.

491
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,560
- Is everything all right?
- He want to eat now.

492
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,720
I've been trying to sit down
and he keeps moving things from my table.

493
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm so sorry.

494
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,840
He doesn't understand
that I haven't finished breakfast.

495
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
Manuel...

496
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,960
Manuel, let me explain.

497
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,880
You understand? Good.

498
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,280
They'll be ready in just
a couple of minutes.

499
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,000
There we are, Mr Ingrams, number eight.

500
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,440
Top of the stairs on the right.

501
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,640
Excuse my not coming up with you,
one of our guests has been taken ill.

502
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,880
Thank you.

503
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,160
Ah! Excuse me?

504
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
In the office.

505
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,640
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

506
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,440
We have an appointment with Mr Leeman.

507
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,840
Do you know where he is?

508
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,200
Where he is? Let me think.

509
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,960
Would he be in the dining room?

510
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,920
- Might he be in his room?
- Let me think. Where is he?

511
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,640
We've come to collect him.

512
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,360
- We're taking him...
- I'm sorry?

513
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,320
We've come to collect him.

514
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,520
- Oh, you've come to collect him!
- Yes.

515
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
I'm sorry, I didn't realise.

516
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,600
- Modern dress.
- What?

517
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
Your dress is very modern.

518
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,240
I didn't realise women did it.

519
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,640
- Did what?
- Shh-hh.

520
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,720
He's downstairs?

521
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,080
No, no, in the basket.

522
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,320
- I beg your pardon?
- He's in the basket.

523
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,200
- In the basket?
- Yes. Hello.

524
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,640
What's he doing in the basket?

525
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,160
Well, not much.

526
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,320
What are you talking about?

527
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,680
Don't you believe... Look, look.

528
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,480
My God, he's gone. Where is he?

529
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,680
- Fresh laundry.
- They've taken him!

530
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Basil!

531
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
If you could just hang
on a couple of minutes,

532
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,240
sorry to keep you.

533
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,400
It's all right. It's all right.

534
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,120
We've sorted it out. He's in this one.

535
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,040
The Doctor didn't want him in the kitchen,

536
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
so we put him in the basket.

537
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
It's more hygienic.

538
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,080
Basil!

539
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,040
- Yes?
- You do work here?

540
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,280
- Yes.
- We'd like to speak to the manager.

541
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm the manager. Is there a problem?

542
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,080
He is, really.

543
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,320
There seems to be some misunderstanding.

544
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,760
We've come to collect
one of your guests, Mr Leeman,

545
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,720
to take him into town for a meeting.

546
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
- Meeting?
- Yes, a meeting.

547
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,520
With our managing director.

548
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,280
- Oh, I see. Mr Leeman.
- Yes.

549
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,480
We thought you said the linen.

550
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,920
Brilliant! Sorry, sorry, that's it.

551
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,680
- Sorry to keep you.
- Hello, my sweet.

552
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
- What are you doing, Basil?
- It's a bit involved, dear,

553
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,400
but we thought that these gentlemen thought

554
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,560
- that we thought...
- No, no, no...

555
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,320
No, they were coming for Mr Leeman,

556
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
and we thought they were coming
to collect the linen.

557
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Mr Leeman?

558
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,160
So, if you just sort that one out, dear,
I'll take the linen upstairs.

559
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
- I see. Thank you, Basil.
- Not at all.

560
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,880
Would you mind coming
into the office a moment?

561
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,160
- Another one, Fawlty?
- No, same one, Major.

562
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,560
Ah.

563
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,560
Oh, sorry, sorry.

564
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,600
- They've gone into town.
- In there.

565
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,920
Oh, dear!

566
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,400
Sorry, wrong room.

567
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,840
<i>Estoy muy... cansado.</i>

568
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,120
- Back in the basket.
- I can't lift.

569
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,960
- Come on, come on.
- No, too tired.

570
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
There's somebody coming.

571
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,000
Mr Fawlty, I no want to work here any more.

572
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
- Open the basket.
- No.

573
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,120
Open the basket!

574
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
Now, inside.

575
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,880
Not you.

576
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
- I quit.
- Get out!

577
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,640
- I on strike.
- I'm warning you.

578
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,520
I stay here, is nice.

579
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,640
You see this? You're next.

580
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,920
Really, I'm so sorry.

581
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

582
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

583
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,520
Goodbye.

584
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,720
Goodbye.

585
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,040
Yes?

586
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,600
Could I get my hat?

587
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
Your hat?

588
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,560
Yes, it's just there.

589
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,960
Yes, I'll have it sent on.

590
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,120
Do you have a card with your address?

591
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
Well, could I just get it?

592
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,120
Do you have to have it now?

593
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,040
Well, yes.

594
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,760
Supposing you lose it? It is windy today.

595
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,400
I'd like to have it.

596
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,160
Oh, right.

597
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,120
Manuel! Manuel!

598
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,680
He's in the basket.

599
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,320
Polly, would you get Manuel
out of the basket, please?

600
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,520
- Manuel?
- Yes, come on, girl. What's the matter?

601
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
- He isn't in there.
- Yes, he is.

602
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,880
- He isn't.
- He is. Look for him.

603
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,320
Oh, sorry.

604
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,360
You big scab.

605
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,720
See?

606
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,680
Manuel, will you get
this gentlemen his hat?

607
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,800
- Where?
- There.

608
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,920
On the rack.

609
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,120
What colour was it?

610
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
- Brown.
- Brown.

611
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,600
No, that's not it.

612
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Thank you.

613
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,320
Mr Fawlty, I want a word
with you in your office.

614
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
When would be convenient for you?

615
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm 79.

616
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,360
What on earth is going on here?

617
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
Sorry about the eiderdown.
It got a bit caught.

618
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,720
My baby, my baby's dying.

619
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,920
- They poisoned him!
- Your baby?

620
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,320
- Sybil!
- He said he'd call a vet.

621
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,880
- A vet?
- Sybil!

622
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,240
I've cooked these sausages
myself and they're off.

623
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
They should have been eaten by the third.

624
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,120
There you are, dear. You do look nice.

625
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,320
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen.

626
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,160
Laundry's ready! Ladies and gentlemen,

627
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,040
there have been a lot of
cock-ups this morning.

628
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
You all deserve an explanation,
and I'm happy to say

629
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,880
that my wife will give it to you.
Thank you so much.

630
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,240
What's going on, old boy?

631
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,240
Basil!

632
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,280
Basil! Basil!
