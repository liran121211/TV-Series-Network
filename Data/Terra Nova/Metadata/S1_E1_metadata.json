The cop and family man Jim Shannon is happily married with Dr. Elisabeth Shannon, and they have the teenage son Josh; the teenage daughter Maddy; and the three-year-old daughter Zoe. However, the law only allows two children per family and when the police officers find Zoe, Jim hits the commander of the operation and is arrested. He is sentenced to six years in the prison, but two years later, Elisabeth visits him and says that she was invited to go to Terra Nova, a settlement 85 million years in the prehistoric Earth. The problem is that he is in prison and Zoe is not allowed to go. Elisabeth plots a scheme and Jim flees and is transported with his family to the past. On the arrival, they meet the leader, Cmdr. Nathaniel Taylor, who gives an opportunity to Jim to stay in Terra Nova.\u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "The Shannon family joins the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova, the first colony established in this beautiful yet foreboding land. Jim Shannon, a devoted father with a checkered past, guides his family through this new world of limitless beauty, mystery and terror. Upon the Shannons' arrival, they are introduced to Cmdr. Nathaniel Taylor, the charismatic and heroic first pioneer and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it initially appears. Along with blue skies, towering waterfalls and lush vegetation, the surrounding terrain is teeming with danger - and not just of the man-eating dinosaur variety. There is also a splinter colony of renegades led by the battle-hardened Mira, who is vehemently opposed to Taylor and his leadership.\u2014Fox Publicity"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1704518", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1687, "number_of_episodes": 13}
