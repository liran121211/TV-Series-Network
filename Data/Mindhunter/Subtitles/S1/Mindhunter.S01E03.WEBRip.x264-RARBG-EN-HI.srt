to your Edmund Kemper.

00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,149
How do you think the men you
study are similar to Edmund Kemper?

31
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,152
Well, first of all,
they're all psychopaths.

32
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,362
I study captains of industry:

33
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,616
IBM, MGM, Ford, Exxon, you name it.

34
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,952
And sure, these men all have
wives, kids, dogs, goldfish,

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,580
but not because they
stopped being psychopaths,

36
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,916
but because they just
had different leanings.

37
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,543
But you think they have the same
underlying personality traits?

38
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,837
Well, Kemper shows a
total lack of remorse,

39
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,089
a lack of inner emotional structure,

40
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,967
no ability to reflect on
the experience of others.

41
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,470
- You saw this in my notes?
- It would've been clearer

42
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,264
if you'd recorded and transcribed
your interviews verbatim,

43
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,641
but yeah.

44
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,435
Although your project is
obviously in the nascent stages,

45
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,313
it already feels like a clear successor
to<i> The Mask of Sanity,</i>

46
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,357

is quite a compliment.

you don't think this,

49
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,155

50
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,323
[CARR] Just the opposite.

51
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,785
I mean, crazy in the way that anyone
with a truly new idea is crazy.

52
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,412
- But no.
- Wow, okay.

53
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,122
That's a relief.

54
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,458
That hasn't really been the
feedback we've gotten so far.

55
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,002
Actually, this is the only
feedback we've gotten so far.

56
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,213
Well, these men are just
sitting here, locked up.

57
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,423
And we're too afraid
of the morality of it

58
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,592
to see the far-reaching
value of their insights.

59
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,678
Far-reaching in law enforcement?

detection, criminology, you name it.

67
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,489
what their thoughts

the killings, that sort of thing.

71
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,165
[CARR] Well, you can't just circulate
your findings within the FBI.

80
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,437
We travel around the country

- We're seeing Benjamin Miller

82
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,523
in Bridgewater this afternoon.

83
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,287

84
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:41,568
to go out and interview these guys.

85
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,194
We can go bit by bit.

86
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,196
Kemper and Miller and
build out from there.

87
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,032
Make a study in our

88
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,159
I didn't realize that
this was so informal.

89
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,330
We could make it formal. We can
do that easily. And then a book.

00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,417
I guess I just wanted to
get another set of eyes,

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,795
see if you thought this was
valuable from an academic standpoint.

93
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,342
Have you shown your Kemper
notes to your department head?

94
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,966
No.

95
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,305
Teaching police departments,
can someone else do that?

96
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,141
- Anyone can, it's really not that hard.
- That is not true,

97
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,559
and it's beside the point.

98
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,686
Shepard doesn't even want
us to talk about this.

99
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,023
You really think he's going to say
yes to a full-time academic study?

100
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,141
Never mind a book?

101
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,723
You think people would be interested

102
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,072
in this outside of law enforcement?

103
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,283
I mean, imagine,

104
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,704
like truly imagine what it takes
to bludgeon someone to death.

105
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,666
The lust for control,

106
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,668
the feeling of arousal,

107
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,921
the decision to rape the
severed head of your victim,

108
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,298
to humiliate her corpse.

109
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,886
How could you possibly get that
from an ordinary police report?

110
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,974
You know why it took me nearly
a decade to publish my book?

111
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,310
Because narcissists
don't go to the doctor.

112
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,438
Psychopaths are convinced that
there is nothing wrong with them.

113
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,983
So these men are virtually
impossible to study.

114
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,164
Yet you have found a way to study them

115
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,113
in near perfect laboratory conditions.

116
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,825
That's what make this so exciting
and potentially so far-reaching.

117
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,536
It's not that I disagree. I've
spent enough time with Holden

118
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,163
that I know what it means
when he gets that crazy look.

119
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,583
I'm afraid it's just not feasible
within the bureaucracy of the FBI.

120
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,753
We've got weekends. We've got
the evenings after Road School,

121
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,798
an hour or so before Road School.
We don't have to tell Shepard.

122
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,592
Interviewing 40 men across
the States is a full-time job.

123
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,053
And if you want this to be
a legitimate academic study,

124
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,305
then you're looking at
four, maybe five years.

125
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,391
- And compiling, analyzing the data.
- Right.

126
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,894
[LAUGHS] Well...

127
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,064
It's a shame.

128
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,694
We have an interview with Miller in
an hour and it's a bit of a drive.

129
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,657
You know, this is really important work.

130
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,367
If your boss won't let you do it,

131
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,370
then you should talk to someone who
has the freedom and resources to...

132
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,122
[TENCH] We'll stick with it for now.

133
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,708
It'll be slow going, but
we're not ready to give up yet.

134
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,959
Of course not.

135
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,337
But it's good to get some encouragement,
even if our hands are tied.

136
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,039

137
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,832
It's a pleasure.

138
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,635
- What if...
- Don't.

139
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,137
- I'm just saying we could...
- Holden.

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,641
Look, I'm frustrated too.

141
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,038
You know, they shoot
the birds in the yard

142
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,648
because they might
be smuggling in drugs.

143
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,987
Actually, I don't know if that's
true. A girlfriend told me once.

144
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,573
- You date a lot of ex-cons?
- No.

145
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,320
Actually, Debbie's the first girl

146
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,828
I've really dated-dated
since high school.

147
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,580
- Dated-dated.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,833
My wife's the first woman
that I've married-married.

149
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,671
I thought they said 3:00.
What are we waiting for?

150
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,799
You'd be less fidgety
if you smoked cigarettes.

152
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,718

[MAN] Bureau Agents Tench and Ford?

155
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,326
Gentlemen. I'm Dr. Cale. We
spoke earlier on the phone.

156
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,746
Thanks for doing this, Doctor. We
realize it's somewhat unorthodox.

157
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,040
Unfortunately, Miller
says he won't talk to you.

158
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,389
Now, we told him in
advance and he agreed,

159
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,253
but there's really
nothing we can do now.

160
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,964
- He should be in a better mood tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

161
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,632
Well, he gets like this sometimes.

162
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,343
Just needs a cool-off period
before he can interact with people.

163
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,263
We have to bring him food into
his cell because he won't come out.

164
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,431
We're headed out tonight.
We can't come in tomorrow.

No.

463
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,811
My point is, in reality, it
doesn't work the way you expect.

464
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:47,147
When you stab somebody,
they're supposed to fall dead.

465
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,271
They go, "Oh... "

00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,609
- And they fall dead, right?
- Right.

467
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,279
In reality, when you stab
somebody, they lose blood pressure

468
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,616
and they leak to death very slowly.

469
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,410

You know, it all really goes back

473
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:15,259
to my perceived inability to
communicate socially, sexually.

474
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,721
I was scared to death of failing
in male-female relationships,

even sitting down to
talk to a young lady.

476
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,143
I wanted to communicate.

477
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,897
Ironically enough, that's
why I began picking people up.

478
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,649

479
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,068

further each time.

480
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,153
It's a daring kind of a thing.

481
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,447
Like, first, there wasn't a gun.

482
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,408
Then I'm driving along,

483
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,452
we go to a vulnerable place where
there aren't people watching,

484
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,871
but I say, "No, I can't."

485
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,123

but didn't kill them?

486
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,042
But then, a gun is in the car,

487
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,878
and this craving,

488
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,506
this awful raging, eating
feeling is inside me.

have just raped them,

but not having any experience at all,

491
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,975
I could feel it consuming my
insides, this fantastic passion.

499
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,243
- enjoy the thrill.

Otherwise, they'll just
be in a great deal of pain.

505
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,718
That's how I learnt
the term "ear to ear,"

506
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,094
literally, what that meant.

507
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,513
People think it's just an expression.

508
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,474
It's not, it's an instruction.

509
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,310
You don't want to. You have to.

[ED] Sure there is.

512
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,982
I just wanted the
exaltation over the party.

513
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,443
In other words, winning over death.

514
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,821
They were dead and I was
alive. That was the pleasure.

515
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,616
I was the hunter, they were my victims.

[CLEARS THROAT, SIGHS]

518
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,502
I liked Mary the best.

519
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,504
I was lukewarm on Anita.

520

What was wrong with her?

521

[ED] Oh, nothing in particular.

522
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,844
It was more that Mary was...

523
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,059
I was really quite struck by
her personality and her looks,

524
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,687
and there was just
almost a reverence there.

525
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,855
- Reverence?
- Sure.

526
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,441
Sometimes, afterward, I
visited there to be near her

527

I was very much out of
touch with women my own age.

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,344
When I got back on the street, it
was like being on a strange planet.

I was like an old fogy.

confessed to the police,

Your mom... maybe?

Obviously, not the way
you're talking to us.

From the moment I
woke up in the morning,

she was demeaning and belittling.

You know, that night
I walked up to her bed.

Because I couldn't shut her up.

She wanted to destroy
me with words, literally.

So I shut her up for good.

And now, everyone knows it was
because of what she did to me,

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,674
Was she hot?

679
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,885
- Who?
- His mom?

680
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,803
- Ugh...
- [LAUGHS]

681
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,990
Guys in my high school
thought my mom was hot

682
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:49,142
and it always really disgusted me.

683
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,761
But then she went through chemo

684
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:52,729
and nobody made jokes about her anymore

685
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,815
- and it kind of made me sad.
- I didn't know your mom had cancer.

686
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,194
That's why I'm always asking you
to grab my boobs when we're fucking.

687
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,782
- Make you check for cancerous lumps.
- Oh, is that why? [SPITS]

688
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,075
[WATER RUNNING]

689
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,790
I can't let these guys rub off on me.

690
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,125
- The way they view sex.
- And women.

691
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,553
Thanks for coming.

692
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,139
I needed to see you.

693
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,062
And now that I'm all clean...

694
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,712
If going down on me
while I'm filing my nails

695
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:41,444
is your idea of being kinky...

696
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,238
I'm kinky.

697
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,452
I'm very kinky.

698
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,581
I could impale you with this nail file.

699
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,751
Then I could be a part
of your case study.

700
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,337
You would be a very
compelling interviewee.

701
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,107
[HOLDEN] Hey, Kenneth,
can I ask you something?

702
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
Oh, sure. What's on your mind?

703
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,385
I've, uh, done a bit of thinking about

704
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:24,821
some of the things that we're teaching.

705
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,032
In particular, the list
of deviant terminology.

706
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,158
The cuss words?

707
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,327
Right. Well, I was thinking more the...

708
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,914
- descriptors of the acts.
- Uh...

709
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,875
You know, fellatio, cunnilingus...

710
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,002
Okay, what exactly is the issue?

711
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,337
Well, that's just it,
Ken. I don't have an issue.

712
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,756
I really don't know
that they are deviant.

713
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,800
Anal violation?

714
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,552
Well, no, not that one.

715
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,721
- Have you talked to Bill about this?
- Oh, sure.

716
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,264
Bill agrees with me.

717
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,100
And you think we should
alter the curriculum?

718
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,936
Just... take a look at the list.

719
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,564
- Think about it, okay?
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.

720
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,528
- [WOMAN] Fuckhead?
- You can keep that.

721
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,738
Fuckbag?

722
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,281
That, too.

723
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,991
And we're keeping "gang bang"?

724
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,242
What's right is right.

725
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,194
Klismaphilia?

726
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,154
Klisma... what?

727
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,749
Enemas. Either giving or having.

728
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,035
That can stay.

729
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,174
And we're losing "pussy," "dildo,"

730
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,302
"fellatio," "cunnilingus."

731
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,720
Are you sure about this?

732
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,843
Yes.

733
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,931
Thank you, Marge.

734
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,433
It's for the best.

735
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:37,727
All right.

736
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,396
[HOLDEN]<i> So, you and Dr. Carr go back?</i>

737
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,107
I consulted her on a
few cases here and there.

738
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,693
We go back a few years. Why do you ask?

739
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:46,778
Just curious.

740
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,324
No.

741
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,076
- No?
- You know what I mean.

742
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,662
- I didn't mean to imply...
- I enjoy being married, thank you.

743
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,955
I didn't mean...

744
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,249
Just... Wendy has something.

745
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,668
Not sexual.

746
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,213
Maybe a little sexual.

747
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,258
But her ideas and her energy,
she... I sound like an idiot.

748
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,594
You sound like you
have a crush on teacher.

749
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:15,014
It's just someone like her embracing
this project says something.

750
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,935
- Don't you think?
- I get it.

751
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,145
Old Man Tench jumps onboard, so what?

752
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,272
Grumpy old Shepard, who cares?

753
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,733
- But the foxy professor...
- That's not fair.

754
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,444
[HOLDEN] That's her.

755
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,034
- Dr. Carr.
- Agent Ford.

756
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,161
- [TENCH] Welcome to Quantico.
- Thank you.

757
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,705
How was your trip?

758
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,333
It was a little dull to be honest.
I was grading papers, but...

759
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,752
We can stop at the cafeteria
for a coffee if you like.

760
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,754
No, I'm fine. I had some this morning.

761
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,257
We're just this way.

762
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,552
So what are you teaching?

763
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,555
Um, I'm teaching a class

764
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,099
on the intersection
of sociopathy and fame.

765
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,728
People like, um... Andy
Warhol, Jim Morrison.

766
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,523
Their celebrity becomes the only
thing they need to sustain their ego.

767
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,359
- Nixon was a sociopath.
- Very similar.

768
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,778
How do you get to be
president of the United States

769
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,113
if you're a sociopath?

770
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,199
The question is, how do you get to
be president of the United States

771
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,493
- if you're not?
- [TENCH LAUGHS]

772
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,873
That's why this work is so vital.
It goes so much further than the FBI.

773
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,376
- [TENCH] All the way to the White House.
- [CARR] Perhaps, yeah.
