Flooded forests are home to caiman-hunting jaguars and strange dolphins that swim amongst the tree tops, while in the dense underworld, ninja frogs fight off wasps and flying dragons soar between trees. Acrobatic indri leap through the forests of Madagascar, while the jungle night conceals strange fungi and glow-in-the-dark creatures never filmed before.\u2014BBC One", "Jungles are by far the most diverse biotopes, providing very rich resources which also cause extreme competition and specialization, sometimes in exclusive symbiosis as between specially shape flowers and matching humming bird-beaks. May species live at a specific height. In the tree crests monkeys are perfectly adapted to beach-swinging, yet many youngsters don't survive, The Amazonian food pyramid is large, even the caimans, who devour everything else, are on the menu of apex feline jaguar.
