From Asia's bizarre-looking saiga antelope to the giant anteaters of Brazil, grassland animals have adapted in extraordinary ways to cope with these extremes. In the flooded Okavango, lions take on formidable buffalo in epic battles, on the savannah bee-eaters take advantage of elephants to help catch insects and, on the freezing northern tundra, caribou embark on great migrations shadowed by hungry Arctic wolves.", "Grasses cover a quarter of the planet's land mass, the base of many vast, complex food chains, starring grazers as diverse as the Kazach saiga-antelope and the Cape Buffalo, with matching predators, except for the elephant, in Asia still outgrown by the largest grass. Some 10,000 species adapted to any open space from poles to equator. Yet about a third is consumed by insects, notably fungus-farming ants and termites, a major food source in their own right, as for Argentina's anteater, whoso unrivaled long tongue and claws larger then a velociraptor dinosaur's penetrate their castle-like nests.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6209140", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 2978, "number_of_episodes": 6}
