1
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,891
Earth is the only planet we
know of where life exists.

2
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,651
And, here, it does so in abundance.

3
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:52,932
The jungle is Eden.

4
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:59,491
It covers less than 6%
of the Earth's surface

5
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,652
but it's home to half of all

6
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,493
the plants and animals on land.

7
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,652
Jungles have just the
right amount of light,

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:16,054
water and nutrients, and they
have had every day for millennia.

9
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:23,495
Life here should be easy.

10
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,896
This is an indri.

11
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:38,736
It's a primate, like us.

12
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:44,056
And these forests in
Madagascar are its home.

13
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:52,817
But to survive here...

14
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:56,818
...it has to face one major challenge.

15
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:05,138
Paradise is crowded.

16
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,419
Life fills every niche.

17
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:19,059
And, at any one time, a staggering
variety of species and countless

18
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,620
individuals are striving
for space and food.

19
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:35,060
Like every jungle animal,

20
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,620
indri have to find their own way to survive

21
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,742
in the most competitive place on Earth.

22
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:09,344
Jungles are complex places...

23
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:16,345
...tangled three-dimensional worlds
created by lush tropical vegetation.

24
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:25,625
90% of the animals here spend
their whole lives up in the trees.

25
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,386
And each of them has to find
its own way of getting around.

26
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,947
Hanging 100 feet above the
ground, a spider monkey.

27
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:48,346
They travel in family groups and
find everything they need in the top

28
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,988
storey of the jungle.

29
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:54,588
Up here isn't a place
for the faint-hearted.

30
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:02,148
With long limbs and a prehensile
tail that can grip like a hand,

31
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:03,669
they're built for climbing.

32
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:15,310
But imagine having to learn
these skills as high up as this.

33
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,511
One third of spider monkeys
never make it to adulthood.

34
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:30,751
This youngster is only a few months old.

35
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:36,392
Her future depends on her ability to climb.

36
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:42,671
Playing on a practice tree with
her older brother and sister,

37
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:46,233
she's already learning to use
her tail as a safety line...

38
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,633
...under her father's close watch.

39
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,994
She's keen to join in the game
but she's the youngest and,

40
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:14,155
as is the way of things,
she's not always welcome.

41
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:23,276
So she chooses her own place to play.

42
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,876
But not all trees are the same.

43
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:35,637
This one is for more advanced climbers.

44
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:47,758
Enthusiasm? Certainly!

45
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,119
Technique?

46
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,039
Room for improvement.

47
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,479
Meanwhile, some of her family have
moved on to look for a new patch of

48
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,520
fresh food.

49
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,240
The top of the canopy isn't for youngsters.

50
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:20,760
But Father's not looking and the
temptation to join the others is

51
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:21,801
irresistible.

52
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:31,561
She'll need to be careful.

53
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:34,482
A fall from here would mean certain death.

54
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:46,443
It's the first time she's been
as high as this on her own.

55
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,885
As she climbs still higher, the
branches get thinner and thinner.

56
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,327
Her tail has caught her...

57
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:33,728
...but now she's stuck in mid-air,
unable to reach any other branch.

58
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,289
Father, however, was watching.

59
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,568
He's big and strong enough to form a
bridge with his body so that she can

60
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:56,610
climb to safety.

61
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:28,852
Lesson learned.

62
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:39,013
But it's not just monkeys that
live here, up in the treetops.

63
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:52,094
And, if you are small, finding the
right tree can mean a home for life.

64
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,094
He's a Draco lizard.

65
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:03,856
He's only the size of a
pencil and he eats ants.

66
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:16,296
This one tree could provide him
with all he will ever need...

67
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:18,137
a conveyor belt of food.

68
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:24,137
It's a perfect place to settle down.

69
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,578
Well, it would be...

70
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,658
...but there's already someone here.

71
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,899
This larger male is the tree's owner.

72
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,060
And Dracos don't share.

73
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:03,381
The owner's flag is a warning.

74
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:09,381
Trespassers won't be tolerated.

75
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,742
The owner's not only intimidating...

76
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:18,142
...he's prepared to battle.

77
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:32,143
A dead end.

78
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:36,304
Safety is a long way away.

79
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:40,704
Now he must choose.

80
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,624
Fight...

81
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,665
...or flee?

82
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:10,387
Only in the jungle do you find
lizards that can soar like dragons.

83
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:17,947
He can travel over 100
feet in a single leap.

84
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:23,868
It's a very fast and efficient
way to move through the jungle.

85
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:36,429
Maybe this new tree will have
food and no resident owner.

86
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,430
Everything in the jungle
has to compete for space.

87
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,751
Only 2% of the sun's
rays reach the ground...

88
00:11:57,711 --> 00:12:00,150
...so even the plants
must battle for the light

89
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:01,711
they need if they're to grow.

90
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:13,672
300 years ago, this Hura
tree began its race for light.

91
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:20,992
And every day since, it has absorbed
the water and sunshine it needed to

92
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:23,073
grow into a giant.

93
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:36,514
It has succeeded in doing what
every tree must do to survive...

94
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,635
...rise above the gloom
of the jungle floor.

95
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:53,036
And, what is more, its success
has given life to others.

96
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:07,197
Its branches now carry 1,000 other plants.

97
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,757
These particular ferns,

98
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:17,078
figs and orchids live only on
the branches of other trees.

99
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:26,119
1,000 plants growing on one single tree.

100
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:32,559
Throughout the forest, this
story is repeated endless times.

101
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,439
As a consequence, jungles are home

102
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,360
to more species of plants
than anywhere else on Earth.

103
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,601
And they, in turn, support
a wealth of animals.

104
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:58,442
In Ecuador, the competition
is at its most intense.

105
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,802
Here, there are 100 species
of hummingbirds alone...

106
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:08,723
...all fighting for nectar.

107
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,042
Each flower only has a
small amount at any one time,

108
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,283
and so it's first come, first served.

109
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:26,923
One hummingbird has gone to
great lengths to avoid conflict

110
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:28,444
with other species.

111
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:37,325
Swordbills are the only bird with
a beak longer than their body.

112
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:44,365
And some flowers are too elongated
for the other 99 species of

113
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,686
hummingbirds here to feed from them.

114
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:02,006
A swordbill's extraordinary beak, however,

115
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:05,048
enables it to reach the
places that others can't...

116
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:13,248
...the top of this flower, where
the sweet nectar is produced.

117
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:19,569
It has found a solution that means
it doesn't have to join the fight.

118
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,569
And, as each long flower blooms, it
gives the swordbill a fresh supply

119
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,690
of food all to itself.

120
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:48,451
But having a beak longer than
your body does have its drawbacks.

121
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:55,972
For a start, it's tricky to keep it clean.

122
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:12,094
Harder still, how do you
preen your body feathers?

123
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:16,573
Unlike the other hummers,

124
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:19,814
swordbills can't reach their
feathers with their beak.

125
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:30,535
The only option, a good old scratch.

126
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:51,337
It's a little unrefined...

127
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:58,058
...but a small price to pay
for an exclusive food supply...

128
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:06,417
...especially when feeding times
are only too frequently interrupted

129
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:08,458
by storms.

130
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:18,578
Jungles are the richest places on Earth

131
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,940
because of one remarkable fact...

132
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,060
...they make their own weather.

133
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:36,341
Every day, water rises from the
surface of the leaves as vapour.

134
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:41,862
It's as if the trees breathe out clouds.

135
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:47,942
They gather over the
forest until, finally...

136
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,902
...they burst.

137
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:10,464
Rain is the lifeblood of every jungle.

138
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:23,945
And all have to do their best
to endure the daily downpour.

139
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,028
In some jungles, like here in Brazil,

140
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,389
it rains so much that, for
part of the year, the trees are

141
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,070
almost totally submerged.

142
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:28,791
The forest floor is 30 feet
below the water's surface.

143
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:38,072
This is a mysterious world, a
place few people have ever explored.

144
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:51,233
We have much to discover about the
animals for which this is home...

145
00:19:55,473 --> 00:20:00,754
...including some you might never
expect to find amongst trees.

146
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:19,396
Here, 1,000 miles from
the sea, are dolphins.

147
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:29,636
A newly identified species of river
dolphin found nowhere else on Earth.

148
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:48,397
In these black, tangled waters, they
have become almost totally blind,

149
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:50,477
so they move slowly,

150
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:55,159
carefully using their sonar to
scan the forest floor for fish.

151
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,120
If this forest can hide
a new species of dolphin...

152
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,440
...what else might there
be here, awaiting discovery?

153
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,080
At the shallow margins
of the flooded jungle,

154
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,961
rivers flow through lush vegetation.

155
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:28,162
Here, food is so abundant,
it supports giants.

156
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:33,562
Capybara, the biggest
rodents in the world...

157
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,883
...giant otters the size of a man...

158
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:49,283
...and the rulers of these rivers...

159
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,684
...caiman.

160
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:56,363
They grow to ten feet
long and kill anything

161
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:58,364
they get between their jaws.

162
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:06,845
But there are more artful hunters...

163
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:11,325
...drawn here from the surrounding forest.

164
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:27,367
A jaguar, the supreme jungle predator.

165
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:37,528
The river marks the
edge of his territory...

166
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,168
...but here he has competition.

167
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,090
He's now in the territory of a female.

168
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:16,651
She has ruled this stretch
of river for five years.

169
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:21,572
This is her place to hunt.

170
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:54,095
Capybara are strong and wary.

171
00:23:57,455 --> 00:23:59,335
The key is stealth.

172
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:22,177
She needs to get within
three feet if she's to pounce.

173
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:46,139
Not this time.

174
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,060
She's not the only female here.

175
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:05,221
Each part of this jungle's edge
is ruled by a different queen.

176
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:21,182
Few places on Earth have enough
food to support so many big cats.

177
00:25:47,225 --> 00:25:49,585
The male hunts in a different way.

178
00:25:57,186 --> 00:26:01,266
Weighing almost 300 lbs,
it's hard to be stealthy...

179
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:07,465
...and with so many other jaguars around,

180
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,227
he doesn't bother with wary capybara.

181
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:18,787
He seeks a different prey.

182
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,949
He's become a killer

183
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,390
of killers.

184
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:16,913
Jaguars have the most
powerful bite of any cat.

185
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:23,833
And he knows the caiman's
most vulnerable point...

186
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,594
...the back of its skull.

187
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:59,355
Hunters living in the dense
understorey of the jungle

188
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:01,837
come in all shapes and sizes.

189
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:06,357
But they share a problem.

190
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,358
How to tell what is a
plant, and what is prey.

191
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:23,998
This is a game of hide and
seek that can be won or lost

192
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,719
in the blink of an eye.

193
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:59,561
The long contest between predator and prey

194
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:03,202
has produced mimicry
of astounding accuracy.

195
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:25,164
A leaf-tailed gecko
masquerading as lichen.

196
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:54,567
Some animals take camouflage
a stage further still...

197
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:00,966
...and these streams in Costa Rica

198
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,727
are home to one of the most remarkable.

199
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,489
A glass frog.

200
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:30,129
A male, and tiny, no
bigger than your fingernail

201
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,330
and almost entirely transparent...

202
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,930
...as he needs to be.

203
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:45,210
Almost everything that walks
past here could eat him,

204
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,731
even a cricket.

205
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:55,851
His best chance is to stay
absolutely still and trust that

206
00:30:55,852 --> 00:30:57,932
the cricket looks right through him.

207
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,933
Danger passed,

208
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:26,374
and that's just as well,

209
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,455
because he is a father...

210
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,096
...and he's guarding
some very precious eggs.

211
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:42,895
For the last few weeks,
females, one after the other,

212
00:31:42,896 --> 00:31:46,177
have visited him and entrusted
him with their offspring.

213
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:52,217
Some are now almost ready to hatch.

214
00:31:56,417 --> 00:32:00,057
There are several clutches on
the leaf, and those at the top,

215
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:03,418
the most recently laid,
are barely a day old.

216
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:13,059
But in the jungle, there's
always someone out to get you.

217
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:23,820
This wasp is a specialist
hunter of frogs' eggs.

218
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,020
It's noticed the wriggling
tadpoles at the bottom of the leaf.

219
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:36,901
He mustn't move.

220
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,940
The youngest eggs are the most vulnerable,

221
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:42,542
and he can't guard them all.

222
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:06,344
But these tadpoles are not as
helpless as they might appear.

223
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:19,144
Incredibly, the unhatched
tadpoles can sense danger,

224
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:24,145
and the oldest and strongest wriggle
free and drop into the stream below.

225
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:44,666
The eggs at the top of the leaf, however,

226
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:48,386
are still too young to hatch,

227
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:50,788
and now the wasps know they're there.

228
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:59,588
But the male's back looks very
like the youngest cluster of eggs...

229
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:06,469
...and that seems to confuse the wasps.

230
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:32,271
Using his own body as
a decoy is a huge risk.

231
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,272
The wasp stings could kill him.

232
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:06,474
He's managed to save most of his young.

233
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:15,994
He'll have to remain on
guard for another two weeks,

234
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:20,996
but in the jungle, just surviving
the day can count as a success.

235
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:37,116
With the coming of the night,

236
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:40,797
a new cast of jungle
characters takes to the stage.

237
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:49,158
Flying insects begin to glow
as they search for mates.

238
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,239
Fungi, unlike plants, thrive in
the darkness of the forest floor.

239
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,199
They're hidden until they begin to
develop the incredible structures

240
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
with which they reproduce.

241
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,559
Each releases millions
of microscopic spores

242
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,720
that drift invisibly away.

243
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:25,920
Many have fruiting bodies that reach
upwards to catch any feeble current

244
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:28,002
there might be in the clammy air.

245
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,481
But this one, as it grows,

246
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:36,922
becomes luminous.

247
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:53,204
Why fungi light up has
remained a mystery...

248
00:37:00,004 --> 00:37:01,245
...until now.

249
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:13,365
Scientists studying the
brightest fungi in the world

250
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:15,686
think they may have an answer.

251
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,927
Like a beacon, the light attracts insects.

252
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,527
From far and wide.

253
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:45,207
To this click beetle, a bright
light means only one thing...

254
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,688
a female click beetle,

255
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:50,209
so he flashes in reply.

256
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,970
But he doesn't get the
reception he was expecting.

257
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:14,931
Confused, he starts searching for
a female, and that helps the fungus.

258
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:21,132
By the time he gives up, he's
covered in the fungus's spores.

259
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,451
And, as he continues
his quest for a female,

260
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:28,652
he carries these spores to
other parts of the forest.

261
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:36,733
And there are even stranger
things glowing in the jungle night.

262
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:45,494
These are the multicoloured
lights of a railroad worm.

263
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:51,654
It's not really a worm, but a
poisonous, caterpillar-like beetle.

264
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:58,615
The yellow lights warn other
creatures to keep out of its way.

265
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,016
It's hunting for millipedes.

266
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:25,897
When it finds the trail of one,
it switches off its yellow lights.

267
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:35,658
Now it only has a red light on its head.

268
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:44,019
Millipedes can't see red light.

269
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:54,660
So, to them, the railroad worm in
stealth mode is virtually invisible.

270
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:09,781
And that is the end of the millipede.

271
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:26,182
Competition in the jungles
forces animals to specialise

272
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:29,222
in every aspect of their life,

273
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:30,783
including courtship.

274
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:37,863
This has produced some of the most
beautiful and elaborate displays

275
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,344
on the planet.

276
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:47,144
A male red bird-of-paradise,

277
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,745
competing to attract a female by dancing.

278
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,985
One has come to survey what's on offer.

279
00:41:13,027 --> 00:41:14,986
She is an independent lady,

280
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:20,187
and she will select whichever
male takes her fancy.

281
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:37,549
She makes her choice.

282
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:58,991
But now she doesn't seem quite so sure.

283
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:12,232
No? Perhaps he's just a little too keen.

284
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:27,834
Maybe he'll have better luck tomorrow.

285
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:40,435
Red birds-of-paradise
display in the treetops.

286
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:47,715
Other members of the family dance
in the gloom of the forest floor.

287
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:54,396
This is a Wilson's
bird-of-paradise.

288
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:59,236
He's brightly coloured, but
about the size of a sparrow.

289
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:07,756
He's lived most of his life
alone, but now he's an adult,

290
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:10,357
and he too needs to attract a mate.

291
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:17,798
This little patch of
light might help him do so.

292
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:27,398
First, he tidies things up.

293
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:32,398
Showing off in this jumble
of leaves wouldn't be easy,

294
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:36,720
and his beauty will stand out
better against a plain background.

295
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,400
He doesn't want bright leaves
to divert a visitor's attention.

296
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:50,801
They all need to go.

297
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:56,001
Even the green ones.

298
00:43:58,882 --> 00:44:00,722
Especially the green ones.

299
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:12,842
His stage is set.

300
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:16,322
A central pole, and a
little patch of light.

301
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:17,363
It's perfect.

302
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:24,763
And now, he must hope
a female hears his call.

303
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,525
He can wait here for weeks on end.

304
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:50,446
At last, a female.

305
00:44:53,246 --> 00:44:55,527
Time to take up position.

306
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:01,447
She will judge him by the
brightness of his feathers.

307
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:09,927
But for the female to see him at his best,

308
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:15,527
he needs her to perch
directly above his stage,

309
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:16,929
under the light.

310
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,769
This might be his only chance to shine.

311
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,849
Now, when she's looking directly
down on him, he reveals a display

312
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,690
for her eyes only.

313
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:45,170
In the gloom of the forest floor,

314
00:45:45,171 --> 00:45:48,971
he is a dazzling blaze of iridescent green.

315
00:45:50,732 --> 00:45:53,532
The brightest leaf in the forest.

316
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:03,653
And that does the trick.

317
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:18,013
Each animal must find its own
way of surviving the competition

318
00:46:18,014 --> 00:46:19,534
of the jungle.

319
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:36,815
This crowded world is so full of
invention that almost all kinds

320
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:41,176
of animals on land can trace
their origins back here...

321
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,737
...including us.

322
00:46:51,217 --> 00:46:56,017
These forests in Madagascar are
home to one of our distant cousins.

323
00:47:00,178 --> 00:47:05,017
This female indri has fought to
keep this particular patch of forest

324
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:08,417
safe for herself and her family.

325
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:22,259
Every morning, the family
come together to sing,

326
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,220
their way of reminding others
that this is their home.

327
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:35,980
Indri are so closely adapted to living here

328
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,861
that now they can live nowhere else.

329
00:47:42,742 --> 00:47:47,901
For them and the billions of animals
with whom they share their home,

330
00:47:47,902 --> 00:47:50,422
the jungle is a sanctuary.

331
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:56,583
But this is changing.

332
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:04,502
Even in the ten years since the
head of this family was born,

333
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:08,543
one million hectares of the
rainforest have been destroyed

334
00:48:08,544 --> 00:48:12,103
in Madagascar alone,

335
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:15,824
and, with it, half the indri
families that once lived there.

336
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:26,104
The local people say the indris
are our brothers and their song is

337
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:30,186
a call to remind us that we,
too, once depended on the jungle.

338
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:43,587
This Eden is still a
place of wonder and magic.

339
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:52,628
Something, surely, worth protecting.

340
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:14,229
Jungles are still some of the
least explored places on Earth,

341
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,629
and with good reason.

342
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,590
They are testing places to work.

343
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,870
Here in the flooded forests of Brazil,

344
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:29,311
the team are on the trail of a newly
discovered species of river dolphin.

345
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:34,871
So little is known about it that
just finding it will be a challenge.

346
00:49:36,512 --> 00:49:42,551
Their base for five weeks is a hut
on the only bit of dry land around,

347
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:44,911
but it's already occupied.

348
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:47,472
It appears someone's been making a nest.

349
00:49:47,473 --> 00:49:48,792
A resident rat.

350
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:52,912
- Hello, little rat.
- And on the food cupboard...

351
00:49:52,913 --> 00:49:55,753
Hello. Are you a bit shy?

352
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:03,834
If the housemates are hostile,
the hitchhikers are even worse.

353
00:50:06,274 --> 00:50:07,834
A large spider.

354
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:10,315
Oh, my God.

355
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:15,554
And a colony of aggressive
red ants looking for a ride.

356
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,594
Shall we knock into them?

357
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:21,315
They'll board the boat
like a bunch of pirates,

358
00:50:21,316 --> 00:50:22,756
and they'll gnaw our faces off.

359
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:27,835
That might not be quite true,

360
00:50:27,836 --> 00:50:31,317
but intimidating animals are
the least of their problems.

361
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:36,196
The flooded forest is not only vast,

362
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:40,756
it's impenetrable, and this new
species of dolphin could be anywhere

363
00:50:40,757 --> 00:50:44,998
in 150,000 square miles
of tangled treetops.

364
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:48,798
But the crew have a plan.

365
00:50:50,078 --> 00:50:53,597
Dolphins use sound to find their
way through the flooded forest

366
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:55,639
by making clicks. Sonar.

367
00:50:56,759 --> 00:51:00,678
Waterproof microphones allow the
crew to eavesdrop on the dolphins,

368
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:02,239
and so follow them.

369
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,000
But that's easier said than done.

370
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,639
So, this is the clear path.

371
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,441
Can you see it? There.

372
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:28,081
It takes them a week to get their
first glimpse of this new species,

373
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:30,642
and even then, it lasts less than a second.

374
00:51:34,002 --> 00:51:36,362
There appears to be only one dolphin.

375
00:51:40,443 --> 00:51:44,203
And, frustratingly, it can pop
up anywhere without warning.

376
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:50,043
Been looking through the water
and seeing bodies kind of appear

377
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:53,844
out of the murk, and then disappear again.

378
00:51:56,764 --> 00:52:00,604
Eventually, the dolphin leads the
crew to an open gap in the forest.

379
00:52:11,245 --> 00:52:13,686
We made it! Yay!

380
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:20,366
Here, at last, there may be a chance
of getting something in the can.

381
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:32,487
Their first shot, but again, a
single breath, and then it's gone.

382
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:40,607
- Hello, you.
- With the dolphin as close as this,

383
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:43,127
the crew can try a different technique...

384
00:52:43,128 --> 00:52:45,688
towing an underwater
camera behind the boat.

385
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:52,089
Dolphin literally just
came up parallel to it.

386
00:52:53,209 --> 00:52:56,608
The problem is that the water
is so murky, that the dolphin is

387
00:52:56,609 --> 00:52:59,650
almost invisible, even when
right next to the camera.

388
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,650
However, now the dolphin
is in this channel,

389
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:11,491
the crew can try a different tack.

390
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:22,852
Michael Sanderson is a drone operator.

391
00:53:26,092 --> 00:53:28,251
As long as the dolphin's in open water,

392
00:53:28,252 --> 00:53:30,572
it might be possible to
follow it from the air.

393
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:37,252
We've worked out the
dolphins seem to be here,

394
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:41,293
and we can do the drone work,
so this is our kind of best bet.

395
00:53:42,293 --> 00:53:45,013
Leaving Michael and his
drone on the sand spit,

396
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,974
the crew head back to open water.

397
00:53:48,214 --> 00:53:50,934
But this is called the
flooded forest for a reason.

398
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:55,974
The rain here can be torrential,

399
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:58,774
and although storms normally pass quickly,

400
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:00,975
this one is clearly not a normal storm.

401
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:08,295
Is it not working?

402
00:54:08,296 --> 00:54:11,215
The motor has broken, and
with the boat flooding,

403
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:12,736
the crew must head for the bank.

404
00:54:19,057 --> 00:54:20,936
It looked like the
rainstorm was going to pass,

405
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:24,136
and it hasn't passed at
all. It's very, very heavy,

406
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:26,457
and I'm soaked through to the skin.

407
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:34,137
They're stranded, the
kit is getting drenched,

408
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:37,497
trees are falling, and Michael
is trapped somewhere down-river.

409
00:54:37,498 --> 00:54:41,338
This is the hardest rain
I've ever seen in my life.

410
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:45,018
- It's incredible.
- I'm hoping Michael's all right.

411
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:48,298
And there's been tree fall
all up around behind us.

412
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:51,179
Michael's down there on
a tiny little sand spit,

413
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,420
with the other boat,
with his opticopter out.

414
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,060
Kind of scary.

415
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,699
After two hours,

416
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,340
a break in the storm gives Michael
a chance to rejoin the team.

417
00:55:04,341 --> 00:55:08,420
Just got caught in one of the
heaviest storms I've ever seen.

418
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:13,541
Got up to this much water on
the tarp, and the other one, so

419
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:16,141
I don't know if this is
going to live any more,

420
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:18,781
because that was on the floor.

421
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:22,101
It looks like it's game over for the drone.

422
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:24,223
Yeah, it was pretty scary, wasn't it?

423
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:30,063
Over the next 12 hours, the
storm returns again and again.

424
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:33,422
If this bad weather continues,

425
00:55:33,423 --> 00:55:36,384
the crew may not be able to
get back out to the dolphin.

426
00:55:41,984 --> 00:55:44,703
The next morning,

427
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:48,025
clear skies, and the
drone might be fixable.

428
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:52,504
But the longer it takes, the
more chance that the dolphin

429
00:55:52,505 --> 00:55:55,624
will have returned to the flooded forest,

430
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,505
and then it'll be back to square one.

431
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:02,266
But finally, their luck is in.

432
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:06,146
The dolphin is still there.

433
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:11,106
For the first time, they
have a chance to film

434
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:14,426
from the water and the
air, and finally discover

435
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:16,827
what this elusive animal is really doing.

436
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:21,627
They were in the boat and they
were looking around and going,

437
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,867
"Yeah, there are some bubbles."

438
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:27,747
We were flying with the drone
and we could see dolphins,

439
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:32,388
and while they thought they could
only see one dolphin, we saw five.

440
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,508
And they had no idea.

441
00:56:34,509 --> 00:56:37,748
The crew are surprised to find
these dolphins aren't solitary,

442
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:40,508
but come together to hunt as a team.

443
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:43,669
You're starting to see stuff with
the drone that you suddenly go,

444
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,989
"I thought there was
one dolphin there," and

445
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,789
then you count that there are five
and then you're looking in one place

446
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,509
and they're all behind
you, laughing at you.

447
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,950
This new perspective has
given the crew a first glimpse

448
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:57,990
into a mysterious jungle animal

449
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:01,471
in one of the least-known
corners of the Earth.

450
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:14,432
Next time... a land of extremes
that pushes life to the limit.

451
00:57:16,673 --> 00:57:20,313
Animals have extraordinary ways of
dealing with the hostile conditions.

452
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:26,512
Creating the most epic
survival stories on Earth.

453
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:28,154
These are deserts.
