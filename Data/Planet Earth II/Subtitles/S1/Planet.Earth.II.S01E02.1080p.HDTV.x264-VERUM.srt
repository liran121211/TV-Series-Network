1
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:43,735
There are only a dozen peaks in
the world that rise five miles high.

2
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:55,738
All of them are here, in the Himalayas.

3
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,580
Lethally cold, scoured
by gales and blizzards,

4
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:14,382
these mountains are among the
most hostile places on Earth.

5
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:28,065
Yet, a few special animals
manage to live here.

6
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,507
Snow leopards.

7
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,187
Like all creatures of the high mountains,

8
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,788
they have had to adapt both
their body and their behaviour

9
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,549
in order to survive.

10
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,830
Life at extreme altitude

11
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:01,032
has shaped some of the
toughest animals on the planet.

12
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:26,438
The sunbaked mountains
of the Arabian Peninsula.

13
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,679
They may only be a fraction
of the height of the Himalayas,

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,600
but they are still so dizzyingly steep

15
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:43,082
that in many places it's almost
impossible to get a foothold.

16
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:55,804
Yet Nubian ibex have made this their home.

17
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,927
The ibex choose the steepest
cliffs to raise their young,

18
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:15,449
in safety, beyond the reach of predators.

19
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,732
But living in this
sanctuary comes with a cost.

20
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,012
These nursery slopes are so steep,

21
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:39,974
there is almost no standing water up here.

22
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:52,497
So to drink, an ibex family
must descend into the valley...

23
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,818
...1,000 feet below.

24
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,019
The mothers pick out the safest way down.

25
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:08,299
With soft cloven hooves that grip
better than any climbing shoe,

26
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,181
they are the most
accomplished mountaineers.

27
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:26,824
But the newborn kids are still
having to find their feet.

28
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,946
This is their first descent.

29
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,068
One mistake could make it their last.

30
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:03,993
Following the adults, the
kids finally reach the valley.

31
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:11,674
But once on level ground,
they're vulnerable.

32
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,877
Red foxes lie in wait.

33
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,399
At the first sign of danger,

34
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,201
the young ibex instinctively
run back to steeper ground.

35
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:59,605
But heading for this particular
rocky outcrop could be a mistake.

36
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,326
It's a 30-foot drop.

37
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,286
The fox has them trapped...

38
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:09,807
or so it seems.

39
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:31,172
This is what ibex were born to do.

40
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:51,216
Scattering makes it hard
for the fox to pick a target.

41
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,099
And it certainly can't follow them up here.

42
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,221
All it can do is wait
for one to slip and fall.

43
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,905
But these youngsters are fast learners,

44
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:40,307
and they're now almost as
sure-footed as their parents.

45
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:18,075
The fox will have to
find its meal elsewhere.

46
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:26,917
It's just not been a good day.

47
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:38,720
Now, at last, the young ibex can drink.

48
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,682
But they'll soon need to return
to the safety of the sheer cliffs.

49
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:55,723
Mastering precipitous
terrain is always challenging,

50
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:59,765
but there are more fundamental
problems for life in the mountains.

51
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,929
The Alps. Europe's highest peaks.

52
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,890
It's winter, and food is desperately short.

53
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:40,933
A golden eagle has to
spend every daylight hour

54
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:45,815
scanning the slopes for
something, somewhere, to eat.

55
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:59,297
Her seven-foot wingspan allows
her to glide effortlessly

56
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,299
for 100 miles in a single day.

57
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:16,142
Her extraordinary eyes enable her
to spot prey from two miles away.

58
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:28,864
But she is not the only
one who's looking for food.

59
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:33,825
When she spots a chance,
she must move fast.

60
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:41,826
She can dive at 200 miles an hour.

61
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,828
Only a peregrine is faster.

62
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:21,996
During winter, even eagles
rely almost entirely on carrion.

63
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:27,277
It's a dead fox, and it
could sustain her for days.

64
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,798
Other scavengers must defer.

65
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,600
The hungry crows soon regain their courage.

66
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,641
They'll try any trick to steal a morsel.

67
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:54,443
And they are annoyingly persistent.

68
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:19,609
But this mob are the least of her worries.

69
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:30,051
A bigger eagle takes control.

70
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:37,933
But this kill is too important to give up.

71
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,894
So she must fight.

72
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:00,018
For the moment, she's won the carcass back.

73
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:05,099
But a kill like this will attract
every eagle for miles around.

74
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,226
As ever, the strongest
wins the lion's share.

75
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:42,186
Unable to defend the carcass any longer,

76
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:45,068
the first eagle must
now continue its search.

77
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,789
It may be many days before she feeds again.

78
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,509
Only the most competitive

79
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,311
will survive the perils
of the mountain winter.

80
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,197
An avalanche.

81
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:32,117
100,000 tonnes of snow

82
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,798
travelling at 80 miles an hour,

83
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,119
capable of smashing everything in its path.

84
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:18,487
The mountains of North America

85
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:22,289
are hit by thousands of
avalanches every year.

86
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:38,812
Yet one animal spends the whole winter

87
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:43,134
slumbering within the snow on
these avalanche-prone slopes.

88
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:56,537
And when spring comes, they emerge.

89
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,659
All across these mountains,

90
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,780
grizzly bears make their winter dens

91
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:18,462
10,000 feet up in the deep
snow of leeward slopes.

92
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,822
And while they were half-asleep
in the depths of winter,

93
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,383
their young were born.

94
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:34,025
Now these cubs are taking their
first steps into the outside world.

95
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,710
This mother is leading her three youngsters

96
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:03,591
to a place where they can find food.

97
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:12,193
They need to descend
as quickly as possible.

98
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,553
The debris from an avalanche

99
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:20,635
is clear evidence that this slope
is still dangerously unstable.

100
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,399
This is not a place to dawdle.

101
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,000
And they have another
reason to keep moving.

102
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:49,962
After five months in the den,
these bears are very hungry.

103
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:58,683
Bears that have hibernated
throughout these peaks

104
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:02,925
now all descend to the valleys,
where spring comes earliest.

105
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:15,127
In the Rockies, seasonal
change is swift and dramatic.

106
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,211
In just a few days, the slopes
turn from white to green.

107
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:57,496
Meadows that only a few weeks
ago were buried beneath the snow

108
00:18:57,497 --> 00:18:59,657
are now full of life.

109
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:21,902
But in these mountains, the
good times will not last long.

110
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:26,103
So the bears must feed as fast as they can.

111
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:31,983
During the summer months,

112
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:36,224
an adult can put on 180
kilos gorging on plants

113
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:38,625
and, if they can catch them...

114
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,666
...a marmot or two.

115
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:49,868
But just now, the bears have
something else on their minds.

116
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:55,348
It's becoming warmer,

117
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:58,590
and the bears are keen to
shed their thick winter coats.

118
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,992
Mothers show the cubs
what to do about this.

119
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,474
They'll soon catch on.

120
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:23,636
Some trees, it seems, are
particularly suitable for rubbing.

121
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:29,557
Bears have their favourites and will
travel long distances to visit them.

122
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,438
Some itches just have to be scratched.

123
00:20:56,683 --> 00:21:00,564
There are now around 30
bears in this one valley.

124
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:12,046
As they rub, each leaves an
individual and recognisable scent.

125
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:20,367
So the tree soon carries
a list of who's around,

126
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:23,049
which might help
individuals to avoid a fight.

127
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,249
To best spread their scent,

128
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,130
they really have to put their back into it.

129
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,979
But summer is short.

130
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,020
Itches satisfactorily scratched,

131
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,101
it's time to eat.

132
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:24,021
In a couple of months,

133
00:22:24,022 --> 00:22:27,062
they will have to return
to their dens to hibernate,

134
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,863
so now they must put on
as much weight as they can.

135
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:41,466
Winter in the mountains
returns fast and hits hard.

136
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:01,229
Temperatures in the Rockies
will drop to -54 degrees,

137
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,830
so cold that moisture in the air

138
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:08,392
freezes into tiny crystals
called diamond dust.

139
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:35,478
This bobcat is one of the few
hunters to remain active in winter.

140
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,839
Most of his prey is now
hidden beneath the snow

141
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,480
that covers his entire territory.

142
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:55,962
He hunts by listening for the
faintest sound of movement.

143
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:59,922
And to prevent crunching footsteps
from revealing his presence,

144
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:03,084
he uses boulders as stepping stones.

145
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:23,849
A mouse.

146
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,249
But one is not enough.

147
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:47,653
The deeper the snow, the
harder it is to detect prey,

148
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,615
and the rewards for the
effort can be disappointing.

149
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:55,056
To say the least.

150
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:02,736
By midwinter, the snow is so deep

151
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:05,897
that bobcats are forced
to leave their territories

152
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:08,298
to try and find easier hunting.

153
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,264
And this bobcat may be in luck.

154
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,545
For this particular valley is blessed.

155
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:47,187
A river here never freezes.

156
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:53,147
It's fed by a volcanic hot spring

157
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:54,788
that heats these waters

158
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:58,029
to 50 degrees warmer
than the surrounding air.

159
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:07,231
Hungry animals of all
kinds come here to feed.

160
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,916
Throughout the winter,

161
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,396
the river is full of food

162
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:37,118
for those who know how to catch it.

163
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:51,561
Here, even the coyotes
have become fishermen.

164
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:59,843
But hunting is hard for a cat that's
not used to getting its feet wet.

165
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:11,726
So he must choose his target with care.

166
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,769
Goldeneye ducks.

167
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,730
But can he get close enough to pounce?

168
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:04,257
Perhaps he'll have more
luck on the other side.

169
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:25,181
Here, steam from the river
warms the surrounding trees,

170
00:28:25,182 --> 00:28:28,903
so up in the branches, there could be prey.

171
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:36,504
If only he could get to it.

172
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,825
It's 20 feet up.

173
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,709
At last... a squirrel.

174
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,030
Not much, but enough to keep him going.

175
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:12,311
To survive a winter in these
mountains takes tenacity,

176
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,393
and bobcats have that in abundance.

177
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,877
Snow on the equator.

178
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,157
Unlike the Rockies, in these mountains

179
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:41,119
there are no marked seasons.

180
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,882
This is Africa's Mount Kenya.

181
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,722
It's 17,000 feet high,

182
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:02,522
which makes its summit
some 30 degrees colder

183
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:04,964
than the surrounding savanna.

184
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:15,525
Giant heathers, lobelias and
groundsel grow on its upper slopes.

185
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:17,927
They all thrive in the tropical sun.

186
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,728
After all, every day is summer.

187
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:30,530
But once the sun sets, every night
becomes as bitterly cold as winter.

188
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:42,691
The temperature drops to
five degrees below freezing,

189
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:46,612
turning the mountainside
into a garden of ice.

190
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,137
Everything freezes,

191
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:14,059
but the cabbage groundsels have
a way of protecting themselves.

192
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:24,661
They close up their leathery
leaves to form an insulating blanket

193
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:27,582
that shields their vulnerable central bud.

194
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,065
Night comes to an end...

195
00:31:45,106 --> 00:31:46,986
...and the sunshine returns.

196
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:54,667
The groundsels spread their leaves wide

197
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,829
to bask in the sunshine once again.

198
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,193
Dawn in the High Andes.

199
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,835
Here too, the rising
sun brings rapid relief

200
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:34,157
to animals living amongst
these volcanic peaks.

201
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:40,877
Mountain viscacha are up early

202
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:44,879
to claim the best places to
catch the sun's first rays.

203
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:10,285
For others up here, the
sunrise is even more welcome.

204
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:15,405
At over 14,000 feet,

205
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:18,767
this is the highest
flamingo colony in the world.

206
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:26,048
At night, it gets so cold that
even this salty water freezes over.

207
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:31,369
And now the flamingos
are trapped in the ice.

208
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,811
Eventually, the sun thins the ice,

209
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,612
but it's still a struggle for
the flamingos to break free.

210
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,618
Walking on thin ice is always risky.

211
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,421
And it's hard to retain one's dignity...

212
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,101
...especially when you're wearing stilts.

213
00:34:38,624 --> 00:34:40,504
At these altitudes,

214
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:45,706
the sun's power can quickly
turn from salvation to threat.

215
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:54,227
The atmosphere is so thin,

216
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:57,749
there is very little protection
from ultraviolet radiation.

217
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:03,190
By mid-morning, it's risky
to linger out in the open.

218
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,631
The viscacha are forced
to head for the shade.

219
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:17,873
Out on the lake, there is nowhere to hide.

220
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:26,394
The white crust of the soda lake

221
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:28,434
reflects the sun's glare

222
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:31,596
and increases the impact
of its ultraviolet rays.

223
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:41,038
By midday, uncovered human
skin will burn in four minutes.

224
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,720
But this doesn't seem
to bother the flamingos.

225
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,041
In fact, they are on parade.

226
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:24,887
During the breeding season,

227
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:28,448
the flamingos perform these
peculiar courtship dances

228
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:31,129
even through the hottest time of the day.

229
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:40,971
They are so eager, they
don't even pause to feed.

230
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:02,055
The rules are something of a mystery

231
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:04,095
but, after a month of dancing,

232
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,416
all the birds will have paired off

233
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,617
and will be getting ready to mate.

234
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:19,339
Up here, there are few other
creatures to bother the flamingos,

235
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,299
but then, few other creatures

236
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,901
could even tolerate these conditions.

237
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:30,501
So for animals that have the endurance,

238
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:33,183
mountains can be sanctuaries.

239
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,705
But rocky peaks which to us, perhaps,

240
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:51,146
seem a symbol of permanence,

241
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:53,387
are more fragile than they appear.

242
00:37:57,748 --> 00:37:59,788
Today in the Alps,

243
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:04,190
human encroachment is changing
even the highest summits.

244
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:19,072
In the Rockies,

245
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:22,193
rising temperatures are
shortening winter hibernation

246
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:25,154
and stifling the growth
of valuable food plants.

247
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:34,715
And in the Andes, some glaciers

248
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:38,557
have shrunk by 50% in just 30 years.

249
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,960
Even the Himalayas are now vulnerable.

250
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,800
With most of the world's tallest peaks

251
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,321
and covering a third of
a million square miles,

252
00:39:00,322 --> 00:39:02,803
this is the greatest mountain range of all.

253
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:12,004
And here, temperatures are now rising

254
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:14,045
faster than the global average.

255
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:20,165
As the snow line retreats further
and further up these peaks,

256
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,766
there is less and less space for wildlife,

257
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,527
and that is a challenge

258
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:29,969
for one of the most majestic
of all mountain creatures.

259
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,173
The snow leopard.

260
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:59,374
Seldom seen, the detail of their
lives has long been a mystery,

261
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:04,495
but now, at last, helped by the
latest remote-camera technology,

262
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:07,457
we are getting closer
to them than ever before.

263
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:16,939
They are very rare... only about
four of them in 40 square miles.

264
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:22,020
There is simply not enough
prey to sustain more.

265
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:30,421
They live solitary lives.

266
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:33,902
Nonetheless, they are well aware
of the presence and the movements of

267
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:38,984
their neighbours, because they leave
messages in a few special places.

268
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,865
They rub particular
rocks with their cheeks...

269
00:40:48,586 --> 00:40:51,067
...and then spray them with urine.

270
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:57,188
The two perfumes create a unique signature.

271
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:06,589
Any other leopard can know which
of its neighbours passed this way,

272
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,071
without ever making direct contact.

273
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:16,671
But there are times when snow
leopards must come together,

274
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:19,073
and the event is often violent.

275
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,276
An adult female and her daughter.

276
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:48,998
She has devoted the last
two years to raising her cub

277
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:51,200
and very soon, it will be weaned.

278
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:58,321
For now, the cub is still
entirely dependent on its mother.

279
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:08,044
But staying together as long
as this could cause problems.

280
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,284
The female is now in heat again,

281
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:18,046
and any male that smells
her signature will know that.

282
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:32,049
From this moment on, her
cub's life is at risk.

283
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,690
Males kill cubs that are not their own.

284
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:47,212
But the mother is now driven by
an urge that she cannot control.

285
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:54,893
She lets the males know
exactly where she is.

286
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:11,296
From up here, she can be
heard for miles around.

287
00:43:30,422 --> 00:43:34,143
A young male emerges from the
wilderness, eager to find her.

288
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:40,623
Snow leopards meet so infrequently

289
00:43:40,624 --> 00:43:43,505
that there is uncertainty and tension.

290
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,667
And it's about to get worse.

291
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:05,029
Another, bigger male has arrived.

292
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:17,671
The mother and cub are
trapped between the rivals.

293
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:24,873
The cub is now in danger.

294
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:26,514
Mother must act fast.

295
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,954
To divert the males'
attention from her cub,

296
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,916
she rolls over submissively.

297
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:49,839
With the males fixed on the female,
the cub has a chance to escape.

298
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:59,920
The males close in on the
mother from both sides,

299
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:01,802
keen to claim her for their own.

300
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:08,283
A fight is inevitable.

301
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:32,649
The female moves to
escape and protect her cub.

302
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:36,009
But the big male follows her.

303
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:50,973
He will not let her leave
until he has mated with her.

304
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:13,498
With the males gone, the female
is at last reunited with her cub.

305
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:18,979
But she has been injured.

306
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:33,102
The cub, however, is
alive, thanks to its mother.

307
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:46,505
Until her injury heals,
she won't be able to hunt.

308
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:52,946
Mountain animals survive on
the very edge of existence.

309
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,588
Mother and cub were not seen again.

310
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,870
Until over a month later, high on a ridge,

311
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,751
a remote camera was triggered.

312
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:19,991
The female cat.

313
00:47:19,992 --> 00:47:23,313
She's no longer limping,
but she's now alone.

314
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:31,954
Then, an hour after the female has left,

315
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:34,236
the camera is triggered again.

316
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:42,636
It's her cub,

317
00:47:42,637 --> 00:47:47,078
taking her first steps towards
adulthood and independence.

318
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,439
She is unlikely to see her mother again.

319
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,639
But every now and then,
they will be reunited

320
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,841
through the messages they
leave on the marking rocks.

321
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:06,682
Her mother has succeeded in raising her,

322
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,802
but life ahead will be challenging,

323
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,644
and she will spend nearly all of it alone.

324
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:18,844
Only the toughest can survive

325
00:48:18,845 --> 00:48:22,846
among the savage beauty of
the world's highest mountains.

326
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,729
Revealing a new perspective

327
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,370
on the lives of golden
eagles in the mountains

328
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:44,611
would take two very different approaches.

329
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:55,452
A traditional wildlife crew
set out to film wild eagles

330
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:58,374
closer than ever before.

331
00:49:02,015 --> 00:49:05,535
Whilst an aerial team aimed
to capture the hunting flights

332
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,736
of eagles high in the mountains.

333
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:18,217
The helicopter crew soon
have success in filming

334
00:49:18,218 --> 00:49:20,058
wild eagles high over the Alps,

335
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:23,900
but there was one part of the
story even they couldn't follow.

336
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:31,581
Golden eagles can stoop
at 200 miles an hour.

337
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:37,902
To capture an eagle's-eye
view of such a dramatic flight

338
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:40,743
would take a more extreme approach.

339
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:51,745
I'm Aaron Durogati and I'm a
professional paraglider pilot.

340
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:56,866
Aaron believes that to fly like a
bird, he must think like one, too.

341
00:49:56,867 --> 00:50:00,147
It's a very special
feeling to fly with eagles

342
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:02,947
because I'm really looking
how they are thermalling

343
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:04,628
and where they go to soar.

344
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:07,148
This helps me to become a better pilot,

345
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:09,829
and I try to take
inspiration from the nature.

346
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:13,070
Wearing a specially designed helmet camera,

347
00:50:13,071 --> 00:50:16,871
Aaron's aim is to film the
perspective of a diving eagle.

348
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,672
But before he can jump off a mountain,

349
00:50:23,673 --> 00:50:25,473
first he needs to climb it.

350
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:33,114
It's a tough 3,000m ascent for
Aaron and his wingman, Armin,

351
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:36,796
as director Emma Brennand waits
for news in the valley below.

352
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:44,438
The ascent is slowed by a
series of dangerous crevasses.

353
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:52,479
After a tricky climb, they
finally reach their launch site.

354
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,680
But the weather up here is unpredictable

355
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,841
and a change in wind direction
makes it impossible to take off.

356
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:10,642
Aaron and Armin are forced to
overnight in the summit shelter,

357
00:51:10,643 --> 00:51:15,563
and with the cold knocking out
their comms, Emma is worrying.

358
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:18,124
They're well-trained mountain guides,

359
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,925
but it doesn't make it
any easier to know that.

360
00:51:20,926 --> 00:51:24,845
I think it's going to be a fairly
restless night for me as well.

361
00:51:24,846 --> 00:51:27,967
Whilst the paragliders prepare
for a night on the mountain...

362
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:32,607
...cameraman Barrie
Britton is setting out early

363
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:36,729
on a more cautious quest to film
wild golden eagles from a hide.

364
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,290
I've got to get everything
set while it's still dark

365
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:48,771
and the eagles can't see what we're up to.

366
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,412
Or if they saw any movement around
the hide, then they'd fly away

367
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,692
and probably wouldn't
come back for a few days.

368
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:57,814
They're notoriously
difficult birds to film.

369
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:02,535
Even hide work is not
entirely without risks.

370
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:08,455
It's -20 outside. So this is a
crucial part of the operation,

371
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:11,616
making sure the fire works
so we don't freeze to death.

372
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:14,176
Aah! Well, that's all
the hairs gone on my hand!

373
00:52:14,177 --> 00:52:16,057
Oh, well!

374
00:52:16,058 --> 00:52:19,097
And we just have to be really quiet now

375
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:22,698
and hope the eagles come in
when first light comes up.

376
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:25,499
Eight sedentary hours later,

377
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,941
Barry's only reward is a dead leg.

378
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:33,101
We haven't done a single shot today.

379
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:36,182
Nothing has come.

380
00:52:37,743 --> 00:52:39,463
Anyway, that's the way it goes.

381
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,263
After a long night on top of the mountain,

382
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:45,703
the weather is only getting worse.

383
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,024
The team need to get down,
but visibility's so poor

384
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:52,945
that descending on foot past
the crevasses is too risky.

385
00:52:52,946 --> 00:52:57,707
Aaron decides it's safer to
fly, but it'll be a bumpy ride.

386
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:18,632
Thick cloud makes it hard to avoid
the mountains, let alone film them.

387
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:26,312
Thankfully, they make it down in
one piece, much to Emma's relief.

388
00:53:26,313 --> 00:53:28,753
We are very, very glad to see you both.

389
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:30,234
Yeah, it's a bit hard up there.

390
00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:35,515
The team spend the next two
weeks chasing weather windows...

391
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:39,676
...until at last, a clear flight.

392
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,999
Trying to mimic a diving eagle,

393
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,079
the flying looks spectacular,

394
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,561
but the helmet-cam shots are less so.

395
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,201
To stay safe at these speeds,

396
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:09,482
Aaron must turn his head
regularly to check his glider,

397
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:11,883
and that is making the shots unusable.

398
00:54:15,764 --> 00:54:19,045
The team must quickly
come up with a new plan.

399
00:54:24,286 --> 00:54:26,806
Back in the hide, all has been quiet

400
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:30,287
until Barrie spots an eagle
scavenging on a fox carcass.

401
00:54:38,249 --> 00:54:41,090
Barrie repositions his hide to keep watch.

402
00:54:48,731 --> 00:54:50,132
Good stuff!

403
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:53,612
After 100 hours in the hide,

404
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:56,173
finally, his luck changes.

405
00:54:58,654 --> 00:55:01,453
That's one terrifying bird there.

406
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:04,975
For me, it's fantastic
just to see them so close.

407
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,576
It's just beautiful.

408
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:14,536
With Barrie's success, it's now
down to the paragliding team.

409
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:18,058
They've come to the Mont
Blanc range with a new plan.

410
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:24,298
Aaron's decided that the best way
to keep safe and get stable shots

411
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:26,700
is to fly tandem with a cameraman.

412
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,940
We've got to try and
mimic how an eagle flies,

413
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:35,661
which is pretty hard because they're
basically like the top bird of prey.

414
00:55:35,662 --> 00:55:37,581
John is nervous.

415
00:55:37,582 --> 00:55:39,503
It's his first-ever flight.

416
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,824
Three, two, one, go.

417
00:55:45,184 --> 00:55:47,264
Eee... ahh!

418
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,585
Yes! Woohoo!

419
00:55:54,426 --> 00:55:57,906
- How is it?
- Ah, man, that was a shock.

420
00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:01,187
Overcoming his initial
fears, John begins filming.

421
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:05,588
If you can go right of
this, that'd be cool.

422
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:09,908
The tandem wing allows
John to get the shots

423
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:12,230
that Aaron was unable to get flying solo.

424
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,350
Awesome, Aaron, very good.

425
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,431
But it's not all plain sailing.

426
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,832
The feeling of discomfort only gets worse

427
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:28,794
as Aaron begins the eagle dive.

428
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,796
I feel sick!

429
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:42,556
Oh, man!

430
00:56:42,557 --> 00:56:44,836
Flying low and fast like an eagle

431
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:46,677
leaves little room for error.

432
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,760
- A little bit too much, do you think?
- Yeah!

433
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:05,162
- Sorry, what did you call it, an unplanned landing?
- Yeah!

434
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:10,562
They might not be as
majestic as a golden eagle,

435
00:57:10,563 --> 00:57:13,722
but they do capture a unique perspective

436
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:17,244
that conveys an eagle's
life as never before.

437
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,925
Next time...

438
00:57:23,926 --> 00:57:26,046
we explore the world's jungles.

439
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:32,528
Places of surprise and
invention unrivalled on Earth...

440
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:37,849
...where the battle for
survival is at its most intense.
