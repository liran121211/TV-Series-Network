1
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:40,283
Imagine a world where temperatures
rise to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

2
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:49,163
Where there's no escape
from sun, wind and dust.

3
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:59,603
Imagine a world with
almost no food or water.

4
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:10,542
These are the conditions in

5
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:13,843
one third of the lands of our planet.

6
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:22,323
To live here demands the most
extraordinary survival strategies.

7
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:49,102
This is the oldest desert in the world.

8
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:52,483
The Namib in south-west Africa.

9
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:57,083
It's been dry for 55 million years.

10
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:06,203
Life here for a hunter
is as hard as it gets.

11
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:18,862
A pride of lions.

12
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:23,342
One of the very few that endures
this desert's scorching temperatures

13
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,323
and lack of water.

14
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:46,163
Hunting here presents special problems.

15
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:57,363
A herd of oryx, the only
prey within 20 miles.

16
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:04,862
Out here, there is no cover for an ambush.

17
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:08,123
It'll have to be a straight chase.

18
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,622
They have failed

19
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:51,323
and each failed hunt brings
the lions closer to starvation.

20
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,902
To find enough to eat,

21
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:10,243
the pride continually searches
an area the size of Switzerland.

22
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:26,083
Three days and 100 miles
later, and still no kill.

23
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,102
These are desperate times.

24
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:36,963
A dry riverbed on the
edge of their territory.

25
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:43,342
The only animals here are giraffe,

26
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:48,523
but these one-tonne giants could
kill a lion with a single kick.

27
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:04,803
Lions seldom tackle such formidable prey...

28
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:12,763
...but this pride can't go
on much longer without food.

29
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:44,203
The whole pride must work together
as a team if they're to succeed.

30
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:14,902
Two lionesses lead the chase.

31
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:18,483
Others race to cut off
possible escape routes.

32
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:40,083
The giraffe has the speed and
stamina to outrun the pride...

33
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:44,043
...but it's being chased into a trap.

34
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:49,243
Up ahead, the lead female waits.

35
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:02,043
It's now up to her.

36
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:23,523
Most lion hunts end in failure.

37
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:30,243
But no lions fail more often than
those that live in the desert.

38
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,763
Once again, the pride
must continue their search.

39
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:06,123
It does, sometimes, rain in the desert.

40
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:14,723
Here, in the American West, storms
can strike with devastating force.

41
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:21,742
After ten months of drought,

42
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:26,803
millions of tonnes of water are
dumped on the land in under an hour.

43
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,942
Over millions of years,

44
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:21,302
sand and gravel carried
by the rampaging floods

45
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,563
have carved channels
through the solid rock.

46
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:33,403
Slot canyons, 150 feet deep.

47
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:08,342
In some places, these canyons have widened

48
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:12,302
until the land between them
is sculpted into tablelands

49
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,622
and isolated pinnacles,

50
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:18,883
some of the most dramatic
landscapes on the planet.

51
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:37,563
The rain may be long gone...

52
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,203
...but there is water here...

53
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:47,043
...locked away within the tissues
of specialist desert plants.

54
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:52,883
Cacti are unique to American deserts.

55
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,662
They all hoard water,

56
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:59,182
storing it in swollen stems

57
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,963
and protecting it behind
a barricade of spines.

58
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:10,683
They're so successful that
they dominate these deserts.

59
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,382
But this forest of spikes can cause

60
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,443
problems for the animals that live here.

61
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,883
A Harrisxxx hawk.

62
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,963
It has developed special techniques
for hunting amongst the cacti.

63
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:43,222
Ground squirrels.

64
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,603
Prey.

65
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,483
At the first sign of danger they
bolt for the safety of the thorns.

66
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,963
But the hawks have a
tactic to flush them out.

67
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:16,283
These are the only birds
of prey that hunt in packs.

68
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:23,083
Flying in formation, they try to
drive their quarry into the open.

69
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:36,723
But this squirrel is staying put.

70
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,683
So now the hawks continue the hunt...

71
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,123
...on foot.

72
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:58,803
They're closing in from all sides.

73
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:23,803
Soon, all escape routes are cut off.

74
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,803
The squirrel is trapped.

75
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:43,862
The spines that cover almost
every plant in this desert

76
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:47,763
can provide protection and
shelter for many animals.

77
00:13:55,463 --> 00:14:00,763
So, why should these
spikes be hung with corpses?

78
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:09,262
What kind of creature could be responsible

79
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:12,043
for creating such a gruesome scene?

80
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:25,203
There's a mysterious killer
at work in this desert.

81
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,363
It's a butcherbird.

82
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:41,342
This little songbird uses the
spines as a butcher uses his hook...

83
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:44,843
to hold its prey as it dismembers it.

84
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:59,483
And with chicks to feed, he
also uses the spines as a larder.

85
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:07,523
He's been stocking it for weeks.

86
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:14,222
Hanging his prey out of the
reach of scavengers on the ground

87
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:18,123
ensures that his newly hatched
young will never go hungry.

88
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:24,603
An ingenious solution to making
the good times last in the desert...

89
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,542
...if a little macabre.

90
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,742
Some deserts are so arid,

91
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:44,283
they appear totally
devoid of all vegetation.

92
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:52,163
Yet even these landscapes can be
transformed in a matter of days.

93
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:06,982
The deserts of Peru are
amongst the driest in the world,

94
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:10,942
but just add a little water and
plants that have lain dormant

95
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,803
for months will burst into life.

96
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:33,342
And when a desert suddenly turns green,

97
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:38,963
even the most seemingly desolate
can become a land of opportunity.

98
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,982
No creature exploits the
greening of a desert more quickly

99
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,603
or more dramatically than a locust.

100
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,822
Madagascar's arid south-west

101
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,923
has received its highest rainfall in years.

102
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,622
Now, an army is on the march,

103
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,803
attracted by the smell
of newly sprouting grass.

104
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:38,182
Locusts are normally solitary creatures,

105
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,862
but when food becomes suddenly
plentiful they come together

106
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:46,483
into an unstoppable force that
devours everything in its path.

107
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:09,443
But this devastation is
about to get a lot worse.

108
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:25,902
The locusts now transform
into winged adults,

109
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,982
and with conditions as good as this,

110
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,443
they do so three times faster than normal.

111
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:36,942
Now they are at their most voracious...

112
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:40,203
and with wings, they can take to the skies.

113
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:09,102
Once airborne, the locusts
can travel over 60 miles a day

114
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:11,803
in their search for new feeding grounds.

115
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,683
A super swarm of this scale may
only appear once in a decade.

116
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:35,142
This one extends over 200 square miles

117
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:38,363
and contains several billion individuals.

118
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:44,283
Between them, they will devour
40,000 tonnes of food in a day.

119
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:23,822
Nothing can strip a land of
its vegetation with such speed

120
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,403
and thoroughness as a plague of locusts.

121
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:35,022
When the food eventually runs
out, the whole army will die...

122
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,923
but not before it's devastated the land.

123
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:55,182
With no plants to bind them,

124
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:59,203
thin soils soon turn to dust and blow away.

125
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:10,643
Now, these barren lands are left
to the mercy of the elements.

126
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:32,262
Scorched by the sun and
scoured by windblown sand,

127
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:37,363
desert rock is shaped into
strange, otherworldly landscapes.

128
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:47,702
These rocky deserts may
have a beguiling beauty,

129
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:51,763
but when they become this barren,
very little life can endure.

130
00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:02,582
For many animals, the only way
to survive the most hostile times

131
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,603
is to keep moving.

132
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:16,083
In the Kalahari, brief rains
have given way to the dry season.

133
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:20,483
Food and water are becoming
increasingly scarce.

134
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:24,803
For these zebra, it's time to leave.

135
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:38,862
They're setting off on

136
00:22:38,863 --> 00:22:43,542
the longest overland migration
made by any mammal in Africa,

137
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:47,163
marching towards the
scent of distant rains.

138
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,062
As drought intensifies,

139
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:56,462
desert-living elephants must
also undertake long journeys

140
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:58,763
in search of water.

141
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:21,982
The older females can remember where,

142
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,982
even in times of extreme
drought, there may still be water

143
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:30,862
and sometimes lead the herd to a
water hole they may not have visited

144
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:32,483
for decades.

145
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:06,043
These zebra are almost at
the end of their journey.

146
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,123
This is what they've been heading for...

147
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,683
...a rare water hole.

148
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:34,462
In deserts, most water
holes are short lived.

149
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:35,942
They appear after rains,

150
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:39,003
but then vanish almost
as quickly as they came.

151
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,403
Animals have come here
from many miles around.

152
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:58,723
Yet this can be a dangerous
place in which to linger.

153
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,902
60 miles away, in the heart of the desert,

154
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:12,243
sandgrouse chicks are hatching.

155
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,523
It's safer for them to be here.

156
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:23,803
But being so distant
from water is a gamble.

157
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,902
With only their mother to
shield them from the sun,

158
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,883
if they get nothing to drink,
they will be dead within hours.

159
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,683
Their only hope is their father.

160
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:52,022
Every morning he makes
the 120-mile round trip

161
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:54,563
to get water for the family.

162
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,342
Grouse from all over the
desert visit this oasis,

163
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:04,582
arriving together in large flocks,

164
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,443
and that is important.

165
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,003
There's safety in numbers.

166
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:29,182
The male snatches a drink,

167
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:33,163
but he also needs to
collect water for his chicks.

168
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:36,182
Using specially adapted breast feathers,

169
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:39,123
he can soak up water like a sponge.

170
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:43,283
But it takes time, and he is in danger.

171
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:52,683
Goshawk.

172
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,243
Sandgrouse here are their main prey.

173
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:21,662
Again and again, the male
sandgrouse risk their lives

174
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:24,443
in order to collect water for their chicks.

175
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:49,163
This is why sandgrouse nest
so far from water holes.

176
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:16,403
At last, he's soaked up as much as he can.

177
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:20,822
Carrying a quarter of
his body weight in water,

178
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:24,283
he can now set off on
the long journey home.

179
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:53,803
He's back, and just in time.

180
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:58,083
He can give the chicks
their first ever drink.

181
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:09,502
But he will have to undertake
this perilous journey every day

182
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:13,862
for the next two months until his
chicks can finally make the flight

183
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:16,363
to the water hole for themselves.

184
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:33,643
It's July in the deserts of Nevada
in the western United States.

185
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:37,363
The hottest time of the year.

186
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:53,662
Bands of wild horses, mustang,

187
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:58,083
are converging on one of the last
remaining water holes for miles.

188
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:06,942
Now, water not only offers
them the chance to drink,

189
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:09,363
it can also bring power.

190
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:16,022
If a stallion can control access to water,

191
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:19,163
he will have secured mating
rights to the entire herd.

192
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:23,702
So stallions try to dominate these pools,

193
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:26,483
fighting off rivals who venture too close.

194
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:40,843
A stranger.

195
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,862
He's travelled ten miles to be here

196
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:48,243
because the pools where he's
come from have already dried up.

197
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:54,643
With him come his females.

198
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:59,582
If he can't provide them with
water, they will leave him

199
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:04,083
for the white stallion who
already dominates this pool.

200
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,723
So, he will have to fight.

201
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:18,643
There is everything to lose.

202
00:32:20,263 --> 00:32:22,462
A broken leg or a shattered jaw

203
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:25,563
would mean a slow and painful death.

204
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:49,123
A missed kick, and it's all over.

205
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:55,662
The new arrival has won...

206
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:59,902
and his prize is more than
just the chance to drink.

207
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:03,102
He has provided for his
herd, and in the process,

208
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:05,763
stolen his rival's females.

209
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:10,203
The white stallion's rule is over.

210
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:22,102
Desert life is not only shaped
by the scarcity of water,

211
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:27,003
but also by the relentless
power of the sun.

212
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:35,582
The highest temperatures on Earth

213
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,523
have all been recorded in its deserts.

214
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:52,742
Changes in the climate
mean temperatures here

215
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:55,862
are rising more than
the global average and,

216
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:59,443
as deserts heat up,
they are also expanding.

217
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:06,342
Every year, a further 50,000
square miles of grass and farmland

218
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:10,403
are turning into barren
stretches of dust and rock.

219
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:21,222
In the heat of the day, surface
temperatures can reach 160 degrees,

220
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:24,123
far too hot to handle for most.

221
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:30,003
But not for this shovel-snouted lizard.

222
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:37,003
Raising its feet off the ground in turn...

223
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:42,803
...enables each to briefly cool.

224
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:52,022
But even this dancing desert specialist

225
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,043
can't stand the heat for long.

226
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:05,123
One option is to find shade.

227
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:14,702
Dune grass, the only vegetation
here, provides virtually none,

228
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:17,622
but just an inch beneath
the surface of the sand,

229
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:20,483
it is several degrees cooler.

230
00:35:27,663 --> 00:35:32,843
Avoiding the extreme heat
imposes a rhythm on desert life.

231
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:39,323
And many animals here choose
the simplest option of all...

232
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:43,582
...staying hidden all day,

233
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,843
and only venturing out
in the cool of the night.

234
00:35:55,623 --> 00:36:00,763
As darkness falls, animals
appear from seemingly nowhere.

235
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:11,062
And, among them, inevitably,

236
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:12,563
are hunters.

237
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:30,822
One of the most voracious
nocturnal predators

238
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:34,483
is also one of the hardest to see.

239
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:41,403
This mysterious creature hardly ever
appears on the surface of the dunes.

240
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:52,163
But there are signs on the
sand that can give it away.

241
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:09,342
It lives only here, where the
sand grains are so perfectly dry

242
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:12,963
and polished, that they
flow almost like water.

243
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,403
It's no bigger than a ping-pong ball.

244
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,683
A golden mole.

245
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:28,062
It's totally blind,

246
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:30,683
but there's nothing to
see underground anyway.

247
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:39,763
Instead, it has superb hearing.

248
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,862
Its entire head acts as an amplifier

249
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:49,182
that picks up vibrations through
the sand, so, to locate prey

250
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,662
on the surface of the
dune, it has, paradoxically,

251
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:55,603
to thrust its face into the dune.

252
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:06,022
Termites.

253
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:08,483
Not easy to catch when you're blind.

254
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:15,403
Far better to go into stealth mode.

255
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:21,443
Once below the sand, it can
detect the slightest movement...

256
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:27,883
...allowing it to strike
with pinpoint accuracy.

257
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:40,083
Well, most of the time.

258
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:55,643
They can travel two thirds of a mile
a night in search of its dinner...

259
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:02,523
...and right now, it has
just detected its main course.

260
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:08,123
Little wonder it's sometimes
called "the shark of the dunes".

261
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:21,062
Food can be so scarce in the
desert that, even at night,

262
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:24,923
animals can't afford to be
choosy about what they eat.

263
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,123
Israel's Negev desert.

264
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:47,203
Otonycteris, the desert
long-eared bat, is on the hunt.

265
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:55,502
Most bats catch flying insects
on the wing, but there are so few

266
00:39:55,503 --> 00:40:00,163
of these in the desert that this
bat must do things differently.

267
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:05,883
It has to hunt on the ground.

268
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:17,003
But what really sets it
apart is what it's hunting...

269
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,803
...a deathstalker scorpion.

270
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:32,603
The venom of this species is
potent enough to kill a human.

271
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:38,723
Tackling it seems madness for a
bat weighing just half an ounce.

272
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:48,102
In the pitch-black, both predator
and prey are effectively blind,

273
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,582
but the scorpion has one advantage...

274
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:55,403
he can sense the approach of the
bat through vibrations in the sand.

275
00:40:58,783 --> 00:41:03,163
Otonycteris must rely
entirely on its hearing.

276
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:07,403
If the scorpion doesn't move,
it won't know it's there.

277
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:23,483
The battle is on.

278
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:30,062
Armed with crushing pincers
and a sting loaded with venom,

279
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:33,003
this scorpion is a dangerous opponent.

280
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,443
A direct strike on the head.

281
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:52,443
Is it all over?

282
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,203
Not for this bat.

283
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:17,462
Otonycteris clearly has
some immunity to the venom,

284
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:21,603
but repeated stings must still
be extraordinarily painful.

285
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,502
And if the bat is not to go hungry,

286
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:35,523
it must catch another three
scorpions before sunrise.

287
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:06,622
Desert animals have developed
remarkable strategies

288
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,323
to make the most of the rare
opportunities that come their way.

289
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,062
Although some deserts may not
see rain for several years,

290
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:19,883
most will hold a little
water in one form or another.

291
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:24,163
The trick is simply
knowing how to reach it.

292
00:43:32,663 --> 00:43:38,203
Dawn in the dunes of the Namib,
and something magical is happening.

293
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:01,262
Moist air lying over the
neighbouring Atlantic is cooled

294
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:06,643
and blown inland, forming fog banks
that shroud the desert in mist.

295
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:17,942
This precious moisture lies
tantalisingly out of reach

296
00:44:17,943 --> 00:44:22,462
at the top of the dunes,
and it won't last long.

297
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:26,683
It'll be burnt off by the
sun just hours after it rises.

298
00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:45,022
Darkling beetles race
to the top of the dunes

299
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:47,763
to reach the fog before it vanishes.

300
00:44:56,863 --> 00:45:01,382
Some of the Namib's
dunes are 1,000 feet high,

301
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:02,963
the tallest in the world.

302
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:08,342
For a beetle no larger than a
thumbnail, this is the equivalent

303
00:45:08,343 --> 00:45:11,963
of us climbing a dune
twice the height of Everest.

304
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:20,243
But even more impressive
is what it does next.

305
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:28,342
Standing perfectly still,
facing into the wind,

306
00:45:28,343 --> 00:45:30,963
the beetle does a headstand.

307
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:37,083
Fog begins to condense on its body.

308
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:43,902
Microscopic bumps on its
wing cases direct the water

309
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:46,523
to grooves that channel
it towards the mouth.

310
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:54,222
Before returning down the slip face,

311
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:57,243
it will drink 40% of its body weight.

312
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:07,422
This little beetle has learned
how to conjure water out of the air

313
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:10,483
in one of the driest places on earth.

314
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:17,563
And it's not alone on the top of the dunes.

315
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:26,883
Web-footed geckos use a similar trick.

316
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:40,683
Surely, few animals go to
greater lengths to get a drink.

317
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:02,942
Unfortunately, Namaqua chameleons
know that on foggy mornings,

318
00:47:02,943 --> 00:47:08,003
the beetles coming down the dunes
are juicier than those going up.

319
00:47:19,263 --> 00:47:23,742
The diversity of life that thrives
in a world almost totally devoid

320
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:26,443
of water is truly remarkable.

321
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:33,022
Success in the desert depends
on an extraordinary variety of

322
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:37,323
survival strategies that have
evolved over millions of years.

323
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:42,163
But our planet is changing.

324
00:47:44,743 --> 00:47:48,822
The world's deserts are growing
bigger, hotter and drier,

325
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:52,003
and they're doing so
faster than ever before.

326
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:58,683
How life will cope here in
the future remains to be seen.

327
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:19,542
Finding animals in these vast empty
landscapes was a persistent problem

328
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:21,182
for the Deserts team.

329
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:24,382
But surely this wouldn't be the
case when they set out to film

330
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:27,883
one of the greatest concentrations
of wildlife on earth.

331
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:35,443
It can't be hard to find
a billion locusts, can it?

332
00:48:38,543 --> 00:48:40,102
OK.

333
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:42,582
With news that freak rains have triggered

334
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:46,222
a mass emergence of locusts
in a remote part of Madagascar,

335
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,363
the team sets off in pursuit.

336
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:58,262
We've got some young hopper
locusts just crossing the road

337
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:00,662
in front of us here. We've
just had to stop the cars.

338
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:03,502
Here they are, here, all on
the side of the road, look.

339
00:49:03,503 --> 00:49:05,502
It looks promising.

340
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:07,822
But though finding hoppers is easy,

341
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,382
filming them proves more of a challenge.

342
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:13,542
Can we rethink this? Because
it's not really working.

343
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:15,262
The locusts are really skippy.

344
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,902
Any kind of movement, they just
freak out, So we're now doing

345
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:20,902
our best locust-herding
techniques to try to get them to go

346
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:24,483
in front of the lens, which is
proving harder than anticipated.

347
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:37,363
This is my Monday morning
locust-herding jazz hands.

348
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:56,302
- Ah!
- What? What's that?

349
00:49:56,303 --> 00:49:58,003
- What?
- It's a wasp nest.

350
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:05,222
Soon, the crew find themselves
surrounded by locusts.

351
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:08,243
No need for jazz hands now.

352
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:15,902
It's a good start, but the team
still need to film the winged swarms

353
00:50:15,903 --> 00:50:17,723
that complete the story.

354
00:50:21,903 --> 00:50:25,422
But, once airborne, they
can travel 60 miles a day,

355
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:27,843
so finding a swarm won't be easy.

356
00:50:31,263 --> 00:50:35,022
Fortunately, the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organisation

357
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:37,323
are here, too, to help.

358
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:43,942
The FAO are on a mission
to eradicate the plagues

359
00:50:43,943 --> 00:50:47,182
decimating crops across Madagascar,

360
00:50:47,183 --> 00:50:51,902
and if anyone knows where the locusts are,

361
00:50:51,903 --> 00:50:55,262
it's the local expert, Hasibelo.

362
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:58,203
He thinks that they are moving this way.

363
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:03,083
Time to go swarm-chasing.

364
00:51:05,783 --> 00:51:09,102
But chasing is the operative word.

365
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:12,643
The locusts always seem one step ahead.

366
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:16,462
It's amazing, really,
because this plan's completely

367
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:19,502
- radically changing, hour by hour.
- We now have to travel

368
00:51:19,503 --> 00:51:22,782
several hours further north, which is...

369
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:24,763
- a bit of a pain.
- It's a bit of a pain.

370
00:51:28,103 --> 00:51:30,142
As they venture into the unknown,

371
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:33,443
it's clear it's been
a very wet year indeed.

372
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:44,382
Traffic is one thing,
but boats on the road?

373
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:46,563
Unconventional traffic.

374
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:54,403
Progress is slow, and
soon stops altogether.

375
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:04,523
The locusts are just across the
water, so the team must follow...

376
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:08,683
...on this.

377
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:12,883
What could possibly go wrong?

378
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:21,782
We're now stuck on, possibly,
the world's most antiquated raft

379
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:24,702
trying to cross a very fast-flowing river.

380
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,302
But, onwards and upwards.

381
00:52:27,303 --> 00:52:30,782
We've now got an hour-long river
crossing, and we'll just have to see

382
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:32,523
what's on the other side.

383
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:53,003
With the river behind them,
it should be plain sailing.

384
00:52:56,783 --> 00:53:00,502
But once across, the team
discovers that, yet again,

385
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:03,043
the locusts are nowhere to be seen.

386
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:11,622
And, after two weeks on the road,

387
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:15,363
the local street food is
beginning to take its toll.

388
00:53:18,903 --> 00:53:23,283
So Ed's not very well.
Been yacking up and...

389
00:53:24,223 --> 00:53:27,262
And not very nice stomach.

390
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:28,902
We just need to do whatever it takes now

391
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:32,022
to get us to where the swarms are.

392
00:53:32,023 --> 00:53:34,483
The next day, the team forges on.

393
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,043
Briefly.

394
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:44,382
Here's Jamal, our driver.

395
00:53:44,383 --> 00:53:46,443
What do we think? Yeah?

396
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,822
No?

397
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:51,982
The road has turned into a bog.

398
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:54,462
The cars can go no further.

399
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:58,182
We need to cross this area
of water to get to the savanna

400
00:53:58,183 --> 00:54:00,203
and find our locust swarms.

401
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:04,222
And it's amazing to think that,
with the combined might of the

402
00:54:04,223 --> 00:54:09,763
United Nations and the BBC, we are
eventually defeated by a puddle.

403
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:13,723
Back to the drawing board.

404
00:54:17,703 --> 00:54:20,763
Once again, it's Hasibelo to the rescue.

405
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:23,803
Well, we have a plan.

406
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:29,782
Taking to the air was never on the cards,

407
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:32,302
but thanks to the FAO's helicopter,

408
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:35,963
the team can now play the
locusts at their own game.

409
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:00,963
More smoke?

410
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:07,723
This time, it's a billion locusts...

411
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:19,403
...and one very relieved producer.

412
00:55:32,103 --> 00:55:34,942
Woohoo!

413
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:39,243
Against the odds, the team
has located a super-swarm.

414
00:55:56,983 --> 00:56:00,222
This is exactly what we've been
looking for. We've driven halfway

415
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:03,342
across Madagascar to one of
the most remote parts there is.

416
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:07,022
It's just been a nightmare,
but, finally, we're here.

417
00:56:07,023 --> 00:56:09,862
I mean, this is the biggest swarm
we could have even hoped for.

418
00:56:09,863 --> 00:56:11,262
It is just amazing.

419
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,643
Look at here, I'm going to film here.

420
00:56:14,983 --> 00:56:18,302
It's incredibly exhilarating,
and yet totally shocking,

421
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:21,542
to think of the devastation that
swarms like this are causing.

422
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:24,622
It just makes you realise
how important the FAO are

423
00:56:24,623 --> 00:56:27,523
in getting this under control.

424
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:32,262
I'm just going to run through it.

425
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,523
I should be naked for this, but...

426
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:53,422
Thankfully, Rob kept his clothes
on, and, more importantly,

427
00:56:53,423 --> 00:56:55,822
this plague has now been halted,

428
00:56:55,823 --> 00:56:59,462
but not before the team had
witnessed one of the biggest swarms

429
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:01,123
ever recorded on film.

430
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:18,582
Next time, we journey to
the world's great plains,

431
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:23,843
where spectacular gatherings of
wildlife cope with extreme change...

432
00:57:25,903 --> 00:57:30,523
...and surprising creatures
survive in unexpected ways.
