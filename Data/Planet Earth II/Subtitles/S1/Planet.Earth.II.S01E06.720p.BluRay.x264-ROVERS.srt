1
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,286
<i>This is the newest habitat on Earth.</i>

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,887
<i>It's here that animals have to contend</i>

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,885
<i>with the greatest change that is
happening to the face of our planet.</i>

4
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,281
<i>In this decade, the urban environment
is predicted to grow by nearly 30%.</i>

5
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,724
<i>It may appear hostile to animal life,</i>

6
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,645
<i>but for the bold, this is a world
of surprising opportunity.</i>

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,883
<i>Jodhpur, India.</i>

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,771
<i>A gang of bachelor male langurs</i>

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,401
<i>has come to challenge
the resident alpha male.</i>

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,730
<i>This alpha rules over
a valuable urban territory.</i>

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,091
<i>But maintaining dominance here
is a constant struggle.</i>

12
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,687
<i>The bachelors have united
to try and overthrow him.</i>

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,731
<i>If they win, one of the challengers</i>

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,690
<i>will take over
the alpha's troop of females,</i>

15
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,967
<i>and may kill his infants.</i>

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,571
<i>There are 15 males
in this bachelor group.</i>

17
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,525
<i>The alpha must evict every single
one of them from his territory.</i>

18
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>He has chased half the bachelors away,</i>

19
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,410
<i>but a splinter group has looped back
and is harassing his females.</i>

20
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,562
<i>Once again, he has to battle.</i>

21
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,689
<i>Finally, he manages to expel them all.</i>

22
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,847
<i>He returns home victorious,</i>

23
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,730
<i>but with a serious wound
on his right leg.</i>

24
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,320
<i>It's a hard life for him in the city.</i>

25
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,922
<i>Keeping the intruders away
is a daily challenge.</i>

26
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,211
<i>But it's worth it.</i>

27
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,930
<i>For these urban territories</i>

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,482
<i>are probably the best
langur territories in the world.</i>

29
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,925
<i>They're filled with
rich feeding grounds.</i>

30
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,248
<i>Here in the temple gardens,</i>

31
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,723
<i>the langurs have, over centuries,
developed a surprising relationship.</i>

32
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,168
<i>One that guarantee's them
a constantly replenished source of food.</i>

33
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,127
<i>The people here associate langurs
with the Hindu God, Lord Hanuman,</i>

34
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,085
<i>and revere them.</i>

35
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,126
<i>They're given all the food they can eat.</i>

36
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,848
<i>And this high-energy diet
has led to a baby boom.</i>

37
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,481
<i>Female langurs in this city</i>

38
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,724
<i>give birth to twice as many young
as their forest counterparts.</i>

39
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,689
<i>This mother is so well fed
that her rich milk</i>

40
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,843
<i>can support something
rarely seen in the wild.</i>

41
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,841
<i>Twins.</i>

42
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,044
<i>And all these babies can create troops</i>

43
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,841
<i>that are far larger than those
found in the forests nearby.</i>

44
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,690
<i>With less time spent looking for food,
there is more time for play.</i>

45
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,603
<i>The rewards of living in a city
can be huge.</i>

46
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,920
<i>The challenge is to find your niche.</i>

47
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,730
<i>New York City.</i>

48
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,524
<i>This densely built-up landscape
is as unnatural as anywhere on Earth.</i>

49
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,210
<i>And yet, this wild peregrine falcon
looks out onto an ideal habitat.</i>

50
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,281
<i>Strange as it may seem,
this vastly-altered landscape</i>

51
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,285
<i>replicates the conditions
in which peregrines evolved.</i>

52
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,651
<i>The towering buildings
have a multitude of ledges</i>

53
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,882
<i>on which falcons can nest,</i>

54
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,208
<i>and the high perches that they need
to catch the wind.</i>

55
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,126
<i>New York City has the highest density</i>

56
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,886
<i>of nesting peregrines
anywhere on the planet.</i>

57
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,530
<i>Winds striking the sides
of the skyscrapers</i>

58
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,400
<i>are deflected upwards
and can help the birds gain height.</i>

59
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,003
<i>And the great areas of concrete
roasting in the sun create thermals,</i>

60
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>so that, with very little effort,
the birds can soar over the city.</i>

61
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,691
<i>And so many peregrines can live here,</i>

62
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,766
<i>because down at street level,
there is a lot of potential prey.</i>

63
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,884
<i>Diving from height,
the falcons can reach speeds</i>

64
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,088
<i>of over 200 miles an hour.</i>

65
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,328
<i>But their prey stay down low
and close to the buildings.</i>

66
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,006
<i>Too risky.</i>

67
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,208
<i>The peregrine pulls out of his stoop.</i>

68
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,449
<i>But the effort is not wasted.</i>

69
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,201
<i>The falcons need to
flush their prey into the open.</i>

70
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,965
<i>And Manhattan is surrounded by water.</i>

71
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,044
<i>Out here the odds change.</i>

72
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,088
<i>And in the peregrine's favour.</i>

73
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,049
<i>With abundant prey here all year round,</i>

74
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,246
<i>it has taken only 40 years</i>

75
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,891
<i>for these falcons
to establish themselves here.</i>

76
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,247
<i>And now, among skyscrapers,
they're more successful</i>

77
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,210
<i>than their cousins
living in the wilderness.</i>

78
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,641
<i>Mumbai, in India,
is home to over 20 million people.</i>

79
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,644
<i>And there are predators here</i>

80
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,327
<i>that, though rarely seen,
are rightly feared.</i>

81
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,961
<i>Carnivores,</i>

82
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,965
<i>lured by the prospect
of plentiful unsuspecting prey</i>

83
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,485
<i>are on the prowl.</i>

84
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,284
<i>A leopard.</i>

85
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,041
<i>Every night, under the cover of darkness
they come out to hunt.</i>

86
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,007
<i>These are big animals,</i>

87
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,880
<i>and they're looking for large prey
to satisfy their hunger.</i>

88
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,045
<i>To catch more than a glimpse of them
and reveal their hunting behaviour,</i>

89
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
<i>you need night-vision cameras.</i>

90
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,882
<i>Leopards have attacked
almost 200 people here</i>

91
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,122
<i>in the last 25 years.</i>

92
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,966
<i>But humans are not their usual prey.</i>

93
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,489
<i>These leopards are on the hunt
for something else.</i>

94
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,480
<i>Pigs.</i>

95
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,807
<i>These leopards prefer to hunt
the domestic animals</i>

96
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,930
<i>that people have brought to the city
in considerable numbers.</i>

97
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,361
<i>The pigs keep their family close.</i>

98
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,007
<i>The ceaseless noise of the city
plays to their advantage.</i>

99
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,488
<i>It conceals their approach.</i>

100
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,205
<i>And the leopards are using this cover
to hunt all over the city.</i>

101
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,846
<i>This is a thriving population.</i>

102
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,602
<i>In fact, the highest concentration
of leopards in the world</i>

103
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,491
<i>is right here.</i>

104
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,563
<i>It's not only the abundance of food
that attracts wild animals to cities.</i>

105
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,288
<i>They're usually several degrees warmer
than the surrounding countryside.</i>

106
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,170
<i>And here in Rome, in December,</i>

107
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,290
<i>one animal is taking full advantage
of this extra heat.</i>

108
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,804
<i>And it's leaving it's mark.</i>

109
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,962
<i>In a single winter's day,</i>

110
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,045
<i>ten tonnes of its droppings
rain down on the city.</i>

111
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,281
<i>Starlings.</i>

112
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,285
<i>In the evening, they come back
to the warmth of the city</i>

113
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,011
<i>after feeding in
the neighbouring countryside.</i>

114
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,246
<i>They must return
to their roosting trees.</i>

115
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,163
<i>But the first to do so
are at the highest risk</i>

116
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,402
<i>of being caught by birds of prey.</i>

117
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,210
<i>So, they wait for others to arrive.</i>

118
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,169
<i>There's safety in numbers.</i>

119
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,727
<i>As daylight fades, the sky fills
with a staggering one million starlings.</i>

120
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,531
<i>And then follows
one of nature's great spectaculars.</i>

121
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,731
<i>How, or indeed why, they perform
these marvellous aerobatics,</i>

122
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,451
<i>we still do not fully understand.</i>

123
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,847
<i>Eventually, en masse,
they brave the descent</i>

124
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,129
<i>and fill the branches
of their favourite trees.</i>

125
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,647
<i>On these cold winter nights,
the city's extra warmth</i>

126
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,122
<i>can mean the difference
between life and death.</i>

127
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,288
<i>A city, of course, can provide</i>

128
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,921
<i>not only shelter and abundant food,
but glamour.</i>

129
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,482
<i>These varied objects
have been carefully chosen</i>

130
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,565
<i>by a bird for their brightness
and their colour.</i>

131
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,763
<i>This great bowerbird
has spent over a decade</i>

132
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,322
<i>building this collection of
mostly man-made objects.</i>

133
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,645
<i>Out on a golf course
in Townsville, Australia,</i>

134
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,725
<i>he's putting the final touches
to his enormous bower,</i>

135
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,690
<i>that he hopes will impress
a visiting female.</i>

136
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,969
<i>He spends two hours each day
rearranging his prized objects.</i>

137
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,166
<i>"Perhaps that would look
a little better over there."</i>

138
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,129
<i>But it seems that something is missing.</i>

139
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,449
<i>Instead of going into town
to collect new objects,</i>

140
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,842
<i>he's decided to raid
his neighbour's bower.</i>

141
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,609
<i>"A clothes peg! Excellent!"</i>

142
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,848
<i>"And a shiny toy car."</i>

143
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,521
<i>It's a risky game if you get caught.</i>

144
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,645
<i>The owner is back.</i>

145
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,849
<i>There is one bower
where the risk is worth it.</i>

146
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,562
<i>A particular object has caught his eye.</i>

147
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,566
<i>He'll have to wait
for the owner to leave.</i>

148
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,720
<i>This is his chance.</i>

149
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,565
<i>A real treasure.</i>

150
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,210
<i>A scarlet heart.</i>

151
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,801
<i>"Got it."</i>

152
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,402
<i>The stage is now set
for female visitors.</i>

153
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,927
<i>His luck may be in.</i>

154
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,770
<i>The seduction can now begin.</i>

155
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,208
<i>He's showing off his best goods.</i>

156
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,286
<i>"Perhaps a little plastic piping?</i>

157
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,562
<i>"Or maybe a bit of coloured string?"</i>

158
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,007
<i>But his guest doesn't seem to be
paying much attention.</i>

159
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,846
<i>"A fork?</i>

160
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,286
<i>"Madame?"</i>

161
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,609
<i>Nothing seems to be working.</i>

162
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,840
<i>Something is just not quite right here.</i>

163
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,965
<i>But he still has one trick
up his sleeve.</i>

164
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,004
<i>The scarlet heart.</i>

165
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,127
<i>As a final thrill,
he expands the pink crest</i>

166
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,123
<i>on the back of his head.</i>

167
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,646
<i>The sign of his adulthood.</i>

168
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,284
<i>But he's made a mistake.</i>

169
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,205
<i>This is not a female</i>

170
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,523
<i>but a young male who hasn't yet
developed that head crest.</i>

171
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,171
<i>And he's making off
with the scarlet heart.</i>

172
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,122
<i>It's not easy finding sex in the city.</i>

173
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,286
<i>Raising a family in the city
is not easy either.</i>

174
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,408
<i>It's spring time in Toronto,</i>

175
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,044
<i>and this mother raccoon has exchanged
her native treetops for rooftops.</i>

176
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,282
<i>Since giving birth two months ago,</i>

177
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,490
<i>she's kept her offspring
safe and warm inside a chimney.</i>

178
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,886
<i>Now, her young
have outgrown their nursery.</i>

179
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,043
<i>This is her first major
challenge as a mother.</i>

180
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,003
<i>The time has come to move to a new home.</i>

181
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,483
<i>She needs to get her youngster
to ground level.</i>

182
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,889
<i>But instead of an easy climb
down a tree,</i>

183
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,611
<i>she is faced with a vertical drop,</i>

184
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,729
<i>with little to cling onto.</i>

185
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,003
<i>Her baby's first glimpse
of the urban world,</i>

186
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,281
<i>from a terrifying 30 feet up.</i>

187
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,283
<i>This is the last of her litter
to be brought down.</i>

188
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,970
<i>Its siblings are already</i>

189
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,122
<i>busy exploring the area.</i>

190
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,810
<i>And they have much to learn.</i>

191
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,202
<i>This one has fallen into a back alley
and is trapped.</i>

192
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,451
<i>Mother comes to the rescue
and demonstrates what must be done.</i>

193
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,360
<i>That's the way.</i>

194
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,800
<i>Raccoons are opportunists.</i>

195
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,403
<i>And they're eager to explore.</i>

196
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,328
<i>But they'll have to learn very quickly</i>

197
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,961
<i>how to get along in this
strange new environment</i>

198
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,611
<i>so full of hazards.</i>

199
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,844
<i>Mother comes to the rescue once more.</i>

200
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,609
<i>Urban raccoons are now
demonstrably better</i>

201
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,206
<i>at problem-solving
than their country cousins.</i>

202
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,927
<i>When the feeding opportunities
are this good,</i>

203
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,526
<i>the time spent working out
how to get to it</i>

204
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,523
<i>is well worth it.</i>

205
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,161
<i>The complexity of urban life</i>

206
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,090
<i>favours the clever.</i>

207
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,968
<i>But to compete with humanity
during daylight hours,</i>

208
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,565
<i>takes more than just intelligence.</i>

209
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,770
<i>It takes nerve.</i>

210
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,691
<i>One enterprising species of monkey</i>

211
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,162
<i>has moved into the city
of Jaipur in India.</i>

212
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,966
<i>The Rhesus macaque.</i>

213
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,526
<i>But how to get a share
of all this juicy fruit?</i>

214
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,209
<i>Every morning,
the troop make the same journey</i>

215
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,887
<i>through the urban jungle,
just as human commuters do.</i>

216
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,601
<i>Sometimes, inevitably,
there are traffic jams.</i>

217
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,843
<i>Once they get to the market,
trouble begins.</i>

218
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,762
<i>Being both intelligent and brazen</i>

219
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,731
<i>is the key to beating
human beings on their home turf.</i>

220
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,203
<i>It's daylight robbery.</i>

221
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,247
<i>There are some animals
that most would consider too dangerous</i>

222
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,209
<i>to tolerate in the city.</i>

223
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,325
<i>Spotted hyenas.</i>

224
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,882
<i>They're feared throughout their range.</i>

225
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,644
<i>In the outskirts of Hara in Ethiopia,</i>

226
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,760
<i>two clans are coming face to face
to battle over a prized resource.</i>

227
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,288
<i>There are about 60 hyenas in each clan.</i>

228
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,326
<i>And they're well matched.</i>

229
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,844
<i>After three hours of
posturing back and forth,</i>

230
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,524
<i>the losers retreat</i>

231
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,491
<i>and the victors head
to claim their prize.</i>

232
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,921
<i>They have been fighting
over access to the city.</i>

233
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,684
<i>Once inside the city walls,
they head for one place.</i>

234
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,486
<i>And they know exactly how to get there.</i>

235
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,048
<i>The ancient meat market.</i>

236
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,570
<i>The scent of all these carcasses
lies heavy in the air.</i>

237
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,921
<i>This tradition goes back over 400 years.</i>

238
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,923
<i>The human butchers put out
the bones they don't need</i>

239
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,731
<i>and these hyenas deal with them.</i>

240
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,204
<i>They're the only animals that can.</i>

241
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,045
<i>No other here has such
powerful bone-crushing jaws.</i>

242
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,410
<i>And this relationship
between man and beast</i>

243
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,687
<i>has now been taken a step further.</i>

244
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,689
<i>Yousuf is calling the hyenas
to his house.</i>

245
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,526
<i>He and his forefathers,
going back five generations,</i>

246
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,648
<i>have been feeding the hyenas</i>

247
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,120
<i>by hand.</i>

248
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,523
<i>The inhabitants of this town
believe that hyenas</i>

249
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,729
<i>provide another very important service.</i>

250
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,646
<i>Eating the bad spirits
that haunt the streets.</i>

251
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,409
<i>These are wild and ferocious animals,</i>

252
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,881
<i>but once within these city walls,</i>

253
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,930
<i>they behave in a completely
different way.</i>

254
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,481
<i>Throughout the rest of Africa,
spotted hyenas are feared</i>

255
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,689
<i>because they kill livestock,
sometimes even children.</i>

256
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,806
<i>They are perhaps the most
vilified animal on our planet.</i>

257
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,288
<i>However, here in Harar,</i>

258
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,728
<i>their relationship with people
is entirely peaceful.</i>

259
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,161
<i>They have won the trust of man.</i>

260
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,802
<i>Losing its fear of humans</i>

261
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,646
<i>has enabled one animal
to spread into cities everywhere,</i>

262
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,563
<i>and in huge numbers.</i>

263
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,648
<i>Pigeons are by far
the most successful urban bird.</i>

264
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,281
<i>Here, in Albi, in the south of France,</i>

265
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,567
<i>the pigeons come to the river to bathe.</i>

266
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,365
<i>They need to preen
their flight feathers,</i>

267
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,522
<i>clean off the city dust,</i>

268
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,969
<i>and cool themselves down.</i>

269
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,762
<i>But death lies in wait.</i>

270
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,168
<i>A predator that has taken advantage</i>

271
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,130
<i>of the very thing that has led
to the pigeon's success...</i>

272
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,886
<i>Their lack of fear.</i>

273
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,371
<i>As the pigeons bathe,
oil from their plumage flows downstream,</i>

274
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,530
<i>and is detected.</i>

275
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,164
<i>A monstrous Wels catfish.</i>

276
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,926
<i>Introduced here just 40 years ago,
they have proliferated.</i>

277
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,041
<i>Virtually exterminated
the local fish stocks...</i>

278
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,121
<i>And they've now developed a taste
for pigeon.</i>

279
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,329
<i>Their eyesight is poor,</i>

280
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,405
<i>so they use their barbels to sense
the movements of their victims.</i>

281
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,970
<i>This is a radical new hunting strategy</i>

282
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,930
<i>for what is normally
a bottom-dwelling fish.</i>

283
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,844
<i>After a thousand years
of living in this city,</i>

284
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,805
<i>pigeons are now having to learn
to avoid a fish.</i>

285
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,451
<i>Our cities are always changing.</i>

286
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,204
<i>Sometimes very swiftly.</i>

287
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,565
<i>And animals must cope with the changes,</i>

288
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,605
<i>or disappear.</i>

289
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,564
<i>One of the greatest changes
in recent times</i>

290
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,521
<i>has come from a single invention
made less than 140 years ago.</i>

291
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,890
<i>Electric light.</i>

292
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,606
<i>It has become more and more powerful,</i>

293
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,008
<i>filling our streets with light.</i>

294
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,569
<i>It's everywhere in the city.</i>

295
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,244
<i>It even goes under ground.</i>

296
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,567
<i>The difference between day and night
is becoming less and less perceptible.</i>

297
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,688
<i>And that has a profound effect
on the activities of wildlife.</i>

298
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,243
<i>In the wilderness,
light triggers all kinds of behaviour.</i>

299
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,929
<i>On the night of the full moon,</i>

300
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,924
<i>hundreds of tiny
hawksbill turtle hatchlings</i>

301
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,891
<i>emerge from the safety of their nest
deep in the sand.</i>

302
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,211
<i>Their instinct is to reach the sea
as quickly as possible.</i>

303
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,121
<i>And their guide is the light
of the full moon reflected on the water.</i>

304
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,091
<i>But this young hatchling is confused.</i>

305
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,091
<i>It's going in the wrong direction.</i>

306
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,646
<i>Bright light is coming from the land.</i>

307
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,322
<i>And all these hatchlings
are travelling up the beach towards it.</i>

308
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,170
<i>Predators are ready to take advantage.</i>

309
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,045
<i>Crabs now make their burrows
directly beneath the beach lights</i>

310
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,644
<i>and wait for their prey to come to them.</i>

311
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,840
<i>Even if a hatchling escapes,</i>

312
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,891
<i>they're still in peril.</i>

313
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,723
<i>The lights become
more and more bewildering.</i>

314
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,929
<i>80% of all hatchlings on this beach</i>

315
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,971
<i>are now disorientated
by the lights of the town.</i>

316
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,805
<i>Roads bring many to their end.</i>

317
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,560
<i>Hundreds get trapped
in storm drains every night.</i>

318
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,606
<i>Exhausted by the effort of travelling
such a distance on land,</i>

319
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,210
<i>this hatchling's chances
of surviving the night are slim.</i>

320
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,009
<i>This turtle is one of
the countless species</i>

321
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,811
<i>that have been unable
to adapt to the change</i>

322
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,884
<i>brought about by the urban environment.</i>

323
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,568
<i>Only a small number of animals</i>

324
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,849
<i>have managed to find ways
of living alongside us.</i>

325
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,165
<i>And every 10 years,
an area the size of Britain</i>

326
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,369
<i>disappears under a jungle of concrete.</i>

327
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,564
<i>But it doesn't have to be like this.</i>

328
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,242
<i>Could it not be possible to build cities
more in harmony with nature?</i>

329
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,767
<i>How, and whether we decide to invite
the wildlife back, is up to us.</i>

330
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,843
<i>This tree is rising nearly 30 storeys.</i>

331
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,848
<i>It's one of almost 800 being planted
to create a vertical forest in Milan.</i>

332
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,129
<i>This number of living trees would
normally fill two hectares of woodland,</i>

333
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,000
<i>but here, they occupy
one-tenth of that area.</i>

334
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,490
<i>Greening the walls
and roofs of our buildings</i>

335
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,131
<i>could create
a rich and extensive habitat,</i>

336
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,123
<i>if we wanted it to do so.</i>

337
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,047
<i>There is one city where that idea
is being applied on a major scale.</i>

338
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,926
<i>Singapore.</i>

339
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,681
<i>Two million trees have been planted here
in the last 45 years.</i>

340
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,882
<i>This city is now richer in species
than any other in the world.</i>

341
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,721
<i>And this practise extends
to all parts of the city.</i>

342
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,964
<i>The waterways have been cleaned up,</i>

343
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,646
<i>and smooth-coated otters
are coming back.</i>

344
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,364
<i>But perhaps, the most spectacular
example of city greening</i>

345
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,762
<i>is this grove of super trees.</i>

346
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,807
<i>These 150 feet high metal structures
are now full of life.</i>

347
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,491
<i>Creepers have been planted
to grow over the outermost branches.</i>

348
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,124
<i>This is a new urban world
that we have now designed and built</i>

349
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,364
<i>with others in mind.</i>

350
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,648
<i>Create the space,
and the animals will come.</i>

351
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,763
<i>Is this a vision
of our cities of the future?</i>

352
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,803
<i>It could be possible
to see wildlife thriving</i>

353
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,804
<i>within our cities across the planet.</i>

354
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,563
<i>We, after all, are the architects
of the urban world.</i>

355
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,208
Now, over half of us
live in an urban environment.

356
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,046
My home, too, is here
in the city of London.

357
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,207
Looking down on this great metropolis,

358
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,442
the ingenuity with which we continue

359
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,002
to reshape the surface
of our planet is very striking,

360
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,490
but it's also sobering.

361
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,409
It reminds me of just
how easy it is for us

362
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,450
to lose our connection
with the natural world.

363
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,530
Yet it's on this connection
that the future

364
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,650
of both humanity
and the natural world will depend.

365
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,130
It's surely our responsibility
to do everything within our power

366
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,566
to create a planet that provides a home
not just for us,

367
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,329
but for all life on Earth.

368
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,889
<i>For a wildlife film crew,</i>

369
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,522
<i>working in the urban environment
was an altogether different experience.</i>

370
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,329
<i>Two crews set off
on two very different missions.</i>

371
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,686
<i>It's Mark and Louis's
first time in India.</i>

372
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,362
Passed this moped,
and we're not stopping.

373
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,886
We're going. Oh, my God!

374
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,682
Yeah, we're in India.

375
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,049
<i>Along with the rest of the team,</i>

376
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,646
<i>they hope to film up close and personal</i>

377
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,882
<i>with the monkeys
that have come from the wild</i>

378
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,281
<i>to live in the hustle and bustle
of the city.</i>

379
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,761
I can't believe these macaques
have left the peace and quiet

380
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,002
for this mayhem, but they're fine here.

381
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,890
In fact, they're probably a bit more
comfortable than I am with this noise.

382
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,007
Yeah, yeah.

383
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,122
<i>And to get into the monkey's world,</i>

384
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,966
<i>Mark will be using a new rig
that stabilises the camera</i>

385
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,407
<i>and allows him to get
right into the action.</i>

386
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,211
I think Mark and Louis
have got a big challenge.

387
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,568
To be, uh, wielding thousands of pounds
worth of camera equipment

388
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,290
down at the street level.

389
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,203
Rather them than me.

390
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,086
<i>We've got a lady
with cauliflowers</i>

391
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,208
<i>passing on your left, Mark.</i>

392
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,004
- Just pull me aside.
<i>- On your left.</i>

393
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,651
I'm more used to a jungle,
if I'm honest.

394
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,601
Erm, well, this is
a jungle all of its own.

395
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,045
Just with people instead of trees.

396
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,122
This really...
It's impossible.

397
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,571
<i>Seven hundred miles south, in Mumbai,</i>

398
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,246
<i>cameraman Gordon Buchanan
will have to take on</i>

399
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,924
<i>a completely different filming approach</i>

400
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,129
<i>if he is to capture
an urban leopard hunt.</i>

401
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,691
It's amazing to think that
standing here, surrounded by people,

402
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,489
all this, kind of, human activity,

403
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,769
that within half a mile,

404
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,525
maybe even less, there will be leopards.

405
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,804
<i>Only glimpses of
these cats have been caught on camera,</i>

406
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,370
<i>and just to locate them,</i>

407
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,920
<i>he'll need new infrared camera traps.</i>

408
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,480
Are you happy
with the composition? Good.

409
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,404
What about you? Correct shutter speed?

410
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,160
<i>Gordon is hoping that these camera traps
will reveal where they're on the prowl.</i>

411
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,447
<i>For the monkey team,
finding the animals seems easy...</i>

412
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,329
Steady now, Rob.
Rob, Rob, Rob.

413
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,210
<i>...but keeping up with them
is a different matter.</i>

414
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,285
- He almost stomped on that.
- Ooh!

415
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,725
They didn't put that
on the hazard assessment.

416
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,643
- They did, as a matter of fact.
- A cow in the groin?

417
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,210
A cow in the groin in there.

418
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,291
<i>They're much tougher
and more granitey</i>

419
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,328
<i>than the monkeys I filmed in the wild.</i>

420
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,004
<i>They're not frightened of us.</i>

421
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,526
They're, erm... I mean, look at this.

422
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,968
He's takin' on pigs,
he's takin' on goats,

423
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,087
he's takin' on cows.

424
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,083
He's takin' on me anytime he wants to.

425
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,804
<i>But with monkeys this brazen,</i>

426
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,407
<i>Mark is able to follow the troop
at street level.</i>

427
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,243
<i>To capture their movements
in their rooftop world,</i>

428
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,360
<i>they need to run a cable between
buildings and fly a camera along it.</i>

429
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,966
<i>And that calls for
some inventive rigging.</i>

430
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,611
I've got this soft satsuma here,

431
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,086
and I've got to lob it to the team
on the other side, over there.

432
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,844
We're gonna lob it
from rooftop to rooftop.

433
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,925
We've made sure there's no one
on the rooftops and it's safe to do it.

434
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,081
You ready?

435
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,801
Okay.

436
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,288
Okay, good. That's good.

437
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,286
I got it into the courtyard.
So that's perfect.

438
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,290
I think our cable run
at the moment is about 60 metres.

439
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,048
And we can travel the whole length,

440
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,851
while panning and tilting and really
looking at everything we want to.

441
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,605
It should give us
some really dynamic stunning shots.

442
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,329
<i>The team
is getting an insight at all levels</i>

443
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,324
<i>into the monkeys' mischievous lives.</i>

444
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,288
<i>And are starting to figure out
the routes they use to cross the city.</i>

445
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,565
<i>And over the course of weeks,</i>

446
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,803
<i>the macaques become
all too familiar with the crew.</i>

447
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,765
Oh, monkey.

448
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,683
All right, little monkey. All right.

449
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,921
<i>They're now fully embedded in the troop,</i>

450
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,004
<i>and Mark is able to film
right amongst them.</i>

451
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,048
<i>These guys
at the moment are magic.</i>

452
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,963
We've got monkeys behaving naturally.

453
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,371
<i>It's fantastic.</i>

454
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,444
- It's good, Louis.
- Very nice, too. Very nice.

455
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,329
<i>Back in Mumbai,
the camera traps are revealing</i>

456
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,528
<i>where the leopards are coming out.</i>

457
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,560
<i>But to stand any chance
of capturing them hunting in the city,</i>

458
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,486
<i>Gordon will need to use
the latest thermal camera technology.</i>

459
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,246
I can't imagine
that a leopard's gonna come

460
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,924
with all this going on.

461
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,962
<i>Relative silence eventually descends.</i>

462
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,960
Okay, I picked up some movement
behind some bushes on the camera.

463
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,007
Just a, sort of, a twinkling of light.

464
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,411
It's something warm-blooded.

465
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,886
Here we go.

466
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,045
A leopard.

467
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,726
You dancer, look at that.

468
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,847
It definitely knows that I'm here.

469
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,322
That's the type of sighting that
you'd have to wait for weeks and weeks

470
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,084
to get a leopard that close,

471
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,003
and so airily open.

472
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,451
<i>Over the next month,</i>

473
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,967
<i>this camera enables Gordon
to see into the darkness,</i>

474
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,886
<i>and be the first person to film
an urban leopard hunt.</i>

475
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,249
<i>But it's only at the end of the trip</i>

476
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,005
<i>that he has his most
memorable encounter.</i>

477
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,242
Look at the size of him.

478
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,927
He's coming up. He's coming up.
He's coming up.

479
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,083
My goodness! Look at that.

480
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,527
He's about three metres in front of me.

481
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,611
Hey, there!

482
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,204
My heart is racing.

483
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,126
That was close.

484
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,287
That's the closest
I've ever been to a leopard.

485
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,523
It's often the case with urban wildlife

486
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,843
is that it's the presence
of human beings

487
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,481
that allows certain animals to do well.

488
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,206
<i>And I suppose it's just incredible</i>

489
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,524
<i>that one of those animals
is the leopard.</i>

490
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,006
<i>It isn't just Gordon getting an insight</i>

491
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,165
<i>into the surprising wildlife
encounters possible in the city.</i>

492
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,726
<i>It's in Jodhpur, filming the langurs,</i>

493
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,361
<i>that the monkey team really see
the extraordinary relationship</i>

494
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,126
<i>between humans and animals
in Indian cities.</i>

495
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,521
They're so tolerant. They're amazing.

496
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,130
<i>And it makes
a strong impression on them.</i>

497
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,645
Oh, it's beautiful!

498
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,611
<i>Yeah, that is beautiful.</i>

499
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,084
I mean, coming to India,
this is what you realise

500
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,205
that if you let your wildlife
into the city

501
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,444
and you really embrace it,
then this is the reward you get.

502
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,842
