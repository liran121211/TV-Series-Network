Trevelyan recounts that some years before, Mr. Blessington plucked him out of an obscure and virtually non-existent practice and offered to set him up at a prestigious address. In return for this investment, Blessington would receive a percentage of his income and would provide him with free medical care. For quite some time now the arrangement has worked well for both parties and Blessington has profited from the arrangement. Recently however, Blessington has been acting very strangely.
