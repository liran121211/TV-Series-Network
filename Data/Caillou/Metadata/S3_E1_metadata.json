When Mom drives Sarah to her skating lesson, Caillou decides he wants to take skating lessons too! But the lessons are harder than Caillou expected, and if it weren't for the neato Zamboni, Caillou might not have gone back. When an invitation for Clementine's party accidentally ends up at Sarah's, Caillou learns the differences between the addresses of the two homes. Later, when Clementine tells Caillou how much she likes her older brother, Billy, to teach her things, Caillou sets out to teach something to Rosie. But this proves harder than Caillou thought, until Mom suggests he try the A-B-C song! Also, when Caillou's dawdling causes he, Mom and Rosie to be late going to the park, they end up missing Leo. So Dad suggests they make a game out of not dawdling, by using an egg timer for Caillou to race against when he gets ready for bed."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1245975", "rating": 3.9, "votes": 16, "number_of_episodes": 203}
