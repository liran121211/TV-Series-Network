Unable to fly his kite on a windless day, Caillou stares at the clouds and finds they're really wagons, balloons and dinosaurs, if you look at them just right. When rain grounds his kite another day, Caillou and Dad turn the living room into a pirate ship. Just like his Daddy, Caillou loves anything to do with cars, so he\u00e2&#x20AC;\u00f4s very happy when Dad asks him to help wash the family car. And while he sits in the car, he imagines he\u00e2&#x20AC;\u00f4s driving a car to the beach. It's also fun playing with his friend George, who no one can see but Caillou. Later, Caillou, Rosie and Julie the baby-sitter travel to all sorts of pretend far away places. Among them are the desert with its camel and oasis, the big mountain they climb and finally the river and waterfalls in the steamy tropical forest."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1245158", "rating": 3.6, "votes": 15, "number_of_episodes": 203}
