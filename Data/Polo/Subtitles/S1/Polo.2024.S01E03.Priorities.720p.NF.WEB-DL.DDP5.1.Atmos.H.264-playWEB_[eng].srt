1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,635
{\an8}<i>It's game day here,</i>
<i>round two of the U.S. Open.</i>

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,556
<i>We've got Valiente</i>
<i>taking on La Fe.</i>

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>As always, Valiente is one of</i>
<i>the favorites here to win the U.S. Open.</i>

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>La Fe is definitely</i>
<i>gonna have their hands full today,</i>

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>going up against the GOAT,</i>
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso.</i>

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,444
{\an8}<i>La Fe is a very young organization.</i>

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,321
{\an8}<i>They've only been playing together</i>
<i>for a few years.</i>

8
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,741
Where the fuck is Louis?

9
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,785
{\an8}

10
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,874
If Cambiaso is standing back,
let's have a bit of patience to attack.

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:41,791
Okay.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,918
Notice that from
where we started having it,

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,128
he started getting in.

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,213
- Once he gets in…
- Then yes.

15
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,424
Then yes, we go there.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,718
- Let's play where it's not his area.
- Okay.

17
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,969
Damn him.

18
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,725
Fuck.

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,104
- How you doing? I'm good.
- How are you, officer?

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm Deputy Ficarra
with the Sheriff's Office.

21
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:09,069
The reason I'm pulling you over,
you were up at 57. That's a 40 back there.

22
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,695
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

23
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,572
Anything to say?

24
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,742
We're playing against
Cambiaso and we got stopped by the police.

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,412
You're such an asshole, dude.

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,125
I'll write the citation.
The options are listed here on the back.

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,214
Is there anything to add?

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,508
We're coming. We're coming.

30
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,718
We're playing against Cambiaso
when we get there.

31
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,098
{\an8}Being late,
that pisses me the fuck off, man.

32
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,228
We're driving as fast as possible.

33
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,107
We're hoping I was going to get there
before the game started going.

34
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,490
In this sport,
you need so many things to be perfect.

35
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,494
Showing up five minutes before a game,
I was embarrassed.

36
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,454
I was so pissed.

37
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,918
{\an8}They called Robi.
We're now playing against Cambiaso.

38
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,337
{\an8}Unlucky for him, though, we're here.

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,967
Adolfo Cambiaso,
he's the best player that's ever lived.

40
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,428
And he's got the best organization
with the best horses.

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,889
But in that moment,

42
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,517
I really don't care about all that.

43
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,436
About motherfucking time.
Big fucking game.

44
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,858
With our new offensive strategy,
we're gonna beat 'em.

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,320
We're gonna fuck this motherfucker up.

46
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,326
<i>La Fe headed towards</i>
<i>the scoreboard.</i>

47
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,745
{\an8}<i>Valiente headed towards</i>
<i>the Alan Carroll side.</i>

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,289
{\an8}

49
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>Both teams getting lined up</i>
<i>for this first throw-in.</i>

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>Ball is bowled in. First ball of the day</i>
<i>going to pop out towards the La Fe side.</i>

51
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,097
<i>Here comes Adolfo Cambiaso.</i>

52
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,725
We've got
a good strategy going in,

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,144
which was for me to be more
of an offensive force

54
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,520
when we recouped the ball.

55
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,023
<i>Elizalde gets there,</i>
<i>steals it back for La Fe.</i>

56
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:14,068
<i>Hits the ball forward, looking forward.</i>
<i>Devaleix, Louis is going to get there.</i>

57
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,153
Come on, Louis.

58
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>Louis leaves it behind there.</i>

59
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,533
Oh. Yikes.

60
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>Stolen back by Cambiaso.</i>

61
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,998
<i>Adolfo fires a beautiful pass</i>
<i>up to Paquito.</i>

62
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,958
<i>Paquito is alone at the front.</i>

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,128
<i>Louis cutting across</i>
<i>center field, trying to catch him here.</i>

64
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>Paquito shoots, knocked down by Elizalde.</i>

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,508
<i>Look at that, but Peke Gonzalez is there.</i>

66
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,595
<i>And that one finally</i>
<i>went on through the goal.</i>

67
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,725
{\an8}You can tell
he's a little overwhelmed and nervous.

68
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,187
{\an8}He's, like, trying to kill the ball.
He just needs to keep his calm.

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,609
<i>Ball is back in play.</i>

70
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,072
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso winds up, shoots to goal.</i>

71
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:05,245
{\an8}<i>It is on through the uprights.</i>
<i>Perfectly done there by Cambiaso.</i>

72
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,331
Motherfucker.

73
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,753
If you don't try to build a lead
against Cambiaso, you're fucked.

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,592
<i>Cambiaso's takeoff to goal</i>
<i>on a breakaway. Oh my goodness.</i>

75
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:25,556
{\an8}<i>Cambiaso puts it on through the uprights.</i>
<i>Back-to-back goals there from the GOAT.</i>

76
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,142
{\an8}<i>Goal number four.</i>

77
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,353
{\an8}<i>De Narvaez gets it done.</i>

78
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,940
{\an8}<i>Paco drills it straight on through here.</i>
<i>What a goal. What a horse.</i>

79
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,984
<i>Fran leaves it for Devaleix…</i>

80
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,901
Come on.

81
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,444
<i>In for the red zone…</i>

82
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,156
{\an8}<i>That's a goal. Fantastic.</i>
<i>Well done, Louis and Fran.</i>

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,909
{\an8}<i>Paco, right down the middle.</i>
<i>6-2, now the score.</i>

84
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,494
{\an8}They started goal, goal, goal.

85
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,415
It kind of brought us
back down to reality.

86
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,625
{\an8}<i>That will do it</i>
<i>for the first half.</i>

87
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,003
{\an8}<i>We get a quick five-minute halftime.</i>

88
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,764
Our team's strategy was… short-lived

89
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,268
when… it goes back to fucking Cambiaso.

90
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,854
Five minutes,
he knows exactly what we're gonna do

91
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,355
the next three chukkers.

92
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,690
He comes to me,

93
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,443
but many times he goes to a pass.

94
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,737
That's when I leave it to you.

95
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,615
- I'm leaving you the six-goaler, there.
- No. It works fine.

96
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,034
We get organized.

97
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,037
Sorry, we missed a goal
right in front of them.

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,914
You are the king of
the penalty and the goal here.

99
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,958
Let's see, now they are putting it wrong.

100
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,088
<i>Valiente doubling</i>
<i>up La Fe on the scoreboard.</i>

101
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,550
<i>I'll hit you guys with a few announcements</i>
<i>while we wait. Just a reminder…</i>

102
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,136
- It's close.
- We've got lots of polo left.

103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,221
I'm feeling good.

104
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,267
And coming from a pregnant lady,
that means I'm feeling great.

105
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,603
This season is different
than it has been in the past.

106
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,314
I'm not playing at all,
but I can go watch polo.

107
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,901
If I were me circa five years ago,

108
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,904
I wouldn't have time
to be here doing this, supporting him.

109
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,406
{\an8}- I'm going… stir-crazy.
 It's okay.

110
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,241
I mean, like, not managing a house.

111
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,453
Of course. But it's
very difficult not working like I was,

112
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,289
not playing like I was playing,
and having those two elements

113
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,876
kind of taken out of my life
because now I feel very stagnant,

114
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,338
and I'm not a person
who enjoys a stagnant lifestyle.

115
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,423
- What brings me joy is the hustle.
- Yeah.

116
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,927
I am a polo player

117
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,514
and an attorney in Chicago
at a law firm there and working remotely.

118
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,725
Because I'm pregnant
with a baby girl, everything else

119
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,603
kind of just became second priority.

120
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,773
I'm happy to be the sweet pregnant wife
supporting her husband

121
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,108
for a period of time,

122
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,903
but that is not who I've been
or what I have strived for.

123
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,280
So…

124
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,080
<i>Both teams line back up</i>
<i>at center field. Ball's in play.</i>

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>Devaleix with the pickup right here.</i>
<i>Louis Devaleix going to the goal.</i>

126
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,420
Come on, Louis.

127
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,422
Good job, Louis.

128
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,340
<i>Ooh,</i>
<i>leaves that one behind, though.</i>

129
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,591
Louis.

130
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,930
We had one strategy going into it.

131
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,310
We started getting killed
and didn't pivot to another strategy.

132
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,187
<i>Louis on the run to goal.</i>

133
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,314
<i>Paquito to the inner vice,</i>
<i>trying to get the hook.</i>

134
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,569
<i>Louis's ball spits out to the left side,</i>
<i>and crosses that back line wide.</i>

135
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,528
Fuck!

136
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,074
When it ends,
I'd be careful coming into the tent.

137
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,119
{\an8}<i>Gonzalez gets away from Diaz.</i>
<i>He's in the red zone.</i>

138
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,371
{\an8}<i>Peke Gonzalez shoots and scores.</i>

139
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,289
{\an8}

140
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,084
{\an8}<i>Final horn sounds.</i>
<i>Valiente comes out victorious.</i>

141
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,587
{\an8}

142
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,801
I mean, I get it,
losing against a good team,

143
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,846
but not getting killed
the way we just got fucking killed.

144
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,122
How do I feel
about our performance? Um…

145
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,418
Angry.

146
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,795
Um, pissed off.

147
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,633
Uh… highly disappointed.

148
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,929
No, no, no, it can't be.

149
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,015
It's not possible that we keep losing.

150
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,107
After that loss,

151
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,152
we knew we had to win
the next game, otherwise we're out.

152
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,321
<i>Devastating loss for La Fe.</i>

153
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,951
<i>Valiente moves to a 2-0 record,</i>
<i>and now if La Fe loses their next game,</i>

154
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,827
<i>they are out of the U.S. Open.</i>

155
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,049
After the game,
I went to the barn, got on three horses,

156
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,760
and hit penalty shots
and went stick and balling.

157
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm super, super disappointed.

158
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,475
We can't play like that.

159
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,521
We have the best chemistry off the field,
but it's just not working.

160
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,192
I wanna blow the fucking team up.

161
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,037
We shouldn't have changed
the strategy. We played better last time.

162
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,956
I mean, you're playing against Cambiaso.

163
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,918
- Fuck him.
- He's Adolfo. He's Cambiaso. That's not a…

164
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,379
That's the best it's gonna be.

165
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,549
- The most difficult game you'll play.
- Okay.

166
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,717
And then Peke,

167
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,220
who's super talented
on really good horses, and Paco.

168
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,555
Hello?

169
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,393
I got a phone call
from Ames' school.

170
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,104
My son just got pulled
into the principal's office.

171
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,982
Okay, what happened?

172
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,525
Ames is six years old.

173
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,778
Being a father is the best thing
that can happen.

174
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,155
I've been blessed with Ames.

175
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,823
Getting that call,

176
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,868
I was sad for my kid.

177
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,412
Sad that he's probably scared
he got pulled in that day

178
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,497
to the principal's office.

179
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,542
And you apologize to everybody.
You understand?

180
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,502
Bye. Bye, my son.

181
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,130
The fuck.

182
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,385
We fucking lost <i>and </i>my kid's misbehaving.

183
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,721
A little bit disappointed in myself.

184
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:44,060
I have spent a lot of time away
from my son during the U.S. Open.

185
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,979
If I made him
my number one priority this season,

186
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,023
maybe this is something
he would not have done.

187
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,450
I'm just so mad.

188
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,329
And Ames today, getting in trouble.
It's just…

189
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,583
I'm starting to think about whether
it's worth it. You know?

190
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
Yeah.

191
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,588
Polo can take a toll on your family.
There are times where it's difficult.

192
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,466
But the best you can do
is support the people you love

193
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,135
and hope that, you know, it all works out.

194
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,763
I'm tired of spending all this money.
I just can't win.

195
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,183
Like, forget today ever happened.

196
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,315
This is a good opportunity for you
to take a look at what's not working

197
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,610
and for you to make
the changes you need to make.

198
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,696
Because you're good at doing that.

199
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,241
It didn't go. Make a wish one more time.

200
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,994
- I love you, babe.
- Love you.

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,498
{\an8}

202
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,343
This lake looks pretty good.

203
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,723
When I'm too stressed
from the U.S. Open, I will go fishing.

204
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:09,061
{\an8}Teams with chemistry, you feel like
you're with your friends playing

205
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,524
{\an8}or having fun with your friends
all day long, playing in Coca-Cola.

206
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,861
{\an8}We did it at a moment,
then Negro went down,

207
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,613
{\an8}and Negro's thing was tough, I think.
It was really tough.

208
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,909
{\an8}So, I mean, everything changes.
So, it is a strange season, you know.

209
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,620
Fishing requires a lot of patience

210
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,082
and it's the only thing
I have patience for, it's fishing, so.

211
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,795
I play polo for a living.

212
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,173
Since I remember,

213
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,592
I was really good friends
with Poroto Cambiaso.

214
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,305
We played together
since probably we were six or seven

215
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,724
until we were 14 for sure.

216
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,977
{\an8}Won a couple
of very, uh, impressive tournaments.

217
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,314
Eighteen, yeah?
And he's already a six-goal player.

218
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,776
Two years ago, I was lucky to play
with Poroto and his dad.

219
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,322
With Poroto, it's amazing.
I mean, he's my age.

220
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:06,160
I don't know, from a year to another,
he made a huge jump. It's unreal.

221
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,789
As good as he is,
as young as he is, I'm wondering

222
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,750
if he doesn't put
added pressure on himself

223
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,045
to try to live up to Poroto too,
his friend, his buddy, you know?

224
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,132
Poroto's not really a fair comparison
because he's a freak of nature.

225
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,429
{\an8}- When do you play? Against?
 I don't know yet. With La Dolfina.

226
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,307
Oh. Tough team, yeah. They play amazing.

227
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:39,443
You always try to push yourself the most,
but you see yourself compared to the guys,

228
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,363
like Poroto, that are on the top now.

229
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,492
You're not far in a way, but really far
on some other ones, you know?

230
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,285
Those guys are improving every day

231
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,497
and they have a lot of help
with organization and everything.

232
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,583
So, I hope to be there.
I mean, I work for it every day.

233
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,712
It's what I dream,
but it's not really easy.

234
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,346
I really want to win
this competition.

235
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,308
I mean, to be 18, playing the U.S. Open,

236
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:17,314
and a team like Coca-Cola,
it's amazing. Really important for me.

237
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,027
Poroto is my friend
and I always respect him,

238
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,822
but to win, I need to beat La Dolfina.

239
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,285
In order to win this tournament,
I have to go through my friend, Poroto.

240
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,956
{\an8}

241
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,133
When I was born,
I was like a little bean.

242
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,343
That's why I'm Poroto.

243
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,765
When I was really, really young,
I knew I was going to be a polo player,

244
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,809
and I had the best teacher.

245
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,065
{\an8}It's not easy to be Poroto
because he had to deal with all the stress

246
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,359
{\an8}of being Adolfo's son.

247
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,363
The question was
if he was going to be able

248
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,115
to be as good as his father.

249
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,287
Adolfo Cambiaso was the youngest player
to ever go to 10 goals at age 19.

250
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,291
{\an8}Then his son comes along
and beat his dad's record right there

251
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,002
to be the youngest player
to ever achieve a 10-goal handicap.

252
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,421
One week after his 17th birthday.

253
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,924
That's mind-boggling.

254
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,136
This is Poroto's
18-year-old version of himself.

255
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,222
It's a better version
than Adolfo's 18-year-old version,

256
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:37,019
{\an8}which was at the time
beyond everybody's beliefs

257
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,355
what he could do
with the ball and his speed,

258
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,690
but in terms of gameplay,

259
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,735
Poroto is even better than his father.

260
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,862
- Are you the youngest 10-goaler?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,406
- In history? Can you tell me that?
- Mm.

262
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,827
I don't like to tell that.

263
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,708
{\an8}Poroto is today top three,
four players in the world, I think.

264
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,377
He's a kid,

265
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,505
but inside the field, you don't feel it.

266
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,927
I mean,
that fucking kid Poroto is unbelievable.

267
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,763
It's just unbelievable.
And Panelo is unbelievable.

268
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:18,435
La Dolfina and the youth on that team,
uh, you know, it's amazing.

269
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,774
{\an8}La Dolfina team is Poroto Cambiaso
and Tommy Panelo and Rufino Merlos.

270
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,068
{\an8}And then of course Alejandro Aznar.

271
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,030
{\an8}With the exception of Aznar,
I don't know if any of them can buy beer.

272
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,622
In this generation,
the speed, it's a whole different game.

273
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,374
Yes, there was passing before,

274
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,545
but the passing now
is just a whole nother level.

275
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,589
They are so in tune
with each other. They're not talking.

276
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,508
They're not calling. They just know.

277
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,553
I won the U.S. Open
once with my dad.

278
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,057
It was a really important moment for me.

279
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,644
It's a good opportunity to win
the most important tournament in America

280
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,854
without my dad.

281
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,693
- It's you playing in this tournament?
- Who?

282
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,652
- You?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,947
{\an8}- You're not playing on this team?
 No, on another team.

284
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,659
{\an8}- We lost the final against Poroto.
 Really?

285
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,829
- We beat him in the final before.
- Exactly.

286
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,876
In the 2024 Gauntlet of Polo,

287
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,546
{\an8}Adolfo won the C.V. Whitney.
Poroto won the Gold Cup.

288
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,467
{\an8}What really is special
about La Dolfina and Valiente

289
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,388
is that both those teams were
in our two finals leading up to the Open.

290
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
One on one. Let's see.

291
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,893
- We need to get there now.
- Yeah, right?

292
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>Action starting off heated</i>
<i>in the first two chukkers.</i>

293
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,653
<i>Both teams are looking for a way</i>
<i>to get out in front of the other.</i>

294
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,740
<i>Pieres, he's gonna leave it here</i>
<i>for Keko. Keko keeps it away.</i>

295
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,408
<i>No, gets it stolen away right here.</i>

296
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,744
You see how far they reach?

297
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,954
{\an8}Oh, yeah.
They're leaning all the way out.

298
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,790
{\an8}They lean all the way out.

299
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,291
Come on!

300
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,379
<i>Hey, I love it.</i>
<i>That one did get away from him.</i>

301
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,634
<i>Ooh, look. The two of them</i>
<i>having some words. I love it.</i>

302
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What's going on here?</i>

303
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,142
<i>We do see a yellow card</i>
<i>coming up here.</i>

304
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,355
<i>That can happen when</i>
<i>a dangerous and/or deliberate foul is made</i>

305
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,983
<i>going against Keko Magrini</i>
<i>on a dangerous use of the mallet.</i>

306
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,402
<i>This could be a devastating play</i>
<i>for Coca-Cola.</i>

307
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,822
Does anybody talk shit
to each other when they play?

308
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,864
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

309
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,537
Good question.

310
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,831
Do you talk shit
to your son when you're playing?

311
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,165
No, I try not to.

312
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,626
If I need
to put a bit of pressure, you do.

313
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,462
- Yeah, of course.
- It's funny, you switch it on and off.

314
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,965
You go from being the guy's best friend…

315
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,383
- To…
- …to…

316
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,010
calling him everything you can imagine.

317
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,930
A lot of times things can get dangerous

318
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,265
just that quick.

319
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,851
They don't mean for it to get dangerous.

320
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:09,273
And so it heightens your…
frustration, sensitivity, whatever.

321
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,274
It makes sense.

322
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,609
<i>Poroto</i>
<i>will take this attempt.</i>

323
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,613
<i>I think their second</i>
<i>goal shot penalty of the day. Cambiaso…</i>

324
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,951
<i>Oh, off the post.</i>

325
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,787
<i>A goal right here.</i>

326
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,831
<i>Aznar,</i>
<i>able to pick that one up.</i>

327
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,961
{\an8}<i>Coca-Cola here playing</i>
<i>catch up in the second half</i>

328
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,631
<i>against the best team</i>
<i>in the gauntlet thus far.</i>

329
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,551
Son of a bitch.

330
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,595
{\an8}

331
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,641
{\an8}What a shame.
A good half, except for the end.

332
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,936
<i>Keko's</i>
<i>having trouble finding his stride</i>

333
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,022
<i>in this game against this La Dolfina team.</i>

334
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:55,319
Keko, I don't care if you get
a yellow card, but turn it around.

335
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,737
You started very well.

336
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,823
<i>Hopefully he'll</i>
<i>do better in the second half.</i>

337
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,366
<i>The ball's back in play.</i>

338
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,744
<i>Keko, he connects to the center</i>

339
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:08,248
<i>where he finds Ruiz</i>
<i>who's still on, uh, Coppa Field.</i>

340
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>Oh. Oh! Somebody's gonna be wrong here.</i>

341
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,004
<i>The play's under review</i>
<i>for a yellow card here,</i>

342
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,965
<i>which would be devastating</i>
<i>for Coca-Cola if they do,</i>

343
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,509
<i>because that'd make</i>
<i>Keko have to sit for two minutes,</i>

344
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,637
<i>ah, if they gave him a yellow.</i>

345
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,599
<i>Keko will sit</i>
<i>for two minutes</i>

346
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>picking up his second yellow card</i>
<i>of the contest.</i>

347
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,686
<i>That is devastating.</i>

348
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,480
<i>Coke managed to claw their way back,</i>

349
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,607
<i>and then Keko picks up</i>
<i>his second yellow card,</i>

350
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,901
<i>forcing his team to play a man down.</i>

351
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:40,364
It's a lot of emotions,
and you're really high up

352
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,032
and so much intensity

353
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,953
and everything that it's hard
for nothing to happen, you know?

354
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>Penalty two put on through</i>
<i>by Panelo.</i>

355
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,625
{\an8}<i>Breaks a tie, takes back the lead</i>
<i>to make the score 11-10.</i>

356
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,710
{\an8}<i>Coke's got some work to do right here.</i>

357
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,296
{\an8}<i>Keko will be sitting</i>
<i>the remainder of this chukker,</i>

358
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,175
<i>and I believe 26 seconds</i>
<i>of the sixth chukker as well.</i>

359
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,969
Shit.

360
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,807
They're calling me
for everything.

361
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,688
When it's four players
against three, it's a lot.

362
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,733
It's that you're more mad at yourself
that you're letting your team down.

363
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,194
<i>Polito's gonna</i>
<i>take it back to the inside,</i>

364
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,613
<i>trying to burn up the time</i>
<i>as much as they can.</i>

365
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,157
<i>And still put one on the board here.</i>

366
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,661
<i>Polito, his shot is</i>
<i>over the back line. Wide.</i>

367
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,746
<i>We got a whistle sounding.</i>

368
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>Looks like we're gonna get</i>
<i>a penalty two for Coca-Cola.</i>

369
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,960
- Listen, that's what we needed right now.
- No, I know.

370
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:40,048
<i>Getting some offense going</i>
<i>with just three players on the field.</i>

371
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,218
<i>Polito sends it on through.</i>

372
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,888
{\an8}<i>Wow, look at this. Three on four,</i>
<i>and they're able to pick up a point</i>

373
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,724
{\an8}<i>as Keko is stuck in the penalty box.</i>

374
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,892
{\an8}<i>Polito Pieres,</i>
<i>the captain of the Coca-Cola team,</i>

375
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,562
<i>is able to tie up the game,</i>
<i>11 goals apiece on the board,</i>

376
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,397
<i>going into chukker number six.</i>

377
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,859
Now we need to really just
make our comeback, like, big,

378
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,111
so we can have a good day.

379
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,947
It was a good chukker.
Come on, let's go.

380
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,407
One more. One more.

381
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>We've got Keko</i>
<i>back out on the field.</i>

382
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,290
<i>Coming in hot, it'll be Keko</i>
<i>to try to get to him. Look at this.</i>

383
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,250
{\an8}<i>Panelo, got it!</i>

384
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,296
{\an8}<i>These young guns are changing the game</i>
<i>right before our very eyes.</i>

385
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,758
Many times the games
get decided on the last five minutes,

386
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,010
and you cannot relax for a second.

387
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,511
<i>This kid is good.</i>

388
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>Look at that, in the red zone,</i>
<i>Poroto Cambiaso!</i>

389
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,851
{\an8}<i>Huge goal to go up two</i>
<i>with a couple minutes left.</i>

390
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,394
{\an8}<i>Plenty of time for Coke.</i>

391
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,358
<i>Rufi, coming in, it's gonna</i>
<i>be Poroto on the near side here.</i>

392
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:43,028
<i>Can he get away from…</i>
<i>Now Keko picks it up again, Keko.</i>

393
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,363
<i>You don't have enough time.</i>

394
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,823
<i>Oh my goodness,</i>
<i>Keko let that one get away from him.</i>

395
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:52,704
<i>No way, oh my goodness, all right.</i>
<i>The wheels just fell off here for Coke.</i>

396
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,584
{\an8}<i>Two quick goals by La Dolfina,</i>
<i>and then Rufi picks up this third one</i>

397
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,045
<i>to maybe just put it</i>
<i>out of reach right here.</i>

398
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,463
{\an8}- Game over?
 Yeah.

399
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,757
{\an8}<i>Red zone here, yes, he does!</i>

400
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,009
{\an8}<i>Oh my goodness,</i>
<i>tough break there for Keko.</i>

401
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,805
{\an8}<i>I think so, that might</i>
<i>just get it done here for La Dolfina.</i>

402
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,265
{\an8}<i>Keko can't keep control. A big one there.</i>

403
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,478
{\an8}<i>It is all but over here.</i>
<i>What a tough loss for Coca-Cola.</i>

404
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,482
{\an8}<i>What a game. La Dolfina team</i>
<i>continues to set the pace.</i>

405
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,609
{\an8}<i>Big win here against Coca-Cola.</i>

406
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,986
Keko is very young. Uh…

407
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,988
He needs to work

408
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,451
{\an8}to play more with the men
and not too much with the ball.

409
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,121
I think the young kids nowadays,

410
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,792
they see Poroto Cambiaso,
and I think it's not good for polo.

411
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,380
Because they are something different.
It's not going to help their polo.

412
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,758
Keko is a fantastic handler
of the ball.

413
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,470
He's the guy that you want
normally to have the ball on your team

414
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,471
{\an8}to go to goal,

415
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,433
{\an8}unless you have
Polito Pieres on your team.

416
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,978
You can hold him up against Poroto,
Adolfo, against any other player.

417
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,397
He's right there with them in those terms.

418
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,611
So I think it's very difficult for Keko
to find his place really on that team.

419
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,660
<i>With that win, La Dolfina</i>
<i>will move to the top of the standings</i>

420
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,079
<i>while Coca-Cola sinks to an 0-2 record.</i>

421
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,292
It's a game that must be won.

422
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,918
They were playing for everything.

423
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,713
It was a difficult game for us.

424
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,007
I think we were a bit nervous,
especially me.

425
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,970
But, in the last chukker, I forgot
all the things that I was thinking,

426
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,808
and we all played good as a team,
and I think that's why we won.

427
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,020
Poroto, he's the future.

428
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,980
You're against him,
but you're happy for him.

429
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,274
- I've been with him since he…
- Since he was little.

430
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,151
- He's like my son.
- That's so cool.

431
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,904
Valiente and La Dolfina
are different teams,

432
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,989
but they're the same organization.

433
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,700
They are sister organizations, basically.

434
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,243
Under the same umbrella.

435
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,539
So they're coming out of the same barn,
but they're like this, you know?

436
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,541
Congratulations, Poroto.

437
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,542
Thanks!

438
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,254
Bob is like a second father.

439
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:11,468
Poroto's been playing a lot
of Bob's horses through all his career.

440
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,678
Everything we do is together.

441
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,640
Adolfo and Poroto,
these sister organizations,

442
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,475
they both have won a tournament.

443
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,853
They want to play each other, and I'm sure
they want to do it in the finals,

444
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,649
but in order to do that, they have to play
well enough to get to the semifinals

445
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,526
to have a chance
to play against each other.

446
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,154
That's not guaranteed at this point
because we've got a lot of good teams.

447
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,157
I want to win against my dad

448
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,537
so I can say that I beat
the greatest of the sport.

449
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,832
I felt the things were not going
really good my way.

450
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,544
I was just probably mad at myself
more than anything.

451
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,921
I played not good.

452
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,468
I think now it's more stressful
because of the future.

453
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,430
{\an8}These players really
have to work hard to make a living.

454
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,060
They're bouncing around and they're always
trying to stay competitive,

455
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,853
trying to increase their skill

456
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,523
as to whether or not
they'll be picked up by a team.

457
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,151
So, if you have a bad year,

458
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,029
it can have
a detrimental effect on your career.

459
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,493
There's a lot of competition.
Everybody is fighting for themselves

460
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,870
to get a job, to improve.

461
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,414
It's a tough sport.

462
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,636
Hi!

463
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,430
Hi, guys. How are you

464
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,599
Are you gonna go over yonder later?

465
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,351
They'll come to the gallery.
My boyfriend's on his way.

466
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,020
So you have to come tonight.

467
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,857
During the winter season,
Wellington is really fun.

468
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,444
And there's always
something to do with your friends.

469
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,537
Keko is eat,
sleep, breathe polo.

470
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,081
It's his life,
it's his career, it's everything.

471
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,001
Mentally, you need a way to de-stress.

472
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,797
I try to, like, help him go out
and, like, not think about polo

473
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,591
for, like, an hour or two hours.

474
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,930
Oh, boy.

475
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,727
{\an8}

476
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,772
Pretend that you like me, okay.

477
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,857
But you know I do. Don't say pretend.

478
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,443
You know what I want to know?

479
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,112
How do you guys stay friends
when you compete with each other?

480
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,865
Like, everybody changes inside the field.

481
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,159
You're really mean when playing.
Screaming…

482
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,535
He's mean. He bullies me.

483
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,163
The things you say,
do you just get off the horse

484
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,831
and forget about all of it.

485
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,626
- There's never bad blood.
- If only girls could be like that.

486
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,253
You say one thing and then it's just gone.

487
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,715
It's really fun when we all go out.

488
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,176
The polo boys,
they're all friends with each other.

489
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,931
They all know each other.
Keko definitely has a large friend group.

490
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,400
The U.S. Open is
the most important tournament in the U.S.

491
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,652
that he plays, so it's intense.

492
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,406
I can see him relax,
have fun with his friends,

493
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,366
and have fun with me and my friends.

494
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,742
It's really nice for him.

495
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,497
But a night out in Wellington
is pretty short-lived.

496
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,420
It's very in-the-moment fun,

497
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,048
but then right back to work
for Keko the next day.

498
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,139
Son, you ready?

499
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,350
The helicopter?

500
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,644
Yeah, we're gonna go
pick up Yaya and Papu.

501
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,441
Pam's father can't sit in a car
for a long, extended period of time.

502
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,277
He's 86 years old

503
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,613
and had really serious cancer.

504
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,783
Have you ever been
on a helicopter like that?

505
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,868
Yes.

506
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:10,165
I've been watching Pam struggle
with the thought of not seeing her dad.

507
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,541
And it's a killer.

508
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,962
My dad and I are super close.
We have been my whole life.

509
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,673
My parents have come
to a few matches over the years,

510
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,842
and they always enjoy their time here.

511
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,637
But because of his health,
my dad hasn't been able to attend lately.

512
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,556
So it's really amazing

513
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,976
to get my dad out and get him
socializing with people I love.

514
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,812
Look at that.
That's where we're gonna play later today.

515
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,230
How cool is that?

516
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,191
- So cool.
- Yeah.

517
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,486
I lost my dad
and still to this day, it's tough for me.

518
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,073
So I just felt it was nice for Pam
to be able to watch a Sunday game

519
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,785
with her father, um, and her mother.

520
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,293
{\an8}
I have to give you chocolate cake.

521
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,003
{\an8}- Is that cool?
 Yeah.

522
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,630
{\an8}Louis, how you doing, pal?

523
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,632
{\an8}- Mr. Flanagan, how are you?
 Want milk?

524
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,134
{\an8}- Everything good?
 A little better every day.

525
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,261
{\an8}- You're looking good.
 Yeah, I feel fine.

526
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,013
Louis,
you want a cup of coffee?

527
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,890
I would love a cup, Yaya. Thank you.

528
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,184
But you don't get
any chocolate cake.

529
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,310
Thank you for that too.

530
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,522
My mother told me
two days ago I was fat. So…

531
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,106
Oh, boy.

532
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,569
- This is nice, huh?
- It is nice.

533
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,737
How's he doing?

534
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,032
You know what?
He's got good days. He's got bad days.

535
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,036
You went through it.
You know what that's about.

536
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,581
- It's not a good time in your life.
- No, it's not.

537
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,543
- Yeah.
- It is what it is.

538
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,461
I know I don't see Pam a lot.

539
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,630
How's the pregnancy?
You know better than I.

540
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,300
Uh… Really… hormonal.

541
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,054
There's days where
I gotta leave the house.

542
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,933
What is wrong with you?
You don't understand women.

543
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,103
- I'm very patient.
- I know how you are.

544
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,856
She gets on a roll and then you walk out
and go in the gym

545
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,818
or you're going skydiving
or you're going to the polo field. Escape.

546
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,697
You can't do that
when someone is pregnant.

547
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,867
You just have to be there
and just shut up.

548
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,411
Just shut up and just be there.

549
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,204
- Okay.
- Anyway.

550
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,540
We gotta go. Let's go.

551
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,209
- Pour out your coffee.
- I already drank my coffee.

552
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,544
My mother-in-law…

553
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,880
My mother-in-law.

554
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,883
She's fucking nuts.
She's absolutely crazy.

555
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,800
You good?

556
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,014
She is the only one
that can really speak to me.

557
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,099
So she tells me to go fuck myself.

558
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,727
She tells me
to stop being a fucking idiot. Um…

559
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,730
She's a pain in my ass sometimes,
but I do appreciate it.

560
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,815
I appreciate everything that woman does.

561
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,943
- Louis, Louis, Louis.
- Hi, Yaya.

562
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,863
Very cool.

563
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,915
My dad used to have
his pilot's license.

564
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,291
He loves planes, helicopters.

565
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,418
I think it was a lovely gesture

566
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,254
to go and pick up my parents
and bring them to the game.

567
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,131
Any moment I get with my dad is special.

568
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,257
Smile.

569
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,217
All righty.

570
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,771
We lost to Valiente.
We're playing against Tamera.

571
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,149
If we lose now, the whole season is over.
Just like that.

572
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,361
This is the bet
that I placed this morning.

573
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,445
What?

574
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,740
- I put my house on this game. Yes.
- You put your house on this game?

575
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,161
This is the most important game
of the season.

576
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,246
The most important tournament for us.

577
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,710
We go into this game prepared,
ready to go.

578
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,004
It's do-or-die.

579
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,302
<i>We're a couple rounds into</i>
<i>the U.S. Open Championship Tournament,</i>

580
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,348
{\an8}<i>our grand finale,</i>
<i>and the final leg of the gauntlet here.</i>

581
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,184
<i>And La Fe</i>
<i>is coming off of a loss</i>

582
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,229
<i>against the Valiente 12-7 on Tuesday.</i>

583
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,274
<i>Tamera, they lost their</i>
<i>top scorer, Diego Cavanagh, to an injury.</i>

584
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,777
<i>So a different team</i>
<i>than we've seen normally.</i>

585
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,613
Tamera,
their nine-goal player got hurt.

586
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,824
So they changed the team around.

587
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,119
We're gonna be
better off playing against this team

588
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,745
because the team is not as strong.

589
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,499
<i>The umpires</i>
<i>have called the teams</i>

590
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,918
<i>looking to get this match underway.</i>

591
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,003
Okay.

592
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,380
<i>Chukker one off and working.</i>

593
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,091
<i>Looks like it's gonna be</i>
<i>one here by Zavaleta.</i>

594
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,302
<i>Now, Matias takes off running</i>
<i>towards the goal right here.</i>

595
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,722
<i>All they can do is hope he misses.</i>
<i>He's in the red zone.</i>

596
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,182
{\an8}<i>Mati is gonna draw first blood on the day.</i>

597
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,978
{\an8}<i>A shot back down the field from Matias.</i>
<i>Back up there looking for Mackey.</i>

598
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,231
<i>And look at this.</i>
<i>Two in a row. Bam, bam.</i>

599
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,234
{\an8}<i>Score two goals.</i>
<i>Goes straight to the ball, takes it away.</i>

600
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,402
{\an8}<i>Going to the goal.</i>

601
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,738
Oh my God. Come on, would ya!

602
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,655
No one is there.

603
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,616
<i>Beautiful goal. 3-0.</i>

604
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,827
{\an8}<i>Tamera is cooking.</i>

605
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,495
{\an8}<i>Uh-oh. Uh-oh.</i>

606
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,583
<i>Look at this. It's gonna be a goal</i>
<i>right here. Elizalde's not gonna miss.</i>

607
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:07,295
<i>He's on a breakaway.</i>
<i>And we've got a 3-2 score on the board.</i>

608
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,338
{\an8}<i>Great way to finish a chukker for La Fe.</i>

609
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,633
{\an8}<i>They didn't start well,</i>
<i>but they're back in the game.</i>

610
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,635
{\an8}<i>They're back in the game. All right.</i>

611
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,680
{\an8}- You've got snacks in your purse.
 What do you want me to do?

612
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,766
Not steal snacks from the buffet.

613
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,185
- Oh, shut up.
- She has lost her mind.

614
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,522
<i>Bilbao takes a shot</i>
<i>from about 80 yards out.</i>

615
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,691
<i>It's going, going, going.</i>

616
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,985
<i>Devaleix is there. Devaleix shoots.</i>

617
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,947
<i>But I heard a whistle.</i>
<i>No goal scored there.</i>

618
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,451
<i>Most common foul,</i>
<i>a defender cannot come across</i>

619
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,954
<i>that right-of-way or the line of the ball</i>
<i>and make a play on the ball.</i>

620
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,664
- Wait, so it doesn't count?
- No.

621
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,166
<i>Here it comes.</i>

622
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,210
<i>Up to Louis.</i>

623
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,796
- Louis needs to come up.
- Come on.

624
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,173
Come on!

625
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,134
Come on, boy!

626
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,178
- Come on, Louis!
- <i>Louis!</i>

627
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,348
<i>Louis Devaleix! Oh.</i>

628
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,891
He didn't do it?

629
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,020
I think I'm gonna give Louis
a backhand for missing that one.

630
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,438
It's very difficult.

631
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,149
- He's going 30 miles an hour.
- So what?

632
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,030
{\an8}<i>That will end</i>
<i>the first half, tied at six goals apiece.</i>

633
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,575
<i>We're gonna invite you out there</i>
<i>to walk back a few divots.</i>

634
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,828
Going into to this game, I'm feeling

635
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,247
like we're gonna fucking… kill them.

636
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,960
We completely underestimated
what Tamera ended up bringing.

637
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,294
Fuck.

638
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,007
<i>The field's clear.</i>
<i>It's ready for you all fine folks</i>

639
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,093
<i>to get out there</i>
<i>and stomp those divots back.</i>

640
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:41,097
<i>Don't forget to grab</i>
<i>a glass of bubbly on your way out there.</i>

641
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,016
A halftime divot stomp,
a very old tradition.

642
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,893
Middle of the game,

643
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,687
the crowd comes out,

644
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,398
everybody goes onto the field,
and you stomp the divots

645
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,067
to ensure that the field is nice and flat
for the second half.

646
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,528
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

647
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,988
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

648
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,075
You get to see the outfits,
the colors, all of the people,

649
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,577
the kids running around.

650
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,038
Then all the people come back in,
and the game resumes.

651
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,207
- How about, "We're off to see the wizard"?
- No.

652
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,585
♪ <i>We're off to see the wizard</i>
<i>The wonderful wiz--</i>♪

653
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,712
I'm pregnant. Stop jerking me around.

654
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,089
You watch every one
of Louis' games?

655
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,258
Yeah. Well, he can do better.

656
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,718
- He could do better?
- Yeah.

657
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,844
What is he doing wrong?

658
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,805
Why don't you explain
what you think we should go tell Louis?

659
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,349
He should hit the ball straighter
is what I think.

660
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,434
Do you know polo?

661
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,020
I don't care. It's a stick,
and you hit a ball.

662
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,940
No fouls. Let's go! Come on.

663
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,151
<i>The players coming back out.</i>

664
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,236
<i>- Here we go.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Here we go.</i>

665
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,447
<i>This is an important chukker</i>
<i>for both teams.</i>

666
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,824
<i>It's not the chukker</i>
<i>when you want to do mistakes.</i>

667
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,867
<i>Yeah.</i>

668
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,286
<i>So this is a big moment right now</i>
<i>for La Fe.</i>

669
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,289
<i>If they can get something</i>
<i>on this drive right now.</i>

670
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,416
<i>Look at this. Look at this.</i>

671
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,960
<i>If they score here,</i>
<i>this could be a huge play.</i>

672
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,922
<i>Matias Torres right now goes to the ball.</i>

673
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,216
<i>Goes to the goal. Picks it up nicely.</i>

674
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,842
<i>Zavaleta.</i>

675
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,053
<i>Uh-oh…</i>

676
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,223
<i>Louis, that might be a big mistake here.</i>

677
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,182
<i>Penalty two.</i>

678
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,475
Oh, my Lord.

679
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,478
<i>Penalty two is</i>
<i>your second most severe penalty.</i>

680
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,521
<i>Thirty-yard undefended shot on goal.</i>

681
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,441
<i>Make it or miss it.</i>
<i>The attacking team is gonna get one swing.</i>

682
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,610
<i>Mackey.</i>

683
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,029
{\an8}<i>Sends it on through.</i>

684
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:23,074
{\an8}<i>Picks up the point</i>
<i>and gives his team a two-goal lead.</i>

685
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,160
Come on, man. Just sock it to them.

686
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,955
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>Here, Elizalde.</i>

687
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:33,668
{\an8}<i>Takes a shot at the goal. It's off.</i>
<i>Oh, he got it! We got a ball game now.</i>

688
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,295
{\an8}<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>a really good end of the game.</i>

689
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,257
<i>That was a huge goal.</i>
<i>Elizalde jumps back.</i>

690
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,634
<i>One goal ball game,</i>
<i>one minute left.</i>

691
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,302
We need to make the next goal.

692
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,388
<i>It sure is close.</i>
<i>Here it comes.</i>

693
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,975
<i>Now Bilbao's got possession,</i>
<i>gives it off to Diaz Alberdi.</i>

694
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,685
<i>He's hooked on the play.</i>

695
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,853
<i>- And the whistle.</i>
- What just happened?

696
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,481
<i>Diaz, an unscheduled dismount.</i>

697
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,984
<i>I think they got that pony</i>
<i>collected over there</i>

698
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,404
<i>and our expert medical staff</i>
<i>on the scene immediately here.</i>

699
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,780
<i>One-goal ball game.</i>

700
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,075
<i>Well, this is right down</i>
<i>to the wire.</i>

701
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,619
<i>So Diaz Alberdi back on his feet.</i>

702
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,540
<i>Foul against Tamera.</i>
<i>Getting a yellow card.</i>

703
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,333
<i>The yellow card.</i>

704
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,170
<i>The goal goes in favor of La Fe.</i>

705
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,925
{\an8}<i>Automatic goal for La Fe.</i>
<i>We're back to a tied ball game.</i>

706
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>The bell,</i>
<i>and that will end regulation time.</i>

707
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,142
<i>We're gonna have overtime!</i>

708
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,937
<i>The first team to score will win.</i>

709
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,400
All right, Mom, here we go.
Our energy is coming back.

710
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,152
<i>Ball's back into play.</i>

711
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:45,614
<i>Lucas Alberdi. Oh, he drops it there.</i>
<i>Elizalde feeds it right back up to him.</i>

712
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,118
<i>He's gonna jump on it right here</i>
<i>and takes a shot at goal.</i>

713
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,536
<i>That is…</i>

714
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,123
<i>…over the backline wide.</i>

715
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,167
Oh, my Lord.

716
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,294
<i>La Fe narrowly</i>
<i>missing the goal.</i>

717
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,672
<i>Well done.</i>
<i>Palma comes in there, broke up the play.</i>

718
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,467
<i>Robi back on it. They're inside the 60.</i>

719
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,305
<i>Lucas Alberdi shoots at the goal.</i>
<i>It's gonna be wide.</i>

720
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,891
Come on. Oh, Lordy me.

721
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,810
<i>Torres Zavaleta breaks the goal.</i>

722
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,355
<i>Torres-Avoleta. Torres-Avoleta.</i>

723
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,898
- Shit.
<i>- </i><i>Tamera!</i>

724
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,692
<i>Tamera, the victors. What a match.</i>

725
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,447
{\an8}<i>What a game. Let's hear it for both teams,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

726
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,742
It all happened so fast.
We're like, "What the fuck is going on?"

727
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,412
I'm glad we're not going home with you.

728
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,122
I'll go home with you guys.

729
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,170
We went into this game
way too confident. It fucked us.

730
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:46,092
We're going back to the Keys
because I know how Louis feels.

731
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,804
We were gonna spend the night,
and I'm going… "Not a good idea."

732
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,725
Oh my God, you have churros in your purse.

733
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,356
Hasta la vista, baby.

734
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,649
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

735
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,287
After that game with Tamera,
my mother said my dad would be proud.

736
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,582
My father was an amazing man, but tough.

737
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,669
Losing was never an option,

738
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,923
but in the end, he was always there
to make me feel better.

739
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,718
I wish he was still here.

740
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,643
<i>With the 12-11 win</i>
<i>by Tamera over La Fe,</i>

741
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,856
{\an8}<i>La Fe is now out of contention</i>
<i>for this year's U.S. Open.</i>

742
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,234
Sorry, Mama.

743
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,236
He puts a lot of thought
and effort,

744
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,072
and so this isn't gonna go away for him.

745
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,451
This loss will be in the back of his head
for the next six months.

746
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,787
What went wrong, why it went wrong,
what they can do better,

747
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,832
that doesn't go away.
That stays with you, stays with him.

748
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,793
I'm gonna count.
Touch the post and come back.

749
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,004
On your mark, get set, go! One…

750
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:09,800
And it's used as fuel and motivation
to help build and learn from.

751
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,218
Okay, high five.

752
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,980
{\an8}Had my worst game.

753
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,026
Every play, you know,
from the fucking beginning.

754
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,700
I feel like I'm complete… fucking garbage.

755
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,955
Well, because you feel like
you let your whole team down,

756
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,209
and it's not just the three guys,
you're letting your wife down.

757
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,212
- Even though she's there to pick you up.
- I'm sorry, honey.

758
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,214
I'm tired of losing.

759
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:52,551
Winning would have shown everyone
it wasn't a waste of their time.

760
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,515
- I'm going to the house. Meet you there.
- Yeah.

761
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,643
I'll get treats for the horses,
say good night, then go.

762
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,727
Okay.

763
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,314
- Love you. Bye, sweetheart.
- I'll see you at home.

764
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,165
Good night, guys.

765
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,336
I'm so mad.

766
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,843
Fuck.

767
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,848
He's being really, really hard on himself.

768
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,060
I just can't fucking win.

769
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,271
But it's more
than just winning and losing.

770
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:51,402
I think there's time for appreciating
the other parts of the sport, like this.

771
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,491
I wish he could get joy
out of these moments.

772
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,376
I'm fucking tired, man.
