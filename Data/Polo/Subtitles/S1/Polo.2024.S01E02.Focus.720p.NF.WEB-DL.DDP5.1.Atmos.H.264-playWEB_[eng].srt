1
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,385
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>The U.S. Open is underway.</i>

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>And we have Dutta Corp</i>
<i>taking on Park Place.</i>

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,349
We decided Timmy's gonna play number one.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,351
<i>Ball's put back into play.</i>

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>Gonna be picked up here by Timmy.</i>

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,150
Here we go. There we go. Come on!

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,737
<i>Going to the goal,</i>
<i>he's got nothing between him and the goal.</i>

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,946
<i>Can he get it done?</i>

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,823
<i>Dutta in the red zone.</i>

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,741
<i>Timmy Dutta.</i>

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>Oh no, it got away from him!</i>

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,915
<i>Oh man, Dutta Corp</i>
<i>really could have used that goal.</i>

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,126
Hit the ball!

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>Let's hope their luck changes</i>
<i>after that one.</i>

15
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,260
- Come on, guys.
- Jesus.

16
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,470
Timmy!

17
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,471
Change!

18
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,389
Yeah, I can hear him.

19
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,142
Why do you stay away from him?

20
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,644
Because I don't like
to hear him criticize Timmy.

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,105
Stop fucking around.

22
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,233
Hit the ball, Timmy. Hit the fucking ball.

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,444
I should be used to it by now.

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,863
<i>It's been an exciting game so far,</i>

25
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,616
<i>and Dutta Corp has held their own</i>
<i>against Park Place.</i>

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,078
{\an8}<i>And now, starting the third chukker,</i>
<i>the score is two to two.</i>

27
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,038
{\an8}

28
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,249
<i>Now, ball's put back into play.</i>

29
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,004
<i>Now, gonna be picked up again here</i>
<i>by Juan Britos.</i>

30
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,297
<i>Britos, going to the goal.</i>

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>Once these guys get hot,</i>
<i>they get lava hot.</i>

32
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,384
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

33
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,223
{\an8}Come on guys, enough!

34
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,851
Unbelievable.

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>What a goal. Important timing too.</i>

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>Dutta Corp really needs to score here.</i>

37
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>If you give Park Place too big of a lead,</i>
<i>you're never gonna catch them.</i>

38
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>Here comes Timmy Dutta.</i>

39
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,787
<i>Busting out of there, on a rocket ship.</i>

40
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>He is cooking down the field.</i>

41
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,291
<i>Can he make it happen?</i>
<i>From left to right.</i>

42
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,377
<i>Dutta cuts the ball back at the goal…</i>

43
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>Just wide over the back line.</i>
<i>You gotta make that count.</i>

44
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,635
<i>Really a tough break there for Dutta.</i>

45
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,896
<i>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like</i>
<i>they're gonna be able to best Park Place</i>

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,232
<i>here in this first game of the U.S. Open.</i>

47
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,071
{\an8}Tough loss.

48
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,574
{\an8}Definitely for us and, you know…

49
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,622
My first game with this switch
with me in number one position.

50
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,585
I really needed the… the few chukkers
to get back in rhythm.

51
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,254
Good job, baby girl. You tried.

52
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,803
My dad doesn't get after me
from, like, a son perspective.

53
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,805
He gets after me
from, like, a player perspective.

54
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,433
He demands nothing but the best.

55
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,810
"Here's your chance.
Now get the job done."

56
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm always grateful
for the opportunities that he gives me.

57
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,983
What I see,
what I feel, is what he hears.

58
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,903
{\an8}Sometimes Susie feels that's too direct,
but so be it.

59
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,198
You know, he has big goals,
and we have big expectations together.

60
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,493
So every day, we have to move forward.
Otherwise, you're not going to get there.

61
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,249
We play Clearwater on Sunday.

62
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,169
{\an8}Probably the most important game
for us the entire season.

63
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,338
{\an8}We already lost against Park Place.

64
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,715
Have to win this game no matter what.

65
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,053
To play
the United States Open Championships,

66
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,138
it's an honor, and it's a dream.

67
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,807
Right now, we are trying to win our first.

68
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,978
What's going on?
His chica's coming into town?

69
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,938
News to me.

70
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,981
Think they're coming?

71
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,568
Timmy is extremely charming,
and his looks are what they are.

72
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,195
He doesn't have to worry about girls.

73
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,112
Score the goals!

74
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,741
Unfortunately, these girls take
a lot of time out of you.

75
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,370
They don't understand that you've got
to focus, and it's a distraction.

76
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,040
- I hope he's focused on Sunday.
- Yeah, he will.

77
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,297
{\an8}

78
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,557
{\an8}Good.

79
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,060
{\an8}

80
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,312
Okay, here we go.
Let's go with that arm.

81
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,398
{\an8}

82
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,192
María now!

83
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,404
- It's forward back, forward back.
- Forward, back.

84
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,822
And come here and pass here.

85
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,200
{\an8}
I'm trying like fucking hell.

86
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,245
They make me work hard.

87
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,663
Very hard.

88
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,832
Who works harder?

89
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,292
- Me.
- Me.

90
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,876
No. No.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,712
Me. 49.

92
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,339
- Professor, tell them the truth.
- No.

93
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,508
- Who's the best of all three?
- Me.

94
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,677
I do the same as her.

95
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,887
- Shut up!
- In the gym and then I play.

96
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,973
- No!
- When she's drinking coffee.

97
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,351
<i>Sí, </i>and then who goes
to the supermarket and feeds you?

98
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,936
Me. So I won.

99
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm telling you.

100
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,483
We love to train together.
So usually we all do it at the same time.

101
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,277
I mean, fucking hell.

102
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,530
The U.S. Open is one
of the most important

103
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,698
tournaments in the world.

104
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,285
Anybody that is in this sport
wants to win the U.S. Open.

105
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,913
My family, I have two candidates for that.

106
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,500
Poroto and Adolfo.

107
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,587
They're not playing on the same team,
which is hard for the family

108
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,214
because they may have to play
against each other.

109
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,675
I'm dying.

110
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,678
- Coach…
- What happened?

111
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,847
You guys, look.

112
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,726
Look at the difference, yeah?

113
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,979
Poroto really wants this tournament, um,

114
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,398
but the thing is Adolfo wants it too.

115
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,152
You know, my husband,
even though he's doing amazing,

116
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,029
he's in the retirement process.

117
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,075
I'm trying to be as competitive
as I can in the next year or so.

118
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,327
So I think one more,
it would be great for him.

119
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,080
Adolfo is very competitive.

120
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,500
Winning is in his DNA.

121
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,502
And he's the best of the best.

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,962
Good.

123
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,924
Yeah, let's go.

124
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,721
People say that you're the greatest
of all time. Do you agree with that?

125
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,225
I feel like there is always,
<i>always </i>somebody better than me.

126
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,520
Always. But I love competing.

127
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,107
Always, every day, I try to be better.

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,820
For me, to win, yes, beautiful day.

129
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,031
But the following day, you start
working to win the next tournament.

130
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,868
My father was a surfer.

131
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,703
Nothing to do with polo.

132
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,040
My mother was, uh,
just a weekend polo fan.

133
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,296
My first job as a professional polo player
was when I was 14.

134
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,635
I was getting paid by my father
with a motorbike, so it was kind of fun.

135
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:15,893
My friends were going out on Saturdays,
having life like a normal kid does.

136
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,938
Then I was competing,
going around the world.

137
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,898
I was alone, too young.

138
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,442
It was tough in one moment.

139
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,486
{\an8}I was very lucky

140
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:31,075
to meet, uh, María, my wife,
when I was… 19 years old.

141
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,913
I met my husband
on the cover of a magazine.

142
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:40,460
He was, like,
they chose him as the best polo player

143
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,836
and me as the best model.

144
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,755
I didn't know, he was so good-looking,
so I just fell in love.

145
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,883
I didn't care what he was doing, so.

146
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,932
So now, polo is everything
in our family and even for my children.

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,730
In 2005,
it was a really big moment for me.

148
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,860
{\an8}My husband was playing
one of the final games

149
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,196
of the Open in Argentina.

150
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,573
María was with her belly like that.

151
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,450
The doctor called him.

152
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,119
I was in the middle of the game.

153
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,165
I was on the horse like that.
María is about to give birth.

154
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,293
Adolfo's partners were asking him,

155
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,421
"Please don't leave. If you leave,
maybe we're gonna lose."

156
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,092
I left right away with the boots
and the whites and everything.

157
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,347
That year, Poroto came to life.

158
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,770
When Poroto was 12 years old,
I was already… 42.

159
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,649
I was nearly to retire.
My back was really hurting me.

160
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,362
But I would see Poroto grow
as a polo player really fast.

161
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,613
So I said,

162
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,699
"I need to play with him one day.
Why not?"

163
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,994
It was the Gold Cup, we won.

164
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,789
A U.S. Open. We did it, we won.

165
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,542
Then we said,
"We gotta play the Argentine Open."

166
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,293
<i>Adolfo.</i>

167
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,170
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso again.</i>

168
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,588
And we did it. And we won.

169
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,299
I couldn't believe
what we achieved together.

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,927
{\an8}We played together,
we won everything together.

171
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,554
Now we're playing against each other.

172
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,020
La Dolfina.

173
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:27,066
I think it's the best team right now.
These guys are good. They're playing well.

174
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,407
I'm playing La Dolfina.
My dad is playing Valiente.

175
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,660
How does it feel
to play against your son?

176
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,078
Uh, it's not comfortable.

177
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,123
But it's all right.

178
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,542
You gotta get used to it,
but it's not easy.

179
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,213
I'm really close with my dad.
We have a really good relationship.

180
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,635
For me, it was a great experience
to… to share a field with my dad.

181
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,722
And he's the best teacher.

182
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,767
But I think that I can do more.

183
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,064
Poroto is going through a stage

184
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,650
where he's becoming a man.

185
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,154
It's time for Poroto
to start building his career

186
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,780
besides Adolfo.

187
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,868
It's time for him to start winning
by himself and against his father.

188
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,369
I think it's healthy.

189
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,121
I think it's about time.

190
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,917
The best situation
in the U.S. Open,

191
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,838
I want Valiente in the final
against our team, La Dolfina.

192
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,674
The only thing that I want
is to win against him.

193
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,719
I'm very proud of my son.

194
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,804
But I try to beat him.

195
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,100
{\an8}Watch when they play each other.

196
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,728
The father's not giving in.
The son's not giving in.

197
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,813
They're going all out to make the plays.

198
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,192
It's kind of drama,
to be honest, for all of us.

199
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,656
But the good thing is
if they get there to that final game,

200
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,282
a Cambiaso will win.

201
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,375
{\an8}

202
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,171
Does everyone want
to beat the Cambiasos as bad as you do?

203
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,924
As bad as I do? I don't think so.

204
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,429
The Cambiasos have a target
on their back because they always win.

205
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,934
I mean, how can you not want to beat them?
At one point, it gets fucking old.

206
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,814
There's very, very few ten-goalers
like Adolfo Cambiaso and Poroto out there.

207
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,400
There's a handicap system in polo.

208
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,946
{\an8}<i>So the handicap system</i>
<i>in the U.S. Open is</i>

209
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,117
<i>each player has a handicap from</i>
<i>between minus one when you're a beginner</i>

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,619
<i>and then the top-top level is ten.</i>

211
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,956
For the U.S. Open,
all four players' handicaps

212
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,332
must add up to 22.

213
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,254
Most professional players are rated
somewhere between three and eight goals.

214
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,967
{\an8}There is less than eight ten-goal players
right now in the entire world.

215
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,012
<i>We have some amazing</i>
<i>ten-goal players in the U.S. Open.</i>

216
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,850
<i>Most notably is,</i>
<i>of course, Adolfo Cambiaso</i>

217
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,686
<i>and his son, Poroto Cambiaso.</i>

218
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,107
My handicap,
I mean, right now is, is one.

219
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,318
The goal is to get my handicap
to go up as much as possible.

220
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,737
We haven't missed,

221
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,531
{\an8}uh… a workout this whole season.

222
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,449
{\an8}No.

223
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,370
It's such a hard sport to tackle,

224
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,791
especially at, you know,
I was 40 when I first picked it up.

225
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,213
I have to work extra hard
to do what's best for the team.

226
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,718
And it's, you know, it's my team,
so I don't want to let the boys down.

227
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,262
What the fuck am I doing here?

228
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,349
{\an8}Foul, it's how it is.

229
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,392
{\an8}Foul.

230
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,479
{\an8}Robi and I started La Fe together
three years ago.

231
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,648
What separates La Fe
from every other team?

232
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:00,070
I think that all of us,
we really care about one another.

233
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,822
{\an8}

234
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,370
{\an8}The La Fe team, they're referred
to as the fraternity house.

235
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,955
{\an8}They walk in as a pack.

236
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,542
They're together
off and on the field.

237
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,961
They party together.
They work out together.

238
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,755
It's like a family.

239
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,508
He and Robi built the team
and the organization that way.

240
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,468
You know? To have fun.

241
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,763
Louis is more than a leader.

242
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,723
He has a really good heart.

243
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,352
He don't like to follow what everybody do.
He wanna do something new.

244
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,689
{\an8}La Fe are still kind of
the new kids on the block.

245
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,236
Because they are newer,
they are kind of an underdog team.

246
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,282
Every single player could be
making more money at another organization.

247
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,869
The fact that they want to be part
of La Fe makes me want to be able

248
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,163
to win with those three motherfuckers
that much more.

249
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,507
With what he does in the gym
and his approach to every day,

250
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,177
obviously that's why
he's able to do what he's doing.

251
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,389
It's a different,
different kind of mentality, you know.

252
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,433
Leading up to the U.S. Open,

253
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,103
I just think that I owe it
to the three professional players,

254
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,688
um, to work extra hard.

255
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,898
Every day I'm not on a horse,

256
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,569
I feel like I'm… I'm fucking things up.

257
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,199
And now today, instead of practicing,
I've gotta go to a baby shower.

258
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,169
We've got our baby shower today,
and I'm very excited.

259
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,424
It's my first baby and I feel like
it's a wonderful way to celebrate

260
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,259
bringing a new life into this world.

261
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,181
And more importantly, typically
my mom and my dad are in Chicago,

262
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,141
as are my siblings.

263
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,477
My polo girlfriends,
they are scattered across the globe.

264
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,316
{\an8}So having everyone here to kind of share
that moment with them is really special.

265
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,984
{\an8}Look who's here.

266
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,986
{\an8}Hi. Oh my gosh, how are you?

267
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,281
{\an8}Sorry, we're getting everything together.

268
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,784
My sister has planned everything.
She's done a beautiful job.

269
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,994
- That's in there.
- Got it.

270
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,538
Just bring it on in.
Thank you, I appreciate it.

271
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,293
{\an8}In 2020, Kelley was a participant
in a show called <i>The Bachelor</i>.

272
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,964
Louis and I, we love the name Alina,
and her middle name is Kelley

273
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,174
after my amazing sister.

274
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,093
Where do we want to set this up?
Did we decide? In the front?

275
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,679
I'm trying to make sure
my sister is not stressed.

276
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,847
It's about her today.

277
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,642
So I just want to make sure
that we keep her calm.

278
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,440
Hi, guys. How are you?
The AC just went out. Holy hot.

279
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,567
The manager just came, said the AC is out.

280
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,236
They wanna move all of this
across the way to the pavilion.

281
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,238
- Okay.
- There's gonna be 80 people in here.

282
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,824
There's no way we can have
100 degrees plus 80 people.

283
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,284
Um, let me go get my phone.

284
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,662
We just got wind that the AC was out.

285
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,914
So now we're in this confused state.

286
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,583
It starts in 15 minutes
and we have zero AC.

287
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,128
Hey, how are you? The AC is out.

288
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,298
Baby. This is Louis Devaleix.

289
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,884
- I'll let you deal with that.
- I got a pregnant wife.

290
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,387
You guys gotta move this stuff
to the restaurant.

291
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,848
My wife is sweating her balls off.
There's only ten people in here.

292
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,601
We're not doing it in here.
It's not fair. It's not cool.

293
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,146
Just have everybody here so they can
move all the shit down there ASAP.

294
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,064
Wait.

295
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,817
Do you understand
how long this is going to take?

296
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,151
An hour or two hours out.

297
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,820
I'm not gonna be like that for two hours.

298
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,989
Want me here two hours, I'm not doing it.

299
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,157
I get it. I'm pregnant. I'm hot. But…

300
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,826
The AC was broken.

301
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,036
Shit wasn't ready on time.

302
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,873
My ultimate focus right now
is… is to win the U.S. Open.

303
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,751
We weren't practicing
when everybody else was practicing.

304
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,044
I'm so fucking mad.

305
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,797
Instead of that, I'm at a baby shower.

306
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,508
And I just really
did not want to be there.

307
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,390
It was definitely too late
to change the venue location.

308
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,100
Guests were already arriving.

309
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,269
Any luck with the AC units?

310
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,105
I believe they're coming right now.
Sorry about that.

311
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,314
It's not your fault.

312
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,859
Here you go.

313
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:11,697
{\an8}Hi, everybody.
Welcome to Pamela's bri-- baby shower.

314
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,326
I hope we all have a good time here
because it's very, very hot.

315
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,538
Okay, so the AC,
we just got portable ones.

316
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,125
Everyone is steaming,
but hopefully it's okay.

317
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,670
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. Okay.

318
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,588
My mom.

319
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,466
She's nuts in the best way,
but she's nuts.

320
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,470
She says things with such sincerity
that even if they're rude,

321
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,181
you know it comes
from a good place in her heart.

322
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,476
It's unfortunate that it's kind of
a shitshow because of the heat.

323
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,645
I know, because look at you guys.
You're all sweating too, like pigs.

324
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,646
No offense intended.

325
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,483
It's so fucking hot. It's so hot.

326
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,151
Am I allowed to start drinking?

327
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,153
- How are you? Good.
- How are you? Good.

328
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,197
Thank you. Appreciate it. How are you?

329
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,366
I thought men weren't allowed
at these things.

330
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,619
Her mother made me come. Yeah, so.

331
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,248
My mom said, "You're gonna be there."
He said, "Men don't go to baby showers."

332
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,917
And she said, "Yes, they do."

333
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,127
Hi, Yaya. How are you doing?

334
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,546
You're wearing a T-shirt
to the baby shower?

335
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,465
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,634
Why would you not wear a collared shirt?

337
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,469
Gym shoes and those pants.

338
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,263
- You look like he's baling hay in a barn.
- White shirt…

339
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,182
Do you think
you're going to a rib barbecue?

340
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,225
Mom!

341
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,061
Nobody can push
that man around like my mom can.

342
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,480
In my family,
the tradition is the dads stop by.

343
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,982
Yeah, it was very important
for Louis to be there.

344
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,278
Do you know, Yaya,
men normally don't come to these events.

345
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,613
- Yes, they do.
- They do not.

346
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,533
I'm looking forward
to, uh, everybody sitting down

347
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,328
so that your daughter can give her speech,
so I can get the fuck out of here.

348
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,039
You better say something too.

349
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,293
- I'm not saying anything.
- Why not? You're the dad, aren't you?

350
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,176
I wanna thank you girls
for putting this event together.

351
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,887
Baby, you are, uh, fantastic.

352
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,516
Our daughter is so very lucky
to have you as her mother.

353
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,726
You hold this family together
and I love you very much,

354
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,145
and I thank you for all you do.

355
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,229
Thank you very much.

356
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,318
Who will take
more photographs of the baby?

357
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,654
 Who will be the more strict parent?

358
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,617
Who will want more children sooner?

359
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,958
Thank you, guys all for coming
to celebrate my little perfect niece,

360
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,334
baby Alina Kelley.

361
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
Louis, you are free. You can go.

362
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,050
Love you.

363
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,511
The fucking baby shower.

364
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,349
There's nothing more important
than… than staying laser focused

365
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,395
to try and win this tournament
because the competition is just fierce.

366
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,406
I can't eat this.
I don't eat dairy anymore.

367
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,991
Why not?

368
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,078
{\an8}- Nothing will happen.
 I don't eat mozzarella.

369
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,372
{\an8}Give it to me.

370
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,919
{\an8}I'm Keko Magrini.
I'm 18 years old,

371
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,379
{\an8}and this year I'm playing for Coca-Cola.

372
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,217
I'm the kid. I'm the youngest on the team.

373
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,060
I try to learn every day.

374
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,563
They're older than me, and I can learn
from all of them something.

375
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,358
Yeah, sometimes I get a little yelled at.

376
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,779
I yelled at you to go left.
So you go ahead, grab him faster.

377
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,281
This year
I started feeling pressure.

378
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,785
Maybe it's just me, myself,
putting too much pressure on me.

379
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,830
It really… It's not easy.

380
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,878
{\an8}<i>Stolen away by Matias Magrini.</i>

381
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,631
My dad, Matias Magrini,
was a ten-goal player.

382
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,050
<i>Matias Magrini shoots,</i>
<i>Magrini scores!</i>

383
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,930
My father never
pushed me into anything.

384
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,517
I do it because I like the sport.

385
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,852
It's a different adrenaline.

386
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,897
I mean, you don't feel it
with many other things.

387
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,816
It's… it's amazing.

388
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,695
Tough draw
for the U.S. Open this year, no?

389
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,614
Yes, rough.

390
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,657
- Yeah?
- Yes.

391
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,119
When we drew,
we draw Valiente,

392
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,579
which has Adolfo Cambiaso.

393
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,540
La Dolfina, which was Poroto.

394
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,418
Pilot, which was Facundo Pieres.

395
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,045
Then we draw Clearwater,
which was a tough team.

396
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:41,008
Playing in the U.S. Open, you're always
competing against the best in the world.

397
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,635
You still can
with a bit of luck.

398
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,761
- Yes, but…
- No?

399
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,263
We'll see.

400
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,852

403
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,240
My girlfriend, Marissa,

404
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,659
she rides on the show jumping.

405
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,663
I spend some time with her there
whenever she shows or she rides.

406
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,166
We have the same season at the same time.

407
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,545
We try to figure out
how to spend time together.

408
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,215
You try, but you're also
nervous about the games.

409
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,427
<i>♪ Gravity defined</i>
<i>What we'll make in the balance… ♪</i>

410
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,182
Thank God.

411
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,811
I go really soon, and you weren't here,
and I was getting nervous.

412
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,104
It's their fault.

413
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,814
- Are you going to set jumps?
- No.

414
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,443
{\an8}You don't want to set them with Paula?

415
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,863
Your loss.

416
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,865
It's not always the easiest

417
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,743
to date someone who eats,
sleeps, and breathes polo.

418
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,705
But Keko does a good job
at making time for me.

419
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,752
With his schedule and his lifestyle,
it's not easy, and I'm difficult.

420
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,962
I, like, want attention.

421
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,298
Can I tell you the course?

422
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,050
- What?
- Can I tell you the course?

423
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,012
- Okay. Yeah, one to two is a ten.
- Like, you really don't have to.

424
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,681
- Can you pay attention? No, get off.
- I am.

425
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,974
I am paying attention.

426
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,561
Keko and I, we've been dating for a year.

427
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,774
In the months
we got to know each other,

428
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,819
we enjoyed spending time
with each other. It was really fun.

429
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,238
And yeah, it just ended up working out.

430
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,704
Okay, I need to get ready.
I'm going to go get on soon.

431
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,916
- Okay, go get them.
- Can you come with me to get ready?

432
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,711
Yeah,
because I'm getting really anxious.

433
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,754
Please?

434
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,354
{\an8}<i>Up now is number 674, Marissa Rice.</i>

435
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,607
<i>She looks good going into her first jump.</i>

436
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:10,031
<i>Her horse unexpectedly stopped</i>
<i>going into that number ten jump.</i>

437
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,536
Her horse stopped there.
I don't know what happened.

438
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,499
That's not going in, right?

439
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,210
Hold this for a sec. What a day.

440
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,839
- So what happened? Why?
- He spooked.

441
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,550
The horse never spooked.
I don't know. He saw a ghost.

442
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,179
- Should we go get a smoothie?
- Yeah, we can go get a smoothie.

443
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,892
Keko is very much an internalizer.

444
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,187
He keeps the emotions in.

445
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,149
We've spent a lot of time together,
so I definitely can feel the vibe out

446
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,442
and the moods out.

447
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,405
He has a huge organization
backing him in this sport.

448
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,825
A lot goes into him
being out there on those horses,

449
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,162
and I think sometimes
he might feel like he lets people down

450
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,956
when there's that many people
behind him supporting him.

451
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,375
It's been hard because Negro,

452
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,879
{\an8}who is a really good polo player,
got injured.

453
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,548
{\an8}And Keko loves playing with Negro.

454
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,967
They have a great relationship
on and off the field.

455
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,762
How bad did he break it?
The whole thing or just one part?

456
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,931
- He broke it in two spots.
- Two spots?

457
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,142
- So he's out for the U.S. Open?
- He's out for the whole season.

458
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,102
I played with him last year.

459
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,189
Before it was the first time
I ever played with him, and I love him.

460
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,690
We became really good friends.

461
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:30,320
It's… the worst thing
that could've happened to us right now.

462
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,364
It's hard to replace Negro.

463
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,367
We just have to have good energy as a team

464
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,870
and yeah, maybe we have a shot at it.

465
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,913
Hopefully.

466
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,500
- Are you tired?
- I want to get the fuck outta here.

467
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,461
What a day, no?
Thank you for coming, though.

468
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,504
No problem.

469
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,348
{\an8}

470
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,191
{\an8}We always have a dinner
with the families before games.

471
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,403
{\an8}We are a close-knit team
and it shows on the field.

472
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,824
{\an8}After the loss to Park Place,

473
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,244
it's very important for us
to win against Clearwater.

474
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,121
{\an8}- Hi, sweetheart.
 Good to see you.

475
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,998
{\an8}- You ready for tomorrow?
 Oh, yeah.

476
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,209
We can beat any team
on any given day if it's our day.

477
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,547
We've got to focus,
and we have to be better.

478
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,133
I feel pressure from my father.

479
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,052
He wants to win so bad, and I get it.

480
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,599
But I think it's… it's healthy
to have somewhat of a… a personal life

481
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,767
outside of the sport and being an athlete.

482
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,939
- Hi. Hi, Charlie.
- Hi.

483
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,400
{\an8}I met a really nice girl, Eva.

484
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,401
Hi.

485
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,571
Gorgeous,
like an incredible personality.

486
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,116
{\an8}- I'm Susie.
 Hi, Karina. Nice to meet you.

487
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,701
{\an8}Oh, this is your mom?

488
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,578
{\an8}- This is my mom.
 I'm good.

489
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,455
{\an8}- Nice to see you.
<i>- Mucho gusto.</i>

490
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,957
We went on one date,
and she went off to Paris.

491
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,751
- You're gorgeous!
- You look amazing!

492
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,960
She flew back

493
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,588
to spend a long weekend,
and it was her birthday as well.

494
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,839
- Hi.
- How are you?

495
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,009
So I decided to invite her to
the team dinner with her and her family.

496
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,303
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.

497
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,180
Oh my God, how many dogs do you have?

498
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,391
Too many, but bear with us and come on in.

499
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:31,566
{\an8}I would really love Timmy
to be with somebody that is kind

500
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,985
and supportive.

501
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,155
I don't know if you have it.
It's a French photographer.

502
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,573
Hoping you like it.

503
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,367
That's so sweet.

504
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,451
Oh, it's beautiful.

505
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,286
Oh, this is beautiful.

506
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,371
Timmy's my baby.

507
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,375
I have my opinions about,
you know, who he's dating.

508
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,044
I think she liked the book.

509
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,420
We want the right person.

510
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,383
- Tim, what do you think about Eva?
- She's amazing, but, you know.

511
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,760
Do you think Timmy
really likes this girl?

512
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,429
I don't know.
We know nothing. We see nothing.

513
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,475
Okay, everybody, it's time to eat.

514
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,270
Come on, let's go, guys.
The pasta's getting cold.

515
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,231
Right now,
he needs to concentrate on himself

516
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,609
and being the best polo player
that he can possibly be.

517
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,487
- You're good? You want any salad?
- No, I'm okay.

518
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,823
At least through the Open, please.

519
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,370
Eva, welcome. Happy birthday.

520
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,287
Thank you.

521
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,164
And to celebrate new friendships.

522
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,794
To have romance during
the U.S. Open is definitely difficult.

523
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,088
It's one of those things
you don't have much time for.

524
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,466
But at the end of the day,
I want the stars and the moon.

525
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,386
I'm not happy with just the moon.
I want the stars too.

526
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:47,142
So for me to achieve that,
I dream about the perfect connection,

527
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,810
the perfect balance.

528
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,355
So that way,
I can live up to my potential.

529
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,233
Boys, tomorrow is a big day for us.

530
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,693
Be safe,

531
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,319
play hard,

532
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,904
and bring it home.

533
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,156
To all the best.

534
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,664
<i>♪ Look at me go, look at me go ♪</i>

535
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,916
<i>♪ Look at me go, look at me go ♪</i>

536
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,085
<i>♪ Look at me go, look at me go ♪</i>

537
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,337
<i>♪ Heavy on the go</i>
<i>We don't ever calm down… ♪</i>

538
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,339
I'd like to welcome you.

539
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,800
Happy to have you all
on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.

540
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,595
{\an8}Two great teams here,
and it should be pretty even.

541
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,889
{\an8}- You ready, boys?

542
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,727
Sunday polo is the chance for us
to play on an incredible stadium

543
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,936
and a great atmosphere.

544
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,398
It's like playing
center court in Wimbledon.

545
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,526
It's the best venue in America
and top three in the world.

546
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,905
Field one,
U.S. Polo ASSN field number one,

547
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,823
is the cathedral of North American polo.

548
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:48,453
That's the field that every polo player,
especially American, wants to play on.

549
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,291
The stadium gives you
a little bit of sparkle.

550
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,335
You get the energy from the crowd.

551
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,464
Everybody comes and watches.
They put their Sunday hat on

552
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,673
and a cute outfit.

553
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,511
Fashion is almost more important
than the actual game.

554
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,389
I don't know anything about it.
I just came for the food and the outfit.

555
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,974
I've been coming for years.

556
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,102
We appreciate the skills
that these riders have.

557
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,312
This is not an easy sport.

558
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,775
To me, it's like Christmas every Sunday.
It's exciting, and it's dangerous.

559
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,152
I'm a little nervous

560
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,155
just because now that I have someone
to personally root for,

561
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,200
it's more, you know, anxious,

562
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:31,746
but I… I have full trust
that he's going to play great.

563
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,919
{\an8}Clearwater, they're a good team.
They play very well.

564
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,714
In terms of horses, Dutta Corp
and Clearwater are evenly matched,

565
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,925
so it's gonna come down to
who has the better game plan.

566
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,345
<i>The Dutta Corp is</i>
<i>coming into this game after a loss.</i>

567
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,472
<i>Timmy Dutta,</i>
<i>up in the number one position,</i>

568
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,766
<i>he hasn't played in that position</i>
<i>in a long time</i>

569
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,685
<i>and he's struggling a bit</i>
<i>to find his footing.</i>

570
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,229
Coming out of Park Place,
a few mistakes that we had,

571
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,147
we'll fix,
and it'll make a big difference.

572
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,067
Play with your brain, huh?

573
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,861
Execute.

574
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,947
Clearwater is the one game
we have to win no matter what,

575
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,907
to give us a shot to continue on.

576
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,535
Hopefully, we can go get it done.

577
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,958
<i>Look to the center field</i>
<i>to get the match started.</i>

578
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,419
- The nerves are really kicking in.
- Here we go.

579
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,338
<i>Clearwater in the white.</i>
<i>Dutta in the blue.</i>

580
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,173
Let's go, Dutta Corp!

581
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>The ball is thrown in…</i>
<i>and we are off to the races.</i>

582
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,895
<i>First one there,</i>
<i>Garcia Del Rio pumps one downfield.</i>

583
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,399
<i>But on the defense,</i>
<i>Jared Zenni losing the play momentarily.</i>

584
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,609
Come on. Come on.

585
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,282
<i>Timmy Dutta.</i>

586
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:50,992
Go, Timmy, go.

587
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,285
<i>Fires one to goal…</i>

588
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,042
<i>And the first blood goes to Dutta Corp.</i>

589
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,211
{\an8}<i>Gus, they moved Timmy to number one.</i>

590
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,923
<i>- And we saw that strategy working.</i>
- Love it.

591
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,967
They're doing good.

592
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,761
The team is working.

593
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,181
<i>Let's see if the Dutta Corp</i>
<i>can keep this momentum going here</i>

594
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,349
<i>early in the game.</i>

595
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,188
I was finding a lot of space
in the front to be able to pull the team.

596
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,858
{\an8}<i>He's done it again.</i>
<i>Dutta, Dutta day!</i>

597
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,693
The horses were on point,

598
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,280
and the balls were reaching Timmy,
and he created havoc.

599
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,074
<i>Over to Timmy Dutta.</i>

600
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,202
{\an8}<i>Timmy Dutta reaching for it</i>
<i>with a shot on goal,</i>

601
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,579
{\an8}<i>and he finds the mark.</i>

602
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,331
- More intense, Timmy.
- Relax.

603
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,625
If I go more intense,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

604
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,669
He just annihilated them.

605
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,838
<i>It's now 13-8.</i>

606
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:51,219
13… 13-4.
I guess Clearwater wishes it was 13-8.

607
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,054
<i>Okay, 13-4.</i>

608
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,180
Come on, guys.

609
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,142
<i>We're back on the center line.</i>
<i>The ball is in play.</i>

610
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,647
<i>Out of the pack.</i>
<i>It's… taken here by Timmy Dutta.</i>

611
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,695
<i>Timmy, has he hit it too far?</i>

612
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,114
<i>Can he get there in time?</i>

613
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,368
<i>He does!</i>

614
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,540
{\an8}<i>No, he's had a hot mallet.</i>
<i>He's played very well.</i>

615
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,378
{\an8}<i>And he's really, really improved</i>
<i>in the last season or two. Timmy Dutta.</i>

616
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,672
All the hard work paid off that day.

617
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,925
{\an8}<i>But the victory will go</i>
<i>to Dutta Corp today.</i>

618
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,011
Oh my God. Just…

619
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,972
<i>- </i><i>And our MVP today is…</i>
- MVP!

620
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,017
<i>Timmy Dutta.</i>

621
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,566
That game
was super important for us.

622
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,527
Clearwater is the one team
that we had to beat.

623
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,530
So that we're still in the fight.

624
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,749
Timmy, fantastic game today.
You're on fire.

625
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,084
Run us through the game
from your perspective.

626
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,337
This is our first big win
of the season, and for us,

627
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,090
Clearwater is a very talented team.

628
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,134
All the players are amazing
and well-mounted

629
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,552
so I'm proud of the horses

630
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,971
and everybody else's teammates
did a great job.

631
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,891
Awesome. Thank you so much, Timmy.
Congratulations again.

632
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,685
- Good luck through the tournament.
- Thank you very much.

633
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,437
Appreciate it. Happy Easter, y'all.

634
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,860
When we win,
we always get a little happy about it.

635
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,238
We have some drinks, dance a little bit.

636
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,573
Enjoy the polo club.

637
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,033
What's the next step?

638
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,201
Valiente.

639
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,203
Valiente. Get 'em!

640
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,496
We'll get 'em.

641
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,001
What I want for Timmy is to become
the best polo player he possibly can

642
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,170
and win some great cups.

643
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,590
I think that he has a bright future.

644
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,093
We just have to keep him rolling
in the right way.

645
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,262
It's so much fun.

646
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:02,100
I couldn't have asked
for more welcoming parents.

647
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:06,395
It's special that we get to all root
someone that we care about.

648
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,233
And… we'll see… we'll see what happens.

649
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,072
- Eva picked a good weekend.
- She did, she did.

650
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,032
Maybe she was the reason we won.

651
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,534
You never know.

652
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,287
It could be that special touch
that just sent us to a different level.

653
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,832
I told her to come for the next game,
but she couldn't.

654
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,423
{\an8}One of the biggest games
of the season.

655
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,051
We're playing against Cambiaso.

656
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,970
And if you can beat them,

657
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,097
it sets the tone for the rest.

658
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:49,021
Most players just like to take it easy,
warm up, and then relax.

659
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,777
And I like to go
and play against another player.

660
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,029
I like to be able to feel the adrenaline

661
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,991
and prepare, you know,
for the contact sport.

662
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,536
And then 20 minutes before the game,
I show up on the field.

663
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,539
I'm feeling nervous.

664
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,583
<i>- Vamos!</i>
- But good nervous.

665
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,755
<i>Welcome to the National Polo Center</i>
<i>here in Wellington, Florida.</i>

666
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,549
<i>We're about to get the game underway,</i>

667
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,926
<i>where we're gonna see</i>
<i>La Fe take on Valiente.</i>

668
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,307
{\an8}<i>As always, Valiente is one of</i>
<i>the favorites here to win the U.S. Open.</i>

669
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,480
{\an8}

670
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,900
{\an8}These guys are…
It's a tough team.

671
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,610
For sure.

672
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,652
I don't think…

673
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,781
I don't think we've ever
actually got a chance to beat them.

674
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,912
When you think of polo,
you think of Cambiaso.

675
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,041
I think he's played
the U.S. Open almost 20 times.

676
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,835
He's also playing
on some spectacular horses, dude.

677
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,587
Like, they're very well mounted.

678
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,426
Adolfo Cambiaso
and Valiente understand

679
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,512
that in polo the horses
are so, so very important.

680
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,354
Each one of those horses
they bring to the field… Top, top horses.

681
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,564
Every single chukker.

682
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,486
Adolfo Cambiaso,
they tell me they own 3,000 horses.

683
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,114
Yet, somebody comes along
with a good horse, he buys another one

684
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,576
because he's looking
for those horses that really perform.

685
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,540
{\an8}Bob Jornayvaz is, um,
the sponsor of the Valiente polo team.

686
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,294
He and Adolfo have been playing together
for many years now.

687
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,506
When you've got that kind of money
for the tournament,

688
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,882
it makes a difference.

689
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,804
La Fe, they have
a tough job to win this game.

690
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,685
Cambiaso, there are not
many people who beat him,

691
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,397
so maybe we will play
a little bit more together today.

692
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,940
How is Louis feeling today?

693
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,527
He's more nervous than us,
so he's just going to stick and ball now.

694
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,491
I was starting to feel good,
feel really confident.

695
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,828
We've over prepared for this,
so we're ready.

696
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,581
This is our game.
They beat us two years ago and last year.

697
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,958
We're gonna beat 'em.

698
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,422
<i>Both teams are starting</i>
<i>to get ready, doing their warm-ups,</i>

699
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,799
<i>as people are pulling up,</i>
<i>getting ready to watch this game</i>

700
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,384
<i>here in Wellington, Florida.</i>

701
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,178
I go thinking
I'm always going to lose.

702
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,348
I really believe that the other team
is much better than mine.

703
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,728
I go with that fear to every game.

704
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,067
<i>In order</i>
<i>for La Fe to beat Valiente,</i>

705
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,820
<i>they're gonna have to play</i>
<i>at their very best level</i>

706
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,282
<i>because we know Valiente comes to win</i>
<i>every time they go to the field.</i>

707
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,200
Where the fuck is Louis?

708
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,455
So I was at the barns,

709
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,542
and all of a sudden,
I realize I lost track of time.

710
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,502
I was like… fuck.

711
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,130
I mean, who the fuck does that?

712
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,508
Not very ideal

713
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,637
to leave at three o'clock.

714
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,973
We got the biggest game of the year.

715
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,690
We're supposed to be normally
at the field at this time already.

716
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,489
I'm not gonna fucking make it.

717
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,366
Fuck.
