00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,019
{\an8}<i>♪ You know the time is now… ♪</i>

2
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,233
{\an8}Despite having a bad U.S. Open,

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,237
I'm looking forward to any opportunity
to get better as a player.

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,323
I want to improve,
and Sentebale is great for that.

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,745
Sentebale, it's a charity
that was founded in 2006

6
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,248
by Harry and Prince Seeiso
in Lesotho, Africa.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,293
Every year, we play one game
somewhere in the world.

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,672
This year it happens
in Wellington, Florida.

9
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,593
The outcome of today
is not about who wins it.

10
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,429
{\an8}It's Sentebale that wins,
and that's what we're all here for.

11
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,680
This is cool.

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,098
- Very cool, right?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,726
In charity matches
like the Sentebale Polo Challenge,

14
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,562
{\an8}the pressure of the U.S. Open
is off for just a moment.

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,689
{\an8}Players get to come together
and have a bit of fun

16
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,317
{\an8}and raise some money for a great cause
and entertain a big crowd.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,694
{\an8}But the polo itself is still top tier.

18
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,364
Most people go there.
It's a charity event.

19
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,034
{\an8}Let's play easy polo and have a good time.

20
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,911
{\an8}Are you gonna play, like,
friendly?

21
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,245
- Very friendly.
- Okay.

22
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,456
I'm a very friendly person.

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,374
Friendly, remember that.

24
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,252
I'm here to become
a better player,

25
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,464
and… you know, just want to fucking win.

26
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,847
- Huh?
- Dude, you're done.

27
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
Yeah, dude, we fucking suck.

28
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,018
It was so bad.

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,312
It was just such a bad season.
It was so bad.

30
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,524
You're, like, supposed to progress
every year, you know, with the same team.

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,317
We just suck.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,945
To be part of
a Sentebale event is awesome.

33
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,572
You have all
the best players in the world.

34
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,242
You know,
I was playing on a team with Nacho,

35
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,161
{\an8}and then Prince Harry and Cambiaso
were playing together on another team.

36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,496
{\an8}

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,709
- How's the Open?
- Poroto is a star now.

38
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,211
He is. He is.

39
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,088
- You created something special.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,422
He's doing amazing things.

41
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,341
For him,
he's starting the career.

42
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,801
- He's only 18?
- 18.

43
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,220
- How old were you when you became ten?
- Uh, similar.

44
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,180
- Similar, but-- Okay.
- He beat me.

45
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,142
We play together a lot.

46
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,979
You can play with your kid,
something that you love.

47
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,690
Yeah, but what's it like
playing against your kid?

48
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,066
It's difficult.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,901
And worse when you lose.

50
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,488
- You're proud, but also angry.
- Yeah. Exactly.

51
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,824
- Is he here today or not?
- Yeah, he's here.

52
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,784
He wants to meet Poroto.

53
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,287
- Hi. How are you?
- Nice to meet you. I'm good.

54
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,329
Nice to see you.

55
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,124
Are you going to end up
in the final against your dad?

56
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,170
- Are you gonna dispatch him before that?
- The semifinals is by draw.

57
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,922
So we gotta be lucky
not to play against each other.

58
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,841
You could play each other
in the second?

59
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,760
Once you get to the fourth semifinalist,
you go by draw.

60
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,057
{\an8}

61
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,396
{\an8}<i>Everyone may be playing</i>
<i>for a good cause,</i>

62
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,149
{\an8}<i>but we are still in</i>
<i>for some heart-pounding polo.</i>

63
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,694
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>let's get ready to get this game underway.</i>

64
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,780
{\an8}<i>Might decide</i>
<i>to run this one himself.</i>

65
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,365
{\an8}<i>What a cracking goal here.</i>

66
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,661
{\an8}Sentebale Polo Challenge
is, uh, played in a round-robin format.

67
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,416
Six chukkers. So we all play two chukkers
against the other two teams.

68
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,628
Whoever wins more games
is considered the winner.

69
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,340
<i>Louis Devaleix.</i>
<i>Louis takes a touch.</i>

70
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,177
{\an8}<i>And that's all he's going to need.</i>
<i>Louis Devaleix, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

71
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,471
{\an8}Louis just scored. I missed it.

72
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,849
{\an8}Do it again, baby. Do it again.
I missed his goal. Do it again, baby.

73
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,644
So first game, I scored a goal.

74
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,521
- It's good that they're passing.
- It was a good game.

75
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,150
{\an8}<i>Nacho Figueras.</i>
<i>Where's that ball going to land?</i>

76
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,694
{\an8}<i>Wow, what a great shot,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

77
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,612
We won.

78
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:02,116
So it just only accelerated that fuel,
that desire to win the tournament.

79
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,411
How are you feeling?

80
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,288
- Good. Ready to play.
- Next pregnancy.

81
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,960
<i>Well picked up there</i>
<i>by the Duke of Sussex.</i>

82
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,588
<i>Adolfo. Here we have another possible run.</i>

83
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,383
<i>Dana Barnes, and he puts that one through.</i>

84
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,510
{\an8}<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>what an amazing goal.</i>

85
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,804
{\an8}

86
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,851
Hey! How are you, man?

87
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,942
 Hello.

88
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,569
- Nice to meet you. Very well.
- How are you?

89
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,196
- She's fluent in Spanish.
- Really?

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,200
I lived there
about 20 years ago. In Palermo Viejo.

91
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,327
- Oh. In Palermo Viejo?
- Las Cañitas too.

92
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,454
That's great.
That's where the polo fields were.

93
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,623
Yes, but I love the 25th of May…

94
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,501
Yeah? That's great. Cool.

95
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,087
- Do you speak Spanish? No?
- Yes.

96
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,839
He knows I don't.

97
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,965
Yes.

98
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,176
- Well, yes.
- A little, a little. All right.

99
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,014
I still had to play Cambiaso.

100
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,142
Grand Champions and Sentebale.
We were both winners,

101
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:15,106
which kind of led to a virtual final
between us Grand Champions and Sentebale.

102
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,900
We're gonna beat them.

103
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,361
<i>And, uh, Louis.</i>

104
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,324
<i>Louis Devaleix doing a very good job</i>
<i>beating the ten-goaler.</i>

105
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,493
<i>Louis Devaleix all the way</i>
<i>on a straight run to goal.</i>

106
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,246
<i>Borwick puts his mallet down</i>
<i>on the near side.</i>

107
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,626
You're playing against
the biggest figures in the sport.

108
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,673
They're driven and… and motivated
for their own personal pride.

109
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,009
We crash each other.

110
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,219
Prince Harry was not relaxing,

111
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,973
and he wanted to win at all costs,
and I was the same way.

112
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>Prince Harry</i>
<i>on the move, working it.</i>

113
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,103
<i>Oh, what a run!</i>

114
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,816
{\an8}<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>what a run and what a goal by the Prince.</i>

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,195
{\an8}<i>Give it up, if you will,</i>
<i>for the Duke of Sussex.</i>

116
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,699
<i>Adolfo could just hammer one.</i>

117
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,623
{\an8}We got beat, at the end
of the day, a great day for the charity,

118
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,584
which is what is important to all of us.

119
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,378
I still can't win.

120
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,462
Thanks, dude.

121
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,131
- Thanks for having us. I appreciate it.
- It was fun.

122
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,510
<i>Well done indeed.</i>

<i>Coming in second place,</i>

125
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>Louis Devaleix.</i>

126
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,148
Watching Louis playing,

127
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,442
that's a huge part
of the sport that I enjoy.

128
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,822
But at the same time,
it makes me want so badly to be out there.

129
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,074
Since the pregnancy,
I haven't been on a horse.

130
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,829
So I definitely am eager
to get back on a horse, for sure.

135
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,102
Hi. Hi.

136
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,937
Hi.

137
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,480
{\an8}- Fucking devil.
 Hey.

138
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,441
{\an8}- How much shit did you eat?
 Plenty.

139
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,193
- How much shit did you eat today?
- Be nice to her.

140
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,111
You stay.

141
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,867
When you get pregnant,
there's a new part of you that you gain,

142
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,035
but a part of you also that you lose.

143
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,872
I've always wanted to be a mother.
My whole life I've wanted kids.

144
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,291
But you're never really prepared
for that transition

145
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,917
until you experience it yourself.

146
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,087
I have definitely lost a part of myself
in certain moments

147
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,797
and felt really down about that.

148
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,675
When I couldn't ride,
I wasn't traveling for work.

149
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,512
I wasn't really doing the things
that make me… me.

150
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,806
I've been wanting to do it
for some time now.

151
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,268
And this is my baby,
so she won't do anything.

152
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,022
It's a tough thing to come to grips with
because going that long

153
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,400
without being on a horse
was really difficult.

154
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,237
And… …you know, when
you're having a baby, you start thinking,

155
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,574
"Will I get back into this?
I don't know how I'm gonna feel."

156
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,368
Where I'm gonna be physically,
mentally, emotionally. You don't know.

157
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,496
Push up. One, two, three.

158
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,749
Great.

159
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,876
I got her. I got her. Don't worry.

160
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,461
Oh, my baby girl.

161
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,796
Oh, I love this horse so much.

162
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,299
You happy?

163
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,306
She's gonna start crying.

164
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,435
I just missed her.

165
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,863
- We won't go anywhere, okay?
- Okay.

166
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,075
She loves the horses
more than she loves the game.

167
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,538
- I wouldn't miss that for the world.
- I love you, Stellie.

168
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,624
You'll be back on her in no time.

169
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,586
Yeah. Okay.

170
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,632
Even just that second of sitting on her,

171
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,386
it just kind of reaffirmed for me
that this is what I love.

172
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,306
It will always be part of my life,
no matter what stage of life I'm in.

173
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,185
I'm just grateful to have horses
as such a consistent part of my life.

174
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,440
Come on, come with us.

175
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,735
Getting back on was really special for me.

176
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,864
Come on.
We're going this way.

177
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,202
She's like, nah.

178
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,838
{\an8}

179
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,133

182
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,056
<i>What a U.S. Open season</i>

183
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,183
<i>We're down now to our semifinalists.</i>

184
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,563
<i>Valiente, Pilot, and La Dolfina have been</i>
<i>favored to make it this far all along.</i>

185
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,191
{\an8}<i>But Coca-Cola really surprised us all</i>
<i>by securing their spot</i>

186
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,902
<i>and winning a penalty shootout</i>
<i>against Park Place.</i>

187
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,446
<i>Hilario Ulloa.</i>

188
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>He missed it. It just goes to show</i>
<i>that when it comes to the U.S. Open,</i>

189
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,201
<i>anything can happen.</i>

190
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,329
First one is Coca-Cola.

191
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,123
<i>Coca-Cola will take on La Dolfina.</i>

192
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,042
Valiente.

193
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,085
<i>And Valiente will take on Pilot.</i>

194
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,009
<i>♪ Okay, tell 'em,</i>
<i>Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em ♪</i>

195

<i>♪ Keep up with this ♪</i>

196
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,720
{\an8}

197
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,813
{\an8}

198
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,442
Maybe Mala
is the tenth?

199
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,695
Yes. Tórula played, didn't he?

200
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,739
Yes.

201
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,741
To me, Mala is the best, isn't he?

202
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,119
- Two for Toro…
- He rode it?

203
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,372
Toro was gonna ride it,
maybe I'll tell him.

204
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,963
 Fucking Louis catching fish.

205
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,548
<i>That one catch is for, uh…</i>

206
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,219
{\an8}For Keko Magrini right there
for not coming out on the boat with us.

207
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,303
{\an8}We're missing him.

208
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,889
<i>'Cause Coca-Cola</i>
<i>made it to the semifinals,</i>

209
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,641
<i>so he's too cool to come out here with us.</i>

210
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,477
<i>That's all right, Keko. No worries.</i>
<i>This one's for you, baby.</i>

211
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,358
Tell them
to take us tomorrow.

212
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,195
Yeah.

213
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,533
<i>For Keko Magrini</i>
<i>right there for not coming on the boat.</i>

214
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>We're missing him.</i>

215
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,889
{\an8}The match before,

216
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:10,563
{\an8}Keko made a joke about canceling
our anniversary dinner that night.

217
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,150
And I think I took it
a little too seriously.

218
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,527
But it was a really fun night,

219
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,281
a really great dinner, good time together.

220
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,285
So, they made it to the semis.

221
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,079
It's a big one. I'll go be there for him.

222
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,417
I want him to win, and I want him
to be happy with how he played.

223
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,335
Three, two…

224
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,089
Once you get
to the finals, you just try to enjoy them.

225
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,592
You never know when
you're gonna play it again.

226
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,180
{\an8}We had La Dolfina, and we knew
we can beat if we had a little luck.

227
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,517
I think we have
a really good draw

228
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,227
for the family.

229
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,064
We don't have to play
against my dad in the semifinals.

230
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,902
Now the thing that I want is we both win.

231
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,696
<i>We're getting ready</i>
<i>for our first semifinals here.</i>

232
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,948
<i>We've got Coca-Cola taking on La Dolfina.</i>

233
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,994
{\an8}<i>Poroto takes the man.</i>
<i>Panelo takes the ball.</i>

234
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,206
{\an8}<i>First blood goes</i>
<i>to La Dolfina.</i>

235
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>Big swing on that one</i>
<i>and a shot out in front.</i>

236
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,961
<i>Keko Magrini for Polito Pieres.</i>

237
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,672
{\an8}<i>What a pass by Keko Magrini.</i>

238
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>Poroto Cambiaso,</i>
<i>some big hang time on that ball.</i>

239
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,095
<i>It's heading in the right direction.</i>

240
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,681
{\an8}- <i>What a shot.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Right on target.</i>

241
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,934
{\an8}<i>Fantastic marksmanship there by the kid.</i>

242
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,519
{\an8}<i>Cut shot coming. What a goal.</i>

243
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,146
{\an8}<i>- Running for the back line.</i>
 <i>Fantastic.</i>

244
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>Cambiaso needs a big</i>
<i>right-hand turn. Panelo, there he gets it.</i>

245
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,653
{\an8}<i>Keko cannot give up</i>
<i>after that play.</i>

246
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,780
{\an8}<i>I bet you Polito's not happy right now.</i>

247
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,199
We can't let that play happen.

248
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,119
I've been fighting like this.
I look back and you come, galloping alone.

249
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,622
I swear it's not on purpose, man.
No, no, no.

250
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,500
You saw how that went?

251
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,962
And you went to… No, remember!
Poroto, you were with him.

252
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,631
- That's your man, that's your man.
- Okay.

253
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,050
The thing that polo has
is that you can get

254
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,928
within five goals in four minutes.

255
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,347
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

256
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,182
Be sharper, man, be sharper.

257
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,647
{\an8}<i>The shot to goal.</i>
<i>Keko Magrini, a needed goal for Coca-Cola.</i>

258
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,358
{\an8}<i>Hopefully getting</i>
<i>his confidence rolling as well.</i>

259
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,027
<i>Coca-Cola's back on.</i>
<i>Polito, lofted shot.</i>

260
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,487
<i>He gets it. How about that?</i>

261
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,947
{\an8}Fucking hell.

262
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,284
{\an8}<i>Bang, bang.</i>
<i>Coca-Cola brings 'em within one.</i>

263
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,497
No.
They are screwing up. They are gonna lose.

264
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,208
- Shut up!
- They are doing everything wrong.

265
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,422
Compact, they are great. This chukker
was amazing how they played it.

266
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,800
Come, let's go. Last stretch. Go!

267
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,468
{\an8}Let's go! Come on!

268
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,889
{\an8}We need to score two goals now, okay?

269
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,474
<i>Let's see if Coca-Cola can stay</i>
<i>in that vein right now.</i>

270
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,852
<i>They can't tie this one up.</i>

271
00:14:54,935 --> 00:15:01,233
<i>Polito Pieres</i>
<i>giving that ball a big ride inside.</i>

272
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,819
<i>One more could do it.</i>
<i>Knocked out of there by Panelo.</i>

273
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>A touch by Toro.</i>

274
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,156
<i>Here comes Poroto Cambiaso on the move,</i>

275
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,325
<i>trying to get this ball</i>
<i>out of their half of the field.</i>

276
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>Poroto Cambiaso.</i>
<i>Can he keep the run together? Poroto.</i>

277
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,581
<i>Keko Magrini coming on strong from behind.</i>

278
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,670
- Nice. Wow-wee.
- Good, Poro.

279
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,173
Good, Poro!

280
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,850
{\an8}There you go.
There you go. That's one.

281
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,353
Yes, finished!

282
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,938
Now yes! Bye!

283
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,606
<i>Poroto Cambiaso.</i>

284
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,568
- <i>Poroto Cambiaso.</i>
- <i>Poroto Cambiaso, cannot stop him.</i>

285
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,738
<i>Keko Magrini fires to goal.</i>
<i>Does he have it? He does.</i>

286
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,031
{\an8}<i>Keko, what a shot.</i>

287
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,867
{\an8}<i>This just goes to show</i>
<i>the enormous potential that Keko has.</i>

288
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,286
<i>Unfortunately, he hasn't had</i>
<i>a great day on defense,</i>

289
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,622
<i>and La Dolfina won't stop scoring.</i>

290
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:02,503
{\an8}<i>We'll see La Dolfina take</i>
<i>the "W" in the first of two semifinals.</i>

291
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,549
You were great.

292
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,510
We wanted to be in the final,

293
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,387
and that played against us
in some moments.

294
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,433
We were, me, personally,
anxious, wanting to be in the final,

295
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,311
without thinking that I had
a very important semifinal ahead,

296
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,940
and at times, I'd lose my focus,
but I think I also had good moments,

297
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,441
and that's why also, we won.

298
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,652
You've gone
into the U.S. Open before

299
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,362
with your father on your team,

300
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,074
and now you might play against him
in the U.S. Open finals.

301
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,868
Uh, what is this like
for you guys as a family?

302
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,495
 Good.

303
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,623
It's difficult, always,
to play finals against Dad,

304
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,544
but I hope he wins today.
It would be very nice.

305
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,849
The game ending
like this was also a little sad.

306
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,727
The whole season, it's been hard.

307
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,479
Keko, when he doesn't win,

308
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,817
it doesn't always show how much
effort and work is being put into

309
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,737
what's actually happening out there.

310
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,323
When you get
a great opportunity like that

311
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,368
you wanna do it right and not…
just throw it away,

312
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,288
that's why
you probably put pressure on yourself,

313
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,416
'cause you don't know
when you're gonna play again there.

314
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,084
It's how hard it is.

315
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,419
Polo's a hard sport,

316
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,882
{\an8}and everybody has to show up together
and click for there to be success.

317
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,094
There's a lot of things
that go into a successful team.

318
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,639
{\an8}These owners go out into the world,
they want the best athletes

319
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,476
that are gonna perform at their best.

320
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,854
So, you fall from that.

321
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,649
You don't become
a valuable player anymore for a team.

322
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,906
The future in Coca-Cola is no more future.
I mean, I'm not playing next year.

323
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,825
{\an8}

324
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,673
Polo is what
I want to do my whole life.

325
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,134
It's, uh, my only plan I have.

326
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,888
I didn't feel that it was my best season.

327
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,559
I didn't get to play…
what I know I can, or how I want to.

328
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,190
I mean, after you lost,
you're like, you cannot do anything there.

329
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,652
When I lose important games
or games that are tough,

330
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,611
I won't sleep.

331
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,574
I want that one.

332
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,162
Season's done.

333
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,165
Was it a stressful one, no?

334
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,295
I don't think it was fun.

335
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,008
We have to spend a lot of time together.

336
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,093
But why?

337
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,682
For Keko and I,
I don't know what's going on.

338
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,892
We say we're always going to be together,

339
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,271
and we're going to date forever,
and then end up together. It's hard.

340
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:12,442
Tensions and pressures,
during times like that, are pretty high.

341
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,238
Sometimes it's better
just to be alone, during the day,

342
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,656
and think about myself.

343
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,201
I felt Marissa understood it in some ways,
and in some other stuff

344
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,579
it must have been hard for her.

345
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,540
But it's what it was.

346
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,419
I'm dead.

347
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,547
You have so much more
to be happy about.

348
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,424
- Like what?
- With me.

349
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,429
Your girlfriend who you don't kiss.

350
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,983
{\an8}

351
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,280
When I was 20,
I could play a lot of games.

352
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,033
{\an8}But… today, uh,

353
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,077
{\an8}I need to take care of my body for sure.

354
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,748
I try to do a little bit of this,
stretching.

355
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,209
If not, I can be really sore.

356
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,670
I couldn't start at the beginning
of the season like everybody else,

357
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,505
because I had a lower back injury.

358
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:20,510
And for me to come back from that,
to get to the semifinals, it's important.

359
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:22,971
Yes.

360
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:29,728
I know that I can still compete against
these young, great kids that are coming.

361
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,605
This is better now.

362
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,483
So, I really hope we can make it
to the final of this Open,

363
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,860
because competing against Poroto

364
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,530
makes me have this adrenaline again

365
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,325
of trying to get better
and compete and win.

366
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,536
But, first of all,

367
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,706
I have to beat his father, Adolfo.

368
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,379
He's an amazing polo player.

369
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,547
A lot of years
of playing against each other.

370
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,342
- <i>Facundo Pieres!</i>
- <i>Facundo!</i>

371
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,970
- <i>Cambiaso! Goal!</i>
- <i>Adolfo Cambiaso!</i>

372
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,140
Facundo Pieres and Adolfo
have been number one and number two

373
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,767
for the past 15 years.

374
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,853
Socially,
they high-five each other

375
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,357
and they're friends when
they're having asados, but on the field,

376
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,528
{\an8}as soon as a ball is hit, or a whistle,
they're like, "Oh yeah, let's go!"

377
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,739
Since 2015,
so for the last decade,

378
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,117
Valiente has won the U.S. Open twice

379
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,494
and Pilot has won the U.S. Open twice.

380
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,955
Both these teams are very hard to beat.

381
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,710
To get to be in a semifinal

382
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,504
for us was really a big deal.

383
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,593
But when Bob was in the hospital,
you know, I was just thinking about him.

384
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,015
We pray for him
and I hope, uh, he wakes up soon.

385
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,058
Um, we're waiting for him.

386
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:57,190
Many of my dreams in my polo career,
they came true.

387
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,736
But if I win in the semifinals,

388
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,614
I will play in a final
on a stage of the U.S. Open

389
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,366
against my son.

390
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,538
I never even dreamed about it.

391
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,207
<i>Semifinal number two.</i>

392
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,836
<i>Pilot in white jerseys,</i>
<i>Valiente in their blues.</i>

393
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,007
<i>Going head-to-head here</i>
<i>to see who will face La Dolfina.</i>

394
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,010
<i>Here comes Facundo,</i>
<i>and then Adolfo jumps back on it.</i>

395
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,763
<i>We're gonna see a lot of action</i>
<i>between those two today.</i>

396
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,975
<i>Oh, it's left behind. Gonna be picked up</i>
<i>by Heguy. Can he sneak it inside?</i>

397
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,686
<i>Can he make him pay? Antonio Heguy!</i>

398
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,189
{\an8}<i>And Pilot on the board first.</i>

399
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,026
<i>Chukker number one. Pilot on top by one.</i>

400
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,570
- It'll happen, calm down.
- Let's go.

401
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,654
- It's long
- Good.

402
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,991
<i>Nice moves</i>
<i>on the back line there from Valiente.</i>

403
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,701
{\an8}<i>And we're even here at one.</i>

404
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,829
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso leads</i>
<i>the horse race out in front here.</i>

405
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,916
{\an8}<i>Valiente in the lead over Pilot.</i>

406
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,626
{\an8}<i>- Well done.</i>
 <i>Can he get it done?</i>

407
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,836
{\an8}<i>Gonzalez! Right on through.</i>

408
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,921
{\an8}<i>Adolfo Cambiaso.</i>

409
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,548
<i>Adolfo, not easy to do.</i>
<i>Peke Gonzalez out in front.</i>

410
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>He wants the pass. He gets the pass.</i>

411
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,429
{\an8}<i>Peke Gonzalez on final approach.</i>
<i>Peke Gonzalez!</i>

412
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,643
{\an8}<i>Valiente. These guys looking</i>
<i>to secure their spot in the finals.</i>

413
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,146
Either I cut through
or you throw long, at the neck.

414
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,607
- It was great.
- But the play was good.

415
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,444
Curtis.

416
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,614
- We have to change everything.
- Okay.

417
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,409
I mean, it feels like
we have no play right now.

418
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,326
Okay.

419
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,414
Pass to me and see
if I can score a goal later.

420
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,084
<i>Plenty of time.</i>
<i>Pilot needs to get to work.</i>

421
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,628
<i>Adolfo brings</i>
<i>the ball into play.</i>

422
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,717
<i>Paco gonna get caught</i>
<i>here on a right-of-way.</i>

423
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,263
<i>It's gonna be a penalty going in favor</i>
<i>of Pilot. They needed it.</i>

424
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>Plenty of time left to go here.</i>
<i>If they can score here…</i>

425
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,017
<i>Facundo on the line.</i>

426
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,189
<i>And he missed it.</i>

427
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,526
<i>- </i><i>Oh my goodness.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Wow. You won't see that often.</i>

428
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,570
<i>On any given day, Facundo Pieres,</i>

429
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,447
<i>he can beat anybody on the planet.</i>

430
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,783
<i>But a little unlucky there</i>
<i>against Valiente.</i>

431
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,702
<i>He never quits.</i>
<i>He continues to fight.</i>

432
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,997
<i>Facundo Pieres starts</i>
<i>to drive inside. Hits it out in front.</i>

433
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,166
<i>Looking for Antonio Heguy.</i>

434
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,544
<i>Heguy, 20 yards out.</i>
<i>A roller along the ground. It's in.</i>

435
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,879
{\an8}

436
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,338
{\an8}<i>They won't stop. I love it.</i>

437
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,841
{\an8}<i>Facundo Pieres grabs control. Hits away.</i>

438
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,010
<i>Antonio's on the move.</i>
<i>He's got him beat.</i>

439
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,680
<i>If he can keep it going.</i>
<i>Antonio Heguy down Main Street.</i>

440
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,349
{\an8}<i>He goes one more through the air. It's in.</i>

441
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,187
{\an8}<i>That could be just what Pilot needs</i>
<i>to get back into this polo game.</i>

442
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,771
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

443
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,899
- <i>Adolfo.</i>
- <i>Adolfo.</i>

444
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,942
<i>- No bouncer doubted.</i>
<i>- </i><i>What a goal.</i>

445
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,279
{\an8}<i>Every time Pilot gets going,</i>
<i>Adolfo seems to have an answer.</i>

446
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,115
<i>Adolfo not letting Pilot</i>
<i>gain any momentum.</i>

447
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,243
<i>Ball's in play.</i>
<i>That's gonna be the last chance.</i>

448
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,206
<i>Facundo Pieres,</i>
<i>the inside track on Adolfo Cambiaso.</i>

449
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,082
<i>Oh, no.</i>

450
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,209
<i>Facundo,</i>

451
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,545
<i>maybe one in a thousand times</i>
<i>you'll see him miss that opportunity.</i>

452
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,463
<i>Wow.</i>

453
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,380
{\an8}

454
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,382
{\an8}<i>Congratulations to Valiente.</i>

455
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,219
<i>- They had full control of the entire game.</i>
<i>- </i><i>I agree.</i>

456
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,306
<i>Into the finals the two go.</i>
<i>It'll be a father-son shootout.</i>

457
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,268
<i>And it's gonna be a great final</i>
<i>against these two sister organizations.</i>

458
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,438
<i>They must be thrilled again</i>
<i>to make it to the finals.</i>

459
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,735
We… we tried. We tried.
That's all we can do.

460
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,570
It never feels good to get beat,

461
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,907
{\an8}but, uh, the shots that we normally
would make in our sleep,

462
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,661
{\an8}we weren't able to make them,
so that's really what happened there.

463
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,873
He had injuries. I mean,
there's nothing you can do about it.

464
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,503
I knew when he, uh, hurt his back
the way he hurt it.

465
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,298
I knew we were climbing the hill,
and we were doing very well,

466
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,425
and it just… today wasn't the day.

467
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,929
It's difficult to get to a game
when you're sore,

468
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,014
so I think without the injuries,

469
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:02,310
we would have had our chances
a lot better at the semifinals.

470
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,897
But at the same time,

471
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,066
we had a very good year, I think.

472
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,163
It's fun to be in that position
at this time of my career,

473
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,874
you know, 49, not young.

474
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,459
I'm going to try to enjoy it,

475
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,588
and I'm just happy
to be in the final against my son.

476
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,758
Daddy against his son in the final.

477
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,802
Father against son.

478
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,139
Who do I want to win?
Uh, very hard question.

479
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,182
Adolfo always wants to win.

480
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,020
I… I don't even want to play
Monopoly with him. It's in his DNA.

481
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,106
Poroto, he's becoming a man,

482
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,027
so imagine, for me,
it's like all I wanted for him.

483
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,820
Today is a happy day.

484
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,906
Sunday, I will let you know
if it's going to be this happy.

485
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,619
It's a fitting culmination
to this season

486
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,330
to see father-son

487
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:04,956
settle it.

488
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,386
- Fanta, Louis?
- Give me that Coke.

489
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,441
I don't know what to tell you.
If you don't get a bite here,

490
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,111
good thing you're a polo player,
not a fucking professional fisherman.

491
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,738
But those are tiny bites.

492
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,948
I can guarantee you
there's big fish here.

493
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,077
There you go, baby. What you got?

494
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,122
- No, I lost it.
- You lost the fish, well.

495
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,666
To be continued.

496
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,798
- You guys almost won yesterday.
- It was good.

497
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:00,428
And you, <i>boludo</i>, what happens now?
Like, you're done with Coca-Cola?

498
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,098
Yes.

499
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,767
Coca-Cola,
they're letting Keko go.

500
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,146
This year was a tough year for Keko
for a variety of different reasons.

501
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,190
Obviously, performance wasn't up to par,

502
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:16,027
it wasn't up to the level
that Coca-Cola is used to playing at.

503
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,571
But I've been watching Keko
for a couple of years now,

504
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,490
and the way this kid improves,

505
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,119
I know for a fact that
he's gonna come out better and stronger.

506
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,037
We're gonna call your dad.
Let's call your dad.

507
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
I'm with your son right now.

508
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,668
I'm trying to corrupt and convince him
into playing with us next year.

509
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,674
<i>Fucking corrupted, yeah.</i>
<i>That can be fucking corruption, yeah.</i>

510
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,345
<i>Send me a picture</i>
<i>with a fish, dude, with a fucking fish.</i>

511
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,140
{\an8}We don't have a fish.
We don't catch shit.

512
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,766
{\an8}We said,
"We want to play with you."

513
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,728
And Keko said,
"I really want to play with you too, now."

514
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,397
But the stars have to align.

515
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,232
We're still working through it.

516
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,651
I'll see you in Argentina
in a couple of days.

517
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,948
Going out of Coca-Cola,
I'm interested to play in La Fe.

518
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,451
I don't know,
I felt Louis is a really cool guy.

519
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,580
I'm still going to think about it,
but it's a really, really good option.

520
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,665
You'll look great in pink.

521
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,917
- Pink?
- Better than fucking red and white.

522
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,670
I could be fine with pink. Eh?

523
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,922
I like… It's not that bad.

524
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,383
Fuck yeah, baby. Let's go.

525
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,636
- Good job.
- Good job.

526
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,436
{\an8}

527
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,401
{\an8}Before the U.S. Open final,
we are, uh, doing, um, a barbecue.

528
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,279
{\an8}And Valiente and La Dolfina,

529
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,240
it's pretty much the same thing.

530
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,700
The same organization.

531
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:51,414
It's like the two Mercedes cars racing
in the last moment against each other.

532
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,045
It's not easy to be
in a final of the U.S. Open

533
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,129
against a dad.

534
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,048
It's going to be
an important moment for me.

535
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,929
I have to prove that I can win
a big tournament without my dad.

536
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,973
I like to play with a young kid,

537
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:13,436
but we are a young team,
and that is my future.

538
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:18,191
This new generation of players
makes the game incredible to watch.

539
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,152
I mean, when you see
what these guys can do

540
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,531
at 35 miles an hour, it's really stunning.

541
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,576
But the older generation still stands.

542
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,663
Like Adolfo, he's always trying to find

543
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,918
an excuse for him to try
to do better than everybody else.

544
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,714
It's probably the most emotional finals
that I've played in my life.

545
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,801
Because Bob is not there,

546
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,555
because of what happened,
and then I know that it's Poroto,

547
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,014
but I want to beat him.

548
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,724
I want to win.

549
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,142
For Bob.

550
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,896
He's my partner. He's my friend.

551
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,649
Bob is part of our family.

552
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,374
<i>We started this competition</i>
<i>about three weeks ago with nine teams,</i>

553
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,585
<i>and now we're down to the final two.</i>

554
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,379
<i>Valiente will take on La Dolfina.</i>

555
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,841
Hollywood better be taking notes
because this is the type of story you see

556
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,175
in blockbuster films.

557
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,721
And now in the season finale,
which Cambiaso will be walking away

558
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,681
with the coveted trophy?

559
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,809
Will it be Adolfo,
who's seeking his 10th U.S. Open title,

560
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,145
or will it be his son?

561
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,106
The question has been
for a long time, can the kid do it?

562
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,733
Can he beat the old man?

563
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,652
Is the son gonna be
the master, ultimately?

564
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,322
Is he gonna outride his father?

565
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:52,285
Adolfo Sr. has been the greatest
of the greatest for so many years,

566
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,955
versus a young player
who has learned from the best.

567
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,084
What that family has done
to give Poroto all of the tools

568
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,503
and the comfort and the pressure

569
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,089
in a way that is an advantage.

570
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,051
Don't give them space.
Drown them, drown them.

571
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,262
Leave them away from the ball.
That's where we're going to break them.

572
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,307
I try to support Poroto
and support my husband.

573
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,559
They both want it and they both need it.

574
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,770
And they are very ready for it.

575
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,732
If you mess with them,
they'll do whatever they want.

576
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,985
But it is key for us
to give ourselves time,

577
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,488
the only thing I would change
is how we defend.

578
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,406
We're gonna suffer.
It's gonna be very disputed.

579
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,284
They are going to overtake us.
It is going to be a very cool game.

580
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,453
With faith, play calmly and with faith.

581
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,913
We are going to break them.

582
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,500
My husband, he's going to retire soon.

583
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,504
To compete against
30-year-younger kids, it's not easy.

584
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,422
It's not easy
to play against your son,

585
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,258
but I don't want to give him anything.

586
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,635
It's hard for me,

587
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,805
because they keep asking,
"Whose side are you going to be on?"

588
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,640
They're pushing me a lot.

589
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,309
It's been a very good season,

590
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,144
but you know, it's too much.

591
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,816
Being the mother and the wife
of these two men, it's too much.

592
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,032
<i>♪ And the rocket's red glare ♪</i>

593
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:18,121
<i>♪ The bombs bursting in air… ♪</i>

594
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:23,835
<i>What a beautiful setting here</i>
<i>for the 2024 U.S. Open Polo Championship.</i>

595
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,505
<i>Field number one,</i>
<i>U.S. Polo at the National Polo Center.</i>

596
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:32,260
<i>You are gonna see the finest that polo</i>
<i>has to offer here on display today.</i>

597
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,432
<i>Chukker number one</i>
<i>off and working.</i>

598
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,308
<i>Poroto picks the pace up.</i>

599
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,395
<i>Cambiaso off and working.</i>
<i>It's his father now in front.</i>

600
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,481
<i>The pair of Argentine flag helmets meet.</i>

601
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,776
<i>The old man looking for the bump,</i>
<i>the ride off. They get tangled up there.</i>

602
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,902
<i>The kid gets it back.</i>

603
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,113
<i>Finding Panelo.</i>

604
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:53,948
<i>Panelo.</i>

605
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,036
<i>Panelo going to the goal.</i>
<i>Can he do it? Panelo.</i>

606
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,873
<i>Unbelievable magic we're seeing</i>
<i>between these two players.</i>

607
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,626
<i>Poroto hits Tommy on the fly.</i>
<i>They draw first blood on the day.</i>

608
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,422
<i>Buckle up, folks.</i>
<i>It's only gonna get better from here.</i>

609
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,675
<i>This is the pinnacle of polo</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

610
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,721
<i>Panelo breaks to goal.</i>
<i>Big hit. He's got Poroto on the move.</i>

611
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:22,101
<i>Poroto, that ball about 30 yards out.</i>
<i>Poroto. Reaches over on the near side.</i>

612
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:26,314
<i>Oh, what a save by Adolfo.</i>
<i>Right off the doorstep.</i>

613
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,358
<i>Penalty against the team in blue.</i>

614
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,695
<i>Penalty number two gonna be</i>
<i>taken by Paco de Narváez Jr.</i>

615
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,364
{\an8}<i>We're tied up at one goal apiece here</i>
<i>in chukker number one.</i>

616
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,201
I need you to close it
more to the four,

617
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,827
when he comes to me I can't move.

618
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,164
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go guys.

619
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,335
{\an8}
<i>Adolfo, it's up. And a score.</i>

620
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,586
{\an8}

621
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>Tommy Panelo has the ball.</i>

622
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,925
{\an8}<i>He winds up and sends it</i>
<i>through the pack and between the posts.</i>

623
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,636
{\an8}<i>That'll tie it all</i>
<i>at two goals apiece.</i>

624
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,682
{\an8}<i>Peke. Peke González. Panelo.</i>

625
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,768
{\an8}<i>Tommy Panelo.</i>

626
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,855
{\an8}<i>- This is as even as it gets.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Yeah.</i>

627
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,483
{\an8}<i>Valiente regains the lead.</i>

628
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,989
<i>Trying to work this one</i>
<i>to get one more point to tie this game.</i>

629
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,742
<i>Oh, what a play. Poroto Cambiaso.</i>

630
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,207
<i>Did he get it?</i>

631
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,584
{\an8}<i>- </i><i>He got it.</i>
 <i>What a goal.</i>

632
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,795
{\an8}<i>He fakes</i>
<i>the shot on purpose,</i>

633
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,381
<i>creates some space for himself.</i>
<i>I wonder where he learned that.</i>

634
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,716
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Father against son right here.</i>

635
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,761
<i>All right, that bell's gonna end</i>
<i>the first half of the finals</i>

636
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,471
<i>of the U.S. Open Polo Championship.</i>

637
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,390
{\an8}They're close, anything can happen.

638
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,809
{\an8}They need one chukker
to make a difference.

639
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,436
<i>What more could you ask for?</i>

640
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,481
<i>This has truly been</i>
<i>a back-and-forth battle all day long.</i>

641
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,360
<i>Poroto is going toe-to-toe with his father</i>
<i>and keeping his team right in it.</i>

642
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:59,115
It's key when we're all
involved the old man starts hitting him.

643
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,826
He's going to yell at you,
and the next time he yells…

644
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,621
They're going to yell at you,
even if you didn't do anything.

645
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,415
So try to slow down now.

646
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,877
Let him scream. But slow.

647
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,839
There you throw yourself
with the ball. Where are you?

648
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,342
What happens, Paquito, is that if you
go forward on the wrong side

649
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,553
you end up like this
and Poroto make you like that.

650
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,972
- I can't go back.
- Well, turn around.

651
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,184
<i>Fasten your seatbelt,</i>
<i>because the U.S. Open final is coming down</i>

652
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,685
<i>to these last three chukkers.</i>

653
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,812
<i>It is anybody's game at this point.</i>

654
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,110
<i>Penalty will go</i>
<i>in favor of Valiente.</i>

655
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,989
<i>And De Narvaez puts it on through.</i>

656
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,659
{\an8}<i>It's now Valiente on the lead, 6-5,</i>

657
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,578
{\an8}<i>over La Dolfina.</i>

658
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,045
{\an8}<i>Poroto, there's the warning bell.</i>
<i>Can they beat the clock?</i>

659
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,052
{\an8}<i>As Poroto has the ball, they trail by one.</i>
<i>Can he get it down there in time?</i>

660
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,597
{\an8}<i>Poroto. Poroto about 80 yards out.</i>

661
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,767
{\an8}<i>Poroto flips the ball over</i>
<i>to Tommy Panelo.</i>

662
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,769
{\an8}<i>- Clock is ticking down.</i>

663
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,103
{\an8}<i>Panelo goes to goal.</i>

664
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,023
{\an8}<i>Panelo. Panelo. Panelo.</i>

665
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,610
<i>I'm not sure if that's a buzzer beater</i>
<i>or not. I don't think so.</i>

666
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,987
- <i>No, it's not.</i>
- <i>He hit it a second time.</i>

667
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,324
{\an8}<i>The goal will not count.</i>
<i>That'll end the chukker, 6-5.</i>

668
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,951
{\an8}<i>Let's hear it for both teams.</i>

669
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,121
It wasn't a goal, tell him.
He hit it before the bell.

670
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,539
It was a goal, dude.

671
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,126
<i>Here comes Poroto</i>
<i>to pick up the pass.</i>

672
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,547
<i>Poroto Cambiaso, ridden off,</i>
<i>leaves the ball behind for Panelo.</i>

673
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,591
<i>Panelo sends a bomb downfield.</i>

674
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,802
<i>Coming in, Rufino Merlos.</i>

675
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,514
<i>Rufi. Rufi. Rufi, looking for pay dirt.</i>

676
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,141
<i>Oh, Adolfo backs that ball out of danger.</i>

677
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,646
<i>On the field, though,</i>
<i>it's turned here by Panelo.</i>

678
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:57,066
<i>Adolfo… He stopped it off the doorstep,</i>

679
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,027
<i>but not in time.</i>

680
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,073
<i>Flag man says it was over the line.</i>
<i>Adolfo comes back to challenge.</i>

681
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,078
<i>Apparently, the flag man thought</i>
<i>it was over the line.</i>

682
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,623
<i>Adolfo says, "No, I had it first."</i>
<i>So is it tied?</i>

683
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,375
<i>Is it not?</i>

684
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,710
<i>We'll find out.</i>

685
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,632
{\an8}<i>The goal counts,</i>
<i>and we've got a tie game once again.</i>

686
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,969
<i>Adolfo with the ball.</i>
<i>He moves it back to the left right here.</i>

687
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,388
<i>Rufi comes in.</i>
<i>Rufi with a great little back shot.</i>

688
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,974
<i>That's gonna set up Panelo.</i>
<i>Panelo takes off right now.</i>

689
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,561
<i>Then Poroto comes in, takes the ball,</i>
<i>as Tommy will take them in.</i>

690
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,397
<i>Poroto going to the goal,</i>
<i>looking good right here and now.</i>

691
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,361
<i>Can he put his team on top?</i>
<i>Poroto. Poroto Cambiaso!</i>

692
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,448
{\an8}- <i>What a goal right here.</i>
 <i>Goal-aso.</i>

693
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,908
{\an8}<i>That's gonna end</i>
<i>the chukker right there.</i>

694
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,036
<i>La Dolfina in the lead</i>
<i>for the first time today.</i>

695
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,041
<i>Both teams look incredibly tired,</i>
<i>but the final battle has yet to come.</i>

696
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,918
<i>What an epic conclusion to the U.S. Open.</i>

697
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,967
<i>Ball's in play.</i>
<i>The game's back underway.</i>

698
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,386
<i>First one there, it's Adolfo.</i>

699
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,805
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso leads the charge.</i>

700
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,390
<i>Adolfo, nice approach.</i>

701
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,393
<i>Adolfo's shot is going, going, going.</i>

702
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,687
<i>Poroto. He got there.</i>

703
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,230
<i>Poroto, unbelievable play.</i>

704
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,775
<i>Denying his dad that goal.</i>

705
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,910
<i>Paquito winds up and hits</i>
<i>the penalty two straight on through</i>

706
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,871
{\an8}<i>and now makes the score</i>
<i>seven goals apiece on the board</i>

707
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,291
{\an8}<i>here in the final chukker</i>
<i>of the U.S. Open final.</i>

708
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,210
<i>Can't get any better</i>
<i>than this, Tony.</i>

709
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,088
<i>Poroto on the backhand hits to Panelo.</i>

710
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,091
<i>Panelo in scoring position.</i>
<i>Panelo winds up.</i>

711
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,344
{\an8}<i>Panelo's got it?! Yes, he does!</i>

712
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,013
{\an8}<i>La Dolfina retakes the lead,</i>

713
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,766
{\an8}<i>but with three minutes left,</i>
<i>Valiente can still turn the tables.</i>

714
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,017
{\an8}<i>Let's see where this leads.</i>

715
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,062
{\an8}<i>Adolfo Cambiaso. Adolfo.</i>

716
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,773
{\an8}<i>Waiting for his players</i>
<i>to get in position.</i>

717
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,110
<i>Now Adolfo winds up, sends a bomb.</i>

718
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,738
<i>Peke Gonzalez runs up there.</i>
<i>So does Alejandro Aznar.</i>

719
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,699
<i>Aznar with a back shot,</i>
<i>a loose ball taken here by Panelo.</i>

720
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,702
<i>Panelo's got the play,</i>
<i>avoids the hook from Paquito.</i>

721
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,538
<i>Panelo still has the ball.</i>

722
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,915
<i>Tommy Panelo waits for it</i>
<i>to settle at the boards.</i>

723
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,251
<i>Flips it over for Poroto.</i>

724
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,087
<i>Poroto shoots the goal. The ball is going.</i>

725
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,505
<i>Rufino Merlos.</i>

726
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,757
<i>Rufino, Rufino, Rufino.</i>

727
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,928
<i>Unbelievable goal by Rufino Merlos</i>

728
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,181
{\an8}<i>to put his team up by two,</i>
<i>9-7 now the score.</i>

729
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,851
<i>Panelo.</i>

730
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,437
<i>Valiente breaking down.</i>
<i>They can't respond.</i>

731
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,730
<i>Panelo!</i>

732
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:46,026
{\an8}<i>Huge goal right there.</i>
<i>The three-goal lead should seal the deal.</i>

733
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,447
{\an8}<i>Valiente tries to create one more chance,</i>
<i>but they don't have enough time.</i>

734
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,992
<i>La Dolfina will take the match.</i>

735
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,165
{\an8}<i>Final score, 10-7.</i>

736
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,791
<i>La Dolfina has done it.</i>

737
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,752
<i>They have beat Valiente</i>
<i>for the second time in a row.</i>

738
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,714
<i>Oh, wow. Look at Poroto.</i>

739
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,175
{\an8}<i>He just won the U.S. Open,</i>
<i>but instead of celebrating,</i>

740
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,052
{\an8}<i>Poroto runs over to show</i>
<i>his support for Bob's family.</i>

741
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,679
{\an8}<i>What a beautiful moment.</i>

742
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,973
{\an8}

743
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,851
I told you I was going
to hit him hard today!

744
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,144
Come on! Come on!

745
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,486
Love you, Mama.

746
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,071
What an animal! Go!

747
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,115
Wow, what a thrill!

748
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,867
Fucking hell!

749
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,630
Congratulations,
old man, anyway.

750
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,174
For the fight you put up.

751
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,596
- It was even until the end.
- Yes. And then at the end.

752
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,433
- Then at the end.
- Yes, I don't know what it was.

753
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,018
We screwed up a little.

754
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,731
<i>And now, the perpetual trophy,</i>

755
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,152
<i>United States,</i>
<i>the U.S. Polo Open Championship.</i>

756
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,864
<i>La Dolfina.</i>

757
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,211
<i>♪ Look all around</i>
<i>What a beautiful sight ♪</i>

758
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:31,298
<i>♪ As we're reaching</i>
<i>For the greatest heights ♪</i>

759
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,430
<i>♪ We're reaching</i>
<i>For the greatest heights ♪</i>

760
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,393
<i>♪ It's what we're waiting for</i>
<i>It's what we're dreaming of… ♪</i>

761
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,354
They say
the difficult thing is not to get there,

762
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,605
but to stay at the top.

763
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:51,485
I'm gonna try to be on the top
and as high as possible in the sport.

764
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,947
We're gonna probably watch Poroto

765
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,158
growing as a polo player
through his career.

766
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,870
I'm very proud of him
that, uh, he's his own.

767
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,873
He has his own way of playing polo,

768
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,502
and he showed the world
that Poroto is Poroto.

769
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,506
And I'll be honest with you, uh,
that night I was pissed.

770
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,384
Really pissed off.
That night I didn't celebrate,

771
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,262
but, uh, the next day

772
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:22,349
we noticed that what we did
was something that is not easy to do.

773
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,396
You're seeing
the most iconic player

774
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,690
to ever play this game passing the torch

775
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,734
and seeing his son compete against him.

776
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,153
No other sport has that.

777
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,866
When we first started playing
with Adolfo, Poroto was really little,

778
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,161
{\an8}and I think my dad has helped
make decisions along the way

779
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,872
for Poroto that's allowed him to flourish.

780
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,625
And I think he's super proud of that.

781
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:52,004
I think he's been so proud
of, uh, the player that Poroto has become.

782
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,841
Adolfo, now that he's got
Poroto coming at him,

783
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,260
I think it's given him new life.

784
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,429
It's given him something
to fight for again.

785
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,474
But Poroto is looking
to make a legacy of his own.

786
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,436
I don't think I have
many more years to play.

787
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,522
I don't want to look back
because you get too emotional.

788
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,815
I just go forward.

789
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,987
I want him to retire up there,
you know, on the best level.

790
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,156
It's not that important for him,
but for me it is.

791
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,076
My thinking is, let's see.

792
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,289
I know that the day
that I feel that I'm done,

793
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,083
that I'm relaxed, that I don't care,

794
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,794
is the day that I'll have to say,
"Okay, stop doing this."

795
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,297
But this was our second year
not winning the U.S. Open,

796
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,551
so you get something inside
and it gets bigger and bigger.

797
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,806
That is that revenge,
getting back the trophy.

798
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,186
I'm still capable of playing
a good game and beat anybody.

799
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,940
You always have something to learn
and something good

800
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,566
to take out of the season.

801
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,652
I'm just gonna go back again

802
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,696
and keep on trying hard
and trying to improve.

803
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,614
I've been talking with Louis.

804
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,783
I hope if it's not this season,

805
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,786
the next one or whenever,
I can play together with Louis.

806
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,498
The end of Wellington
is always bittersweet.

807
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,042
We kind of go our separate ways after

808
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,754
and we really never know
what's gonna happen next.

809
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,759
But regardless, I'm always proud of him
and I was really proud of him this season.

810
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,638
And I'm also excited
for what's going to come next for him.

811
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,645
No! Fucking shit
of your fucking mother.

812
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,273
Losing is just…
it's fucking terrible.

813
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,399
Good game.

814
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,402
But, I'm looking forward
to this upcoming season.

815
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,570
I'm just gonna keep trying.

816
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,572
This is the nursery.

817
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,574
How far out are we?

818
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,160
It could happen any day now.

819
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,829
She's ready. I'm ready.
And now the room's ready.

820
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,874
I'll look forward
to having baby Alina

821
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,042
and Ames, you know,
on the sidelines cheering.

822
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,670
Pam, she's gonna do whatever she can
to win the U.S. Open.

823
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,046
We'll be there cheering her on.

824
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,216
Yeah. She supports me,
and I will do the same for her.

825
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,553
Polo's up there, but family first.

826
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,766
Being able to tell Alina one day
that I had you and a few months later

827
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,142
I played the Women's U.S. Open.

828
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,519
I don't know if I can.
We're gonna see how things play out.

829
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,647
But ultimately, that would be
a pretty wonderful experience.

830
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,026
Louis, Ames, Alina, and I
could make up a team one day

831
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,737
and play in a tournament.
It would be incredible.

832
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,366
We are a small organization
against the big boys.

833
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,994
And last year and the year before,
we never out-horsed.

834
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,206
We keep equal footing
and that's a big credit

835
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,665
to the team behind us.

836
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,835
And that's Timmy's horsemanship also.
We are very proud of that.

837
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,878
That's the man.

838
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,507
At the end, we were close,

839
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,091
but we were not close enough.

840
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,178
A loss is a loss. What did we learn?

841
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,387
We love each other.

842
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:51,183
That's 100%. We will get better together.

843
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,893
You little cookie monster.

844
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,189
Timmy is for sure a warrior.
He goes out there.

845
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:01,235
I know he has the ability
to make his own little polo legacy.

846
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,532
I know I can be great.
I just have to get there.

847
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,161
Maybe it's not today.
Maybe it's not winning the next U.S. Open.

848
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,580
But the goal is to win a U.S. Open.

849
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,457
I'm gonna bring it home one day.

850
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,209
<i>♪ My dreams come alive ♪</i>

851
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:21,380
Kids like Timmy, Keko, Poroto,
the younger generation,

852
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,174
they make things
that we wouldn't dream possible.

853
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,343
Time for the young kids.

854
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,804
The game has picked up in speed,

855
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,889
and the players
are much more athletic now.

856
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:35,853
You're going to see a higher skill,
a more fearless risk-taking

857
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,772
than you've ever seen before
in the next generation to come.

858
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,692
The beautiful thing is
that they all wake up and dream

859
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,319
that they're going to be
the next U.S. Open winner.

860
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,405
<i>♪ My dreams come alive ♪</i>

861
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,463
"Together, they fell fast asleep."
