1
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,351
It all starts out really calm.

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,441
By game time,
you start hearing the noises.

3
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,944
People are everywhere.

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,405
The adrenaline
that goes through your body,

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,408
I've never experienced anything like that.

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,036
It's addicting.

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,121
<i>♪ To be the best,</i>
<i>You gotta beat the best ♪</i>

8
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>♪ I did that… ♪</i>

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,084
Polo is one of the most
thrilling sports that you can imagine.

10
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>♪ That's why I stand,</i>
<i>That's why I fight… ♪</i>

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,548
Speed, horses,
the amazing athletes.

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,927
Polo is not just a sport.
Polo is a lifestyle.

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>♪ I do what I wanna and I'm gonna… ♪</i>

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,726
We eat, we breathe, we sleep polo.

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,022
For sure, it's glamorous.

16
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,192
They put their Sunday hat on
and a cute outfit.

17
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,361
It's a sexy sport too.

18
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,115
Dirty, sweaty boys, riding.

19
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,873
It's not the easiest to date someone
who eats, sleeps, and breathes polo.

20
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,959
Polo can take a toll on your family.
That's no secret.

21
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,253
It'd be great to have you there
if you could make it.

22
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,423
Once we have the baby, things'll change
a little bit for me mostly.

23
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,009
I don't think
Louis' life will change much.

24
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>Everyone is competitive.</i>

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,726
<i>Whether you're a pro</i>
<i>or whether you're a sponsor,</i>

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,187
<i>you're all hoping to do the best.</i>

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,274
We have big expectations together,
so every day we have to move forward.

28
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,777
I'll do whatever I have to
because at the end of the day

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,237
I have to win.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,988
The pressure is real.

31
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,617
These players really
have to work hard to make a living.

32
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,121
I've been struggling
a little bit this year with injuries.

33
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,374
I had a lower back injury, a disc hernia.

34
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,210
There's a lot of competition.

35
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,046
Everybody is fighting
for themselves to get a job.

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,508
Our life is on the line
every time we get out there.

37
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,930
I've put more at stake this season
than I ever have in the past.

38
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,352
{\an8}The best players in the world
come to Wellington

39
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,981
from February to the end of April
to compete in the U.S. Open.

40
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,941
It's the one that everybody wants to win.

41
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,026
Everybody wants to knock off the king.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,822
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso seeking</i>
<i>his 10th U.S. Open title.</i>

43
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,365
The Michael Jordan of polo.

44
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>This is a father-son duo.</i>

45
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,536
<i>This year, they're playing</i>
<i>against each other.</i>

46
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,289
- What's it like playing against your kid?
- It's difficult.

47
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,666
And worse when you lose.

48
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,670
<i>I've seen a lot of careers ignited</i>
<i>by winning the U.S. Open.</i>

49
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,714
<i>It doesn't get any better than this.</i>

50
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,592
<i>Cambiaso! Cambiaso! Cambiaso! Goal!</i>

51
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,081
All right. So let's get this day started.

52
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,630
{\an8}I'm Timmy Dutta.
I'm born in Wellington, Florida.

53
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,006
{\an8}I'm 22 years old.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,175
I'm a professional polo player.

55
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,928
My family invested in me as a player.

56
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,679
Courses, trainers.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,642
For me, it's… it's…
it's an incredible opportunity.

58
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,021
I take my season here very serious.

59
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,648
Don't go out. Don't party.

60
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,691
Champagne's only
for the podium-type vibes.

61
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,318
That ideology, right?

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,199
It's the U.S. Open. I'm American.

63
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,118
This for me as an American,
this is my cup that I'm gonna win.

64
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,871
This is your first time
competing in the U.S. Open?

65
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,083
No, this is my fifth year.
It's a hard cup to win. It's not easy.

66
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,297
To compete at this top level,
it all starts at the barn.

67
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,341
{\an8}

68
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,350
Good girl, Monkey.

69
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,811
The game of polo.

70
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,982
{\an8}The lifestyle, everything all has to do
with the horse at the end of the day.

71
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,526
Come here.

72
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,778
He hears it. Yeah, you hear it.

73
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,863
Come on. Come on.

74
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,199
I love the game of polo. I really do.

75
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,536
{\an8}But it's the horses for me
that I really enjoy

76
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,830
because without them,
the sport's not possible.

77
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,833
I understand the care
that needs to go into these horses.

78
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,960
Physios, vets, everything, you name it.

79
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,714
It's all about how we can make
the horse better as an athlete.

80
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,597
My son is a beautiful rider.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,728
The minute Timmy
hit a polo ball…

82
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,773
{\an8}…my husband was like,
"Oh my gosh, this is gonna be our thing."

83
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,736
{\an8}My husband Tim and I are horse crazy,

84
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,238
and that's one thing we brought to Timmy.

85
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,826
I was, like, the primary parent
until Timmy was 12.

86
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,912
His father traveled a lot
while he was a baby,

87
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,289
so he was really my baby.

88
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,917
Tim is the driving force in this family.

89
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,628
Sometimes we don't agree on his style,

90
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,965
but he's for sure
the elevation behind both of us.

91
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,760
Come on, boys, 20 minutes.

92
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,762
{\an8}My father is the team owner,

93
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,724
and he helps us
and supports us and fields us, um,

94
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,559
and coaches us sometimes.

95
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,437
It can be interesting.
He's not such a soft guy.

96
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,567
I am the president and the CEO
of the Dutta Corporation.

97
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,778
We ship horses around the world.

98
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
I only believe in hard work.

99
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,951
{\an8}I drive the team.
I drive the company. I drive my family.

100
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,621
{\an8}It's very important that I play that role

101
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,333
{\an8}to make sure these guys
mentally and physically are ready to go

102
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,250
on the field.

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,419
There's Gatorade in the red cooler.

104
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,880
Growing up in India, I played polo.

105
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,049
I was born to two army officers.

106
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,302
I had the privilege
to have access to army horses.

107
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,388
Like every kid who goes to a fair,

108
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:33,351
you ride a pony, and the kid gets hooked,
and I was immediately hooked on polo.

109
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,979
{\an8}You're cleared, no?

110
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,608
Timmy has that passion from me,

111
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,986
and to see Timmy improve
is all I can do for as a father.

112
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,281
Shine. This is your day.

113
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,825
Good luck.

114
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,786
{\an8}<i>Good morning.</i>

115
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,330
{\an8}<i>We are here for the second leg</i>
<i>of the Gauntlet of Polo.</i>

116
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,750
<i>This is the 2024 USPA Gold Cup.</i>

117
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,502
<i>The Gauntlet of Polo,</i>

118
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>that's the three major tournaments</i>
<i>that we have in America.</i>

119
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,173
<i>It's the CV Whitney Cup,</i>

120
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
<i>the Gold Cup, and the U.S. Open.</i>

121
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,512
<i>And the U.S. Open has been</i>
<i>and always will be</i>

122
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>the number one</i>
<i>most sought-after trophy to win.</i>

123
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,851
<i>Since all three tournaments</i>
<i>are played back-to-back,</i>

124
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,478
<i>teams often use</i>
<i>the CV Whitney Cup and the Gold Cup</i>

125
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,524
<i>in order to fine-tune their team</i>
<i>to get ready to try to win the U.S. Open.</i>

126
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,861
<i>Today, we've got</i>
<i>La Fe taking on Dutta Corp.</i>

127
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,197
<i>Here comes Timmy.</i>
<i>He's got this one. Looking good.</i>

128
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,366
<i>Taking this one towards the goal.</i>

129
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>He winds up,</i>
<i>fires at the goal, off the post.</i>

130
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,330
<i>Still in play.</i>
<i>Oh, man, what a terrible luck play there.</i>

131
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,082
Can't have these fucking miss hits.

132
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,460
I look at it,
I'm investing in Timmy's future

133
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,464
and giving him the opportunity
that he well deserves.

134
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,717
This is his dream,
and I'm definitely living it.

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,387
It's my dream as well,
but it puts a lot of pressure.

136
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,015
If I fail at this,

137
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,268
I'm not just failing for me.

138
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,312
I'm also failing in his eyes,

139
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,856
and obviously no son wants to feel that.

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,483
Stupid play.

141
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,526
He wants me
to be a better player,

142
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,694
which I try to be.

143
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,154
Go back, Timmy, go.

144
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,616
But he has his ideas
of how to do it, and I have my ideas.

145
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,576
He needs
to get rid of Louis' blocks.

146
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,745
One thing we see eye-to-eye on,

147
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,914
I'm playing against
the best guys in the world,

148
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,457
and I gotta go beat them.

149
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,255
<i>Polo is a sport</i>
<i>that includes four players on each team.</i>

150
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>They're on horseback.</i>

151
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,969
{\an8}<i>You play on a field</i>
<i>that is nine football fields large.</i>

152
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,390
<i>And the goal is to put the ball</i>
<i>between the goal posts.</i>

153
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,642
Goal!

154
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,186
<i>The goal posts are 24 feet apart.</i>

155
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,021
<i>There's no net.</i>

156
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,233
<i>The ball can go as high as you want.</i>
<i>It just has to go through the goal posts.</i>

157
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,401
<i>A period in polo</i>
<i>is called a chukker.</i>

158
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,531
{\an8}<i>We have six chukkers in a game.</i>
<i>They last seven and a half minutes.</i>

159
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,453
<i>You'll change horses</i>
<i>mid-chukker, kinda like an F1 pit stop.</i>

160
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,081
<i>Your horse loses steam,</i>
<i>you run over to the sidelines,</i>

161
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>jump on a fresh horse and continue.</i>

162
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,376
<i>They don't stop the game for it.</i>

163
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,672
The strategy is to let
the horse recover,

164
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,258
then I have my good horse back again
to compete again.

165
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>Dutta Corp</i>
<i>is looking confident.</i>

166
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,136
{\an8}<i>Three-goal lead back on the board.</i>

167
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,848
<i>Now, Timmy wins the throw</i>
<i>and takes off running right here</i>

168
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,600
<i>and then loses the play momentarily.</i>

169
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,143
<i>The play, here's a back shot.</i>

170
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,063
<i>It's gonna be Lucas Alberdi</i>
<i>by himself coming in.</i>

171
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,774
<i>Right to left and sink it.</i>

172
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,902
{\an8}<i>That's just what La Fe needs</i>
<i>to start a comeback right here and now.</i>

173
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,654
{\an8}<i>Taken here by Lucas.</i>

174
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,240
{\an8}<i>He shoots and scores…</i>

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,368
{\an8}<i>and that's a goal.</i>

176
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,038
{\an8}

177
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,250
{\an8}<i>And for the first time today,</i>
<i>we've got a tie ball game.</i>

178
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,751
{\an8}Hit the ball, man.

179
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,669
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

180
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,297
<i>Dutta Corp is starting to lose their grip</i>
<i>on what should have been</i>

181
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,590
<i>a certain win for them.</i>

182
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,883
{\an8}<i>La Fe has the lead.</i>

183
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,468
{\an8}Stop fucking fouling.

184
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,930
{\an8}<i>They gotta go pretty quickly.</i>

185
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,309
{\an8}<i>Dutta doesn't have time here.</i>
<i>You gotta go for it.</i>

186
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,269
<i>Here we go. Is it over?</i>

187
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,565
<i>No, that's gonna be</i>
<i>a penalty shot.</i>

188
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,068
<i>Dutta will get a chance to tie this game</i>
<i>with five seconds left to go on the clock.</i>

189
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,370
{\an8}- <i>Right down the middle.</i>
 Yes!

190
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,457
We were winning most of the game,
all the way to the end.

191
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,417
They came back, and-- Fucking annoying.

192
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,253
<i>We are tied up</i>
<i>with ten goals apiece.</i>

193
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,964
<i>That means we are going</i>
<i>into sudden death overtime.</i>

194
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,634
<i>The next goal scored</i>
<i>is gonna win this polo game.</i>

195
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,053
She's done. Who you want for spare?

196
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,221
I focus on all our horses.

197
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:44,226
I count how many minutes they're playing,
when it's time for them to change.

198
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,021
I'm regulating
which horses he's getting on,

199
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,731
but of course he overrides.

200
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,234
If he wants to play a horse
more than the other, it's his choice.

201
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,737
<i>Timmy Dutta, Dutta Corp.</i>

202
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,989
<i>They've got all the cards</i>
<i>to make magic happen.</i>

203
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,658
<i>Let's see if they can pull this off.</i>

204
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,787
My horse, Chevy, he was tired.
He already played twice that game.

205
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,121
I made a crucial mistake.

206
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,416
I jumped on an unknown horse that
I've never really played in the States.

207
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,460
It's not the same connection.

208
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,758
When I went to hit this next shot,

209
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,886
she kinda just, like, got a little uneasy.

210
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,556
And I hit it two yards too short.

211
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,517
<i>That's gonna come up short.</i>

212
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,020
<i>The horse just stumbled,</i>
<i>and it's gonna be picked off right here.</i>

213
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,481
<i>Nicely done by Lucas Alberdi</i>
<i>for the win right here.</i>

214
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,482
<i>And he got it!</i>

215
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,694
{\an8}<i>What a goal by Lucas Alberdi</i>
<i>to win the game here.</i>

216
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,862
Let's go!

217
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,906
Let's go!

218
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,414
He didn't play
three other horses sitting here.

219
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,294
It's a dumb move.

220
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,296
Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.

221
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,928
<i>What a massive win for La Fe</i>
<i>and for their patron, Louis Devaleix.</i>

222
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,846
Let's fucking go!

223
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,807
<i>They're gonna have</i>
<i>great momentum going into the U.S. Open.</i>

224
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,155
I own a healthcare software company
in the behavioral health space.

225
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
{\an8}We're a fast-growing company
and proud of it.

226
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,450
Fuck yeah, baby.

227
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,994
She helped close an account
we've been trying to get.

228
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,663
With the rest of my time, I play polo.

229
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,123
Love to play polo.

230
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,876
<i>♪ All my life, been grindin' all my life ♪</i>

231
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,211
<i>♪ Sacrificed, hustle paid the price… ♪</i>

232
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,673
Most polo players start
at a really young age.

233
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
I was almost 40 years old.

234
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,305
I took a lesson, and I just fell in love
with every part of the sport.

235
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,682
And from then on,
it took off pretty quick.

236
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,310
It's the best thing
that's ever happened in my life.

237
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,937
{\an8}Louis is super competitive
and super athletic

238
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,898
{\an8}and comes from playing professional golf.

239
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,693
My father was a big golfer

240
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:02,364
and provided me with all the support
necessary to accomplish my dream,

241
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,326
which at the time
was to be a professional golfer.

242
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,078
I played mini tour golf for two years.

243
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,123
It's nice when
you make it to the PGA Tour,

244
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,835
but if you're not making it,
it can be a pretty tough and lonely life,

245
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,837
and he was there with me
every step of the way.

246
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,673
He worked his ass off.

247
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,260
I remember he'd fly from… from China
and different regions of the world

248
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,223
just to… to watch me play one hole,
and then off he went again.

249
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,101
My father passed when I was mid-20s.

250
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,772
Losing him was fucking terrible.
I mean, it was horrible.

251
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,691
It just didn't feel right
to try to continue the dream,

252
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,946
and so it was time
for me to get a real job.

253
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,540
- How often are you in the office?
- Three, four days a week.

254
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,168
Ideally, it would just be
the family and… and… and polo forever.

255
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,422
Like today, I spent,
you know, most of my day on calls.

256
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,304
Polo kind of gives me hope
that I can accomplish something

257
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,932
that I didn't get to accomplish
in other sports.

258
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,017
But I have to work to play polo.

259
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,813
Most teams spend,
like, five million dollars

260
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,565
just for these few months.

261
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:22,319
We spend a tiny fraction of that,
which still to us is monumental.

262
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,407
My wife and I sold our dream home
so that we could take the profits

263
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,451
from that house
in order to play the season.

264
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,746
We're making financial sacrifices
that most people wouldn't make,

265
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,791
and they probably think it's crazy,
I still think it's crazy sometimes,

266
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,794
but at the same time,
you've got to give it a fucking shot.

267
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,715
Three or four months in from when
I really started sticking balling

268
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,801
and playing some small matches,
I said I wanna play in the U.S. Open.

269
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,846
I started the La Fe team
and became patron.

270
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,895
The way professional polo works,
there's an owner of the team

271
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:00,024
{\an8}that we call the patron,
which loves polo, loves horses,

272
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,360
{\an8}and facilitates the, uh,
funds for the team.

273
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,448
{\an8}So they pay for the pros,
they buy horses,

274
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,241
{\an8}they pay for travel, for the vets.

275
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,493
{\an8}And they get to play with us.

276
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,997
{\an8}Think of, uh, like,
Mark Cuban, uh, owning the Mavericks,

277
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,582
{\an8}but actually playing inside the game.

278
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,295
{\an8}Generally, it is one person
paying for the whole team.

279
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,340
{\an8}I've heard rumors of people
spending in excess of ten million dollars.

280
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,592
{\an8}It depends upon the level
in which you're playing.

281
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,930
How do I fit in
in the polo world?

282
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,641
I'm not too sure I fit in really well.
I don't really care actually.

283
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,271
Oh, Louis is definitely not
the typical "polo sponsor."

284
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,068
For most teams,
you can kind of spot who the patron is.

285
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,195
And the La Fe, you can't.

286
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,615
Louis is the biggest one on there. Madman.

287
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,160
Definitely lets his temper
get in the way of some of his game.

288
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,078
Fuck!

289
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,372
He's intimidating.

290
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,797
{\an8}Let's just call it what it is.
He's just all muscle.

291
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,216
Ah, shit!
I fuckin' lost it! Goddamn it!

292
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,345
Growing up, you know,
my father kind of pushed really hard.

293
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,973
It always felt
like you weren't achieving enough.

294
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:19,269
That mentality to try to win
and just be better was projected into me.

295
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,984
And now, I want to kill every single team
that… that's playing out there right now.

296
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,032
{\an8}That's one of those things.
I'm like, I couldn't look.

297
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,619
I had him first. I had him in the bump.
And then he came through on the bump.

298
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,037
<i>It's gonna be picked off.</i>

299
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,000
And he went to the near side,
and I went down to hook him.

300
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,964
He slid it under,
and he just touched the ball.

301
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,803
That was really stupid of him.

302
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,266
I think my dad's home.

303
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,644
There's nobody
harder on Timmy than Tim.

304
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,439
I go toe-to-toe
with Tim on it all the time.

305
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,192
If there was one thing that I could tweak,

306
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,111
it would be the…

307
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,572
the criticism.

308
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,495
Today was very important to win,
and we didn't.

309
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,540
We were up by two.
We had him for most of the sixth.

310
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,751
They just came back
in the last three minutes.

311
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,461
Yeah, that's all it takes.

312
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,967
- Don't be negative, Tim.
- Not negative, Susie. Just the reality.

313
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,678
The whole goal
is to make this kid better

314
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,765
and to make his handicap rise
and to get him experienced.

315
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,060
Too many handoffs didn't go well.
The transitions were not right.

316
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:46,607
Placings, fouling, late to the play.
We all have to wake up. But…

317
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,110
A young athlete like him,

318
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,529
that kind of money being spent on you,
it's real.

319
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,990
The… the pressure is real.

320
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,996
I live in pressure,
running my business for 37 years,

321
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,206
and it's just deliver.

322
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,250
- That's how winners do it.
- Yeah.

323
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,003
I'm his biggest cheerleader

324
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,089
and his biggest critic.

325
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,133
We don't sugarcoat each other,
and he only gets the truth.

326
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,763
We're not creating flower childs
who needs a therapist

327
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,265
and a 1-800 number
to tell him how great he is.

328
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,476
No, that's not how you win.

329
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,977
We're here for one thing, to win.

330
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,773
I think he should focus
on the first game of the Open.

331
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,941
That's my opinion.

332
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,792
U.S. Open draw
just looks like some cocktail party.

333
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,085
But at the end of the day,

334
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,170
it's where
the tournament bracket's decided.

335
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,049
All the teams are there.

336
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,386
It's where you find out
which teams you gotta beat to win.

337
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,935
- Do you feel lucky today?
- No.

338
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm not drawing.

339
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,564
No, tonight he is. No.

340
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,857
Tim is coming or?

341
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,108
No, he's in Ocala.

342
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,152
- Nice.
- Susie's here. Bro.

343
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,320
He'd drop you in the drawing
and start saying fuck…

344
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,406
You fucking piece of shit.
You disappointment!

345
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,158
You're a disappointment to this family.

346
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,118
- Because you lose the draw?
- Yeah!

347
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,081
For all these major tournaments,
we have a draw.

348
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,125
{\an8}It's a placement in the tournament.

349
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,629
Nobody has made a schedule
and pitted Team A against B.

350
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,923
The names are pulled out of a hat.

351
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,718
A plays B
only because of the luck of the draw.

352
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,596
This year, we have nine teams.

353
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,932
So they've come up
with this nine-star draw.

354
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,268
Each team is gonna play four games.

355
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:51,315
After that, then the top four teams
are gonna advance to the semifinals.

356
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,818
The winner of the semifinals
play against each other in the finals.

357
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,116
- They said this one's gonna be different.
- Why?

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,536
- I don't know. My mom was telling me…
- Your mom?

359
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,497
- What the fuck does she know?
- That's what I would say.

360
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,000
There's like balloon popping.
I was like, "What?"

361
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,669
They're gonna do it
like the U.S. Women's Open.

362
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,838
- They had to pop the balloon.
- Oh, yeah?

363
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:19,384
This year, for some reason,
they decided to do something different.

364
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,013
Every team chooses a balloon, pops it,

365
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:27,184
and inside there's a number that tells you
where you fall in the bracket.

366
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,270
So… very strange.

367
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,315
- I'm not doing it. You're doing it.
- No, I'm not popping it.

368
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,281
We knew that we needed
a good draw to have a chance.

369
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,453
We knew it was going to be difficult.
It's all nine super tough teams.

370
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,873
We were trying to have a drink
and relax a little bit.

371
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,127
But it's difficult
because you're all like,

372
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,131
"What's gonna happen in the next
five minutes? Who are we gonna play?"

373
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,929
Good evening.
Welcome to the 2024 U.S. Open draw.

374
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,932
We're gonna draw teams alphabetical order.
You'll come up.

375
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,269
{\an8}There's an envelope in the balloons.
We'll pop the balloon.

376
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,105
I'm not popping the balloon.
You're gonna pop the balloon.

377
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,565
Without any further ado,
we'll jump into it.

378
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,277
Clearwater, you're on the top
of the list here.

379
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,194
Whoa!

380
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,904
Number one.

381
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,282
Coca-Cola, we're looking for you next.

382
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,076
Good call.

383
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:26,994
Dutta.

384
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,289
Dear God,
what balloon do you want?

385
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,798
Whoa. A fake out. I thought
she was going for it. That was it.

386
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,598
Let's see what you got.
What is it?

387
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,518
- Four.
- Number four. Now La Fe.

388
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,023
Oh man, that man knew exactly what to do.

389
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,737
I wanna play against
these motherfuckers too.

390
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,867
- Eight.
- Do we play against them? Fuck.

391
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,208
This year,
all the teams are incredibly difficult.

392
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,670
There's not one team you say,
"I wanna play because it's gonna be easy."

393
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,550
- It is what is!
- It is what is!

394
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,052
It is what is.

395
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,346
We had an okay draw.

396
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,973
At the end of the day, pretty much
all the teams had an okay draw.

397
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,811
Can we get the fuck outta here now or no?
Let's go get drunk.

398
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,107
Except for Coca-Cola,
they drew the toughest teams.

399
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,694
Clearwater, Pilot, Valiente,
just Adolfo Cambiaso himself,

400
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,697
and Dolfina with his son, Poroto.

401
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,620
To play against Adolfo Cambiaso
is a… is a pleasure.

402
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,789
I'd be lying
if I say I don't want to beat him.

403
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,834
<i>Here goes Cambiaso. Another goal!</i>

404
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,755
There's a rivalry
with everyone against Adolfo.

405
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,135
Everybody wants to knock off the king.

406
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,389
He is so fast.

407
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,599
So intense.

408
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,520
That motherfucker wants to win
more than I do.

409
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,400
<i>He's won the U.S. Open</i>
<i>nine times throughout his career.</i>

410
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,737
<i>Adolfo Cambiaso is</i>
<i>the greatest player of all time.</i>

411
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,826
<i>Goal!</i>

412
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,457
{\an8}I'm Adolfo Cambiaso,
polo player from Argentina.

413
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:43,130
I wake up every morning
liking what I do.

414
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:47,384
I like to be around horses,
and I love to compete.

415
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,136
I don't know if I like to win or…

416
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,430
or the answer would be I hate losing.

417
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,224
<i>Cambiaso. Cambiaso. Cambiaso. Goal!</i>

418
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,189
If you put together the Argentina,
English, and American season,

419
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,485
he won more than anybody
in the world by a mile.

420
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,487
<i>Cambiaso shoots. He scores.</i>

421
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,074
<i>That's another win at the U.S. Open</i>
<i>for the master Adolfo Cambiaso.</i>

422
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,452
He was handmade
by God to play polo.

423
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,954
He thinks so much faster
than everyone else.

424
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,414
His hand-eye coordination,

425
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,333
{\an8}he's got all those
natural physical abilities.

426
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:25,797
Adolfo, he was one of the first,
you know, young, amazing polo freaks.

427
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,674
He is a chess player.

428
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,012
Two years ago,
Cambiaso comes to watch our practice.

429
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,056
I get out of a horse, her name was Opeta.

430
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,058
He's like,
"Opeta did really good for you."

431
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,270
And then I get off the next one, Misica.
He goes,

432
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,772
"Misica's doing well
for you too this season, huh?"

433
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,901
He knew every single one
of my motherfucking horses.

434
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,111
I don't even know
what my fucking horses' names are.

435
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,113
Some of them.
But I don't know all of them.

436
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,783
He's got your fucking beat
before you even get on the field.

437
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,331
He is the Michael Jordan
of our game.

438
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,582
There's no question about it.

439
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,002
On top of that, he has a son,

440
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,046
so you've got two of them.

441
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,884
Poroto, he's the son
of the best player in the history of polo.

442
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,428
Those are big shoes to fill, right?

443
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,350
He is, I think,
even more talented than the father.

444
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,060
He is remarkable.

445
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,604
{\an8}I started playing because of my dad.

446
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,483
I went to all the games,
and he always wins.

447
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,652
I had more pressure

448
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:33,657
because I was the son
of one of the greatest of the sport.

449
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,951
But I don't think too much on that.

450
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:41,498
I, uh… I want to be better all the time
and to win at everything.

451
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,335
What's the secret
to beating the Cambiasos?

452
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,715
Uh, I don't think there's no secret.
You need luck.

453
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,592
You need a lot of luck.

454
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,348
{\an8}I love those aviators,
they're frameless on the bottom.

455
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,683
They're comfortable.

456
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,518
They're a very nice, light weight.

457
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,270
What do you think?

458
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,773
- Looks like the same ones you have…
- Ten pairs of them.

459
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,443
She's more than my mom.
She's my friend. So that's a big thing.

460
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,028
She's a really good friend of mine.

461
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,991
- Do you have a list?
- Yeah, I need to buy gloves.

462
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:20,579
We're super bonded.
You know, he's a Mommy's boy.

463
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,580
Really.

464
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,873
This is a size seven for you. Try 'em on.

465
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,376
Can't get my hand in there.

466
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,211
It doesn't feel like it'd be sticky.

467
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,922
No. And the crazy part is… that softness.

468
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,924
Yeah, it feels soft, right?
It feels, like, slick.

469
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,011
You grab the reins
and it automatically grips on.

470
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,263
 Oh, that's nice.

471
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,473
They just came out
with a schedule,

472
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,643
and it looks like
we are the first game of the U.S. Open.

473
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,228
We're the first game?

474
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,315
You guys gonna try my lineup?

475
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,067
We will try it in the practice, yeah.

476
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,153
- If it works or not works.
- Cool.

477
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,030
Timmy's doing a great job at four,

478
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,868
but I'm thinking that maybe
he could be better off up front.

479
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,205
In a game, every player has
a different position on the field.

480
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,083
You have number one,
number two, number three, number four.

481
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,127
And those numbers
are on the back of the jersey.

482
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,921
Four is the most defense-oriented.

483
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,466
Three would be the quarterback.

484
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,927
Two is kind of the warrior
who helps make plays happen.

485
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,139
Number one is the person
that goes to goal.

486
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,143
I mean,
definitely I've done well in the back

487
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,604
and I've proven myself in the back, um…

488
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,064
It's the polar opposite.

489
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,900
Number four,
I gotta be in a defensive posture.

490
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,110
And one's
an optimistic ideology of the game.

491
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,154
Scoring goals
and pulling the team forward.

492
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,740
You go from one program in your head
to completely another.

493
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,326
- It's different.
- To put you in one?

494
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,327
It's…

495
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,039
It's different.
I haven't played one in a few years.

496
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,291
It's gonna bring
a whole different dynamic to the team.

497
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,336
I'm not the polo coach,
but I see a lot,

498
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,297
and I feel like my opinion is valuable.

499
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,508
I still want you to try it. Just…

500
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,134
- Well, it doesn't hurt.
- No.

501
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,639
It might be good
for his confidence to score the goals.

502
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,767
To, like, be able to raise your mallet,
"Yes, I got another one."

503
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,770
This is a big tournament.

504
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:14,943
I mean, it's a lot of money for us.
We are choosing to spend it on our son.

505
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,197
The patron is really Tim,
but we're giving Timmy the job.

506
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,783
I mean, there's pressure on that part too.

507
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,035
The first game's gonna be difficult, but…

508
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,246
- Maybe with you at one.
- We'll see.

509
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,081
We'll definitely put on a show.

510
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,083
From the outside, it's gonna look good.

511
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,001
 So that's all that matters.

512
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,925
We need to win to set the tone
for the rest of the tournament.

513
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,571
My dad was super military,

514
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,989
uh, so…

515
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,741
- Your dad was--
- Oh, yeah.

516
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,661
My dad was the equivalent
to the Navy SEALs in the French Army,

517
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,998
and, you know,
everything had to be pretty strict.

518
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,504
It was tough
to get close to my father, yeah.

519
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,134
I wasn't his friend,
you know, so.

520
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,637
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

521
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,183
- How are you, my son?
- Hello. Good.

522
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,560
{\an8}See you… next week?

523
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,898
I think you have a duty as a parent to do
whatever is necessary to make sure

524
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,942
that, you know, you give your child
the best chance possible

525
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,236
at making something of themselves.

526
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,365
- How was school today?
- Good.

527
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,327
I colored and I made clay.

528
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,579
What did you color?

529
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,166
Um, I colored… Iron Man.

530
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,083
Iron Man.

531
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,127
That's the…

532
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,005
It's the hero of the month, Iron Man.

533
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,424
Your dad,
does he remind you of any superheroes?

534
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,550
Um…

535
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,010
Hulk.

536
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,095
I just think he's super strong.

537
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,223
Oh. I'll take the Hulk.

538
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,811
My pops, he was tough,
and he pushed me a great deal.

539
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,940
I do raise Ames so that he understands

540
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:21,110
that losing is…
is not preferable over winning.

541
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,949
Although, I'm a little bit more subtle
than my father was.

542
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,332
{\an8}-

543
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,416
{\an8}

544
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,001
My love?

545
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,381
- Hello.
- Hi, boys, how are you?

546
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,715
Come here, give me a kiss.

547
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,384
- How was your day at school?
- Good.

548
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,552
Can I see your cape?

549
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,596
Which superhero are you today?
Uh, you're Ryan?

550
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,515
That's cool.

551
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,976
- And Iron Man.
- Yeah?

552
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,769
And Iron Man.

553
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,105
 How was practice?

554
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,023
Uh, it was good.

555
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,818
Some of the horses are a little heavy,
we'll see how they…

556
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,444
Why heavy?

557
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,989
- Why?
- 'Cause they haven't been playing?

558
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,365
Yeah, just like shit.

559
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,496
I'm a polo player,
and I'm also an attorney.

560
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,584
It's very tempting to want to jump into
the polo world right out of school.

561
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,879
But I wanted to kind of secure
my career first.

562
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,298
So, I went to law school, passed the bar,

563
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,509
and then I went on to work
in Chicago at a law firm.

564
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,889
And while working in Chicago, I realized,
"Okay, I need to have horses in my life."

565
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,391
Pam is awesome at polo.

566
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,144
She's won four U.S. Women's Opens.

567
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,896
She loves polo.

568
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,940
When I was a kid,

569
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,734
my siblings
and my neighbors would joke

570
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,279
that once in a blue moon
when I got grumpy, they'd call me Map.

571
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,198
Who is on the polo field?
Pam or Map?

572
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,533
Oh, Pam, for sure.

573
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,701
Bullshit.

574
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,536
Louis! I don't do any--

575
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,998
While I'm on the field, I never cuss
or yell at girls or get angry.

576
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,082
I get aggressive.

577
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,543
I stood by the sidelines
when you won the U.S. Open last year.

578
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,504
Whenever you didn't have your way,
you were cursing, pissed off.

579
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,757
- Who are you talking about?
- My wife.

580
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,885
Never, ever in my life have
I cussed on the field at another girl.

581
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,844
Ever. Ever. Ever.

582
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,013
He's making me sound like a monster.

583
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,683
No, you're not a monster.
You're just a determined athlete.

584
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,562
No, but not a classless athlete.
I don't yell at people.

585
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,773
Never in my life
have I screamed at the girls.

586
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,150
Yes, of course,
get out of my way, move, whatever.

587
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,778
But never, ever have I lost my head
cussing at them.

588
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,613
She acts nice and everything,

589
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,240
and you see this sweet lady,
but she's got a side of her

590
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,617
you don't wanna mess with.

591
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,748
Oh, now you like me
after you think I'm such a bully.

592
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,291
Wow.

593
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,502
Louis' great and I love him.

594
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,545
Three months after meeting,
we were engaged.

595
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,007
Getting engaged in three months
was not aligned

596
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,802
with my personality
or something that anyone in my family

597
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,097
would have ever thought that I would do.

598
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,598
I didn't think I would do that.

599
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,975
It wasn't something like,

600
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,768
"Here she goes
doing something crazy."

601
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,604
No, I don't do things crazy.
I'm not a crazy person,

602
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,524
so I think getting engaged in three months

603
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,277
definitely, you know,
threw people for a loop, but here we are.

604
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,405
When Pam and I met,

605
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,492
the first thing I told her
was that I had this awesome little man.

606
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:19,205
She immediately fell in love with him,
and she's been super supportive of Ames.

607
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,208
And now we're pregnant
with our first baby.

608
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,460
Things'll change
a little bit for me, mostly.

609
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,713
I don't think Louis' life
will change much.

610
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,382
 No, I think she's right.

611
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,592
Just a different chapter in my life,
I suppose.

612
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,139
Um, so I don't think I'll be playing
nearly as much as perhaps I once was.

613
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,307
Right now,
I think the things we balance most

614
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,101
are polo, work, and family.

615
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,853
When a newborn's in the picture,

616
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,440
I think you can kind of pick two.

617
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,736
Priorities will shift,
but that's, you know, natural.

618
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,988
I think we'll do a good job.

619
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,990
It's not rocket science.

620
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,034
You ready to eat?

621
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,036
Where am I sitting?

622
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,122
You're gonna sit right here
in between me and Daddy.

623
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,216
<i>Good morning, everyone,</i>

624
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,095
<i>and welcome to the National Polo Center</i>
<i>here in Wellington, Florida.</i>

625
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,139
<i>We are ready to start the U.S. Open.</i>

626
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,224
<i>This is the final leg</i>
<i>of the Gauntlet of Polo</i>

627
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,310
<i>and the one everyone wants to win.</i>

628
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,874
{\an8}<i>Park Place. Unbelievable.</i>

629
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,544
{\an8}<i>That team has some really, really</i>
<i>super horses.</i>

630
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,631
They're one of the favorites
and won last year.

631
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,717
{\an8}Dutta Corp, they're an underdog team,
for sure.

632
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,053
{\an8}You gotta respect a team like Dutta Corp

633
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:01,015
{\an8}that maybe don't have the budget that some
of these other bigger organizations have.

634
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,268
They don't have the numbers of horses,

635
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,355
but the fact that they're right there
means a lot.

636
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,941
I put Chevy as the first spare.

637
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,401
Play on the first chukker.
And then comes back in the fifth.

638
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,988
- You have to open the game.
- That's what I think and wanted.

639
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,326
Especially you're playing number one,
you have to have the push.

640
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,662
All gas, no brakes.

641
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,748
We decided Timmy's
gonna play number one.

642
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:31,420
We were lacking attack,
so we'll see how it pans out.

643
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,091
They act like
it was their idea.

644
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,926
Men.

645
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,431
Today's the day.
We've waited a year for this.

646
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,518
Let's go play our best game.

647
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,778
Love you, son.

648
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,031
Enjoy. Go do it.

649
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,215
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>The U.S. Open is underway.</i>

650
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,010
<i>First ball of the day in play.</i>

651
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,888
<i>Ulloa… pounds that ball up.</i>

652
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,140
<i>He's looking for Vignoli here.</i>

653
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,683
<i>Picks it up on the near side.</i>

654
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,186
<i>Tries to swat it back to Borodin.</i>
<i>Couldn't get it.</i>

655
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,855
<i>Stolen away by Garcia Del Rio</i>
<i>for the team in white.</i>

656
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,109
<i>Accelerates, fires a pass forward.</i>
<i>He's looking for Joaquin.</i>

657
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,861
<i>It's gonna be stolen away again.</i>

658
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,033
Let's go. Get that ball.

659
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,285
Come on, Nino. Hit.

660
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,413
<i>Hilario looking</i>
<i>to line up a shot on goal here.</i>

661
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,666
<i>Now winds up and shoots.</i>
<i>That ball is rolling. It's rolling.</i>

662
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,627
<i>It's looking like</i>
<i>it's gonna make it through.</i>

663
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,548
<i>But look at that.</i>

664
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,009
I think this is gonna be
a close game.

665
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,093
Hit it!

666
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,472
<i>Timmy Dutta, he's got</i>
<i>a little bit of space to work with.</i>

667
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,098
<i>He's gonna accelerate towards goal.</i>

668
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,392
<i>Andrey hurrying up</i>
<i>to try to put a stop to it.</i>

669
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,853
- No!
- Hit the ball, Timmy.

670
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,313
<i>The ball goes to the right.</i>

671
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,774
<i>Borodin gets a hold of it.</i>
<i>But Dutta gets back to it.</i>

672
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,736
<i>Timmy Dutta now in the red zone</i>
<i>for Dutta Corp. Shoots and scores.</i>

673
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,740
<i>First flood of the day</i>
<i>drawn by Timmy Dutta.</i>

674
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,408
{\an8}There we go.

675
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:25,952
{\an8}Let's go.

676
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,579
It might take a minute
for him to get used to this,

677
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,289
but he's doing a good job.

678
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:35,670
<i>And ball's back in play.</i>
<i>Here comes Britos to win this throw.</i>

679
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,838
<i>Trying to get it around past Timmy Dutta.</i>

680
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,342
<i>We've got</i>
<i>a whistle stopping the play.</i>

681
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,969
<i>Penalty going against Dutta Corp.</i>

682
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,136
Take your time!

683
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,181
<i>Penalty two for Park Place.</i>

684
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,392
<i>Here comes Hilario.</i>

685
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,103
<i>Drawing first blood of the day</i>
<i>for Park Place.</i>

686
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,187
Unbelievable.

687
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,274
{\an8}Hit the ball, Timmy. Hit the fucking ball.

688
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,901
The guy behind me tried to hook me.
What do you want?

689
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,528
Stop fucking fouling!

690
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,239
I won't lie to you
that my dad's a lot.

691
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,826
There's always something
to argue about.

692
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,828
I get the brunt of it all.

693
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,124
And I don't know
how much longer I can keep fighting.

694
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,218
<i>Ball's put back into play.</i>

695
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,722
<i>Gonna be picked up by Timmy.</i>

696
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,516
There we go. Here we go.
Come on!

697
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,769
<i>Going to the goal.</i>
<i>He's got nothing between him and the goal.</i>

698
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,937
<i>Can he get it done?</i>

699
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,690
<i>Dutta in the red zone. Timmy Dutta.</i>

700
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,401
Timmy!

701
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,577
This year,
the big story is a father-son duo.

702
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,788
Adolfo Cambiaso and his son,
Poroto Cambiaso.

703
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,834
<i>Cambiaso. Cambiaso. Cambiaso. Goal!</i>
<i>De La Urquina.</i>

704
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,463
Cambiasos have a huge target
on their back because they always win.

705
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,300
I want my dad playing in the final
against our team, La Dolfina.

706
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,053
It's about him now. I want to beat him.

707
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,140
I heard from Mom that you have
a friend coming in from Paris.

708
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,268
I decided to invite her and sometimes
you gotta do what you gotta do.

709
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,773
Hi, everybody!
Welcome to Pamela's bri-- baby shower.

710
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,816
The AC just went out. Holy hot.

711
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,568
What is wrong with you?

712
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,614
You don't understand women. You can't
do that when someone is pregnant.

713
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,533
What is this like?

714
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,703
I know that I can still compete
against these young,

715
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,497
great kids that are coming on.

716
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,957
It's easy to kinda second guess yourself.

717
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,627
They are screwing up.

718
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,921
Polo is what
I want to do my whole life.

719
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,756
The only plan I have.

720
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,051
I'm late to play
the biggest game of the year.

721
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,889
Tensions
and pressures are pretty high.

722
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,182
{\an8}Take your fucking mic off.

723
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,892
{\an8}- They're filming you.
 Take it off.

724
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:59,188
The whole season has been hard.
Ending like this was a little sad.

725
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,566
<i>- </i><i>Just what they need to have happen.</i>
- Yes!

726
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,693
<i>Wow, you won't see that often.</i>

727
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,738
<i>This is truly anybody's game now.</i>
