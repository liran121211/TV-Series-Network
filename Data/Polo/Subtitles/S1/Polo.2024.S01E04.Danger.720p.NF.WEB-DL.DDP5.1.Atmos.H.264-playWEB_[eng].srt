1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,427
Since I've been playing polo,
I've broken both my ankles,

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,596
broke my jaw, my nose two times,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,183
some fingers, broke my collarbone,

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,270
blew up my teeth, tore my left knee up.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,569
{\an8}If I could do it all over again,
I'd do it all over again.

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,417
What the hell just happened?

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,129
Why do people keep partaking in it?

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,549
People are absolutely in love with horses.

9
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:57,057
{\an8}They're like the perfect balance
between elegance and power.

10
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,854
{\an8}I don't know, you feel it.
You feel different. You feel you can fly.

11
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,567
{\an8}Imagine going on a horse
at 30, 35 miles an hour

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,944
{\an8}with someone coming at you at full speed.

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,863
{\an8}There's a little bit of danger involved.

14
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,284
{\an8}Polo's considered the second
most dangerous sport behind motor sports.

15
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,662
{\an8}The trust between man
and animal is incredible.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,916
It just gives you goosebumps sometimes
when you're watching the game,

17
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,461
to see them and how they're capable
of avoiding injury.

18
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,881
But when you're seeing a battle play out
at the highest goal level,

19
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,550
anything can happen at a moment's notice

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,136
that could end their careers
in a heartbeat.

21
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,604
Valiente.

22
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,233
{\an8}One of the best teams in the tournament.

23
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,944
And we're gonna win it.

24
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,862
It should be good.

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,200
{\an8}Against Clearwater,
we were on, we were on point,

26
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,661
{\an8}the team was firing,
all of us were connecting.

27
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,079
{\an8}We were doing our jobs.

28
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,457
{\an8}We have to get back to that feeling
of that we're invincible

29
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,751
{\an8}kind of ideology that we can do it,

30
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,504
{\an8}'cause Valiente,
they're the best in the world.

31
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,090
It's always a pleasure to play against

32
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,384
the GOAT himself.

33
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,179
To beat Adolfo, don't get Adolfo angry.

34
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,599
If he gets pissed off,
he will score goals on you all day long.

35
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,853
{\an8}Obviously, it's Adolfo Cambiaso.

36
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,357
{\an8}He's the Michael Jordan of our sport,
or he's the GOAT.

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,818
I get to tell my kids
I played against the GOAT.

38
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,362
Now he's getting older,

39
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,740
you try to use that always
to your advantage.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,075
I want to beat him.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,910
That's… I want to beat him.

42
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,371
{\an8}<i>Timmy Dutta playing number one.</i>

43
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,956
{\an8}<i>Since they switched their lineup</i>

44
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,626
{\an8}<i>and they changed it up to this version,</i>
<i>the team has gone much better.</i>

45
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,212
<i>Adolfo, you can always tell it's him</i>

46
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,048
<i>with that Argentine flag helmet</i>
<i>he likes to sport.</i>

47
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,050
Today is the day.

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,097
Last time we played them,
we went into overtime.

49
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,391
{\an8}I was in the back. Now I'm in the front.

50
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,645
{\an8}Tomas is back too for this game,
so… …score the goals.

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,855
That's all I gotta do.

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,443
Score the goals
so Tomas doesn't yell at me.

53
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,071
It'll be tough. This will probably be
one of our hardest games of the season.

54
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,240
<i>Could be a sleeper team.</i>

55
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,701
<i>If they can win today,</i>
<i>man, I tell you what,</i>

56
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,620
<i>it could be a huge victory for them.</i>

57
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>Penalty two.</i>
<i>Start off this second chukker.</i>

58
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,001
{\an8}<i>Here comes Adolfo. Look at that.</i>
<i>It is up, and he drains it.</i>

59
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,130
{\an8}<i>Right there. Gets his team on the board.</i>
<i>We got a 1-1 score on the board.</i>

60
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,966
{\an8}<i>Adolfo is such a master of the game,</i>
<i>especially at this level</i>

61
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,011
<i>that it's really tough to bet against him.</i>

62
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,804
<i>Here comes a shot from Adolfo.</i>

63
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,140
<i>Two in a row for Cambiaso.</i>

64
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,935
{\an8}<i>And that'll end the chukker.</i>

65
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,854
{\an8}<i>He's taking matters</i>
<i>into his own hands,</i>

66
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,648
{\an8}<i>and quickly back-to-back goals.</i>

67
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,025
- Get on.
- Let's go.

68
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,735
Get on. Get on. Get on.

69
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
Timmy, focus.
They're throwing the ball in.

70
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,949
This is why
I don't need five people yelling.

71
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,119
<i>He's almost 50 years old,</i>
<i>and he still plays… on a good day,</i>

72
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,788
<i>it's not even quantifiable.</i>

73
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,084
Motherfucker.

74
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,087
- <i>The intensity picking up.</i>
- <i>Blood's pumping.</i>

75
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,218
<i>Adolfo working his way around</i>
<i>to the inside of Joaquin Avendaño.</i>

76
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,513
<i>Here comes Obregon to try to get the hook.</i>
<i>Cambiaso gets rid of it just in time.</i>

77
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,183
<i>Ball pops loose here.</i>
<i>Picked up by De Narvaez.</i>

78
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,230
Fight!

79
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,523
Get the ball!

80
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,862
{\an8}

81
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,207
<i>We just had a…</i>

82
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>a bit of a wreck here.</i>

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,044
Ambulance!

84
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>The Valiente patron,</i>
<i>Bob Jornayvaz, went down.</i>

85
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>We had a collision.</i>

86
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,595
<i>When Bob came down, he hit his head hard.</i>
<i>Hopefully, he's gonna be okay.</i>

87
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,890
<i>Horse is okay.</i>
<i>Bob's still being looked at.</i>

88
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,476
- Hopefully he's all right.
- It's tragic.

89
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,479
The ambulance is coming,
and probably a helicopter.

90
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,949
- He got hit hard. Thank God, he…
- Everyone's traumatized.

91
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,492
He's breathing again.

92
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,536
He's breathing now.
At first he wasn't.

93
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:32,707
<i>Stay where you are for now.</i>
<i>The ambulance will transport Mr. Jornayvaz</i>

94
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,044
<i>over to the trauma hawk</i>
<i>on the neighboring field.</i>

95
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,504
You told them?

96
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,298
I called them. I go.

97
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,800
The second chukker comes.

98
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,387
There's, like, a minute
and twenty-five left. Bob falls.

99
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,808
Very bad fall. One of the worst ones
I've seen in a very long time.

100
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,146
You know, ambulance comes.
Helicopter comes.

101
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,648
Takes him to the hospital.
Family is everything.

102
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,026
We think of the team as a family.
We are a family.

103
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,489
When something like that happens,
it feels like a big shock. Like a…

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,991
It's a reality check.

105
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,660
- But they already took him?
- Yes.

106
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,288
I'm going to see if Robert
needs anything, poor thing.

107
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,541
- Robert is in there.
- They're asking him 300 questions.

108
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,253
This is the worst part
of polo. It takes any desire away.

109
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,717
{\an8}
Many things in my head,

110
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,344
{\an8}uh, through that moment.

111
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,890
{\an8}Bob, he's so special. He's a great guy.

112
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,102
He's like my father, a second father.

113
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,439
I… I don't know. It was hard for me.

114
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,739
<i>Basically,</i>
<i>what we're hearing right now</i>

115
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,867
<i>is that neither team wishes</i>
<i>to continue with the game at this point.</i>

116
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,204
<i>And, um, we pray that he's gonna be okay.</i>

117
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,543
{\an8}

118
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,387
Sergio.

119
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,141
I just heard from…

120
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,727
They said that Bob is in a coma.

121
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,522
<i>Que… está </i>stable.

122
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,942
- He hasn't gotten up yet.
- But stable?

123
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,026
But stable.

124
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,322
That's good news.
But he still has the brain hematomas.

125
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,200
That's gonna be tough, hey? To come back.

126
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,870
Think about it.
It's not a vehicle, not a car.

127
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,331
I have a 1,200-pound animal
underneath me I'm controlling with my legs

128
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,042
going flat out… into somebody else.

129
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,128
A whole bunch
of dangerous things can happen.

130
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,133
I just hope that Bob turns this around
and comes out of this okay,

131
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,217
and he's all right.

132
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,846
We're praying for his family,
for him, and for a fast recovery.

133
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,685
This game, it's so beautiful.

134
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:03,357
But it can go from
one of the most enjoyable moments

135
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,902
to a terrible moment really fast.

136
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,197
{\an8}You kind of always
in the back of your mind say,

137
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,823
{\an8}"That won't happen to me."

138
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,785
It won't happen to my dad.

139
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,537
And, um…

140
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,210
it does.

141
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,179
Yeah.

142
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,353
I might need one minute.

143
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,195
I never thought in a million years
it would happen to him.

144
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,782
But the one thing I do know is,
like, my dad's a fighter.

145
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,618
{\an8}He fought his way to the top,
and he'll fight his way back to life.

146
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:04,293
{\an8}Bob Jornayvaz is one of the…
biggest and most well-known patrons

147
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,378
{\an8}in our sport.

148
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,047
He's put more money,
blood, sweat, tears,

149
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,299
{\an8}everything into polo,

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,010
more so than just about anyone else.

151
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,805
Adolfo and Bob are
one of the greatest stories in polo.

152
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,891
And that part of the reason why
Adolfo's had so much success

153
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,935
is because he had the support of Bob.

154
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,021
There's a lot of
fantastic organizations,

155
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,565
but that one's different.

156
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,692
{\an8}They've been at it the longest,

157
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,904
{\an8}and they've been dedicated to excellence.

158
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,656
{\an8}Bob's a friend of mine.

159
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:38,119
{\an8}I just texted him and said,
"I just care about you."

160
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,497
{\an8}And, "My family
and I'll be praying for you."

161
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,292
Even the rival teams,
rival players,

162
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,419
everybody puts all that aside.

163
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,713
And we all pull for Bob.

164
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,726
This tragic accident that
happened, these guys are big and tough,

165
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,603
but life is fragile.

166
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,647
I'm gonna dim the lights.
It's gonna be a little dark.

167
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,442
I'm gonna have you lay down
so you can get comfy.

168
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,446
{\an8}Now that the season is done
for the La Fe team, my family's not here.

169
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,615
My friends have all left.

170
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,911
Being six months pregnant, it's not… easy.

171
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,289
It can feel a little bit isolating.

172
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,003
Hello, my love.

173
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,963
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

174
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,468
They're about to pull up her image
on the screen, so I wanted to call you.

175
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,095
{\an8}Even though the U.S. Open
is over now for us,

176
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,139
{\an8}I want to be able
to keep on getting better

177
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,267
so that I can elevate my game,
become a better player.

178
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,562
So I started traveling back and forth
to Argentina twice a week.

179
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,105
- I'm going…
<i>- I'm not there.</i>

180
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,358
- You what?
- <i>I said, I'm sorry I'm not there.</i>

181
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,822
Instead of the usual 12 to 15-hour days,

182
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,909
five, six days a week
that I normally put in,

183
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,121
thankfully I have a business partner
that's been, you know, running things.

184
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,457
Everybody kind of picked up the slack

185
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,042
and helped me out

186
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,419
to allow me to allocate
some time towards polo.

187
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,254
And then obviously Pam.

188
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,842
She's made a lot of sacrifices,
so I think it's just a group effort.

189
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,011
<i>Oh, look at that little face. Hi.</i>

190
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,639
She's so cute.

191
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,643
She has her tongue sticking out
a little bit as well.

192
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,896
<i>Holy shit.</i>

193
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,529
Oh!

194
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,114
For such a macho man,

195
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,491
I would have expected him
to want a little boy,

196
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,994
but no, he was dead set
on having a little girl.

197
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,205
The pink jerseys this season
was Louis' idea.

198
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,207
He was really excited to have a baby girl.

199
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,667
<i>I wish I was there.</i>

200
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,922
<i>Robi… godfather.</i>

201
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,675
Yes, but if he has one sassy thing to say…

202
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,843
{\an8}<i>She looks like me.</i>

203
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,010
{\an8}

204
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,306
I have… spent

205
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,768
a lot of time away from my wife,

206
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,646
who would like to spend more time,

207
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,815
um, you know, with me.

208
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
Ooh, she just kicked.

209
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,943
Ooh.

210
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,361
She kicks hard.

211
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,738
Yeah, she does.

212
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,657
Baby, your little baby girl
is rather aggressive.

213
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,451
<i>She gets that from you.</i>

214
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,871
Sometimes what I want to say
is this is a hobby.

215
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,122
Louis' not a polo player.

216
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,040
He's a businessman
who does polo as a hobby.

217
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,834
If it were your lifeblood and career,

218
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,503
I can understand why
you need to dedicate that time.

219
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,423
I think his priorities right now
are different from mine.

220
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,592
<i>It would be a lot better if I was there.</i>

221
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,093
Yeah.

222
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,096
His time, I guess, is what I want. Time.

223
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,684
<i>Now we have to drive</i>
<i>I think, like, five hours.</i>

224
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,271
<i>Four or five hours</i>
<i>to go play a tournament.</i>

225
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,189
Very cool.

226
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,442
<i>So, um…</i>

227
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,196
There have been times where
it's definitely been difficult for me

228
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,781
during this pregnancy.

229
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:06,076
And especially now, um,
I just, I really want him to be here.

230
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,123
So I just, I need
to voice those feelings to Louis.

231
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,544
<i>Tell the boys</i>
<i>over there I said hello.</i>

232
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,546
- I will. Love you. Bye.
- <i>Love you.</i>

233
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,714
<i>Love you.</i>

234
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,382
- <i>Bye, sweetie.</i>
- Bye.

235
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,095
I hope that there's a shift.
I pray that there's a shift.

236
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,561
After Bob fell down,

237
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,230
it was a big deal for me.

238
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,359
{\an8}You don't think about the game.
You don't think about anything but him.

239
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,611
{\an8}We share our lives.

240
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,990
I know all his family,
and we were pretty much all together,

241
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,662
you know, praying for him
and… it was really hard.

242
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,333
I didn't know if I was able to keep going,
to keep playing.

243
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,211
I'm here because of him,
and he's my friend.

244
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,593
In the best moments of my career
or the worst moments of my career,

245
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,886
he was always there.

246
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,807
And I believe those are your friends.

247
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,104
Definitely, the accident
had a huge impact on Adolfo.

248
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,232
It's no question in anybody's mind, um,

249
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,819
who the greatest player
to ever play this game is.

250
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,404
That's Adolfo Cambiaso.

251
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,156
And, uh…

252
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:33,122
there's also no question who the best,
uh, sponsor of a team is, um…

253
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,167
over the course of his career,
and that's my father, Bob.

254
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,502
<i>Adolfo's on Auna.</i>

255
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,672
<i>This is the mare that was named</i>
<i>after Bob's eldest daughter.</i>

256
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,134
<i>Adolfo's wearing the number one jersey</i>
<i>today in solidarity with Bob.</i>

257
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,055
{\an8}<i>It also looks like a majority of the teams</i>
<i>have come to show support for Bob</i>

258
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
{\an8}<i>and to support Valiente.</i>

259
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:58,397
{\an8}<i>We are continuing</i>
<i>the Valiente versus Dutta Corp game today.</i>

260
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,984
<i>Three to two on the board,</i>
<i>the starting score in favor of Valiente.</i>

261
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,655
{\an8}<i>And then Joaquin is playing</i>
<i>the number four position.</i>

262
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,699
{\an8}<i>Joaquin Vilgre filling in.</i>

263
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,868
<i>We all wish Bob a speedy recovery,</i>

264
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>and we've got nothing</i>
<i>but wonderful wishes.</i>

265
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,122
<i>Everybody's pulling for him.</i>

266
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,666
Boys, let's get it done.

267
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,335
Let's do it, yeah?

268
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,880
It was really everything
kind of, uh, strange,

269
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,466
emotional, because Bob was not there.

270
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,386
But I think the courage of the family

271
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,348
gave me that enthusiasm

272
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,142
to keep going and play for him.

273
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,645
And that's what we did.

274
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,396
There's really no question about it

275
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,150
that my dad would want
this organization to keep going.

276
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,945
Show everybody exactly what they can do.

277
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,863
<i>Ball's back in play.</i>

278
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,535
{\an8}<i>Timmy trying to get this one</i>
<i>put between the posts.</i>

279
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,787
<i>Timmy out in front.</i>

280
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,121
Come on, Timmy!

281
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,499
<i>Reaches out near side.</i>
<i>Neck shot from Dutta.</i>

282
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,001
<i>Oh, man, off the post and goal.</i>

283
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,587
{\an8}- That's the way, Timmy.
 <i>What a goal, Timmy.</i>

284
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,215
{\an8}<i>Coming in hot. Look at this.</i>

285
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,425
<i>Well done, Timmy. Oh, yeah.</i>

286
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,511
<i>What a play. Dutta-- Oh, man.</i>

287
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,679
<i>Adolfo comes in.</i>

288
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,808
<i>And Adolfo's gonna make him</i>
<i>pay for it here.</i>

289
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,644
<i>Wind up, fire at the goal from distance.</i>

290
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,063
<i>Cambiaso winds up,</i>
<i>cuts it at the goal.</i>

291
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,608
{\an8}<i>Sends it on through.</i>
<i>What a goal by the master himself.</i>

292
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,612
- <i>Valiente back on top.</i>
- <i>Adolfo looks like he's hot.</i>

293
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,031
<i>Three goals, two assists for Adolfo.</i>

294
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,533
<i>Looking for a shot.</i>

295
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,035
<i>He likes what he sees.</i>
<i>Look at this shot from Del Rio.</i>

296
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>Oh, what a play!</i>

297
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,329
{\an8}<i>Yes!</i>

298
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,540
{\an8}<i>Unbelievable!</i>

299
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,875
<i>Watch Timmy Dutta knock it down.</i>

300
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,712
<i>- Right to Nino.</i>
<i>- </i><i>That was awesome.</i>

301
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,715
<i>An amazing goal like that</i>
<i>could be just what Dutta needs</i>

302
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,174
<i>to get back into this game.</i>

303
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,802
<i>Five minutes left on the clock.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

304
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,055
<i>Good effort here from</i>
<i>the Dutta Corp. Working this one down.</i>

305
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,349
<i>Here comes Nino firing at the goal,</i>

306
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,227
{\an8}<i>and he drills it and picks up the point.</i>

307
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,730
{\an8}-

308
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,648
Now it's a ball game.

309
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,193
<i>Running down the field,</i>
<i>Timmy comes in one time</i>

310
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,320
<i>at the goal from distance.</i>

311
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,947
<i>Over the back line wide.</i>

312
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,450
<i>- </i><i>Still time for the Dutta Corp.</i>
- Shit.

313
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,910
<i>- That would've been a great…</i>
<i>- </i><i>They needed that one.</i>

314
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>A great time to score</i>
<i>to put the pressure on Valiente.</i>

315
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,082
<i>Adolfo comes back around behind.</i>

316
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,002
<i>Now back shot here</i>
<i>from Timmy to break out…</i>

317
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,671
<i>Look at this. No way.</i>
<i>What a goal. Timmy Dutta.</i>

318
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,006
Yes!

319
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,971
{\an8}<i>Just what they need to have happen.</i>
<i>Timmy is a hero right now.</i>

320
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,474
<i>This is truly anybody's game now.</i>

321
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,143
<i>Bounces up,</i>
<i>and it's gonna be Adolfo to jump on it.</i>

322
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>Taking this ball straight to goal.</i>
<i>It's hero time.</i>

323
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>That clock is ticking down.</i>

324
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,609
<i>If Adolfo scores here,</i>
<i>that's pretty much game over.</i>

325
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,486
{\an8}<i>Can't keep it alive.</i>
<i>15 seconds on the clock.</i>

326
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,197
{\an8}<i>Oh, no! Dutta Corp stole possession.</i>

327
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,948
{\an8}<i>Twelve seconds to go until the horn.</i>

328
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,367
{\an8}<i>Can he make it happen right here</i>
<i>on this drive?</i>

329
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,577
{\an8}<i>It'll come down to this.</i>

330
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,246
{\an8}<i>Hits it one time down</i>
<i>the right-hand side of the field.</i>

331
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,956
{\an8}<i>He's trying to get it to Dutta.</i>

332
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,668
I was gone. I had that goal set up there.

333
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,670
{\an8}I needed the 80-yard pass.

334
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,506
{\an8}Ka-boom. Boom.

335
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,924
{\an8}Went 60.

336
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,134
<i>It's not gonna have</i>
<i>enough power on it.</i>

337
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,136
Killed me,
that that pass was short. Ugh.

338
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,932
But, um… I had the opportunity.

339
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,726
<i>That's gonna win</i>
<i>the game for Valiente.</i>

340
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,188
<i>Unbelievable.</i>
<i>What a game. What a showing here.</i>

341
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,439
<i>Congratulations, Valiente.</i>

342
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,984
{\an8}<i>They will take home the win,</i>
<i>9-8 the score.</i>

343
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:35,447
{\an8}<i>That's gonna be a tough loss,</i>
<i>but they can hold their heads high against</i>

344
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,826
<i>this incredible Valiente team</i>
<i>that gets it done.</i>

345
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,953
We went toe-to-toe,

346
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,664
to even have a chance
to go into overtime with them.

347
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,501
When you lose by one,
we were pissed, to be honest with you.

348
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,420
It was one of those small, fine lines.
It could've gone either way.

349
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,049
Now we have Pilot coming up,
and we have to win no matter what.

350
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,136
You have to win
to keep us in the rest of the tournament.

351
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,847
But it's not over yet.

352
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,684
<i>With that loss, Dutta Corp</i>
<i>finds themself in a must-win position.</i>

353
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,061
<i>One more loss,</i>
<i>and they are out of contention</i>

354
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,312
<i>for the semifinals.</i>

355
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,983
{\an8}

356
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,571
{\an8}We have a game tomorrow
against Dutta Corporation,

357
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,574
and they're playing very strong right now.

358
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:23,328
Uh, the last game
that Dutta played against Valiente

359
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,956
we're gonna have to have
a really good game to beat them.

360
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,543
I feel like we can,
but what they all don't have

361
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,337
{\an8}is a player like Facundo.

362
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,133
{\an8}With him, you're always the team to beat.

363
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,178
When he's having a good day,
he can win it all by himself.

364
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,058
{\an8}Facundo and Adolfo have been trading
the number one and number two position

365
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,519
{\an8}for the last… you know, 20 seasons.

366
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,815
That's why there's a kind of like mission
to beat the other guy,

367
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,569
because they have always been the…
Who's the best player in the world?

368
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,029
Is it Adolfo? Is it Facundo?

369
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,285
I've been a polo player
nearly since I was born.

370
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,121
I have a family that is all polo players.

371
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,708
My father, my brothers, my uncles,

372
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,668
{\an8}all my cousins were all polo players.

373
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,631
When I started playing
as a professional polo player,

374
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,175
I wanted to be as better as I could be,

375
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,385
and I'm constantly looking for that.

376
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>Facundo Pieres,</i>
<i>he flicks it in towards the goal!</i>

377
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,849
Facundo's one
of the great players.

378
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,227
He's been at the top
of the game for many years.

379
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,270
He's won all the big tournaments.

380
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,356
The word for him is unstoppable.

381
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,024
What you feel when you're playing

382
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,236
is that you have
this like bullet train coming,

383
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,072
and, you know, you better hope that he…

384
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,407
something happens and he misses the ball,

385
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,910
because he's not someone
you'll be able to stop.

386
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,330
<i>It's another magical goal</i>
<i>from the ten-goal maestro…</i>

387
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,583
I've been playing
with Facundo now for five years.

388
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,670
In my opinion, he's the best pro
that ever played the game.

389
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,757
You give him the ball, and he's gone.

390
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,218
<i>Facundo! Facundo! Facundo!</i>

391
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,517
Of course, I had
all my career playing against Adolfo.

392
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,353
There's been a big rivalry

393
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,439
{\an8}for a long time
between Cambiaso and Facundo Pieres.

394
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,650
Facundo is
the number one in the world

395
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,820
because he's taking
the podium away from Adolfo Cambiaso.

396
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,698
The skill, he's at the right age.

397
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,953
I have no question about it
there's some type of rivalry on the field.

398
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,665
That's where I actually hope
we get to a point in the Open

399
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,376
where we're having
those both on the same field

400
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,877
and playing against each other.

401
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,381
Seeing that level of play
would be so incredible to watch.

402
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,345
{\an8}Life for everybody changes
and now I have different priorities.

403
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,018
So what colors
do you want to use?

404
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,812
I always knew
that I wanted to have kids.

405
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,273
They changed my life, for sure.

406
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,233
What do I do every day?

407
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,403
- What do I do the most?
- Play polo!

408
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,657
- And do you sometimes come to watch me?
- Sometimes.

409
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,118
- And do you enjoy watching me?
- No!

410
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,456
They live in Argentina,
and I travel, so they come to visit me.

411
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,794
A couple of years ago,
I got into a divorce.

412
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,590
Outside my polo career,

413
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,176
that was my biggest failure as a person.

414
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,970
You know, like,
something went wrong there.

415
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,018
How delicious.

416
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,522
Do you want a drumstick?

417
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,024
Okay.

418
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,277
Do you want to stay or leave?

419
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,112
I want to stay.

420
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,447
A few more days?

421
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,867
I don't get to see them
as much as I want.

422
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,245
But when I see them, I spend a lot of time
with them. Good quality time.

423
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,624
I've been struggling
a bit in a couple of years,

424
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,460
but now everything looks
to be a little bit more balanced,

425
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,421
so I have my head more ready to go

426
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,673
and concentrate in my game.

427
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,180
If there's one team in the world
that you can put at the level

428
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,558
of Valiente and La Dolfina, it's Pilot.

429
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:18,313
They won the U.S. Open,
you know, three or four times already.

430
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,733
Curtis is someone that also understands
the power of horses.

431
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,904
Curtis is the person
that has been spending the most,

432
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,782
and obviously having Facundo
is always an edge,

433
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,829
which makes, you know,
Pilot always one of the teams to beat.

434
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,626
I had a lower disc hernia
at the beginning of the season.

435
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,545
I never had that injury before,

436
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,048
and now I have to take care
of all the rest of my body

437
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,885
because having that pain
made my body restructure a little bit.

438
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,680
It's not easy to do that.
It's very difficult.

439
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,683
Timmy Dutta, he's playing forward now.

440
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,855
I think probably that's one of the reasons
why the team is doing better now.

441
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,441
I think he's at his best.

442
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,193
- Come again?
- Does that scare you?

443
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,030
Yeah, I mean, respect.
I don't know if scared, but respect.

444
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,367
Dutta.
They're coming on strong right now.

445
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,329
Their lowest goal player
with a handicap is four,

446
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,874
{\an8}so if you're under four goals,

447
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,085
{\an8}you gotta have a very good game
for your team to win.

448
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,838
Now Dutta is going a lot forward, so…

449
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,342
What I've seen is
we're gonna have to go in with Avendaño,

450
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,427
not with Timmy.

451
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,386
Okay.

452
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,638
Because Timmy is fast.

453
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,559
{\an8}<i>Timmy, what a play right here.</i>
<i>Dutta in the red zone.</i>

454
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,311
{\an8}<i>Another one.</i>

455
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,606
<i>Dutta jumps out of here</i>
<i>and goes with it right now out in front.</i>

456
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,982
<i>Can he get to it?</i>

457
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:44,983
<i>Yes, he does.</i>

458
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,819
<i>Man, oh, man.</i>
<i>He's had some fantastic finishes.</i>

459
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,658
But if it is with Joaquin Avendaño,
it's different. I think you can do it.

460
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,077
With Timmy Dutta, he will be very fast.

461
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,372
So we're going to defend a lot.

462
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,670
If I don't at least try to take Timmy
and try to get in his way,

463
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,508
then there's going to be a free man
who you can score any time.

464
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,094
We don't smile
until after the game tomorrow, right?

465
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,237
How depressing it is

466
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,822
to drive over to this place
now that the season is over.

467
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,576
Yeah? But we still have horses here,
so it's not that depressing.

468
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,372
- It is for me.
- When are you going to Argentina?

469
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,791
I'm going…

470
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
tomorrow.

471
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,421
And when do you come back?

472
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,800
I don't know.

473
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,511
Okay.

474
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,722
We started a breeding operation
with Robi down in Argentina,

475
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,183
which is actually where most of our…

476
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,105
um, like, our finances
and our capital is allocated to that.

477
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,607
And obviously, you know,

478
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,527
winning is important,
because if we don't win, then,

479
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,071
you know, we don't showcase
the horses as much.

480
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:18,493
If we don't perform well,
then it's money that's not well spent.

481
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,372
I'm gonna spend Greek Easter
with my family.

482
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,418
- Okay.
- If you can make it, I would love it.

483
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,379
I will fly back if I'm not playing.

484
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:39,973
Perfect.

485
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,601
Perfect… As in, like, perfect? Or…

486
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,271
Perfect as in, it would be great
to have you there if you could make it.

487
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,692
But if you can't make it,

488
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,445
because there's something
more important, then that's okay.

489
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,114
It's rare for her to…

490
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,284
to manifest her feelings.

491
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:04,331
And when she does, you know,
I pay really close attention to it.

492
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,333
I wanna make sure

493
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,003
that polo doesn't become all-consuming.

494
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,838
It's not like this season's been…

495
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,675
you know, that exciting.

496
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,305
I spent a lot of our financial resources
into what I think is a very…

497
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,767
disappointing season.

498
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,938
We should find excitement and enjoyment
in more than just winning.

499
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,985
You mean in… in us?

500
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:39,866
As long as I know that you know
your priorities, I'll always support.

501
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,910
I do know my priorities, yes.

502
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,080
So as long as it doesn't get
too far off base and too skewed,

503
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,499
I'll always support it.

504
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,416
Understood.

505
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,293
I'll always support you.

506
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,379
Okay.

507
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,883
Is that an, "Please stop telling me that,"
or is that an okay?

508
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,345
There has not been a day that's gone by

509
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,223
where I don't think about we could've
spent more time together.

510
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:06,601
And I'm sure it can feel really lonely,
and I'm sorry for that.

511
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,436
- I love you, thank you.
- I love you.

512
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,732
I hear you.

513
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,568
You happy?

514
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,115
- Right now, this second?
- Mm-hmm.

515
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,241
I'm very happy.

516
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,792
It's one of these games
that's like, all the pressure is on you.

517
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,170
It's the game that is
the game of the games, right?

518
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,425
It's that one last showdown that,
I mean, if we win against Pilot,

519
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,845
it gives us a shot in the semis.

520
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,807
And, uh, hey, Facundo Pieres…

521
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,891
He is the man.

522
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,144
He's a top dog.

523
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,355
He's the team to beat, though.
It's the team to beat. We'll beat them.

524
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,399
We'll beat them.

525
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,945
Very important,

526
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,865
that as soon as we have the ball today,
you are ready, eh?

527
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,742
{\an8}You have to give Facundo.

528
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,244
If you stretch the team
as soon as we have it,

529
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,997
you put him in a difficult position,
you know?

530
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,835
I was there at the hospital
and they came out with good news.

531
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,672
Said he was going to be fine and all that.
And then it all went to shit.

532
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,590
So.

533
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,259
{\an8}- Is his wife there with the kids?
 Yeah.

534
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,345
{\an8}- We met her there at the hospital.
 So Louisa is here.

535
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,055
Yeah. So.

536
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,348
It didn't have to be.

537
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,268
No. It's… it's polo.

538
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,563
- I mean, things move fast.
- Yeah.

539
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:38,109
And us, not you,
but us old people, us being me.

540
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,446
- Hey, I'm 58.
- Yeah, but I'm 65.

541
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,241
- Good luck, my friend.
- Good luck.

542
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,744
- You too. Will do.
- Have fun.

543
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,914
- Take it easy on the old man.
- Yeah.

544
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,042
- Good to see you, young man.
- Good luck.

545
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,794
- Thank y'all.
- Good luck.

546
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,171
Five out. Let's go. Get it done.

547
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,465
Good luck, huh?

548
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,549
Thank you, sir.

549
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,636
Think, focus. Today is your day to shine.

550
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,553
Go.

551
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,430
You can do it.

552
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,021
The main thing today,
Timmy Dutta never has a free run to goal.

553
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,775
{\an8}And he's well mounted.

554
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>You say with the Dutta Corp,</i>
<i>they've gotta win.</i>

555
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,448
<i>- </i><i>They have to.</i>
<i>- </i><i>They've gotta beat them.</i>

556
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,699
<i>Ball's put into play.</i>

557
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,578
<i>Facundo goes to the ball.</i>
<i>He takes off with it.</i>

558
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,205
<i>Oh, man, it got away from him.</i>

559
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,249
<i>Won't see that too often.</i>

560
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,585
<i>Here comes Facundo.</i>
<i>Penalty number two. Oh, no.</i>

561
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,004
<i>First miss of the season.</i>

562
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,049
Facundo started off the game
a bit slower than he normally does.

563
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,594
When we saw him miss the first penalty,
maybe we found a crack and can get in.

564
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,805
<i>And then watch</i>
<i>this cut shot from Facundo.</i>

565
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,307
<i>Look at this. Oh, man.</i>

566
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,351
<i>He overcut it.</i>

567
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,145
<i>I guess it just goes to prove</i>
<i>he actually is human.</i>

568
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,481
Facundo's a power polo player,
I like to say.

569
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,275
He's gonna run through you and score.

570
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,903
<i>Here's Facundo.</i>
<i>Look at this horse just explode for him.</i>

571
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,866
<i>Takes his shot. Facundo… finds the goal.</i>
<i>Sends it on through.</i>

572
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,742
{\an8}<i>Goal by Facundo, his first of the day.</i>

573
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,579
{\an8}<i>Making up</i>
<i>for that penalty two miss, Facundo.</i>

574
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,455
- <i>Facundo there is challenged.</i>
- Shit.

575
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,249
<i>Taps it out. Bounces it up.</i>

576
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,377
<i>Keeps it going right here.</i>
<i>Winds up. Cuts it at the goal.</i>

577
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,379
<i>Look at this. Oh, man.</i>

578
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,423
{\an8}<i>What a shot. Unbelievable.</i>

579
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,550
<i>- Facundo breaks back to the center.</i>
- Shit.

580
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,343
<i>Facundo will not miss.</i>

581
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,013
{\an8}<i>Sends it through.</i>
<i>Picks up the point and extends his lead.</i>

582
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,307
{\an8}-

583
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,231
We can't let this
get any more out of control.

584
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,068
He's bringing her back. What for?
He needs to stay there.

585
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,778
Timmy, it's not chukker end.

586
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,947
- The fucking horse is dead, Tim.
- I know.

587
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,575
Let the horse breathe.
Let me get on the next mare.

588
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,412
Let her breathe.

589
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,498
<i>We haven't seen</i>
<i>Timmy find the scoresheet.</i>

590
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,416
<i>True.</i>

591
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,960
<i>Timmy trying to come on strong</i>
<i>from behind.</i>

592
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,088
<i>Curtis Pilot coming back</i>
<i>to defend against Timmy Dutta.</i>

593
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,966
<i>Great job</i>
<i>by Curtis taking out Timmy.</i>

594
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,802
<i>Not letting Timmy jump on that right away.</i>
<i>Well done, Curtis.</i>

595
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,638
<i>What a play, Curtis Pilot.</i>

596
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,099
<i>Timmy comes in for the steal.</i>
<i>Takes it away.</i>

597
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,601
<i>Dutta is gone on a break</i>

598
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,978
<i>as Facundo tried to pick up</i>
<i>the right-of-way.</i>

599
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,606
<i>It's gonna be taken by Dutta,</i>
<i>looking to put one on the board.</i>

600
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,025
<i>Can he get it done? Timmy.</i>
<i>There's Curtis. Gets to it.</i>

601
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,026
<i>Well done, Curtis.</i>

602
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,487
<i>Four goals down. One chukker left.</i>

603
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,405
<i>It's gonna be very difficult</i>

604
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,908
<i>for the Dutta Corporation</i>
<i>to get anything done.</i>

605
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,910
<i>Try to score as quickly as possible.</i>

606
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,870
<i>- Maybe draw a foul.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Yeah.</i>

607
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,957
<i>Nice angle put together there</i>
<i>for Dutta on the near side.</i>

608
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,292
<i>Timmy Dutta. It's off the post. Oh, baby.</i>

609
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,671
{\an8}<i>And that will take us</i>
<i>out of chukker number five.</i>

610
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,131
<i>We're down</i>
<i>to the final chukker and now</i>

611
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,258
<i>Dutta Corp is in desperation mode.</i>

612
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,345
<i>If they can't pull out the win,</i>
<i>they will be eliminated.</i>

613
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:56,015
I know why they call this
a young man's sport. Son of a bitch.

614
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,102
We need some goals.

615
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,979
Had to hit the fucking post.

616
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,858
<i>Looks like a possession play.</i>

617
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,445
<i>Tomas hits it straight at the goal.</i>
<i>Centers it up for Nino.</i>

618
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,782
<i>And now Del Rio smack it through the goal.</i>

619
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,869
{\an8}<i>What a goal for the Dutta Corporation.</i>
<i>Back within two now. 7-5 the score.</i>

620
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,871
{\an8}They're there.

621
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,623
We have time.

622
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:26,087
- <i>Less than a minute remaining.</i>
- <i>Del Rio gives that ball a big run.</i>

623
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,966
- <i>They've gotta score now.</i>
- <i>Yeah, they have to burst down.</i>

624
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,468
<i>Just try to go score.</i>
<i>Hopefully you get lucky.</i>

625
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,886
<i>Taking too much time.</i>

626
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,055
<i>You gotta shoot</i>
<i>if you want to have a chance.</i>

627
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,892
{\an8}<i>Del Rio's back to it.</i>
<i>Tomas Garcia Del Rio.</i>

628
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,602
{\an8}Hit the fucking ball, guys.

629
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,688
{\an8}Come on. Who's got it?

630
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,733
{\an8}<i>Taken now by Del Rio.</i>
<i>Del Rio knows he needs to shoot.</i>

631
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,194
{\an8}<i>Can he get it done? Del Rio coming in.</i>
<i>Del Rio runs it on through.</i>

632
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,238
{\an8}<i>Picks up the point,</i>
<i>brings the team within one.</i>

633
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,948
{\an8}<i>There is still time, especially if--</i>

634
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,326
{\an8}- <i>The horn went before he scored.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Oh, did it go?</i>

635
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,750
- <i>That's a shame. That's game.</i>
- <i>He tapped it.</i>

636
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,503
{\an8}<i>Seven to six, the final on the scoreboard.</i>

637
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,922
{\an8}<i>Congratulations, Pilot,</i>
<i>here on the Open match.</i>

638
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,177
<i>That is it, officially.</i>

639
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,804
<i>Man, so close,</i>
<i>but they weren't fast enough.</i>

640
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,351
<i>This means the Dutta Corporation</i>
<i>has been eliminated from the U.S. Open.</i>

641
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:23,936
Good job, Timmy.

642
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,440
They gave it all.

643
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,942
- That's all you can ask.
- So proud of you.

644
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,530
Great job. We tried hard.

645
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,491
I know you wanted it so bad.

646
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,827
Be proud of yourselves,
though, in a lot of ways,

647
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,913
because these are big organizations.

648
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,795
I think he's gonna question
every single goal he didn't score

649
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,090
and how he could have just turned
his wrist just the slightest way

650
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,510
and, you know, probably all day long.

651
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,470
Another year.

652
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,599
Another roller coaster.

653
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,936
<i>This young man</i>
<i>has such a bright future.</i>

654
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,189
<i>Nearly taking down two giants of the sport</i>
<i>in back-to-back games,</i>

655
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,150
<i>Adolfo and Facundo. But not today.</i>

656
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,986
<i>Instead, we'll have to wait</i>
<i>for those giants to collide.</i>

657
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,990
{\an8}Cloves, cardamom.

658
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,037
{\an8}Who's gonna chop?
Am I chopping or you're chopping?

659
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,581
- Or you're looking pretty?
- I can do anything.

660
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,126
I got it. Make me a drink.

661
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,258
I keep saying it over and over,
and I feel like a broken record,

662
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:39,053
but it's such-- It was a fine line
of winning and losing always.

663
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,472
We lost games so close.

664
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,724
We lost by one, two, one, two. We lost.

665
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,019
- Yeah.
- And being very close to beat them.

666
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,606
{\an8}We had an incredible defense that
the big boys just couldn't penetrate us.

667
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,901
Against the biggest of the biggest boys,
and that's all we could ask for.

668
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,319
That small margin.

669
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,989
Can you take this
and start chopping?

670
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,907
- Just the tips? Okay.
- Yeah.

671
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,451
When you play these ten-goalers,

672
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,746
{\an8}they have so much talent
and depth of horses,

673
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,542
{\an8}uh, that we make a mistake, it's a goal.

674
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,294
- We learn from them.
- Yeah.

675
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,422
Would it be amazing
to beat Mr. Cambiaso?

676
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,884
Absolutely, 100%.
It would be an honor and a dream,

677
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,801
{\an8}and the guys…

678
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:24,182
{\an8}I think you learn more from him,
playing him, and Facundo Pieres,

679
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,727
{\an8}because they're the best in the world,
and if we don't, we're stupid.

680
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,896
{\an8}It's a fact.

681
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,732
{\an8}One day, I hope we win the U.S. Open.
I hope it's next year.

682
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,277
{\an8}You have to start dreaming
to beat the big boys.

683
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,738
I've dreamed of that cup. That's for sure.

684
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,033
Now I'm gonna build the biryani.

685
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,704
- Is it looking good?
- Yeah. It's cooked.

686
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,042
{\an8}He has got a huge future
ahead of him as a polo player.

687
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,212
{\an8}- Want me to get a serving spoon for that?
 Yeah.

688
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,132
{\an8}He has four shots as a polo player
as good as any ten-goal player.

689
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,175
{\an8}Looks good.

690
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,178
{\an8}He can reach anyone at 140 yards

691
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,974
{\an8}to their stirrups, which not many
sitting ten-goal players can do that.

692
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,392
{\an8}That's just a fact.

693
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,939
{\an8}Timmy started the Open at one level,
and he finished at a different level.

694
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,234
And that's winning to me.

695
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,946
A little pickle, a little chutney.

696
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,158
So if he plays simple polo,
it's hard to beat him.

697
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,286
I'm not worried about it.
Before 30, he'll be there.

698
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,332
{\an8}And he's just… he's extremely bright.

699
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:36,545
{\an8}Uh, I wouldn't comment on the way
he looks, but he has a great personality,

700
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,673
{\an8}and he's just an amazing kid.

701
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,383
{\an8}He makes me proud every day.

702
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,095
{\an8}He's the greatest joy I have,

703
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:48,182
{\an8}and thus I say,
I'm a very rich man because of him.

704
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,104
{\an8}It's not the money in the bank
or what I own or et cetera.

705
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,855
It's him. It's very simple.

706
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,818
I love you and appreciate
everything you do.

707
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,736
I love you too.
I'm so proud of you. Well done.

708
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,655
- Great season.
- Thank you so much.

709
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,740
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

710
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,452
- My goodness, the damn thing is good. Mm.
- It's so good.

711
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,957
<i>We're back</i>
<i>with one of our final games</i>

712
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,418
<i>of bracket play</i>
<i>before we get to the semifinals,</i>

713
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,295
<i>Valiente will take on Coca-Cola.</i>

714
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,382
<i>With each team playing</i>
<i>four games in bracket play,</i>

715
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,051
<i>three wins guarantees</i>
<i>a trip to the semifinals.</i>

716
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,679
<i>Valiente and La Dolfina</i>
<i>have both secured their spots,</i>

717
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,764
<i>so two more are still up for grabs.</i>

718
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,892
<i>Any team that has lost three games</i>
<i>are now out of the running,</i>

719
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,603
<i>meaning that Dutta Corp,</i>
<i>La Fe, and Clearwater</i>

720
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,022
<i>are out of contention.</i>

721
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:40,401
<i>Pilot, Park Place, Coca-Cola, and Tamera</i>
<i>all have one more game to go</i>

722
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,903
<i>and all looking</i>
<i>for a spot in the semifinals.</i>

723
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,490
<i>If they lose today,</i>
<i>Coca-Cola will be out of the U.S. Open.</i>

724
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,755
He's under a tremendous amount
of pressure, Keko is.

725
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,383
{\an8}To be really young
and to continue to perform

726
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,345
{\an8}better and better
every time he goes on the field,

727
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,056
I can't imagine what kind
of pressure he's dealing with.

728
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,644
{\an8}Today is a really special day,
not because of polo,

729
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:21,525
{\an8}because it's Keko and I's
one-year anniversary of dating.

730
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:26,655
So, no matter how it goes,
he's going to be in a good mood later

731
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,618
when it's me-time
and time for us to celebrate.

732
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,914
Hopefully, he'll be happy
regardless of how this goes.

733
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,794
{\an8}<i>With three wins under their belt,</i>
<i>Adolfo's undefeated Valiente team</i>

734
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,754
{\an8}<i>are already through to the semis,</i>

735
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:45,132
{\an8}<i>but the men feel the absence</i>
<i>of their sponsor, Bob Jornayvaz.</i>

736
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,218
<i>Our hearts go out to him and his family.</i>

737
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,428
How is he?

738
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,014
{\an8}He's not very good, Harry. He's in a coma.

739
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,642
{\an8}I think it's just going to be a long haul.
Yeah, so.

740
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,520
{\an8}- They're trying to get him to wake up.
 Trying to wake up now.

741
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,480
{\an8}That's the idea right now. So.

742
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,025
Good luck.

743
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:11,992
Yeah, so, I've got
Adolfo and Robertito going down tonight

744
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,787
to say any kind
of stimulation and talking.

745
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,831
Things like that.
He's gonna listen to the game.

746
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,875
- Yes. And he loves to… <i>Bueno.</i>
- It's wonderful to see you.

747
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,504
{\an8}- Everything's gonna be okay.
 Yes. We're thinking about you.

748
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,881
Thanks, Harry.
That means a lot. Thank you both.

749
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,509
The best thing to do now
is to win the whole tournament.

750
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,344
Yeah, I think you're right.

751
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,888
If you wanted to get
the opportunity to be in the semis,

752
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,765
it's a must-win, yeah, 100%.

753
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,268
So, of course, the intensity is high.

754
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,145
I just put the pressure on myself.

755
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,399
{\an8}<i>Polito,</i>
<i>he's been fantastic this entire season.</i>

756
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,527
{\an8}<i>Really, Toby,</i>
<i>they have to all play extremely well.</i>

757
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,865
<i>We know they play best when they play</i>
<i>a good team-style hit-and-run.</i>

758
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,034
<i>Coca-Cola, Valiente,</i>

759
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,038
<i>just about ready to go head-to-head here.</i>

760
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,331
<i>Ball's in play.</i>

761
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,544
<i>Cambiaso's moving through the pack.</i>
<i>Oh, baby, look at that.</i>

762
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,714
<i>How does this happen?</i>
<i>Adolfo should not be this alone,</i>

763
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,591
<i>by himself, going to the goal,</i>

764
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,093
{\an8}<i>picking up the first point,</i>
<i>making the score 1-0.</i>

765
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,222
<i>What a shot from Paquito.</i>
<i>Look at this play.</i>

766
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,683
<i>Does it have the legs</i>
<i>to get across the line?</i>

767
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,935
{\an8}<i>Beautifully done there.</i>

768
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,562
<i>Peke off and running.</i>

769
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:26,275
{\an8}<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>What a shot from Peke. 3-0 now the score.</i>

770
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,235
{\an8}<i>They are off to the races early.</i>

771
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,696
<i>Coca-Cola, again,</i>
<i>they need to win this game.</i>

772
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,740
<i>Let's see if they can turn this around.</i>

773
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:37,953
For Valiente, the thrill of,
"If I lose, I'm out," is not there.

774
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,457
You know that you're in no matter what,
so you're relaxed. You're focused,

775
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,583
but you're relaxed.

776
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,877
Versus the other team, it's tight.

777
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,547
If we win, maybe we have a chance,
and you're a little tighter,

778
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,133
'cause if you don't win,
then you're out for sure.

779
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,886
This is the U.S. Open, come on.

780
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,429
Let's play well.

781
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,805
- Let's play.
- Let's go.

782
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,891
Concentrate, talk to me, talk to me.

783
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,726
<i>Keko.</i>

784
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,730
<i>Wins a throw-in.</i>
<i>Magrini catches the top of that one.</i>

785
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,025
{\an8}screaming in Spanish]
Let's go! Dude.

786
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,862
<i>Backed up by… Ruiz.</i>

787
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,990
<i>Ruiz with a little flip-neck shot</i>
<i>at the goal,</i>

788
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,326
<i>and he will send it on through.</i>

789
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,411
{\an8}

790
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,666
<i>Keko Magrini.</i>
<i>Oh, a little slip-up.</i>

791
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,587
<i>Now,</i>
<i>Polito Pieres taking control now.</i>

792
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,257
Keko's got to prove
that he's still got it, that he's there.

793
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,591
That he should be there.

794
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,302
<i>Polito likes what he sees.</i>
<i>He'll shoot at the goal.</i>

795
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,679
He went for the big shot.

796
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,847
<i>And this one will go. What a goal!</i>

797
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,016
- Yes, he nailed it.
- Yes.

798
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,894
<i>Incredible goal there</i>
<i>from Polito Pieres.</i>

799
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,397
{\an8}<i>And ties this game up</i>
<i>now at three goals apiece.</i>

800
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,857
<i>It's gonna be picked up by Peke,</i>
<i>who got there first.</i>

801
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,360
<i>And now Keko comes in to challenge.</i>

802
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,154
<i>Gonzalez has an inbound</i>
<i>Keko Magrini to deal with.</i>

803
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,074
{\an8}<i>He gets the shot off. Oh, man.</i>

804
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,744
{\an8}<i>Tough break there for Keko.</i>

805
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,372
<i>Look. Here comes Keko.</i>
<i>Got his mallet all tangled up.</i>

806
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,874
<i>Couldn't get to it.</i>
<i>Taken here by Joaquin Vilgre.</i>

807
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,544
<i>And Vilgre got it done.</i>
<i>Sends it on through.</i>

808
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,505
{\an8}<i>Breaks a tie. Takes the lead</i>
<i>and makes the score 5-4.</i>

809
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,591
{\an8}<i>Tough for Keko Magrini so far.</i>

810
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:19,013
<i>And you can see there's some words</i>
<i>being said between Polito and Keko now.</i>

811
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,140
<i>Kind of butting heads a bit at this point.</i>

812
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,641
<i>Polito is not happy.</i>

813
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,189
Because you
are looking at me but tell me yes or no.

814
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,858
Think!

815
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,819
Let's go, come on!

816
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,155
- Are you looking at me?
- Yes, I get it.

817
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,324
Yes, or you don't understand?

818
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,284
Listen to me, Keko.

819
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:44,204
Get him, dude. Come on!

820
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,581
Okay, okay.

821
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,999
This is so bad, man.

822
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,334
Okay!

823
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,424
- Be more conservative with the ball.
- Okay.

824
00:43:55,507 --> 00:44:00,429
This game is important
for me to show the team what I can do.

825
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,265
But I still didn't feel really good.
I don't know.

826
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,851
I was putting
too much pressure on myself.

827
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:10,105
And I felt the things were not going
really good my way this season.

828
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,359
And I was just probably
mad at myself more than anything.

829
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,403
Polito and Keko's styles
are similar.

830
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,322
They're both good with the ball.

831
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,949
Uh, they both like to have the ball.

832
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:25,245
{\an8}We cannot argue about Keko's talent,
but Polito is a better player than Keko.

833
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:30,417
Keko needs to understand
that he's not going to be the guy

834
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,585
that stands out.

835
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,838
It became personal
between Polito and Keko.

836
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,882
Keko is very young.

837
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,844
{\an8}I get quite angry.

838
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:46,558
And some days you need
that craziness to win big games.

839
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,103
<i>Keko Magrini.</i>

840
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:55,109
<i>A beautiful pass from Keko Magrini</i>
<i>to Polito Pieres all by himself.</i>

841
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,861
<i>He'll wind up, shoot,</i>
<i>and send it on through</i>

842
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,115
{\an8}<i>and pick up another point now</i>
<i>to make the score 8-6.</i>

843
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,700
{\an8}

844
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,828
<i>Coca-Cola, can they cling</i>
<i>to that two-goal lead here?</i>

845
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,288
<i>Running towards the goal.</i>
<i>Can he put it through here?</i>

846
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:13,502
<i>Victorino Ruiz over the back line wide.</i>
<i>But we're down to the last 30 seconds.</i>

847
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,295
<i>The 30-second bell is going to sound.</i>

848
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,715
{\an8}<i>That means</i>
<i>a guaranteed victory for Coca-Cola.</i>

849
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,050
{\an8}<i>They've got a chance to go to the semis.</i>

850
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,886
Keko is super talented,

851
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,099
but I feel like it was
difficult for him to adjust

852
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,853
to having a player
like Polito on the field.

853
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,899
And Keko has been having trouble
figuring out his role on this team

854
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:36,984
with Polito.

855
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,364
<i>Despite their rocky start</i>
<i>at the top of the competition,</i>

856
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,782
<i>Coca-Cola will survive</i>

857
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,285
<i>and have a chance</i>
<i>to make it to the semifinals.</i>

858
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,877
- Should we go out tonight?
- No.

859
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,628
- Why not?
- Because.

860
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,090
Yes, please, thank you. So.

861
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,801
Tell him why not.

862
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,345
- What do you mean?
- Because we have plans.

863
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,223
- Yeah, but after.
- No, we spend the night together.

864
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,767
- Out.
- No.

865
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,020
- You don't want to go out.
- No.

866
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,897
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

867
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,940
We have dinner and we have plans.

868
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,819
You have a romantic night, right?

869
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,697
- Apparently.
- Yeah?

870
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,578
- I really want to…
- Okay, I'm going to cancel our dinner.

871
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,997
- And I'll go with Zach instead.
- Cool.

872
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,541
Okay. And you're good with that?

873
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,596
- Okay, I'm gonna go. Home.
- Where are you going? Why?

874
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,015
- Because I don't wanna be here.
- Why?

875
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,812
Like, time after the game,

876
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,565
that short of a time
you're still with the energy of the game,

877
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:02,027
with everything, and maybe if you're mad,
it's not a good moment.

878
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,411
The game itself
is incredibly competitive.

879
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,290
{\an8}It isn't a surprise that
when you kind of crank it up to 11,

880
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,792
{\an8}people can't hold on.

881
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:21,755
And, you know, my dad worked really hard
on building the absolute pinnacle

882
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,384
of excellence in this sport.

883
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,845
As my dad used to say a lot, he said,

884
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,180
"The lucky truck backed up
and dumped on him."

885
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,394
We're taking every single little win
that we can with my dad.

886
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:40,482
But sorrow and trauma, like, it has no,

887
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,526
it doesn't care who you are,
it'll come for you.

888
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,197
It's amazing how much, like, a little
squeeze of the finger means these days,

889
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,448
and open…

890
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,202
to open your eyes and have
a semblance of a smile

891
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,996
or something like that. It's like…

892
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:59,585
But yeah, to be honest,
all the little wins are…

893
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,671
absolutely…

894
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,342
They're the most exciting thing
in my world these days, honestly.

895
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,555
The other day, my mom kissed him,

896
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,891
and you could see his lips move.

897
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,893
It's like…

898
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,145
you know,

899
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,065
it just goes to show
there's so many things in the world

900
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,610
to be excited about
and all that stuff, but like,

901
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,112
when it really comes down to it,

902
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,490
like a kiss from your wife
when you're in that space, like,

903
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,744
is unbelievable.

904
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,038
You can count on one hand

905
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,999
the amount of people who matter,

906
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,792
really, really matter to you.

907
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,590
Life is a lot of sorrow,
but it's filled with a lot of joy.

908
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,551
We're hoping and praying
that it keeps going that way.
