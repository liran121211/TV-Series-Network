After the initial shock wears off, Holmes explains that he did not die in the fall that killed Professor Moriarity in their famous encounter at Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland three years earlier.

He's also working occasionally as a police surgeon and is called into the strange case of the murder of Ronald Adair. The gentleman had returned home from his club the previous evening and was apparently shot in his rooms in his parents house. No one heard a shot and the young man's room was locked from the inside. After testifying at the inquest, Watson bumps into a crippled bookseller who later turns up at his surgery. The man reveals himself to be Sherlock Holmes, alive and well. He recounts exactly what happened at the Falls and what he has been up to for the last three years. He also tells Watson that one of Moriarty's associates, Colonel Sebastian Moran - whom he has dubbed the second most dangerous man in London - is out for revenge for the death of the Professor. There is also a link to the Adair case.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0685622", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1074, "number_of_episodes": 13}
