Musgrave's butler is discovered prying into an enigmatic, centuries-old family document outlining an apparently meaningless ritual. When the butler and a maid he was romantically involved with disappear, Holmes and Watson set about deciphering the ritual's meaning which they hope will lead them to a long-buried treasure.\u2014Gabe Taverney (duke1029@aol.com)", "Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson are invited to the estate of a university acquaintance of Holmes, Sir Reginald Musgrave. Holmes isn't exactly enthusiastic about the holiday but things get interesting when the butler disappears. Due to the circumstances surrounding his departure Sir Reginald relates to Holmes the contents of a cryptic document that has been in his family's possession since the mid-17th century, the Musgrave Ritual.\u2014grantss", "Accompanied by Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes heads off to West Sussex to spend a weekend with his old school mate, Sir Reginald Musgrave. In fact, Holmes isn't all that fond of Musgrave and confides in Watson that he has had better conversation with Musgrave's butler, Richard Brunton who is quite intelligent. Holmes soon has a mystery to solve when the butler disappears after Sir Reginald caught him going through his private papers and dismissed him. The documents he seemed interested in were a very old poem that the all of the Musgraves would recite as children. It's obviously a treasure map of some sort and Sir Reginald admits that they all sought out the treasure at one time or another over several generations, but were never able to find. Holmes is convinced that by solving the mystery of the Musgrave ritual, they will solve the mystery of Brunton's disappearance as well as that of another servant who has gone missing since.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0685625", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 1085, "number_of_episodes": 13}
