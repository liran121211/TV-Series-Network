["I'm Sitting on Top of the World"

00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,115
For you, Doctor.

3
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,867
[chuckles] I'm supposed to wear this?

4
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,786
No, no, no. You're supposed to eat it.

5
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,790
I thought you might be hungry,
so I picked you up some along the way.

6
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,584
Yeah, you're supposed to wear it...
[chuckles] ...Kei.

7
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,336
[chuckles] A little torqued up, Doc, huh?

8
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,547
Well, this dress prevents breathing,

9
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,090
and these shoes prevent walking,

10
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,718
and I'm expected to impress men
who can't remember my name

11
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,470
and would just as soon shut us down

12
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,223
as turn our work into weaponry.

13
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,183
Why isn't Billy here?

14
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,393
- Are you kidding me?
- [sighs]

15
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,811
He'd look terrible in that dress.

16
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,271
[scoffs]

17
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,815
[chuckles] Look,
this is only one night a year...

18
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,317
- [sighing] All right.
- ...okay? So, we say hello,

19
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,403
say thank you
to the people who are footing the bill,

20
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,947
- and then we can go on our merry way.
- Right. Okay.

21
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,740
- Exhale.
- [breathes deeply]

22
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,451
- Smile.
- [chuckles]

23
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,744
And, uh...

24
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,414
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

25
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,209
- Have a drink. [clears throat]
- Yes.

26
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,800
Or th-three.

27
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,224
Ha, Captain Lee Shaw.

28
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,143
I ever tell you
about this son of a bitch?

29
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,520
- [Lee chuckles]
- [colonel] Unguided missile, this kid.

30
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,899
I... I pulled him out of a... a bar brawl.

31
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,611
- He was all busted up, bloody knuckles.
- [chuckles]

32
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,155
[colonel] But potential.

33
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,615
Real potential.

34
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,742
Hmm. I saw great things for you, didn't I?

35
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,868
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:08,665
Do you remember what I told you
to do to succeed in this man's army?

37
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,501
- You remember, Leland?
- Definitely. Definitely, sir.

38
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,379
You said to, uh, only punch
sailors and marines from now on.

39
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,548
Hmm.

40
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,177
That's what you said.

41
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,223
- [laughs]
- [laughs]

42
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,641
Now look at you.

43
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:30,646
A captain with the future
of Project Monarch in your hands.

44
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,773
We're excited to hear more about
this mysterious Project Monarch.

45
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,899
[Lee] Outstanding.

46
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,402
I think that you'll find our work
vital to not only American security

47
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,323
but global scientific superiority.

48
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,408
And I'd like to introduce you
to the brains of our outfit,

49
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,702
Dr. Keiko Miura.

50
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,539
- Pleasure to see you again, Doctor.
- General.

51
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,498
Thank you, Captain.

52
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,084
- Miura? Japanese name, yeah?
- [Keiko sighs]

53
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,546
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Now, she's one of the good ones.

54
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,688

- Puckett...
- General Puckett.

56
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,318
- ...is a major asshole.
- Hey, you gotta keep your voice down.

57
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,696
Okay?

58
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:26,326
Hey, guys like them,
they are old-fashioned.

59
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,204
If we ever find another Titan,

60
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,456
those old-fashioned men will blow it up

61

- or march it into Red Square.
- Kei.

62
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,461
[sighs]

63
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,507
- [clears throat]
- [softly] Yeah.

64
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,761
Have you ever heard the expression
"To a hammer, the whole world is a nail"?

65
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,847
Yeah.

66
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,891
Well, this is a hardware store.

67
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,976
[chuckles]

68
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,730
Yeah. Well, in my country,
we have a saying,

69
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,317
"The nail that sticks up
gets hammered down."

70
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,447
Not you.

71
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,658
No, you're gonna change their minds,

72
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,245
as old-fashioned as they may be.

73
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,040
How?

74
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,417
'Cause it's what you do.

75
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,670
It's who you are, Kei.

76
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,174
You are a...

77
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,135
force of nature.

78
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,030
[chuckles]

79
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,574
Come on.

80
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,035

Hmm.

{\an8}Maybe... Maybe General Puckett's right.

93
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,407
Being career military might not be so bad.

94

Mmm.

- What's, uh...
- This is the old man, yes?

[in French] Colonel, your dossier
says you speak French.

You think you know how to stop it,
but Monarch disagrees.

153
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,116
Why do you know more
than the finest physicists,

154
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,287
geologists, and zoologists on Earth?

155
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,706
Don't know more... [sighs]

156
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,042
...but I got a good idea
about what's going on.

[breathes heavily]

158
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,882
Didn't do enough about that
when I had the chance.

Figuring I was making up for that now

160
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,303
or die in the trying.

161
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,806
Why not share what you know with Monarch?
Surely they could help.

162
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,141
They've known everything for years.

163
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,396
I've been telling them for years.

164
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,607
They just don't believe it.

165
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,861
- Why not?
- Because I'm crazy.

166
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,864
Just like wild Bill Randa
and his crazy kid Hiro.

167
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,616
I mean, it's amazing, isn't it?

168
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:50,163
How anyone who disagrees with them
has gotta be just crazy.

169
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,089
What about you, mademoiselle?

170
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,302
My sister, Sandra.

She worked in Japan.

00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,518
Hmm.

174
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:16,315
Some of us came to Monarch
saying "Never again."

175
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,817
I meant it.

176
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:25,407
And there are more who feel like me,
waiting for someone to show us how.

177
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:29,995
- [sighs]
- [Duvall] I think it's you.

178
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,000
Does that make me crazy?

179
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,673
I think you and I
have a lot to talk about.

180
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,677
[door closes, engine starts]

181
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,071
Hey. Sorry for interrupting

182
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,824
your big whatever-the-hell-it-was
I-don't-give-a-shit,

183
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,954
- but I think we got a live one.
- Visual confirmation?

184
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,872
A guy thinks he saw it but isn't sure.

185
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,583
- Sounds squirrelly...
- What kind of a data are we...

186
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,127
- So... Sorry, Doctor.
- Beg your pardon, Captain.

187
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,339
Okay. Um,

188
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,842
hey, I don't know how you do
what you do, Kei,

189
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,844
but I know
that when the little squiggly line

190
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,972
shoots off the top of the page like that,
it means something.

191
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,768
The only other time I've seen
isotopic signatures like this

192
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,895
was in the Philippines.

193
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,939
It's what led us
to the wreck of the Lawton.

194
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,482
So, this is a Titan?

195
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,109
It's not definitively not a Titan.

196
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,487
Okay, that's definitively not an answer.

197
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,822
If it's not one of our bogies,
then what is it?

198
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,158
The three most beautiful words
in the English language:

199
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,619
I don't know.

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,497
- We need to get to Japan.
- Yes.

201
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,376
Now?

202
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,588
We're presenting our budget proposal
to the committee on Friday.

203
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,548
- You heard General Puckett.
- Oh, Puckett?

204
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,341
Titans don't care about budget meetings, Lee.

205
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,386
That's because Titans
don't have to sing for their supper, Kei.

206
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,347
But you know who's got
a beautiful singing voice?

207
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,725
- [sighs]
- Perfect. We'll divide and conquer.

208
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,102
You stay and deal
with the hardware store, and...

209
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:22,191
No, no, no, no. I'm not letting you
go on a Titan hunt alone.

210
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,819
- Or... Or you. Both of you.
- [Billy] Okay. Um.

211
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,529
Either... You know what I mean.

212
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,865
We need money to hunt Titans,

213
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,578
but we need to prove Titans exist
to get money.

214
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,416
Look, for the good of Monarch,
something's gotta give.

215
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,796
[sighs]

216
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:52,803
{\an8}- [sighs] It's in the middle of the Sahara.
- Not the middle-middle. More like the...

217
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,056
- North-middle.
- Yeah, of a giant desert.

218
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,307
So?

219
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,851
We got Dad's map.

220
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,895
[sighs] Nut up and pack a sun hat.

221
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,356
How are we even gonna get there?

222
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,566
[Lee] Get where?

223
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,193
- Mom?
- Shit.

224
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,403
Colonel.

225
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,280
- Mom?
- Cate, your mom is fine.

226
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,406
She's out throwing pots
with her boyfriend,

227
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,367
if that's what they're calling it
these days.

228
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,620
- [Kentaro] How did you escape?
- [Lee] Ah, you know me.

229
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,748
A little help from the outside,
sometimes from the inside.

230
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,958
What's she doing here?

231
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,294
[Lee] Well, Michelle's dancing
on the side of the angels now.

232
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,964
Pretty respectable dancer too.

233
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,216
We can use her help.

234
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,259
Something's coming.

235
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,304
G-Day times a hundred.

236
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,807
Maybe times a thousand.

237
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,475
I think your father's trying to stop
what's coming,

238
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,645
and I got a pretty good idea
how he's gonna do it.

239
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,313
Only way to know for sure is to find him.

240
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,232
Mm-mmm. She tried kidnapping me.

241
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,650
She threatened my mother.

242
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,360
On Monarch's orders.

243
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,113
But she's not taking orders
from Monarch anymore

244
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,825
because she's with us,
and you can trust her.

245
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,079
Besides, she's our ride.

246
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:05,043
Now all we need is a destination,
which is of course where you come in.

247
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,803
[Verdugo]
Cell phone data tracked them here.

248
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,848
<i>We just don't know
what they were looking for.</i>

249
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,894
All right, Columbo. Dazzle me.

250
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,898
I know you meant that as a burn,
but, uh, I actually love Columbo

251
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,400
and it's maybe the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

252
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,902
You need friends.

253
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,031
- I have friends.
- Not Internet friends.

254
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,240
[taps on table]

255
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,370
So, why'd they come here?
What were they looking for?

256
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,501
Okay. Okay.

257
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:50,546
So, Hiroshi, he, uh...
[stammers] ...he... he rents the office

258
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,423
with the million-dollar view, right?

259
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,092
But he sits with his back to it.

260
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,303
Why?

261
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,305
So he can stare...

262
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,059
at whatever was here.

263
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,498
Huh.

264
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:26,583
[Verdugo] What is it?

265
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:28,794
This pattern.

266
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,463
It's familiar, right?

267
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,340
These holes.

268
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,301
There's holes?

269
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:43,224
What did Hiroshi do to get exiled
from Monarch?

270
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,309
His file is sealed.

271
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,603
He wasn't exiled.

272
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,732
Misuse of government assets.

273
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,779
[groans]

274
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,490
He kept retargeting deep-space satellites

275
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,784
to look at things
they weren't supposed to.

276
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,245
- Like what?
- Like Earth.

277
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,122
Well, what do they normally look at?

278
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,207
Space.

279
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,339
Electromagnetic spectrum.

280
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,383
Cosmic radiation.

281
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,218
Gamma rays.

282
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,100
That's what Barnes detected
coming from places it shouldn't.

283
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,519
Yeah. From Earth.

284
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,899
I think I know what they were looking for.

285
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:38,863
Everything that Bill Randa studies,
he puts in his files.

286
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,741
Research expeditions, monitoring outposts.

287
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,204
And these files become Monarch.

288
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,039
Single holes,

289
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:51,001
these are all places Monarch has
or ever had boots on the ground.

290
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:57,590
This... This is Outpost 4, and 15, 47.

291
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,675
But...

292
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,221
these clusters...

293
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,933
I bet if we pull the data

294
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,228
on where Hiroshi
was redirecting the satellites,

295
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,355
we will get a perfect match.

296
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,233
- [personnel] Operations.
- Get me Collins in data culling.

297
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,985
I need to pull some satellite logs.

298
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,112
Yeah, I'll hold.

299
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,073
G-Day minus two:

300
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,117
Godzilla emerges west of Hawaii
at this cluster,

301
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,410
heads towards the mainland.

302
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,704
Gamma ray spike, right?

303
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,874
After G-Day, Godzilla swims west.
Another spike.

304
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,294
But Hiroshi flew north to this cluster.

305
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,549
Another gamma ray spike
where we found Shaw, his kids,

306
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,591
and that new Titan.

307
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,886
So they're looking for their father.

308
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,597
So, where are they heading now?

309
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:47,850
[sighs]

310
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,811
If we think of this as a-a subway map,

311
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,063
and-and these are the stations,

312
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,274
we just need to find
the next stop on the line.

313
00:21:56,275 --> 00:22:00,487
Now, it looks like Hiroshi
recorded three more gamma ray surges.

314
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,741
Here, in Central Asia.

315
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,744
And... What would that be?
Vietnam, Cambodia?

316
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:11,665
And here.

317
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Good work.

318
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,672
Yeah. Well, you know,
that was the thing about Columbo.

319
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,632
He was always right too.

320
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,678
- [Collins] This is Collins.
- It's Verdugo.

321
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,765
We need to redirect our satellites to
the coordinates Tim will be sending you.

322
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,142
Get Dr. Barnes on the line.

323
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,811
We're looking for gamma ray spikes.

324
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,439
[engineer muttering]

325
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,108
I think I'm in love.

326
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,111
[person muttering]

327
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,657
[in Japanese] Doctor Suzuki?

328
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,409
[in English] Huh?

329
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:48,827
[in Japanese] Pardon us.

330
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,747
Doctor Miura!

331
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:55,625
My apologies for not
anticipating your arrival.

332
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,043
Oh, my apologies as well.

333
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,961
The locals are too scared to bring

334
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,089
my mail or messages anymore.

335
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,383
- Oh.
- Even my assistant ran away. [chuckles]

336
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,011
[chuckles]

337
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,096
[clears throat]

338
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,850
Welcome to Monster Island.

339
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,727
[chuckles, mutters]

340
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,230
[in English] Sorry, sorry, uh...

341
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,940
He said, "Welcome to Monster Island."

342
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,192
Yeah. I got that part.

343
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,903
Someone should have a talk
with the board of tourism.

344
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,615
[Keiko] So there's an error
in the tracking system?

345
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,950
You misunderstand.

346
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,869
- No, but if the data is accurate...
- [Suzuki] And it is.

347
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,415
- Then it means physics are wrong.
- Wrong.

348
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,585
I prefer "incomplete."

349
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,380
Theoretical physics are riddled
with contradictions and impossibilities.

350
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,714
Hence the "theoretical" part.

351
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,675
- Yes. Still...
- But the data suggests

352
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:49,054
that whatever is out here generates
gamma radiation at cosmic levels.

353
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,599
So... [chuckles] ...I constructed that.

354
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,936
A gamma radiation simulator.

355
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,063
The more signals I simulate,

356
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,234
the more radiation
whatever is out there generates in reply.

357
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,446
So I call, it responds.

358
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,034
This clever man has made a Titan phone.

359
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,203
[chuckles]

360
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,539
- Or...
- [chuckles]

361
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,168
...this lunatic made Titan bait.

362
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,295
I prefer her version.

363
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,193
We're in the right place.

364
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,532
What?

365
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,453
Put in a lot of miles with you Randa girls
over the years.

366
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,126
Wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

367
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,380
That makes two of us.

368
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,015
This wasn't part of our deal.

369
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,393
When do I get to go home?

370
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,813
Circumstances have changed.

371
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,234
I'll keep my word.

372
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:26,902
Yeah? When?

373
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,780
As soon as we make it out of the desert.

374
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:31,990
Together.

375
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,387
[sighs]

376
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,138
Good seeing you, Scotty.

377
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,437
[groans]

378
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,689
What's going on?

379
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,358
Well, there's no more roads
where we're going from here on out.

380
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,527
No, I mean him.

381
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,403
What?

382
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,656
I don't want anything to do with
an armed Monarch goon.

383
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,116
Ex-Monarch goon.

384
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:19,079
[sighs] All the apples
in the Monarch barrel aren't bad, Cate.

385
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,665
I mean, mademoiselle here
isn't the only one fed up

386
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,417
with the way things are being run now.

387
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,170
The Colonel is starting a movement.

388
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,089
We're not here to start a movement, okay?

389
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,424
- [chuckles]
- [Cate] Okay?

390
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,259
Are you mad he got us some help?

391
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,385
From one of them? Yeah.

392
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,553
[in Japanese] Why can't you trust him?

393
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,305
[in English] Because every time I think
we're searching for Dad,

394
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,140
turns out there's some Monarch business
in the way.

395
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,851
I'm sorry everything is
tangled up together, but yes,

396
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:45,104
all these roads lead to one place,
but you're the ones with the map.

397
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,442
I could have taken it anytime I wanted,
but I haven't done that, have I?

398
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,197
All right. If this is where you want off,

399
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:58,577
just understand that the consequences
will be on your heads now too.

400
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,788
Consequences. [scoffs] What consequences?

401
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,292
Thousands, maybe millions of lives lost

402
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,922
that your grandparents and father
were trying to save.

403
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,510
L-Let's go.

404
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,686
If you wanna bail, we can bail.

405
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,648
[sighs]
But I wanted to call it a day in Alaska,

406
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:29,982
and then someone said,

407
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:34,655
"Nut up and pack a sun hat."
Only way out is through.

408
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,041
Thanks for your help.

409
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:52,464
[sighs]

410
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:54,925
[Billy] Shaw?

411
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:59,053
<i>Leland Shaw? Shaw, do you read me?</i>

412
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:02,056
Billy. Billy. Billy, I read you. Over.

413
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,433
<i>Lee! Great.</i>

414
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,062
The fish are biting, buddy.

415
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:10,648
So it's the real deal?

416
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,443
It's as real as anything else
in this goddamn circus.

417
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,906
Billy, uh, how's Keiko?

418
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:19,907
<i>How's Dr. Miura?</i>

419
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,411
I'm gonna drop a line at 0400 hours.

420
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,996
<i>Set it up, see if we get any nibbles.</i>

421
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,582
Billy, I asked you how... [stammers]

422
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,091
Exactly what kind of fish
are we talking about here, Billy?

423
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,260
A big one.

424
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:41,597
Wish you were here, pal.

425
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,327
[Puckett] What do you got,
a dinosaur there?

426
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:09,875
All right. Well, I'm gonna call it Dave.
[chuckles, sniffs]

427
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,598
You know, I don't recall
receiving your RSVP

428
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,476
for my family cookout, Captain.

429
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,272
- Sir.
- Oh, stand down, Lee.

430
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,608
We're in my backyard, for Chrissakes.

431
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,151
- [sighs]
- Hot dog?

432
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,529
No, thank you, sir.

433
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,785
My people are in the field
and they need me, sir.

434
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,621
No, we have men for that, Lee.
We call 'em the army.

435
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,832
Not the army, sir. Just me.

436
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,086
You wanna sleep under the stars?
Be a cowboy?

437
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,337
[sighs]

438
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,548
I see great things in your future, Lee.

439
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,842
But you gotta sit at the grown-ups table
if you want 'em.

440
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,385
It's called building a career.

441
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:06,014
- Monarch is my career, sir.
- Then stop treating it like a job.

442
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:11,018
In every military organization,
there are generals and there are soldiers.

443
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,436
I understand that, sir.

444
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:13,856
You could've fooled me.

445
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,940
Now, you have a choice to make

446
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,276
and I trust you to make it.

447
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,531
But understand that what you choose
will affect choices I have to make.

448
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,243
You make the wrong choice
and I will act accordingly.

449
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,287
But you make the right one,

450
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,916
and you get to run Monarch your way.

451
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,027
- [Lee] This is it.
- [Kentaro] You sure?

452
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:04,906
Well, I'm... I'm sure this is
the spot on the map,

453
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:07,910
but what that means exactly
only your dad can tell us.

454
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,413
But... [sighs] ...yeah.

455
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,958
I-I think it's just over this ridge.

456
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,155
There.

457
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,658
- [Lee] Where?
- You see? There.

458
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,453
Is that...

459
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,122
[gasps] Well, I'll be damned.

460
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,837
- [Kentaro gasps]
- [Lee chuckles]

461
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,770
- He's alive.
- [chuckles]

462
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:22,693
Dad! Over here, Dad! Dad!

463
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,821
- Dad!
- [whistles] Up here!

464
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,949
- Dad!
- [Lee shouts]

465
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:33,703
[chuckles]

466
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,038
Dad!

467
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,587
[chuckles]

468
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,357
[machine whirring]

469
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,170
Reading's flatter
than hammered shit, Suzuki.

470
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,882
I thought you said turning this thing on
was like ringing the dinner bell.

471
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:28,925
My father used to say,

472
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:32,345
"There is a reason
they call it fishing, not catching."

473
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,557
[chuckles] My pop said the same thing.

474
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,059
[chuckles]

475
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,107
Have you ever seen one?

476
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:45,692
For certain?

477
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,445
A Titan.

478
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,199
Yes, we have.

479
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:57,829
They are terrifying.

480
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,042
Good! [chuckles]

481
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:06,213
[in Japanese]
Miracles should be terrifying.

482
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,964
Don't you think?

483
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,341
[chuckles]

484
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,677
[in English] Uh, guys, something's coming.

485
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:13,761
[vehicle approaching]

486
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:15,556
No, it ain't coming from the water.

487
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,359
[chuckles] Lee!

488
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,151
Didn't think you were gonna
make the party.

489
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,780
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How'd the serenade go with the bigwigs?

490
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,323
Wait, I thought that was today.

491
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,493
It is today.

492
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:42,999
Oh, uh... uh, hey, uh...
This is, uh, Dr. Suzuki

493
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,084
and, uh, he made a...

494
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,086
- A gamma radiation simulator.
- Yeah.

495
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,714
Oh, that's great. That's great.
I can't wait to hear all about it.

496
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:53,009
[chuckles] Uh, it's a device that
actually simulates gamma radiation...

497
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,218
- Hey, Zook, um...
- ...and it's not just...

498
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,347
...you know the only thing worse
than being a third wheel?

499
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:59,600
Being a fourth. Let's walk.

500
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,395
[Suzuki] But four wheels
are intrinsically stable.

501
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,815
That's why a car has four wheels. Cars...

502
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,820
[sighs]

503
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,371
[whirring continues]

504
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:25,334
[Lee] Now, now, wait a minute.
I think he... I think he's waving us off.

505
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,127
- [Kentaro] Why? What's going on?
- [Lee] Oh, no.

506
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,088
- [Cate] What is he doing?
- [Lee] No, no, no.

507
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,675
[gasps]

508
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,972
We gotta get out of here!
Come on, we gotta move! Now!

509
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,225
- Now! Move! We need to go now!
- [gasps, grunts]

510
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,393
Kentaro, we gotta go!

511
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,603
- [grunts]
- We gotta go now!

512
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:46,939
[helicopter approaching]

513
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,494
There they are! That's them.

514
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:08,418
[laughs] Columbo, baby!

515
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,671
Take us down.

516
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,510
[laughs]

517
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,057
[machine whirring]

518
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,903
[Keiko] You weren't supposed to come.

519
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:41,493
My place is here with you, Kei.

520
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,705
- You need...
- What?

521
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,332
Your protection?

522
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,125
That's my job.

523
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,378
No, your job is to protect Monarch.

524
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,174
Without you, there is no Monarch.

525
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,554
Tell me that's not why you're here.

526
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,472
For me.

527
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,852
[sighs]

528
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,993
You know we can't do this.

529
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,078
We can try.

530
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,875
How long before either of us
makes a decision

531
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,168
based on what we want to do

532
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:33,670
instead of what Monarch needs?

533
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,881
You don't trust me.

534
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,181
I don't trust either of us.

535
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:47,768
[sighs]

536
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,899
If we can't put the greater good
before our own desires,

537
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,735
we risk losing everything.

538
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,195
I don't care.

539
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:00,280
[sighs]

540
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,002
- Yes, you do.
- [whirring continues]

541
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,054
[whirring stops]

542
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,139
It stopped.

543
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,183
What?

544
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,477
The device.

545
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,230
It stopped. [gasps]

546
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,277
[Lee] Where is it?

547
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,540
[both grunting]

548
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,709
Oh, my God.

549
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,606
[roars]

550
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:24,907
We didn't kill it.

551
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,368
Jesus Christ, we didn't kill it.

552
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,001
[Monarch personnel] Wait, don't land.

553
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,462
[gasps]

554
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,673
[grunting, gasping]

555
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:44,218
[radio chatter]

556
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,387
<i>The hell is that?</i>

557
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:00,234
[grunting]

558
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,460
Oh, my God.

559
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,173
[screams]

560
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,597
[grunting, coughing]

561
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,521
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

562
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:44,653
[grunting]

563
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:53,262
Get us out of here! Pull up! Hey! Pull up!

564
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,597
- [clamoring, through radio]
- Pull up!

565
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:55,849
[Monarch Personnel] Brace for impact!

566
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,736
[roaring]

567
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,802
[Cate gasps] Did you see?

568
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,680
He saw me.

569
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,099
Yeah, he did.

570
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:47,859
- We cannot keep them in the dark.
- Why not?

571
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,652
Look, I know how you feel about Puckett...

572
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:51,904
- [sighs] Puckett.
- ...but this changes everything.

573
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:53,281
I don't agree.

574
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:55,950
The most powerful weapon
this country's ever created

575
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:59,161
could not bring that thing down,
so we can't keep that to ourselves.

576
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,830
- So we tell them and then what?
- [sighs]

577
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,164
They build an even bigger weapon

578
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,083
- and try again.
- Kei...

579
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,293
[Keiko] And if that doesn't work,
an even bigger one.

580
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,086
And if they can't find Godzilla,

581
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,173
maybe then they'll find
somebody else to use it on.

582
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,803
I wasn't supposed to
go after you two.

583
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:18,556
And I certainly wasn't supposed to
come back empty-handed,

584
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:20,975
so I need something... We need something,

585
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,935
anything that I can put
in front of Puckett

586
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:24,812
so we can get our asses
out of the doghouse.

587
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:26,732
[sighs]

588
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:32,779
[sighs] All right.

589
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,491
- All right.
- [Keiko sighs]

590
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,578
So let's get our shit together, yeah?

591
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,080
I'll try and go sell this to Puckett.

592
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,962
Gentlemen. Doctor.

593
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,592
Just going over
some of your field reports.

594
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:57,094
Some... [chuckles] ...wild stuff in here.

595
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,805
Who the... Uh, what's going on?

596
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:02,518
In the Navy,
we call it "change of command."

597
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:07,230
During Captain Shaw's
unauthorized absence,

598
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:09,941
General Puckett handed
operational command and control

599
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:12,528
of Project Monarch to me.

600
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,406
I'll expect a full report and accounting
of your little field trip

601
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:20,202
on my desk by end of day.

602
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,330
[Keiko breathes shakily]

603
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:25,916
What have you done?

604
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,303
[Cate] Did you find anyone?

605
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:42,266
[Lee] No one survived the crash,
and we're running out of time.

606
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,018
We need to find out
where Godzilla is going

607
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,355
before Monarch does,
so we need to move now.

608
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,899
- This is gonna lead us to him.
- That map belongs to us.

609
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,901
No, this map stays with me.

610
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,570
So we chase Godzilla, then what?

611
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:58,406
More people die? We can't stop him.

612
00:44:58,407 --> 00:44:59,491
Stop him?

613
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:04,787
Jesus, Cate. I'm trying to help him.

614
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,790
Oh, my God. You're insane.

615
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:11,711
What I am is done debating. [sighs]

616
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:14,463
But if you come with me,
you'll know everything.

617
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,383
- I promise you.
- No.

618
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,970
The only place we're going
is after our father.

619
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:22,514
I'm out.

620
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:32,482
I'm going with them.

621
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:38,279
[stammers] I'll leave you
plenty of water and food.

622
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,242
You won't need it 'cause civilization
is just ten klicks that way.

623
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,831
You go now,
you'll be there long before dinner.

624
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,584
[in French] Allons-y.

625
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,504
[grunts]

626
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,679
[engine starts, vehicle departs]

627
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,527
[Kentaro, in English] Do you think he was
waving us away?

628
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:18,612
I don't know.

629
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:22,449
He just took off.

630
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:27,204
Maybe he was running from Godzilla.

631
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:30,791
Or trying to lure him, you know,
away from us.

632
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,711
At least we know he made it this far.

633
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,672
And so did we.

634
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,508
[chuckles] He's alive.

635
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,051
So we keep looking.

636
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,179
[Kentaro] How many klicks have we gone?

637
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,765
[sighs] No idea.

638
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,686
How are we gonna go from here?

639
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:52,938
We don't have any money or phones.

640
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:54,814
How are we going to find Dad
without the map?

641
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,526
[Cate] Well, someone always seems to have
a backup of her backups.

642
00:46:58,277 --> 00:46:59,820
You wouldn't let us down, would you, May?

643
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:07,869
It was a joke.

644
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,163
No, I can't do this anymore.
This is my fault.

645
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:15,752
- [chuckles] What do you mean?
- Seriously. No, I sold you out.

646
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:22,384
- What?
- Just hear me out, okay? [pants]

647
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,846
A couple of years ago,
I pissed some people off

648
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,682
and I let some people down,
and so I had to run.

649
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:31,351
And then I ran to Japan

650
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,771
and I lied about my life and my name,
who I was.

651
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:39,817
And I was living nice and-and quiet
until Monarch figured me out

652
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,068
when they picked us up.

653
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,278
They left a deal on the table,

654
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,363
and they said that if I told them
where we were,

655
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,532
I could go home
and I could get my life back

656
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:47,951
and I could be with my family.

657
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:53,707
[sighs] And so, yes, I sold us out,
and I'm the reason that they found us.

658
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,084
"The only way out is through."

659
00:47:57,085 --> 00:48:00,171
- Look, I have money.
- I don't want your goddamn money.

660
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:01,923
Listen, I have a lot of money.

661
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:04,050
And I never touched it because
the wrong people could find me.

662
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,676
But I don't care anymore.
It doesn't matter.

663
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:07,345
I can get us wherever you wanna go.

664
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:08,430
Go to hell.

665
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,309
Cate, I'm sorry.

666
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:15,687
Cate. [sighs]
