[person, in Japanese]
Your work is a bold statement.

58
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:22,883
Why this?

59
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,135
Why now?

00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:26,680

62
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,102
You hesitated.

63
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,896
It's a complicated question.

64
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,692
And you've had months to
come up with an answer.

65
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,859
Art...

66
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,779
...comes from a place you don't
feel comfortable talking about.

67
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,156
To me it's just intuitive.

68
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,493
I respect your process.

69
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:52,663
But if buyers are going
to plunk down money, good money,

70
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:56,459
they want to know what they are getting.
Who they are getting.

71
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,168
People...

72
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,211
...don't buy the art...

73
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,714
they buy the artist.

74
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,090
I know, Kimi.

75
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:04,009
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,593
You have two hours before
we open the doors

77
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,803
to figure out an answer
that makes me believe you.

78
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:10,682
We both have a lot at stake tonight.

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,270

I'm not.

85
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,374

86
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,338
It wouldn't be very "provocative"
if everyone loved it.

He will tonight.

93
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,105
He's coming straight from the airport.
[chuckles]

97

...you've worked hard for this.

98
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,791
You deserve it.

99
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,337
There are snacks.

100
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,464
[Emiko, in English] Mmm.

101

No.

[in Japanese] I saw you.

105
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,855
[Kentaro] I was taking a picture
of my poster for my show,

106
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,236
and you walked in front of it
gawking like a tourist.

00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:53,158
[in English] "Parallels and Interiors."
Sounds pretentious.

108
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,411
Incredibly.

109
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,838
You know what would be
incredibly respectful is if you...

110
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:11,136
Yeah.

111
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,139
- Deleted.
- Thank you.

112
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:19,269
Is there a reason you don't like
your picture being taken?

113
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:23,565
I...

114
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,650
It's a very nice picture.

115
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:31,740
Are you hitting on me?

116
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,242
Just being honest.

117
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:40,290
Is this really you?

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

119
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,586
Is there wine?

120
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,633
It's cheap. Bad. Pretentious.

[chuckles]

122
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,302
Pretentious wine.

123
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,678
Right.

124
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,971
Do you like whiskey?

125
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,265
I like expensive whiskey.

126
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,977
You're in luck. Japan has
some very expensive whiskey.

127
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,771
Cool.

128
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,481
- I know a place.
- Now?

129
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,234
But don't you have a show?

130
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,820
Um, I'll make an entrance later.

131
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:12,696
Oh.

132
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,157
[chuckles] Okay.

133
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:15,617
I'm Kentaro.

134
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,203
I'm May.

135
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:19,913
May.

136
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,748
[Kentaro] May. May.
Where are you going? Slow down.

137
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,167
Slow down? [pants]

138
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:27,711
Unless you want to add a set of toes
to what you already owe me,

139
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:28,837
you need to speed your ass up.

140
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,839
He's right, May. Conserve your energy.

141
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,925
Wet legs,
you're gonna be fighting hypothermia.

142
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,093
[Kentaro] We gotta get you dry.

143
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:37,596
No. Even if there was anything out here
to build a fire with,

144
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:40,058
we can't sit still
with that Titan on the prowl.

145
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,269
- You still think it's out there?
- [Lee] Hell if I know.

146
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,522
[May] What are you ta... What happened to
your centuries of experience now, huh?

147
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:47,983
It's a Titan, May.

148
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,110
They're like snowflakes.

149
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,778
Never came across two that were same.

150
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,699
Okay. Well, maybe there's some info
on these precious files of yours.

151
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,783
Go to hell

152
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:00,828
- and take your life's work with you.
- Hey. Easy with these. Now come on, May.

153
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,037
[Cate] Once the sun goes down,

154
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,706
the temperature's gonna drop
by the minute.

155
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,499
We've got no food, no shelter.

156
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,001
No Du-Ho.

157
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:08,669
[sighs] Where the hell are we going?

158
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,838
Northwest. We head for the coast.

159
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,215
Greater probability
of running into people there.

160
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,300
[sighs]

161
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,302
- I think I saw something from the plane.
- [Lee] What?

162
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:18,220
[stammers] Saw what?

163
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,181
Some kind of structure.
Looked like a big golf ball.

164
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,266
[Lee scoffs]

165
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,644
It had to be man-made,
like a building or settlement.

166
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,520
All right. All right.

167
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,105
Did either one of you see it?

168
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,190
No.

169
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,777
But May did.

170
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,570
What? No.

171
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:36,822
No. You said you saw something.

172
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:37,908
I didn't see anything.

173
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,035
[in Japanese] You're taking their side?

174
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,077
[in English] Is it 'cause
you're pissed at me?

175
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,039
No. This has nothing to do with you.
This is about me freezing to death.

176
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,665
I'm trying to save you. Will you just...

177
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,751
Trust me.

178
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,761
- [knocks]
- [Kentaro, in Japanese] Sota?

179
00:11:58,762 --> 00:11:59,721
[Sota] <i>Password.</i>

180
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,388
Sota. It's me, man. Kentaro.

181
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,514
[Sota] <i>Who?</i>

182
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:03,600
Kentaro.

183
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,393
- [Sota] <i>Password.</i>
- [static]

184
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,313
[in English] Okay. Forget about it.
This place is a dump.

185
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:10,232
[in Japanese] Dump!

186
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:12,984
[Sota] Hurry up!

187
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,449
[door buzzing]

188
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,826
Dump?!

189
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,161
She didn't mean it.

190
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:25,871
[chuckles] Prove me wrong.

191
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,456
[chuckles]

192
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:28,667
[in English] I like you.

193
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:31,169
[in Japanese]
And you're too easy to mess with.

194
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:37,551
[in English] Okay. You've proved me wrong.

195
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:39,636
[in Japanese] May, this is Sota.

196
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,096
Owner.

197
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:42,013
Manager.

198
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:43,055
Asshole.

199
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:44,683
[chuckles] Guilty of all charges.

200
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:48,019
[in English] Wait.
You have your own bottle?

201
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,521
You are as pretentious as I thought.

202
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:51,605
That's how it works here.

203
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:52,857
Uh-huh.

204
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:56,528
- [in Japanese] But maybe we can do better.
- [Sota, in English] Okay.

205
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,782
Oh. Okay.

206
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,284
So, you're a successful artist.

207
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:04,410
I designed the lighting here.

208
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:05,370
[glasses clinking]

209
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,496
- What? No way.
- Yeah.

210
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:08,415
Oh.

211
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,126
So, he lets me pretend,
and even open early for me.

212
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:13,587
[speaks Japanese]

213
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,760
What do you do?

214
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:22,888
Uh, computer shit.

215
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:27,433
It's not nearly as interesting as art.
How long have you been doing it?

216
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,517
Since I was little.

217
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,686
But as a job, I guess, since tonight.

218
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,230
What? Like... What do you mean? [chuckles]

219
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,108
- Like, tonight's your first show?
- Yeah.

220
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,235
Don't you feel like you should be there?

221
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,280
Um, I'm letting the suspense build.

222
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,782
- It's all part of the act.
- Oh. Part of the act.

223
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,117
Is this part of the act?

224
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:46,493
W-What do you mean?

225
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:50,165
The secret whiskey bar and you,
the artist, next big thing.

226
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,083
[in Japanese] Does he bring other girls?

227
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,544
As a bartender, I can't say.

228
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:57,421
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles] Asshole.

229
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,632
[in English] I mean,
I didn't say it was a bad act.

230
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,134
I mean, as far as acts go.

231
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:04,262
This isn't an act.

232
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:10,851
I judge an artist based on their art,
not on a suit and a haircut.

233
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,437
- [lock clicking]
- [keys jingle]

234
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,486
[door closes]

235
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,200
What?

236
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,577
Why isn't this stuff in the gallery?

237
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,746
[Kentaro] These aren't for sale.

238
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:32,540
[May sighs]

239
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,418
You're definitely
more than just a haircut.

240
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:38,755
Kimi sent me to her stylist.

241
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,007
People buy the artist.

242
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:44,761
I mean, sure.

243
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,099
Rich pricks who have
more money than good taste.

244
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:54,187
Why don't you tell Kimi
what pieces you want in the show?

245
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:56,106
[Kentaro] Hmm.

246
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,024
It's her gallery.

247
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,570
- She was taking a chance on me...
- Chance on you?

248
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:04,698
Like, out of the goodness of her heart?

249
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,242
Come on. That's bullshit.

250
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:11,454
People don't give other people a shot
unless there's something in it for them.

251
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,583
That's pretty cynical.

252
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:17,294
That's life.

253
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:19,796
[cell phone chimes]

254
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:26,719
You should probably go.

255
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,806
The, um... The rich pricks are waiting.

256
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:37,314
Come with me.

257
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:40,190
Not really my crowd.

258
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,276
Mine either.

259
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:44,029
[chuckles] Get used to it, hotshot.

260
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,284
Wait. [grunts]

261
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:54,706
Okay.

262
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:56,415
Now you can go.

263
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,876
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

264
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,604
[Cate sighs] Okay.

265
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:20,023
Somebody has to say it.

266
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:22,275
I don't see any buildings.

267
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:25,527
It must be behind those hills.

268
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,655
[sighs] Must it?

269
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,865
- Kentaro, we agreed...
- You all agreed.

270
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,659
[Lee] You got passion, kid.
I'll give you that.

271
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,412
- Stop treating me like a kid.
- [Cate stammers] Hold on.

272
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,039
I know what I saw.

273
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,248
- [Cate] No, no, no.
- [Lee] What?

274
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:38,333
Over there.

275
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:41,377
- [Lee] What? Where?
- [Cate] Right there. What is that?

276
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:42,503
[Lee] Oh, yeah. I see it.

277
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,130
I don't know. Lights on an oil rig maybe,
or a local settlement.

278
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:47,259
[Cate] Point is, it's out there, right?

279
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,678
- We follow something we can all see.
- Yeah.

280
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,845
You don't know how far that is.

281
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:54,306
That Titan can catch you
before you get halfway there.

282
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:55,933
Whatever I saw is closer.

283
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,687
- Yeah, if it exists.
- [May] Okay. Kentaro.

284
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:04,234
Look, you have a brilliant imagination,
but now is not the time to use it.

285
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,652
I'm going.

286
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:09,905
Alone if I have to.

287
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,700
Oh, my God. You obstinate asshole.

288
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:16,328
- So, what? You wanna die to prove a point?
- Do you?

289
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,497
- No.
- [Lee] Stop. Stop. Please, stop.

290
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,292
You think you saw something?

291
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:22,418
Yeah. I know what I saw.

292
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,463
Then go, and don't stop until you find it,
and then get help.

293
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:27,549
We'll do the same.

294
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:30,342
Good luck.

295
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:31,887
We're all gonna need it.

296
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,603
No. No. We can't just let him leave.

297
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,898
He's made his choice, Cate. Let's go.

298
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,537
[Verdugo] Dr. Barnes, I understand
you have something for us?

299
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,706
[Barnes] <i>Yeah. Hold on.
Sharing my screen now.</i>

300
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:02,333
- What are we looking at here?
- <i>Radiation.</i>

301
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,418
<i>Specifically, gamma rays
in the 30 exahertz range.</i>

302
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,087
- Where is this radiation coming from?
- <i>That's the crazy thing.</i>

303
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,340
<i>You only see these kinds
of spikes from pulsars.</i>

304
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:12,343
<i>Supermassive black holes from outer space.</i>

305
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:13,677
- But not this?
- <i>No.</i>

306
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,137
<i>This was coming from the earth.</i>

307
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,347
Where exactly on the earth?

308
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,974
<i>Well, the detector that picked it up
is an old model,</i>

309
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,059
<i>it's pretty much an antique.</i>

310
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,061
- <i>They're pretty finicky.</i>
- I'll note it in the next budget request.

311
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,812
- Where?
- <i>It was a rhythmic pulse,</i>

312
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,564
<i>well, like... like a pulsar</i>

313
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:28,652
<i>but as far as I know,
there aren't any pulsars in Alaska.</i>

314
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,154
Thank you, Dr. Barnes.
Send us everything you have

315
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,406
and we'll get an analysis team
out to you right away.

316
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:36,283
<i>Wait, wait, wait!
That's not the big thing.</i>

317
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,452
<i>The last time anyone
saw readings like this</i>

318
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,580
<i>was right before the last emergence event.</i>

319
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:42,998
<i>From Janjira and Yucca Flats.</i>

320
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,459
Before G-Day.

321
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,807
[breathing heavily]

322
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,017
[May, echoing] <i>Kentaro!</i>

323
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:03,353
[Kentaro] May?

324
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:04,938
Is that you?

325
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,731
[Cate, echoing] <i>Kentaro!</i>

326
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:08,900
Cate?

327
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:10,694
Shaw?

328
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:14,281
[voices whispering]

329
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,220
[Cate] <i>We shouldn't have let Kentaro go.</i>

330
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,014
[grunts] He won't survive the night.

331
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,098
[sighs]

332
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:42,808
He just needs to hang on
until we get help.

333
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,020
[grunts, breathing heavily]

334
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:50,024
- Come on, May, let me carry that bag.
- No. Stop. No!

335
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,109
He wants something.

336
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:53,236
She's getting delirious.

337
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,866
Few more steps, okay?

338
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,161
Think of how warm it'll be
when we get there.

339
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,165
Blankets, hot coffee.

340
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,666
- Whiskey.
- [chuckles]

341
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,377
[breathing heavily] Come on.

342
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:30,523
[grunts]

343
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:33,235
No.

344
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:46,998
[all grunting]

345
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,379
[breathing heavily, groans] Shit.

346
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,924
[Cate] What? We're back at Dad's tent?

347
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,261
- How did this happen?
- [sighs]

348
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:01,679
[Cate] We're walking in circles.

349
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,641
Uh, Titans have odd effects
on their surroundings

350
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:07,643
and how we experience them.

351
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:12,148
The cloud we flew through, this place,
it's stranger than you think.

352
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,901
It's stranger than anybody knows.

353
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,196
[shivering]

354
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,909
If we don't warm her up, she's gonna die.

355
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,453
We can all die if that Titan's still here.

356
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:28,331
Well, I'm not leaving here without her.

357
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:30,917
We are not losing another person.

358
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:50,186
Beautiful.

359
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:03,199
It is.

360
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:10,999
Tell me why you don't wanna go
to your gallery opening again.

361
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,713
Why does it matter to you if I go?

362
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:19,757
Well, it doesn't.

363
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:23,970
But I don't think you should be ashamed
to take credit for what you do.

364
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:25,764
What do you do?

365
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:32,854
I just brought you here
and bared my artist's soul.

366
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:35,898
You haven't told me shit about yourself.

367
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,317
I told you. I do computer shit.

368
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:39,777
- Computer shit?
- Yeah.

369
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:40,862
Yeah, okay. Come on.

370
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:58,380
I'm from Tacoma. Tacoma sucks.
So, I came to Japan.

371
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,674
Japan is cool.

372
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,384
Is that better?

373
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:04,177
[Kentaro muttering] I'm sorry.

374
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:06,930
It's okay. You didn't make Tacoma suck.

375
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:14,562
So, you can stay as long as you want,
or you can come with me?

376
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:16,814
This is your party. [sighs]

377
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,775
I've already seen all the best stuff.

378
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,860
Can I see you again?

379
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,076
- Give me your number. [chuckles]
- This is your phone?

380
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,745
Yeah. I like a physical button.

381
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:36,334
- [cell phone ringing]
- [Kentaro] Um, you need to...

382
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:38,210
Ignore it.

383
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,671
[buttons beeping]

384
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:42,214
Try not to break anything.

385
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:44,175
[chuckles] How would you tell?

386
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:46,970
[cell phone ringing]

387
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,731
Hello? Hey.

388
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,358
[sighs] I'm traveling.

389
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:02,485
For work, yeah.

390
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,116
No. Look, you... you gotta stop calling me.

391
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:12,954
I... [sighs] I'll call you
when I'm back, yeah?

392
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:15,999
Okay, you too.

393
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,126
Yeah, bye.

394
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,150
Beautiful.

395
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:46,946
Beautiful. [shivering]

396
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:49,532
- This shit is so beautiful.
- [Cate] May.

397
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,327
Stay with me. May. May.

398
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:56,373
Oh... [stammers] My legs are burning.

399
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,457
Like pins and needles?

400
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,417
More like swords and daggers.

401
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:02,254
- [groans]
- That's really good.

402
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,672
Your nerves are waking up.

403
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:06,048
You don't have frostbite yet.

404
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,758
[May breathes shakily] Yet.

405
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,134
Good bedside manner.

406
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:10,762
[shivering]

407
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:17,935
Hey. If anything happens to me,
just get in touch with my sister.

408
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:20,437
Her name's... [inhales sharply]
Her name is Lyra.

409
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:21,731
No. Let's not go there.

410
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:25,986
She's the only...
only person that I can call.

411
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:30,072
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give you her number.

412
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:31,198
I'm sure Kentaro knows h...

413
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:33,993
No. He doesn't know shit.

414
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:36,204
[Lee] Hope you're not talking about me.

415
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,082
[sighs] Compliments of Du-Ho.

416
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,751
Crackers and chocolate.

417
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:43,961
How's she doing?

418
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:45,422
[breathes shakily] Better.

419
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:53,346
[exhales sharply]

420
00:25:54,598 --> 00:25:56,850
[Lee] All right. Her pants are dry.

421
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:03,105
[groans] We're gonna
have to stoke that fire.

422
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,315
[grunts]

423
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:07,611
This is nothing but kindling.
I mean, it's not gonna last very long.

424
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,740
And who knows what's in your dad's papers.

425
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:15,410
I mean, it could tell us
what he was doing here.

426
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:19,372
Theories, discoveries, where he went.

427
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,000
[shivering]

428
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:26,213
Let it burn.

429
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:28,006
[breathing deeply]

430
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,853
[rumbling]

431
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:47,900
Get your gear on! We gotta move! Come on!

432
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:49,318
Get back to where we hid before.

433
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,487
- Come on.
- May!

434
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:54,199
- [whimpers]
- Go, go, go, go, go!

435
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,328
- [whimpers] May.
- [Lee] Wait, wait. Stop. Don't move.

436
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,248
[Cate] It could be anywhere. Listen.

437
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,335
[shrieks, gasps]

438
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,879
[creature roars]

439
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,723
I can't run from that thing anymore.

440
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:24,271
We may not have to.

441
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:28,566
This morning,
Outpost 47 registered readings

442
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,653
I consider noteworthy.

443
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:33,905
Dr. Barnes.

444
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:35,864
- [tech 1] Oh, my God.
- [tech 2] What?

445
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:38,742
That can't be right.
These readings mirror, uh...

446
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:41,162
The gamma-ray flare
before the San Francisco...

447
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:43,707
event.

448
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:46,584
Call it what it was. An attack.

449
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:48,919
Well, what do you suggest?
Full mobilization?

450
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,297
- Try out your Titan warning system?
- [Tim] <i>Uh, excuse me.</i> [clears throat]

451
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:53,716
- [Bagheri] Create a worldwide panic?
- Better than a thousand dead.

452
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:55,509
- <i>Or 10,000.</i>
- Excuse me.

453
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,845
[Bagheri] We don't know if these creatures
have malevolent intent.

454
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:00,098
- [Tim] <i>Excuse me!</i>
- Quiet down.

455
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:03,976
[shushes] Tim, you have something?

456
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:07,104
<i>We can't dismiss Bill Randa's files.</i>

457
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:10,399
Now, look, Lee Shaw was there.
He knows something that we don't.

458
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,861
- <i>That's why he's going after the files.</i>
- Quiet!

459
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:17,406
<i>Uh, most of you all don't know me,
and if you do,</i>

460
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:21,912
<i>I'm the troll from the basement
that you try to avoid in the break room.</i>

461
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:25,539
It's fine. It's not like I work here
for the after-work karaoke anyway.

462
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,750
Your point.

463
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,962
[sighs] <i>I thought that we were here</i>

464
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:35,425
<i>to learn everything we can
in any way that we can</i>

465
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:39,471
<i>so no one else has to lose
another loved one in a Titan event.</i>

466
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:42,598
<i>And I would've thought
that a bunch of people</i>

467
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,479
<i>who signed up to study
giant, atomic-powered monsters</i>

468
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:49,814
<i>would be a little bit more
open-minded about it.</i>

469
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,279
[Lee] We may be knocked on our asses
but we're not done yet,

470
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,823
'cause now we know how our enemy works.

471
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:00,659
- We do?
- [Shaw groans] Yeah.

472
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,328
That Titan didn't go after us,
it went after the fire.

473
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:07,540
Didn't go after Kentaro, it went after
that burning airplane engine.

474
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,544
That's how it's tracking us.

475
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:12,920
It's drawn to the heat. Oh, my God.

476
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:16,590
Then why did it toss that airplane
like a chew toy... [pants]

477
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,176
...and come chasing after us?

478
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:22,137
Because my brother tried saving our asses
by shooting a flare at it.

479
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,599
And after the flare,
we were the warmest things.

480
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:30,522
And this is how we beat this damn thing.

481
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:34,900
We dangle the biggest, brightest,
hottest object we can in front of it.

482
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,152
Never been so thankful for a full bladder.

483
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:39,196
Aviation fuel.

484
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:40,281
Flint.

485
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:43,742
Gonna light this thing brighter
than Times Square on VJ Day.

486
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,119
Uh, what? What day?

487
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,455
We build a bonfire. We feed it.

488
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:50,874
And then while that Titan's
absorbing its heat...

489
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:54,796
[grunts] ...we hightail it to the coast.
I'll carry you if I have to.

490
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:57,757
[grunting]

491
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,819
May, just a little further, okay?

492
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:19,529
We're gonna make it.

493
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:23,199
I'm not.

494
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:28,830
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to ditch me, okay?

495
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,834
Yes. And if the time comes,

496
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:35,378
you ditch him too.

497
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,423
Save yourself, Cate.

498
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:41,635
One of us
has to make it out of here alive.

499
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:56,441
[voice, echoing] <i>Who's there?</i>

500
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:01,738
Hello?

501
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:10,038
- Hello?
- [voice, echoing] <i>What are you doing here?</i>

502
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:12,249
Are you real?

503
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,460
[voice, echoing] <i>I thought I was alone.</i>

504
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:17,545
So did I.

505
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:18,964
[voice, echoing] <i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

506
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,348
[in Japanese] Dad...

507
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,021
Don't leave me!

508
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,232
Wait, Dad!

509
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:38,942
It's me!

510
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:41,403
Don't...

511
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:12,434
[wheezing, coughing]

512
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:40,587
[breathes shakily]

513
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:44,525
[scratching]

514
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:45,860
[gasps]

515
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,412
[gasps]

516
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:57,956
I did sell a few pieces...

517
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,335
...but Kimi dropped me anyway.

518
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,671
[scratching]

519
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:11,094
"It's a huge opportunity," you said.

520
00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:15,140
"You're so talented."

521
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:17,434
"You can do this."

522
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,061
"I believe in you."

523
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:22,814
That's what you said that time.

524
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:27,443
How the hell...

525
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,905
...would you know
if I was ready or not?

526
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:33,032
But I didn't want to disappoint you.

527
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,577
So I couldn't face you...

528
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:41,791
How was I supposed to know
I'd never see you again?

529
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:43,668
Dad?

530
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:51,968
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

531
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,095
Everybody loved it.

532
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,305
Your mother loved it.

533
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:57,682
[distorted] I loved it too.

534
00:34:58,725 --> 00:34:59,976
I'm proud of you.

535
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,771
Congratulations.

536
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,315
[distorted dialogue]

537
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,068
[static]

538
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:50,944
[static continues]

539
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,451
[Cate, in English]
Are we really doing this?

540
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,620
[Lee] It's a funeral pyre, Cate.

541
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,998
Du-Ho always wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

542
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:08,461
I'm just pouring one out for the guy
who loved getting one over on me.

543
00:36:09,004 --> 00:36:12,840
First night we met, brother,
I... I couldn't believe

544
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:16,093
how you were drinking me
underneath the table that night.

545
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:18,596
- [helicopter whirring]
- [Lee] And then I realized

546
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:20,973
- every time you took a shot...
- Do you hear that?

547
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:22,434
- Shaw. Shaw! It's...
- ...all you really...

548
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:25,145
[roars]

549
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:28,064
[both screaming]

550
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,652
- Go! Run!
- May!

551
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:37,324
Hey, big boy! Big boy! Over here!

552
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:41,286
Oh, Jesus. No. Where is it? No.

553
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:46,958
- Help! Help! Help!
- [grunting]

554
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:49,878
- [whimpering]
- [growling]

555
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:52,505
[screaming]

556
00:36:54,174 --> 00:36:57,009
[groans] Need a shield
to ride a rocket ship.

557
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,638
Dinner time, you son of a bitch. [grunts]

558
00:37:02,265 --> 00:37:03,350
[grunts]

559
00:37:08,188 --> 00:37:09,856
[screaming]

560
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,566
May, come on.

561
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:13,777
You can do this.

562
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:16,446
The chopper! Let's go.

563
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:26,706
[grunting]

564
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:33,379
[footsteps thudding]

565
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,589
[roars]

566
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:51,648
- [Cate grunting] May! Come on!
- [May] Oh, shit.

567
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:53,858
[Cate] I got you!

568
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:56,610
- Come on, hurry!
- [Cate] Kentaro!

569
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,028
- Let's go!
- Kentaro?

570
00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:00,115
- [Kentaro] Come on. Go.
- [Lee] Go. Go.

571
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,326
[Lee] Pick it up!

572
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:07,246
[Cate shrieks]

573
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:08,582
[grunts]

574
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:36,442
They said the signal was so weak,

575
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,945
they almost didn't hear me
on the emergency channel.

576
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:44,241
I never thought I'd thank someone
for abandoning their family,

577
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,827
but here we are.

578
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,205
Dad was there. Before me.

579
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,249
- Just like at his camp.
- How do you...

580
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,627
Someone had to fix the radio that I found.

581
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:56,296
Left a mess of shavings behind.

582
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:01,425
He made it out.

583
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,677
He's alive.

584
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:05,180
[May] Thank you.

585
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:22,489
[radio chatter]

586
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:29,955
No. No, no, no. Oh, goddamn it.

587
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:31,623
Damn it.

588
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:43,927
[Tim] Colonel Shaw!

589
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,305
It's an honor to finally meet you!
