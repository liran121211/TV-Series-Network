1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:02,503
[knocks]

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,673
[colonel] Enter.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:09,927
[door closes]

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,519
Lieutenant Shaw reporting as ordered, sir.

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,233
[colonel] At ease.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,570
Oh.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,031
I believe that's gonna stick around
awhile.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,286
You know, this island is lousy
with sailors, Marines.

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,498
You couldn't pick a fight with one of them
instead of two of our own?

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,459
[both grunt]

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,254
Sometimes the fight picks you, sir.

12
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,797
[colonel] What was the fight even about?

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,678
I guess I just can't abide bullies, sir.

14
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,430
[colonel] You know, your father
threw a few punches in his day.

15
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,766
Some of them at me.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,059
[chuckles]

17
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,397
- What do you think he'd make of you now?
- [grunting, groaning]

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
[Lee] I don't know, sir.

19
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,276
Maybe we could sober him up and ask him.

20
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,905
All right.

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,991
Well, some orders have come through.

22
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,536
Security escort for a Japanese scientist.

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,122
[stammers] Sorry, sir.
A Japanese scientist?

24
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,748
[colonel] This isn't a milk run,
Lieutenant.

25
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,043
We already lost a man
on one of these escort missions

26
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,170
a couple of months back.

27
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,175
You will protect, observe, and report
when and if able. Understood?

28
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,426
Understood, sir.

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,636
Then that is all, Lieutenant.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,931
Dismissed.

31
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,324
Excuse me, sir, uh, you don't happen to be
Dr. Miura, would...

32
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,201
[speaks Japanese]

33
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,660
Miura?

34
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,704
- [speaks Japanese]
- Oh, sorry.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,290
I think you're here for me.

36
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,961
[chuckles] Wish I could say I was,
but I'm here on army business.

37
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,507
Maybe we can get a drink
on my way out, huh?

38
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,759
[chuckles] Wait a minute.

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,221
They told me they were sending
a military escort,

40
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,389
and you're the only one here in uniform.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,601
Um...

42
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,854
I'm... I'm supposed to meet a Dr. Miura.

43
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,105
I'm Keiko Miura.

44
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,234
- You're... Keiko, nice to meet you.
- [chuckles] Nice to meet you.

45
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,318
You must be his daughter?

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,446
Or...

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,950
I'm sorry. I think there's
a little miscommunication happening here.

48
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,826
- Um, let's start over.
- Yes, why don't we?

49
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,203
- Okay.
- You are...

50
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,665
I am Lieutenant Leland Lafayette Shaw III,
but you can call me Lee.

51
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,503
I'm Keiko Miura,
and you may call me Dr. Miura.

52
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,140
[Lee] You know, these things
aren't supposed to go that fast.

53
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,309
[engine revs]

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,812
Would you like me to drive?

55
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,896
Why?

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,148
Am I making you nervous?

57
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,860
Nope. But, uh,

58
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,280
I've been assigned to you
as your military escort.

59
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,908
This is an army jeep
and I'm, you know, the army.

60
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,077
I've been driving up and down these roads
for weeks.

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,161
I know the way.

62
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,246
[engine revs]

63
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,790
[Lee] Okay then.

64
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,293
I'm starting to get the feeling
you don't really want me around here.

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,422
Aren't you even curious why you're here?

66
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,506
Very much so.

67
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,303
[sighs] A WB-29
on a routine weather mission

68
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,306
scooped up some airborne radioisotopes
over the Philippine Sea.

69
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,102
That's... That's pretty far south
for a Russian bomb test. They don't...

70
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,062
That's because it's not the Russians.

71
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,193
Well, it's not us. So, who is it?

72
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,570
Well, they were the wrong isotopes
for bomb fallout.

73
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,616
And meteorological data
shows they likely originated here.

74
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,700
The Philippines?

75
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,535
That's gotta be a mistake.

76
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,996
That's what I'm here to find out.

77
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,457
Okay.

78
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,002
We should get to work. Hit the gas, Doc.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,865
[alarm ringing]

80
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,037
[alarm stops]

81
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,750
[exhales sharply]

82
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,378
[sighs]

83
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,012
[sighs]

84
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,378
[screams]

85
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,464
[screams]

86
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,133
[grunts]

87
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,392
[grunts]

88
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,977
Every day the reading diminishes.

89
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,105
Soon it'll be entirely gone,
and the trail will be lost.

90
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,107
[Lee] Uh-huh. Got that. Double-time.

91
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,984
- [sighs]
- Your English is very good.

92
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,947
It came in handy when I did
my postgraduate work at Berkeley.

93
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,576
It's impressive.

94
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,996
But, uh, doesn't that make you
a little overqualified

95
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,163
for this snipe hunt?

96
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,665
[Keiko chuckles] This what?

97
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,292
Wild-goose chase.

98
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,297
Come on, Doc. Don't you think
if those readings were legit,

99
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,507
Washington would've sent
half the eggheads at Los Alamos

100
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,425
to check it out?

101
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,595
Not a woman.
Certainly not a Japanese woman.

102
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,013
Oh, you got that right. Yeah.

103
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,435
You want me to lie
and pretend that's not the way things are?

104
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,519
Mm-mmm.

105
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,814
You're telling me
you didn't take one look at me

106
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:09,151
and make a snap judgment
about who I am the second we met? Huh?

107
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,741
It's not the same,
Leland Lafayette Shaw III.

108
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,744
[sighs] Suppose it's not.

109
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,625
Hmm.

110
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,835
[grunts]

111
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,673
[branch snaps]

112
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,973
[rustling]

113
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,726
Do you hear that?

114
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,065
[branches snapping]

115
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,026
Lieutenant?

116
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,408
- [branches snap]
- [footsteps approaching]

117
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,826
Lieutenant? [sighs]

118
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,708
[person breathes heavily]

119
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,837
Oh.

120
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,632
Hey.

121
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,593
Hey.

122
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,678
[Lee] Don't move.

123
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,846
- Whoa.
- [Keiko] Lieutenant.

124
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,347
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Don't shoot.

125
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,516
I'm American. Navy vet.

126
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,561
And what are you doing here,
American Navy vet, huh? You filming us?

127
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,146
Why? You guys doing something film worthy?

128
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,440
- I asked you a question.
- I'm just asking a question back.

129
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,692
Well, I got the gun, swab,

130
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,193
so who are you
and what are you doing here?

131
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,195
- Lieutenant.
- My name's William Randa.

132
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,741
Okay, Lieutenant Shaw?

133
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,368
Mm-hmm.

134
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,414
Look, I promise I won't shoot you
if you don't shoot me.

135
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,082
Deal?

136
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,425
All right.

137
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,509
All right?

138
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,762
Still haven't answered my question.
What are you doing here?

139
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:01,680
[scoffs]

140
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:07,186
Well, you could say
I'm on a hunting expedition.

141
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,021
I'm a cryptozoologist.

142
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,983
- You're a cryptozoo... Uh, what?
- He studies animals that don't exist.

143
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,568
Yeah.

144
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,739
Atmospheric sampler? Spectrometer?

145
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,158
- Hey, is this a radiation monitor here?
- Hey, hey, hey.

146
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,576
- [Lee] Easy.
- [Keiko] Don't touch that.

147
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,411
Sorry. I just...
I've never seen one before.

148
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,414
[chuckles] Just wanted to check it out.

149
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,709
'Cause, uh, it seems like maybe
we're out here hunting for the same thing.

150
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,879
And wh-what's that, Mr. Randa?

151
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,381
The truth.

152
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,253
[cell phone rings]

153
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,675
[Caroline, on phone]
Catey, where have you been?

154
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,676
I'm sorry. I, uh...

155
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,261
[Caroline]
I've been calling and calling you.

156
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,054
Mom, I'm fine. I'm coming home.

157
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,807
[Caroline] Already? What did you find out?

158
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,517
It doesn't have anything to do with us.

159
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,769
[Caroline] What does that mean?
What does it have to do...

160
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,646
What did it always have to do with, Mom?
Him.

161
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,231
- [Caroline] Catey.
- [sighs]

162
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,233
- We'll talk when I get home, okay?
- Don't do this.

163
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,734
- Love you. Bye.
- Catey, do not...

164
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,617
American?

165
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,745
Excuse me?

166
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,664
Sorry, I... I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I just...

167
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,165
I... I overheard your accent.

168
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,545
Sometimes this place can make you feel
like you're stranded on another planet.

169
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,629
Glad I could help.

170
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,306
- Where are you heading?
- Look, I don't mean to be rude,

171
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,309
but I've made all the new friends
I can handle for one day, thanks.

172
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,186
Yeah. Nah, nah. Hey, I totally get it.

173
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,481
This young woman abroad
runs into a strange man

174
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,566
at the train station.

175
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,445
And next thing you know,
you're buried alive in a coffin somewhere.

176
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,824
I can't imagine that that helped.

177
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,620
Hey. Wait, wait, wait. Look, look, look.
Hey, I'm harmless.

178
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,872
My name's Tim. [chuckles]

179
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,499
They don't come much more harmless
than the "Tim" variety.

180
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,584
Have a nice night, Tim.

181
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,629
I need to talk to you about the files.

182
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,715
I don't...

183
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,426
What files?

184
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,178
I work for Monarch.

185
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,098
You're not in trouble.

186
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,392
Not yet.

187
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,645
Those files belong to us,

188
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,106
and they are more important
than you could possibly imagine.

189
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,111
I need to make a call.

190
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,241
Okay. Let's make a call.

191
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,426
All right. All right.

192
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,512
Make your call.

193
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:31,265
Speaker, please.

194
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,142
Sure. [sighs]

195
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,227
[line rings]

196
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,145
- [Caroline, on phone] Cate? Hello? Cate?
- [grunts]

197
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,730
[groans]

198
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:39,815
[panting]

199
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,987
[grunting] No.

200
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,321
No. [grunting]

201
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,494
[breathes heavily]
I said you weren't in trouble.

202
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,788
- "Yet". You said "yet."
- [Tim pants]

203
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,799
Look, I swear we're not gonna hurt you.

204
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:06,967
[Cate] No, you can't do this.

205
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,428
- I can't let you see where we're going.
- [Cate] No! You don't understand.

206
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,263
I can't breathe. [panting] I can't...

207
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,766
[hyperventilating] I can't...

208
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,811
[Tim] Relax. You're gonna be fine.
Just breathe, okay?

209
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,856
- [Cate] Let me out. Let me out!
- Calm down. Relax.

210
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,650
- [Cate] Let me out! Let me out!
- [Tim] Relax. Calm down.

211
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,528
Hey! [grunts]

212
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,489
Get her under control, man.

213
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:30,532
Let me out!

214
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,076
[yelps]

215
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,955
[Cate yelping]

216
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,589
[Cate coughing, panting, groaning]

217
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,313
[Tim grunts]

218
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,031
[driver breathes heavily]

219
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,246
[breathing heavily]

220
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,330
[panting]

221
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,715
What?

222
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,843
[in Japanese]
Why aren't you answering my texts?

223
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,554
[in English] When's the last time
I answered one of your texts?

224
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,139
[in Japanese] I don't know... I thought...

225
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,224
[in English] You thought?

226
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,476
You thought that
because of your crazy family drama

227
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,354
that what happened between us
is ancient history?

228
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,024
What do you want from me?

229
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,364
[in Japanese]
I found this in my father's office.

230
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,576
[in English] I do audio, not home movies.

231
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,080
I told you I was sorry.

232
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,291
Apology accepted.

233
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,126
I'm sorry too.

234
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,255
I... I grabbed onto you
to keep my head above water,

235
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,882
and you didn't wanna drown. I get it.

236
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,054
You should go home now.

237
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,931
[stammers] Wait, wait, wait.

238
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,517
[stutters] I want
those old computer files we found.

239
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,685
Why?

240
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,813
[stammers] Because they're mine.
What difference does it make to you?

241
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,064
I'm busy.

242
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,983
Come back tomorrow.

243
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,114
[sighs]

244
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,522
[Cate, in Japanese] She sounded French.

245
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,067
[officer] You said they were American.

246
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,151
[Cate] The man was.

247
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,196
[officer] Tim?

248
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,866
Do you have some identification?

249
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,414
I lost my bag when I ran away.

250
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,625
My passport...

251
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,710
...my phone, all my money.

252
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,548
And you're sure this wasn't some kind of...

253
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,716
...misunderstanding?

254
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,261
What?

255
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,640
Tourists come here to enjoy
what Tokyo has to offer.

256
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,227
The nightlife. Some karaoke.

257
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,728
But...

258
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,397
...it's easy to overindulge.

259
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,441
You think I'm drunk?

260
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,279
I was almost kidnapped!

261
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,912
If you feel you are in danger...

262
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,208
...I would recommend you contact the
American Embassy.

263
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,003
Wait here.

264
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,005
I will get you the address.

265
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,487
[breathing heavily]

266
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:42,993
I'm home.

267
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,244
[parent] Welcome back.

268
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,963
Have you had dinner?

269
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,673
I'm not hungry.

270
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:57,591
[chuckles] You haven't?

271
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,092
I was going to warm up the curry.

272
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:01,386
What's this?

273
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,098
[parent] His life was not easy, you know.

274
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,769
He lost so much when he was young.

275
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,690
You're defending him?

276
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,526
Aren't you angry?

277
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,780
You're angry, Kentaro.

278
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,200
Do you feel better?

279
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,963
What are you doing?

280
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,257
Now I'm angry too.

281
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,885
Join me, Kentaro.

282
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,971
[exclaims]

283
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:45,514
[laughs]

284
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,557
Seriously?!

285
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,725
Throw it! [breathes heavily]

286
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,686
- [chuckles]
- [exclaims]

287
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,603
More.

288
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,729
Here.

289
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,940
[exclaims, chuckles]

290
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,278
[breathes heavily, exclaims]

291
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,113
[breathing heavily]

292
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,282
Now we both feel better, right?

293
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,827
[chuckles] A little.

294
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:08,829
[chuckles]

295
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,374
I'll warm up the curry.

296
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:20,716
[sighs]

297
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,608
[Billy, in English] So, you guys are
following the radiation, aren't you?

298
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,734
And how do you know about that?

299
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,986
Well, I know you're not gonna find
what's out there

300
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,446
following a Geiger counter.

301
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,364
[Keiko] What should we be following,
Mr. Randa?

302
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,866
Just Billy.

303
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,328
I think you should be following
the stories. Folklore. Legends.

304
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:52,748
You know, the people of these mountains,
they have an oral tradition

305
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,335
about a dragon that carves a path of fire
across the sky.

306
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,669
Hmm.

307
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,422
Or maybe a path of ionizing radiation.

308
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:05,344
So, you're hunting dragons.

309
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,931
[sighs] I told you,
I'm looking for the truth.

310
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,933
That's great. But we got work to do,

311
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,684
so it's time for you to hit the trail,
bud.

312
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,186
Wait a minute, Lieutenant.

313
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,730
I don't think it's such a bad idea
for Mr. Randa to join us.

314
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,982
I think it's a terrible idea.

315
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,527
[chuckles] You're not here
to think for me, Lieutenant.

316
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,987
- [inhales deeply]
- Look at him. Smell him.

317
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,614
He's probably been lost out here
for weeks.

318
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,241
Hey, hey. I know exactly where I am, pal.

319
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,617
- Do you?
- Yes.

320
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,995
No. Look, I am here at the behest
of the US Army, and my orders are...

321
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,414
Your orders are to provide me
with whatever assistance I require.

322
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,126
M... My orders are to provide you
with operational security,

323
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,172
and I cannot do that with our new friend,
Billy the jungle hermit, hanging around.

324
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,340
[chuckles] Wow.

325
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,009
[sighs]

326
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,263
Fine. Just go then.

327
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,348
[scoffs] Don't tempt me, Doc.

328
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,226
[scoffs] I didn't ask for you.

329
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,020
I don't need you and I don't want you.

330
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,899
So, you are relieved of
any responsibility for me.

331
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,944
Dismissed.

332
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,782
I'll send someone back with the jeep.

333
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,288
[engine starts]

334
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,212
Shall we go?

335
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,645
[Keiko] So, have you ever seen a dragon?

336
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,105
- [Billy] Once.
- [Keiko] Oh.

337
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,983
[Billy] Well, maybe.
It's kind of why I started doing this.

338
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,735
Trying to prove I'm not crazy.

339
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,111
You think I'm crazy?

340
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,237
I don't even know you.

341
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,655
[sighs] That's true.

342
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,408
Do you often
follow strange men into the jungle?

343
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,369
Uh, this is my second time today.

344
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:57,039
- [chuckles, sighs]
- [chuckles]

345
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,373
We call 'em MUTO's.

346
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,461
For Massive Unidentified
Terrestrial Organisms.

347
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,962
- I came up with that.
- Huh.

348
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:07,633
Terrestrial.
So, you don't think they're space aliens?

349
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,176
You do think I'm crazy.

350
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,677
[sighs] I'm a scientist.

351
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,888
I believe what
the evidence tells me to be true.

352
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,097
- [breathes heavily]
- Okay.

353
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,101
Everyone around here tells
some version of the same story.

354
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,770
- Okay.
- Lights in the sky.

355
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,358
And whatever's making them
has been tracing the same path

356
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,986
over and over and over again,
going back centuries.

357
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,989
- Like comets.
- No. More like migrating birds.

358
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:32,908
Hold on.

359
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,662
I have to show you something.
[breathes heavily]

360
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,664
These... [inhales sharply]
...are the tracks [exhales sharply]

361
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,375
of the radiation readings
from our surveillance aircraft.

362
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,836
[Keiko breathes heavily]

363
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,881
See this?

364
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:49,716
[breathing heavily]

365
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,890
- [Billy scoffs]
- [Keiko] Incredible.

366
00:25:58,642 --> 00:25:59,643
[exhales sharply]

367
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,770
- This way. This way. Come on.
- Okay.

368
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,605
[Keiko] Where are we going?

369
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,190
[Billy] We're following the map.

370
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,035
[breathing heavily]

371
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,079
We're almost there.

372
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,290
[Keiko] Almost where?

373
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,294
[sighs] What is it?

374
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,426
What is that?

375
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:38,974
The Lawton.

376
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,124
[breathing shakily]

377
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,797
[breathing shakily]

378
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,183
[Tim] I don't know.

379
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,184
[gasps]

380
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,852
You wanna take a look
and see what's on these.

381
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,687
I have no idea if they're any good but...

382
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,397
[gasps]

383
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,484
[shushes]

384
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,488
[Duvall] You do it.

385
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:50,879
[speaks Japanese]

386
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:55,175
[in Japanese] Hiroshi was eighteen
when his father died in Vietnam.

387
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,349
His Uncle Lee was
the only family he had left.

388
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,270
If they were so close,
why didn't Dad ever mention him?

389
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,188
[sighs]

390
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,023
I think something happened between them.

391
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,526
He didn't like to talk about

392
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,821
some parts of his life.

393
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,324
Is he still alive?

394
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:20,826
[sighs]

395
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:21,994
Oh, I don't know.

396
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,455
This would have been a long time ago.

397
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,249
[phone chimes]

398
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,293
Sorry.

399
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,252
Mmm.

400
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,713
"CALL ME! IT'S IMPORTANT!"

401
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,592
[doorbell rings]

402
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,801
I'll get it.

403
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:38,844
Thank you.

404
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,137
[sighs]

405
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,145
Good Evening.

406
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,189
Do you speak English?

407
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,607
[in English, stammers] Yes.

408
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,901
Ah. That's... That's great, actually.

409
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:57,070
That makes this much easier...
[inhales sharply] ...for me anyway.

410
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,155
May we come in?

411
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,033
- No. Who are you?
- It's official business.

412
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,827
[stammers] We're with
a special government task force.

413
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,746
- Which government?
- [inhales sharply] You know what?

414
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,457
We'll be in and out
before you even know it.

415
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,585
Wow. You have a lovely home.
[speaks Japanese]

416
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,045
[in Japanese] Who are they?

417
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,131
[in English, stammers] What do you want?

418
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,051
I want Bill Randa's files.

419
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,344
No, you need to leave.

420
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,763
No, you need to hand over those files.

421
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,849
Otherwise, you, your friends,

422
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,185
and your mother
are gonna be in a lot of trouble.

423
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,436
[parent] Kentaro...?

424
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,354
[in Japanese] It's okay.

425
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,607
There's something that your son stole.

426
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,152
He's going to have to come with us.

427
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,987
[stutters]

428
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:39,947
Is it true?

429
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,074
Did you take something of theirs?

430
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,534
They say I stole some files.

431
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:44,743
Enough.

432
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,370
Let's have it.

433
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,084
If he returns whatever he took,
will you leave him alone?

434
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,627
Of course.

435
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,587
[exhales sharply]

436
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,923
[inhales sharply, speaks Japanese]

437
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,342
If you have what they are looking for...

438
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,469
...you should give it to them.

439
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,179
Are you sure?

440
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:05,514
[sighs]

441
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,560
It must be very important.

442
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,233
[in English] I'll get it.

443
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:20,445
Amazing. [stammers] Thank you.
[clears throat]

444
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,031
Tea? You like tea?

445
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,117
Tea?

446
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,785
[Tim] Uh, no. We're good. Thanks.

447
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,204
[in Japanese] I hope my son hasn't caused
any trouble for you.

448
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,331
He's a good man now,

449
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,959
but when he was younger
there were so many problems!

450
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,545
- So much drinking!
- [in English] Hurry up!

451
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,131
[in Japanese]
I wanted him to find a nice girl.

452
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,633
Someone to settle him down.

453
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,219
You are very attractive.

454
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,554
Are you single?

455
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,310
- [in English] Oh, shit.
- [door slams]

456
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,645
- Shit.
- Kentaro!

457
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,606
- [banging on door]
- [Tim] Open up!

458
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,357
[in Japanese] Kentaro, run!

459
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,733
[phone chimes]

460
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,824
[Keiko] You know this ship?

461
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,243
[Billy] USS Lawton.

462
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,455
Went down 200 miles west of Pearl in 1943.

463
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,457
Pearl Harbor?

464
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,627
That's 5,000 miles from here.

465
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,711
Exactly.

466
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,506
[Billy exhales deeply]

467
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,347
[ship creaks]

468
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,564
[Keiko] Is this safe?

469
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,742
Mr. Randa.

470
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,746
You said you study myths, stories.

471
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,624
I'm interested in why
people tell the stories they tell.

472
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,047
[Billy] What inspired the storyteller.

473
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:48,468
- [ship creaks, rumbles]
- [gasps, breathing shakily]

474
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:52,806
What terrified 'em.

475
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,766
[breathing shakily]

476
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,367
[Keiko] What is it?

477
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,539
Mr. Randa.
Maybe we should stick together...

478
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,421
[grunts]

479
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:27,841
[sighs]

480
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,931
[Keiko] Mr. Randa.

481
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,768
Billy.

482
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,063
[sighs]

483
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,112
You were on this ship.

484
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,825
Yeah.

485
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,956
Is this what you were looking for?

486
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,124
Did you know it was here?

487
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,088
Did I know?

488
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,135
Let's say hoped.

489
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,223
Not very scientific.

490
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,645
[sighs] I know we hit something
in the water that night.

491
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,981
We figured it was a Japanese sub.

492
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:29,110
[sighs] The whole ship went down
in less than three minutes.

493
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:31,864
Who else survived?

494
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,452
Only me.

495
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:56,388
[Geiger counter whirring]

496
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,768
[in Japanese] Going to the back.

497
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:43,852
Okay.

498
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,912
[in English] Who are you? Jason Bourne?

499
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,624
You're from San Francisco.
You were there that day.

500
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,417
You don't have a bag packed,

501
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,753
ready to head for higher ground
when the tide starts rising?

502
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,881
Yeah. It's full of bottled water
and batteries, not extra passports.

503
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,262
- May.
- Hey, are you okay?

504
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,597
What is she doing here?

505
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,474
Hey. Whoa. She's in this too.

506
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:25,936
Somebody's after those files.

507
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,521
Why don't we just give 'em what they want?

508
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,731
[scoffs]
Maybe then they'll leave all of us alone.

509
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,441
Okay, yeah. Good luck with that.

510
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:32,776
What's your plan? Just run?

511
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,320
Me? I have contacts.
I can get us fake passports.

512
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,865
I don't want a fake passport.
I want my real passport.

513
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,157
I haven't done anything wrong.

514
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,243
Okay. When have people in power
ever cared about...

515
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,327
Hold on.

516
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,414
I know where to go.

517
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,542
Trust me.

518
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,711
Come on.

519
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,679
- [Keiko] What is that?
- [Billy] I don't know.

520
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,100
[Billy sighs] Looks organic.

521
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,750
[Billy gasps, exclaims]

522
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,587
Oh... [groans, pants]

523
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,381
Oh, God.

524
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,763
[Keiko] There are so many.

525
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,977
[inhales shakily]
When did you say this ship sank?

526
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,438
Nine years ago.

527
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,109
I think I've seen everything I need to
in here.

528
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,361
Yeah.

529
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:07,996
[breathes heavily]
That wasn't there before.

530
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,790
- [Billy] This is fresh.
- Fresh what?

531
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,376
We'll find another way outta here.

532
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,002
- How did it get here?
- [grunts]

533
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:15,838
Is there something in here
that's making it...

534
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:17,214
I don't know. Come on.

535
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,111
[in Japanese]
You're here to see the Colonel?

536
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,113
Yes, we are.

537
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,448
[in Japanese, stammers]
If he's still alive.

538
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,701
So, we can see the Colonel?

539
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:08,974
[in English] Colonel Shaw?

540
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:23,447
What's your name?

541
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,741
Kentaro.

542
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:27,284
Kentaro what?

543
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,368
Randa.

544
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:34,583
[inhales deeply] Oh, my God.
[chuckles] You're Hiroshi's boy.

545
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,335
[Lee inhales deeply]

546
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,920
[stammers] And you?

547
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,464
I'm Cate Randa.

548
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,257
Course you are.

549
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:48,430
I, uh... I didn't know
Hiroshi even had a daughter.

550
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,599
[Cate scoffs]
Well, I didn't know he had a son.

551
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,227
Turns out he was good at keeping secrets.

552
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,191
[chuckles] Not my drama. No relation.

553
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,653
- We wanted to ask you about our fa...
- W-Why don't we, um...

554
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,240
Yeah. Come on.

555
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,450
Let's get some air.

556
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:10,577
Come on.

557
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,002
If you guys could just kinda keep
your voices down, that'd be good.

558
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,587
Tell me, how'd you get here?

559
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,422
Rented a minivan.

560
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:25,801
That's good.
But I mean, how did you find me?

561
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:27,636
My mom.

562
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,221
- Emiko.
- Yes.

563
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:31,723
[chuckles]

564
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,561
We found something in my father's safe.

565
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,271
- Kentaro.
- What? He's my great uncle Lee.

566
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,314
What did you find in the safe?

567
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,691
Old computer files.

568
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:43,193
Bunch of crazy shit. Monster shit.

569
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:47,364
[shushes] Can you please,
please keep your voices down?

570
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,910
What's this all about? Why are you here?
And you gotta make it kinda quick.

571
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,079
We wanna find out
what happened to my father.

572
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,206
[stammers] You tell me.

573
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,377
Right after G-Day,
he said he had someplace he needed to go.

574
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,545
Wouldn't tell us where,

575
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,463
but a week later
we were told the plane he was on

576
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,299
disappeared somewhere in Alaska.

577
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,843
[scoffs] Turns out he had
a whole secret life in Japan.

578
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,470
I came here to try and figure it out,

579
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,973
but now we're being chased by
these Monarch people and, uh...

580
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,934
"Disappeared"? As in, no body?

581
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,519
No death certificate?

582
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,522
- What are you saying?
- Hey.

583
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,567
Hey, w-what is this place? Huh?

584
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,780
Oh, this place is what Monarch
euphemistically refers to

585
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,824
as "secure asset management."

586
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,535
Right. So, you're imprisoned here.

587
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,370
Okay. Well, we're leaving. Mmm.

588
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,873
Yeah, you can try,
but they're just gonna keep following you

589
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:41,460
and following you and following you,
until they finally get what they want.

590
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,961
Or?

591
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,338
Well, that's up to you.

592
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,341
Now, you can choke down
that mountain of Monarch bullshit

593
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,843
about your father disappearing
without a trace.

594
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:56,558
Or... [sighs] ...we can
get the hell outta here right now

595
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,894
and find out what really happened
with your dad.

596
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:00,312
[grunts]

597
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,692
Now you got just about 60 seconds
to make up your minds.

598
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,115
What's it gonna be?

599
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:20,666
Here, this way.

600
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,000
[Keiko] Are you sure?

601
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:25,337
I did two tours in this tin can, Doc.
[breathes deeply]

602
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,463
[exhales sharply]

603
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:27,840
[growling]

604
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,383
[gasps] What is that?

605
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:36,306
- Let's keep it moving. Come on.
- [Keiko] Okay.

606
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,060
- [growling]
- [Billy] Whoa!

607
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,144
[Keiko] Are you all right?

608
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,896
[Billy] Oh, Jesus Christ.

609
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,940
- Go back! Go!
- [pants] Oh, my God.

610
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,359
[panting]

611
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:49,653
[grunts, screams] Oh, my God!

612
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:50,946
No.

613
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,031
- [groans]
- Hang on!

614
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:56,410
[grunts, screaming]

615
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,328
[Keiko] It's leaving! Now's our chance!

616
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,831
[groaning]

617
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:02,291
- Push!
- I am pushing!

618
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,459
- [Keiko] Come on!
- [Billy yells, grunts]

619
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,628
Where'd it go? [groans]

620
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:10,174
- [Billy] Help!
- [groans]

621
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,258
[Billy] Hurry!

622
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:12,968
What the hell is going on?

623
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,387
- [Keiko] Help! Help!
- [Billy] Come on!

624
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,056
- Watch out!
- Holy shit!

625
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,808
[grunts, pants]

626
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:23,061
Oh! Oh, my God!

627
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:24,938
Oh, my God!

628
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,106
Help me get him out!

629
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,483
- [panting]
- Come on! Before it comes back!

630
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,027
Okay. [grunts]

631
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,195
Here we go.

632
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:32,487
One, two, three.

633
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,239
[straining]

634
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,200
[grunts] It's too heavy.

635
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,492
[groaning]

636
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,078
I'm gonna stick this under,
and we're all gonna lift, okay?

637
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:41,079
- Okay.
- [Billy grunts]

638
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:42,956
One, two, three.

639
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,461
Go! [grunts] Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up! Billy! Hey, get up!

640
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:48,837
[panting, groaning]

641
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,215
- [Lee] Go! Go, go, go!

642
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,387

Oh, my God.

654
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,338
[pants] It is a dragon.

655
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,550
