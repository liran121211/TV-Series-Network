1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,094
- [Billy chuckles]
- [Keiko] Stop.

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,472
You're just mad because he takes after me.

3
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,474
Of course I am. It's not fair.

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,351
Oh, look, he's obviously got your brains.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,894
Yeah, obviously.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:23,189
And he'll be blessed with my
gravity-defying breaking curveball.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,858
Oh, my God.

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,985
- Not the curveball again.
- Yes, the curveball.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,115
I mean, look, your brains, my arm.
It's the best of both worlds.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,243
- Kid's gonna be a god.
- [chuckles]

11
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,287
[breathes heavily]

12
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:39,957
I just miss him.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,834
This is hard.

14
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,919
Yeah, I know.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,004
I miss him too.

16
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,300
Do you think we'll be home
before Hiroshi's birthday?

17
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,636
Lee?

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,597
Lee?

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,186
[Duvall] Colonel.

20
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,647
Colonel?

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,482
Yeah, what?

22
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,484
Point of no return.

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,155
We having second thoughts?

24
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,368
Not at all. But what I'm saying is,
there are other targets.

25
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,035
True.

26
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,328
More easily accessible.

27
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,413
No, Michelle.

28
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,874
This is the target today.

29
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,918
This is the one.

30
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,840
There's gonna be a turn up here,
a little bit ahead.

31
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,538
[sighs] I have to confess.

32
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,416
This is more than I could have imagined.

33
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,459
Thank you. [chuckles]

34
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,087
We've recently had
some very promising results

35
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,006
with our gamma ray simulation techniques.

36
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,175
It would appear so.

37
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,136
My hat's off to you, Captain.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,637
We aim to please.

39
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:43,181
You've managed to take
a pile of blurry photos,

40
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,393
campfire stories, unreliable witnesses
and so much scientific gibberish

41
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,478
- it might as well be Chinese algebra...
- Hey, hold on...

42
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,272
...and used it to siphon off resources

43
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,399
that ought to be used
to safeguard this great nation.

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,401
We are trying to safeguard the world.

45
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,113
We don't wear these uniforms
to protect the world.

46
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,324
So you think that Godzilla
respects national boundaries?

47
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,577
Our nuclear superiority proved
more than a match for Godzilla

48
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,830
and I'm confident it will again,
should the need arise.

49
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,208
Which, in the two years
since Castle Bravo,

50
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,087
you have provided not a shred of
evidence to suggest that possibility.

51
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,549
I have one question.

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,635
[exhales sharply]

53
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,554
Where are all these monsters?

54
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,811
You have shoveled Uncle Sam's money into
a self-perpetuating bureaucratic sinkhole

55
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,399
while ignoring the clear
and present threat to this country:

56
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,528
infiltration and subversion
by hostile foreign agents.

57
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,530
That's not exactly our department.

58
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,324
[Hatch] Well, maybe it should be.

59
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:47,370
I see one of your breakthroughs
is based on technology developed

60
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,791
by a former officer
in the Imperial Japanese Navy.

61
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,044
- "Former."
- And how Doctor Miura here ever qualified

62
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,754
for top secret clearance is beyond me.

63
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,256
Hey, you're out of line, Hatch.

64
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,593
Especially given the juicy tidbits
the FBI turned up in her background check.

65
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,845
You son of a bitch. [groans]

66
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,055
[grunting]

67
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,018
Welcome to Monarch.

68
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,480
[stammers]

69
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,899
[sighs]

70
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,442
Sorry. [chuckles]

71
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,237
This is what our grandparents built?

72
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,990
- [chuckles]
- Ah... [sighs] ...well, yeah.

73
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,617
They keep saying we're
gonna move into a bigger space but,

74
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,286
uh, I'll believe it when I see it.

75
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,371
Come on, we're late.

76
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,164
I don't see any Randas up here.

77
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,417
I thought we were Monarch royalty.

78
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,338
[Tim] Uh, well, your family has
kind of a complicated legacy here.

79
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,384
After your grandmother died,
your grandfather became obsessed.

80
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:47,930
Started pushing all these theories
about teleportation and wormholes.

81
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,058
Real tinfoil hat type of stuff.

82
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,271
Is that why we're here,
to get fitted for our tinfoil hats?

83
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,065
Let your freak flag fly, bro.

84
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,448
[May] Oh.

85
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,742
This is your legacy.

86
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,827
This is more like it.

87
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,706
[Tim] Monarch
has outposts all over the world.

88
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:18,211
Right now, they are picking up gamma ray
bursts just like we saw before G-Day.

89
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,421
Alaska, North Africa,

90
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,591
places we know your father has been.

91
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,844
So what? Is he causing it?
Is that what you're saying?

92
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,970
No, I'm not.

93
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,307
But these are all points on
the map that you saw in his office.

94
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,977
Is he predicting them
or is he following them?

95
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,562
Good questions.

96
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,856
We do questions really well around here.

97
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,818
But what we need right now
are some answers.

98
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,363
Shaw and his people
just detonated a large explosion

99
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,616
near the site we picked you up at
in Alaska.

100
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,910
The gamma ray emissions coming
from that area dropped to zero.

101
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,870
Well, that sounds good.

102
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,955
But then immediately
increased at a dozen other sites.

103
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,289
That sounds bad.

104
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,002
Right now, they're hovering
at levels just below what we saw on G-Day.

105
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,130
We don't know exactly what
Shaw is trying to accomplish here.

106
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,883
But if he sets off another blast,
it could push it over the line.

107
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,553
So that means another G-Day?

108
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,848
I'd rather not find out.
That's why you're here.

109
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,101
What can we do?

110
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,270
[Tim] We know that Colonel Shaw
wanted your father's map

111
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,731
because he's following
some pattern that Hiroshi laid out.

112
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,441
We need to know where
Shaw's heading to next

113
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,278
so we can stop him before it's too late.

114
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,697
Sorry. He dumped us in the desert,

115
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,742
stole the map
and took off with your partner.

116
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,036
I'm not sure how much we can help.

117
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,456
You saw Hiroshi's map.

118
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,708
It led you to Africa.

119
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,668
It led you to Godzilla.

120
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,670
Tim seems to think that your bloodline

121
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,089
gives you some unique insight
into this situation.

122
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,009
Like, I don't see how,
but I am running out of options.

123
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,470
So I need you to think about your father,

124
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:55,976
about this map that he made
and about where it's leading Shaw.

125
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,990
Well, I love what
they've done to the place.

126
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,325
[sighs]

127
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,119
They don't want anyone getting in.

128
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:20,250
No, I think this is their feeble attempt
to prevent anything from getting out.

129
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,631
What exactly do you think
we'll find in there?

130
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:28,926
[sighs]

131
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,011
- Reach! Kei!
- [screams]

132
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,350
It won't be for the faint of heart.
I can tell you that.

133
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,316
I founded this place

134
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,778
and that fascist tin-pot thinks
he can bury me in the basement.

135
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,112
Well, it was everything I could do

136
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,198
to keep you from getting thrown out
onto the street. So...

137
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,033
And I can't believe
that crap he said about you.

138
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,117
Juicy tidbits?

139
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,579
What a load of racist horseshit. [groans]

140
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,790
- [chuckles]
- [groans]

141
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,751
- [chuckles] How's your hand feel?
- [Billy] Not great.

142
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,294
Well... [scoffs] ...you did me a favor.

143
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,381
If I'd gone at him like that,
I'd be in the stockade right now.

144
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,466
You're welcome.

145
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,427
He's gonna write a report that makes us
look like con artists.

146
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,304
Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,016
You know General Puckett.
Can't you do something?

148
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,393
Well, he wants to know
where the monsters are.

149
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,395
So the obvious solution
is to find him one.

150
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,939
Easier said than done.

151
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,441
- Godzilla saved our asses last time...
- No.

152
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,778
If we tell them that the biggest H-bomb
we've ever tested didn't kill it...

153
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,532
- They'll build a bigger one.
- Which they're gonna do anyway, Kei.

154
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,327
Didn't you hear Hatch? I mean,
the Reds are the problem now.

155
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,372
- We made a pact.
- [sighs]

156
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,957
We only share what they need to know.

157
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,543
You don't think this qualifies?

158
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,674
[sighs]

159
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,804
[breathes heavily]

160
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,522
[sighs]

161
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,193
I need you guys to start making a map.

162
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,236
A map?

163
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,614
He wants to know where the Titans are
hiding, let's draw him a goddamn map.

164
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,950
[inhales sharply]
Build me a case for Monarch.

165
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,953
All those field notes and the journals
and the diaries that you've been keeping.

166
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,206
You know, everything that
you've scribbled down

167
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,249
since the Lawton sank out
from underneath you.

168
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,044
What we know about the Titans.
Where they... Where they sleep.

169
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,504
What they eat. Spawn. Mate.

170
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,713
The whole shooting match.

171
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,757
Right.
Uh, we don't actually know any of that.

172
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,676
[scoffs] How can I convince Puckett
this place should exist

173
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,221
if we don't know why it should?

174
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,891
You have three days
before the budgetary meeting.

175
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,228
You have three days.

176
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,815
Take your life's work
and string something together.

177
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,361
[sighs] Whew.

178
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,363
Going a little stir-crazy in here or...

179
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,574
I inherited that from
someone with a temper.

180
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:02,829
I keep filling out a maintenance request.
But welcome to government work.

181
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,624
[sighs]

182
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,000
What is the point of this?

183
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,587
Travel vouchers,
requisition for office supplies...

184
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,381
Uh, here's an invoice for an exterminator.

185
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,132
Did you ever throw anything away?

186
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,176
[Tim] No. And thank God I didn't.

187
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,556
There is a connection here.

188
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,518
A direct line from the foundation
that your grandparents laid

189
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,605
through your father's map straight to
the readings that we're getting now.

190
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,776
Ju... Just... [sighs]
We just got to find it.

191
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,778
"July 7th, 2008."

192
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,114
Does that mean anything?

193
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,492
It was my 18th birthday.

194
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,870
And my dad was here
doing the software update

195
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,874
on the Geosynchronous
Titan Anomaly Sensing System.

196
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:52,838
G-TASS. Yeah, that was tough.
That was a busy day.

197
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,845
[clears throat, stammers]

198
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,598
I'm sorry that Hiroshi
was not Dad of the Year,

199
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,183
but this is not the time for that.

200
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,686
Verdugo and her team,
they are up there collecting data

201
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,647
and crunching numbers
with every source that we have.

202
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,109
But Shaw...
[breathes heavily] ...he's old school.

203
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,403
- The oldest of schools.
- [Tim] Exactly.

204
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,531
He would not let this go.
This was his mission.

205
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,949
It was... [stammers] It was his life.

206
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,662
We're not gonna find him with
some multi-spectrum satellite sweep.

207
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,747
Wait.

208
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,625
- [sighs]
- Did you find something?

209
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,506
"Operative lost during field assignment
in performance of duties.

210
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,257
Missing presumed killed.

211
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,219
Randa, Keiko."

212
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,055
[sighs]

213
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,268
So Monarch cost us our father
and both our grandparents.

214
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,356
[Tim] Huh.

215
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:01,448
"I request her death benefits be issued
to her surviving spouse, Randa, William.

216
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:07,162
Signed, Leland L. Shaw,
Major, United States Army."

217
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,249
Where did she die?

218
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,008
Kazakhstan.

219
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,552
It was on Hiroshi's map.

220
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:26,055
[stammers] It is one of the places we're
seeing a spike in gamma ray emissions.

221
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,559
- Yes, one of.
- It's where he lost her.

222
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,602
Does Shaw seem like
the sentimental type to you?

223
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,770
Yes, he does.

224
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,358
I mean, when we were in the desert,
the way he talked about our grandmother,

225
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,444
I thought he was gonna tell me
he was our grandfather.

226
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,197
Shaw is trying to rewrite the past.

227
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,824
To do that, he needs to go back to

228
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,785
the place where
everything went to hell for him.

229
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,038
We're not allowed to
operate inside those borders.

230
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,835
- [sighs]
- It'll have to be a small team.

231
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,629
- We'll go.
- [scoffs] We will?

232
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,550
I am not sending a bunch of
untrained amateurs after Lee Shaw.

233
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,051
You sent a bunch of trained professionals
last time.

234
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,386
How did that work out for you?

235
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,850
Shaw practically begged us to go with him.
He wanted us to finish this together.

236
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,230
I'll go with them.

237
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,443
[sighs]

238
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,530
Sure. Why not?

239
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,450
I always thought Goonies
deserved a sequel.

240
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,084
I didn't mean to volunteer you back there.

241
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,628
You did.

242
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,964
Sorry, but we have to do something.

243
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,551
[sighs] Why do we have to do something?

244
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,221
Our father worked for these people.
He made that map.

245
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,014
And we took it to Shaw.

246
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,349
If it hadn't been for us,

247
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,563
Uncle Lee would still be in his
old folks' home playing boccie with Stan.

248
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,485
- [sighs]
- Look, I get what you mean.

249
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,655
I mean, that was me, right?
Screw Dad. He screwed us.

250
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,740
I understand if you need to leave.

251
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,866
I'm not leaving.

252
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,327
- But I'm not cleaning up his mess.
- [elevator chimes]

253
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,829
I'm not doing this for him.

254
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,749
[May] Should we hold it?

255
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,210
Okay?

256
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,711
Okay.

257
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,255
Coming. [panting]

258
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,558
Hatch almost busted me
but I managed to get all the f...

259
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,518
Oh, good.

260
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,894
Files. What the...

261
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,439
It's not the best work light
but the place needed something.

262
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,567
- It did. I like it.
- Good.

263
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,652
[sighs]

264
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,361
What's this?

265
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,489
So... [grunts] ...I was going through
your field notes

266
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,285
and there's too much unsubstantiated data.

267
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,787
There is second, third,
fourth hand accounts

268
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,249
- with no corroborating evidence.
- You sound like Hatch.

269
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,877
Would you like to lose the other hand?

270
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,711
- No. Okay.
- Mmm.

271
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,297
So, Lee said that we need to draw a map

272
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,091
that clearly charts our mission
for Hatch and Puckett, right?

273
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,676
Yeah, so? That's what I did.

274
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:09,636
No.

275
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:10,970
This is more like a blueprint

276
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,472
of a house that's designed by
a hundred different architects.

277
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,225
- [chuckles]
- Ninety-nine of whom might be insane.

278
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,227
- [scoffs]
- You got stairways going nowhere,

279
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,438
rooms with no doors,
and you end up with a house

280
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,940
that's bigger on the inside,
but on the outside...

281
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,735
[scoffs] And can you please
clean up after yourself?

282
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:26,819
Yeah. [stammers, sighs]

283
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,655
[stammers] How did you manage to
get ants four stories underground?

284
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:35,162
We can't just exclude anything that seems
crazy when the whole damn thing is crazy.

285
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,206
- Hmm.
- Remember...

286
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,709
- Beyond logic lies the truth.
- Lies the truth.

287
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,628
Yes, it's catchy.

288
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,712
- Okay.
- Yeah.

289
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:48,090
But Hatch and Puckett
can't see the possibilities

290
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,550
in the impossible the way you do.

291
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,636
The way we do.

292
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,387
[sighs]

293
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,684
[inhales deeply]

294
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,652
Billy, I'm... [sighs]

295
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,571
Thank you...

296
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,825
for what you did up there, defending me.

297
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,618
- It was stupid.
- [clicks tongue]

298
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,329
- [chuckles]
- But thank you.

299
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,958
[sighs] Look, the nerve of
that guy coming at you like that.

300
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,502
Yeah. But what Hatch said, it wasn't...

301
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,966
The truth is, there are things in my life,

302
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,801
in my past,
that I haven't shared with you.

303
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,972
I... I don't care. I don't care. [sighs]

304
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,183
From the day that I met you,

305
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,312
when you wouldn't leave me
on the wreck of the Lawton, I knew.

306
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,859
[clicks tongue] I knew that I...

307
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,489
I knew I, uh...

308
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,910
That I...

309
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,330
could trust you...

310
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,250
no matter what.

311
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,803
So... [inhales shakily, sighs]

312
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:22,351
So, um, I guess the job here is to
make it simple enough to understand

313
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,313
so that even
a Neanderthal could understand it.

314
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,273
- [chuckles] Yes.
- Right.

315
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:31,944
So we eliminate
what we don't have direct evidence of.

316
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:32,945
- Right.
- Hmm.

317
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,074
So we know that Godzilla was in Bikini

318
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,326
and Hateruma.

319
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,286
- Yeah.
- Confirmed sightings.

320
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:44,165
Right. And then the...
the Lawton dragon is here off Hawaii.

321
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,918
- And here in the Philippines.
- Yeah.

322
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,546
And, uh... [sighs] ...we can
eliminate the Siberian reports.

323
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,382
Excuse me?
I had three independent sources.

324
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,551
Two drunk, one blind.

325
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,844
- [stammers]
- Next.

326
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,181
Okay. Uh, Yucatán.

327
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Blurry photos.

328
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,226
But photos.

329
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,396
Okay. Mark them possible but unconfirmed.

330
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,482
That is...

331
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,608
- This is how it's done.
- ...not okay.

332
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,651
- No.
- It's science.

333
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,985
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,530
- Wow, color coded and everything.
- [Keiko] Mm-hmm.

335
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,907
So we can take it out later if we need to,
you know?

336
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,117
[Billy] Yeah. I don't know. Um...

337
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,579
[Keiko speaking indistinctly]

338
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,585
My team will go in first,
assess the situation.

339
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,880
We'll bring you in
once we feel the area is secure.

340
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:33,966
[May] Body armor?

341
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,175
This isn't gonna work.

342
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,677
This needs to go by the numbers.

343
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,136
We don't know
what we're gonna find in there.

344
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,139
We're gonna find Shaw, okay?

345
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,392
And if the first thing he sees
is your team pointing guns at him,

346
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,144
this isn't gonna turn out the way we want.

347
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,315
You said you weren't the bad guys.

348
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,611
That you're just a bunch of
monster nerds trying to save the world.

349
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,405
I don't think I ever used the words
"monster nerds."

350
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,156
[chuckles] I definitely did.

351
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,449
Shaw escalated this.

352
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,619
Yeah, and he's gonna do it again
if he sees you.

353
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,829
He'll at least talk to us.

354
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,540
What makes you think he'll listen?

355
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,710
[Kentaro] Because he wants us here.

356
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,421
He wants someone
to take over the family business

357
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,716
and he thinks we're
the only family he has left.

358
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,177
He's not gonna shoot us.

359
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,433
Okay, well, I'm not gonna be the only one.

360
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,582
[Tim] Looks like you were right.

361
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,084
[pants] He's already here.

362
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,176
[Kentaro] Over there.

363
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,151
[Konaté] Looks like
they blasted their way in.

364
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,780
[sighs]

365
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,324
[exhales sharply]

366
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,672
Y'all sure you want to do this?

367
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,550
Guess so.

368
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,349
[Tim] What kind of exposure
are we looking at?

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,561
- [buzzing]
- About two-tenths of a millisievert.

370
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,438
Is that bad?

371
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,649
[Tim] Bad a-adjacent.

372
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,571
It's not much more than a chest X-ray,
per hour.

373
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,659
After the meltdown, this place

374
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:54,082
was supposed to be
uninhabitable for a thousand years.

375
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,755
Something's absorbing the radiation.

376
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,216
Something?

377
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,012
Yeah. Well...

378
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:09,640
You know.

379
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:15,771
Yeah.

380
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,412
- What the...
- [groans] Don't move.

381
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,789
- What is it? What is it?
- [shushes]

382
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,916
[grunts] I'm not moving.
Just tell me what it...

383
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,167
[grunting]

384
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:42,255
[breathes deeply] No, no, no,
that's... It's a shell.

385
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,506
- What?
- [sighs] Yeah, it's empty.

386
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,967
- You're fine. [sighs]
- What?

387
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,136
[Kentaro] They all are.

388
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,808
It's an exoskeleton.

389
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,269
Like when an insect molts.

390
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,354
- Oh, my God.
- [crunching]

391
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,898
God. Jesus.

392
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,775
[mumbles, breathes deeply]

393
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,152
You are the Monarch guy, right?

394
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,572
Shut up.

395
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,701
You do know why some animals molt, right?

396
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,078
Yeah, they grew out of their skin.

397
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,207
- [sighs]
- Fantastic.

398
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,685
This should lead to the reactor,
or what's left of it.

399
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,397
[Konaté] We're at six millisieverts now.

400
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,400
This is where they lost Keiko.

401
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,527
Then this is where he'll be.

402
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,205
[Konaté] Fan out. Stay alert.

403
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,334
- [Kentaro] Holy...
- [Tim shushes]

404
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:15,599
[sighs]

405
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,852
[wind whistling]

406
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,402
You think they had a meltdown?

407
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,531
It's a portal.

408
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,741
It's an entry point.

409
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:34,785
[May] To where?

410
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,205
Tinfoil hat land.

411
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,586
Is Shaw's plan really that crazy?

412
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,589
To try and close it?

413
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,425
[Konaté] Tim.

414
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,356
Charges. Set all around the perimeter.

415
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:07,651
Looks like enough to bring
this whole place down on top of us.

416
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,611
[Tim] Can you defuse them?

417
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,155
I can try.

418
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,492
Looks like they're rigged
to a radio detonator.

419
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,578
- Step away from that.
- [operatives clamoring]

420
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,455
Hey! W-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

421
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,415
And put your gun down.

422
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,375
[operative] Do it.

423
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,753
Shouldn't be here, Tim.
You're not cut out for fieldwork.

424
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,756
You sure about that?
Maybe I learned a thing or two from you.

425
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,677
Look around, sweetie pie.
Clearly not enough.

426
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,597
- I said gun down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

427
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,182
Hey, just...

428
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,726
Okay. Okay.

429
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:46,940
Hey.

430
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,358
Are you gonna shoot me, Michelle?

431
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,777
I don't want to, Timothy,
so don't make me.

432
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,031
We can't let you stop this.

433
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,366
Everyone stop.

434
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,750
No one is shooting anyone.

435
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:08,837
Where is Shaw?

436
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,009
Well, you finally made it.

437
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:19,806
I assume this means you wanna talk.

438
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:26,188
Let's talk.

439
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,819
Cate. Just you.

440
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,547
Stairs to nowhere.

441
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,467
Rooms without doors.

442
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,432
What the hell are we missing?

443
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:04,977
[sighs]

444
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:19,741
Bigger on the inside.

445
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,370
Keiko!

446
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,415
Keiko!

447
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,751
Hey, Keiko, you in there?

448
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,254
I'm coming around back.

449
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,630
[knocking]

450
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,633
- [sighs]
- Keiko!

451
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,428
Oh. It's the ants. [chuckles]

452
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,930
- What are you doing here?
- The ants. I'm sorry.

453
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,016
- I know how you are about your privacy.
- You can't be here.

454
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,977
- Yeah. Okay. Ooh.
- Billy. [breathes shakily]

455
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:51,189
- I tried to call but, uh, it was busy.
- [shushes]

456
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,815
[stammers, sighs] Keep your voice down.

457
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,066
- [sighs] Can you keep your...
- [coughs]

458
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,484
- [whispering] keep your voice down.
- So...

459
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,445
- I had it off the hook.
- Why?

460
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:00,031
- Well, just...
- It doesn't matter.

461
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,950
[breathes deeply] The ants showed me
it's bigger on the inside.

462
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,368
What are you talking about?

463
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,953
What if they live underground?

464
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,289
The Titans.

465
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,667
If that's how they move around the world
without being seen.

466
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,628
- Like ants.
- Yes. Sort of.

467
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:17,299
Uh, what if their underground
isn't just underground?

468
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:22,345
What if it's another realm,
not just beneath the earth, but...

469
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:23,555
Inside of it.

470
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:29,186
Yes. Inside, but also... also alongside,

471
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,524
existing together.

472
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,442
Bigger on the inside.

473
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,569
Mm-hmm.

474
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:39,863
That sounds...

475
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,282
[sighs] Crazy.

476
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:43,950
Yes.

477
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,369
- Oh.
- But brilliant.

478
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,996
- Yeah?
- [chuckles]

479
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,541
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Yeah.

480
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,544
[child] Mama.

481
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,887
[speaking Japanese]

482
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,515
[child groans]

483
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,769
[speaking Japanese]

484
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,855
[chuckles]

485
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:17,067
[in English] This is my son Hiroshi.

486
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:19,778
[chuckles]

487
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,657
- Hi.
- [speaks Japanese]

488
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,577
- [speaks Japanese]
- [sighs]

489
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,662
[chuckles]

490
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:37,546
[in English] So, it's why I applied to
do my postgraduate work at Berkeley.

491
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:44,219
After the war I... [sighs] I wanted Hiroshi
to have other opportunities.

492
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,849
And then I couldn't bring him
in the beginning,

493
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,020
so my mother's been looking after him.

494
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,193
I just didn't realize how long
it was gonna take for me to bring him.

495
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,740
[inhales sharply] I was finally able
to save up enough money,

496
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,993
thanks to the job at Monarch.

497
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,370
Yeah.

498
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:14,708
And their visas came through
about six months ago.

499
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,089
So, he's what Hatch was talking about?

500
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,092
Your juicy tidbit?

501
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:28,055
- What did you think it was? [chuckling]
- Nothing.

502
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:31,475
[chuckling]

503
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,894
I wanted to tell you and Lee.

504
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,646
- I... I really did.
- No. No, it's... Don't.

505
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:41,652
And I almost did so many times.

506
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:47,199
But, uh, you see how I'm treated.

507
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,079
A woman. A Japanese.

508
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:58,544
[stammers] It's hard enough
to get an ounce of respect. [sighs]

509
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,214
What do you think they'd do
if they found out I was a widow

510
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,093
trying to raise a child alone? [sighs]

511
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,555
Then don't do it alone.

512
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,393
You know, um, I-I got your back.

513
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,772
We, Monarch, we got your back.

514
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,137
Why just me?

515
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:53,140
You know why.

516
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,439
You looked into his eyes.

517
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:05,151
He's not just a mindless,
destructive force.

518
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,238
He knows what he's doing.

519
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,866
And what's that?

520
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,410
[sighs]

521
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,502
There's a world down there, Cate.

522
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,631
And it's not ours.

523
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,384
There's a world down there?

524
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:35,390
Oh, yeah. I know because I've been to it.

525
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:39,561
It exists, Cate.

526
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,772
Billy and Keiko were right.

527
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:43,941
Please.

528
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,610
Please believe me.

529
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,530
I want to believe you.

530
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,034
[chuckles] Well,
that puts you one up on Monarch.

531
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,663
And your dad, too, by the way. At first.

532
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,290
[grunts]

533
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,293
[sighs]

534
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,422
What did you see?

535
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,635
[breathes shakily] Tell me
what they couldn't believe.

536
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,553
[scoffs, chuckles]

537
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:20,351
I'm afraid that's
just simply incomprehensible.

538
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,897
But what I learned from it

539
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:28,901
was why Keiko was trying
to tell everybody at Bikini Atoll

540
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:32,821
why they were wrong
to try to destroy Godzilla.

541
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,116
He... He's not here to hurt us.

542
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:40,246
He's just keeping his kind in their world
and us in ours.

543
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,251
So that's why
you wanna seal off their world.

544
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,713
I am sealing off their world.

545
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,257
Every portal.

546
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,178
But what if you're making things worse?

547
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,430
We went to Monarch,
and we saw the gamma ray readings.

548
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,348
The same type they were
getting right before G-Day.

549
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:00,767
Come on, Cate.

550
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:05,062
Monarch can cherry-pick
any piece of data they want

551
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,232
to justify
continually sitting on their hands,

552
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:09,442
which is what they do.

553
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:13,155
They study their data
and then they study it again.

554
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:18,117
What makes you so sure that your data,
whatever that might be, is so right?

555
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,661
It's not about the data, Cate.

556
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,749
It's all about belief.

557
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:29,004
And to some small degree atonement.

558
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,521
A nun and a priest are walking along.

559
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,315
Now, they get into a sandstorm.

560
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:49,983
General.

561
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,735
- General.
- No idea...

562
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,363
[clears throat]
A moment of your time, sir?

563
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,909
Well, you had your moment, son.
It passed you by.

564
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,538
I'm due before the vice president
in about two minutes and sadly...

565
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,040
[stammers] Give us a minute.

566
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,544
Sadly, there's nothing
in Lieutenant Hatch's illuminating report

567
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:12,214
to justify the continued funding
of Project Monarch.

568
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:16,927
I am disappointed in you, Leland.

569
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,304
I understand, sir.

570
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,182
That's why I wanted to give you this

571
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:25,811
as a token of my appreciation
for all that you've done for me.

572
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:27,728
And what's this?

573
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,938
It's a map, sir.

574
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,106
A map?

575
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:33,234
A comprehensive projection
of all the potential Titan threats

576
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,403
currently under assessment
by Project Monarch.

577
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,572
Jesus Christ, you do not give up.

578
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:40,199
Well, thank you for your generous offer,

579
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,244
but Lieutenant Hatch has given me
all the information that I need.

580
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,872
Sir, I believe that you'll find
Lieutenant Hatch's report

581
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:50,710
has omitted certain facts
to justify shifting funding

582
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,795
from Monarch to his own priorities.

583
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:55,007
Facts? Such as?

584
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,888
Such as Godzilla, sir.

585
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,638
Well, it's highly classified.

586
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,099
Why would he have that in his file?

587
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,394
We didn't kill it.

588
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:22,283
What did you say?

589
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:24,577
It was sighted during the operation
at Hateruma Island, sir.

590
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,245
This is confirmed?

591
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,748
Sighted by me, sir.

592
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,588
It's all in here.

593
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:38,382
You playing games with me?

594
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,675
No. No, sir.

595
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:43,721
I just feel compelled to point out that
this was not provided by Lieutenant Hatch,

596
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,473
but through the sole dedication,

597
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:49,520
diligence and loyalty
of doctors Miura and Randa.

598
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,230
Noted.

599
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,272
[grunts]

600
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,900
I do hope that doctors Miura
and Randa's position

601
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,320
as sole authority over Project Monarch's
scientific operations

602
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,572
will remain unchallenged.

603
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,327
Why wouldn't they?

604
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:08,997
Sir.

605
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,501
[clears throat] He is ready for you, General.

606
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:17,631
Good luck, sir.

607
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:23,762
You too.

608
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:31,978
[Tim] He's lost it, Michelle.

609
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,438
Shaw. He doesn't know what he's doing.

610
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,525
[Duvall] He knows exactly what he's doing.

611
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:42,280
And at least he's not sitting around, Tim,
waiting to see what happens next.

612
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,283
Whose city will be destroyed?

613
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,953
- Whose family will die?
- This could destroy everything.

614
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,122
This could destroy the whole world.

615
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:53,292
Or it could save us.

616
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,714
Do you think this is
what she would have wanted?

617
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,507
Keiko?

618
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:06,763
[chuckling] She was the first one to
jump in, against my better judgment.

619
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,976
My mission was to protect her.

620
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,645
My job.

621
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,030
I know this is where you lost her.

622
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,699
I read the file.

623
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,163
Sounds like she was a force of nature.

624
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,834
And then some.

625
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,840
Talk all you want about stopping monsters
and saving the world.

626
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,260
This is to make up for losing her,
isn't it?

627
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,764
Well, of course it is.

628
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,809
But that's not really possible now, is it?

629
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:59,566
But I can still honor the work
that Billy and Keiko were trying to do.

630
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,570
- I understand what you're saying, but...
- No time for indecision, Cate.

631
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:08,575
{\an8}Especially when you've already seen
what indecision can cost you.

632
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,162
{\an8}- Clear the space.
- [operative] Copy that.

633
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,163
{\an8}Let's go.

634
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,748
[beeping]

635
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,875
Come on.

636
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,293
[rumbling]

637
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,796
- The hell was that?
- Something's coming.

638
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,216
- [operatives clamoring]
- Oh, shit.

639
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:28,427
- Get out! Everybody out!
- Cate!

640
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,221
- May, get back!
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

641
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,139
[grunts, groans]

642
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,391
[Tim] May!

643
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:35,184
Hang on! [gasps, panting]

644
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,435
- [screams]
- [Tim] No, no, no!

645
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,689
- [screaming]
- [Kentaro] May!

646
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:42,276
- [breathes heavily]
- [roaring]

647
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,531
[gasps, whimpers]

648
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:49,783
[groans, screams]

649
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:53,120
- [growling]
- [screaming]

650
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,292
- [screaming, whimpering]
- [Lee grunts]

651
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,210
I got you!

652
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,837
Don't let go of me!

653
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,923
- [screams]
- [Kentaro] Cate!

654
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,009
[growling]

655
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,553
[beeping]
