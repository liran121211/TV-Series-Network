00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,127
[Lee] <i>We can
get the hell out of here right now</i>

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,339
<i>and find out what really happened
with your dad.</i>

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,507
[item clicks, buzzing]

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,427
<i>Now, you got just about 60 seconds
to make up your minds.</i>

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,098
{\an8}What's it gonna be?

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,059
- [Cate] Wait a minute.
- [Lee] We don't have a minute.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,895
That van in the parking lot?

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,688
Thought so.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,982
I'm not going anywhere with you.

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,652
Hey, you came to me.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,653
If you don't want to find out

12
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,905
if your own father's alive or dead,
that's your business.

13
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,366
But I do want to find out.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,826
If he's alive, how do we find him?
Where do we even start looking?

15
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,370
We start where his trail ended.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,996
[scoffs] Good luck with that.

17
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,540
They searched for his plane for weeks.

18
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,960
That's hundreds of square miles of,
you know, Alaska.

19
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,921
Yeah, then we'll look where they didn't.

20
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:52,344
Now, this is a <i>niwaki,</i> which means
an entirely different pruning process.

21
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,471
So, of course, it's, uh...
it's quite fascinating.

22
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,181
[radio chatter]

23
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,976
Look, all I want
is for these Monarch asshats

24
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,146
to leave me out of whatever crazy shit
my dad was into.

25
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,357
You good with that?

26
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,193
- I wanna find my father.
- Me too.

27
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,284
[May] Why do you wanna find him?

28
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,785
What's your dog in the hunt?

29
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,454
Hiroshi Randa's more like a son to me
than a nephew.

30
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,125
He's the only family I ever had.
That's my dog.

31
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,420
This is crazy.

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,549
Crazier than finding secret files
in your dad's secret safe?

33
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,925
Crazier than a secret brother?

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,427
- A secret family?
- [alarm ringing]

35
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,470
Ah, they're onto us. Get to the van.

36
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,680
[in Japanese] EMERGENCY OCCURRENCE

37
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,599
PLEASE STAY ALERT

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,850
- [in English] I'll drive. Give the keys.
- No, this is a rental.

39
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,394
- I don't think you're allowed.
- God, you are your father's son. Come on.

40
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,812
[in Japanese] EMERGENCY OCCURRENCE

41
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,565
PLEASE STAY ALERT

42
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,401
[orderlies shouting in Japanese]

43
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,321
- [in English] Okay, where's the key go?
- Oh, my God.

44
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,739
When was the last time you drove?

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,616
If it floats, flies,
or runs on four wheels, I can handle it.

46
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,201
Foot on the pedal. Press the button.

47
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,745
- Button?
- [May] Yes!

48
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,163
Hooah!

49
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,248
[in Japanese] It's Lee Shaw!

50
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,920
They're headed to the south gate!

51
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,295
[orderly] <i>Close the south gate!</i>

52
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,673
[alarm ringing]

53
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,010
[Cate screams, in English]
Stop, stop, stop!

54
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,928
[Kentaro] Watch out, watch out, watch out!

55
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,222
[tires screeching]

56
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,516
You pay for collision?

57
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,684
Uh, yeah.

58
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,230
[Kentaro] What are you doing?
Where are we go...

59
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,150
[whimpers]

60
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,074
- [Cate] Watch out!
- [grunts]

61
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,243
[tires squealing]

62
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,288
Are you insane?

63
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,290
You never drove with your grandmother.

64
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,584
Hang on.

65
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,506
[Cate screams]

66
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,425
[in Japanese]
He's coming back! Main entrance!

67
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,346
[tires squealing]

68
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,390
[Cate, in English] Oh, my God!

69
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,665
[Billy] I don't like it.

70
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,336
Yeah, well, you haven't exactly
kept that opinion a state secret, Billy.

71
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,589
We've always maintained our independence.

72
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,092
Because no one takes us seriously.

73
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,678
Look, if you two wanna keep this

74
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,598
our private little monster-hunting club,
then fine. We pull the request.

75
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,185
But if you wanna make a difference,

76
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,687
you wanna do some... some serious science,

77
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,939
then we need backing.

78
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,941
[sighs]

79
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,026
Can we trust this guy?

80
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,154
As long as we don't make him
look like a jackass.

81
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,408
Okay.

82
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,535
- Okay.
- Yeah.

83
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,539
Welcome to Monarch, General.

84
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,713
Who'd have thought you'd parlay
escort duty into your first command?

85
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,341
And these eggheads are already
starting to grow on you, Shaw.

86
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,052
It's a bit like herding cats, sir,

87
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,888
if cats had Geiger counters
and thought they were smarter than you.

88
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,973
[chuckles]

89
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,769
My colleagues: Dr. Miura, William Randa.

90
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,647
Congratulations on your promotion, General.

91
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,776
- Well, thank you, miss.
- Of course. And it's Doctor.

92
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,445
Forgive me.

93
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,201
I believe you have something to show us,
Doctor?

94
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,049
What the hell?

95
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,593
Tell me this is some kind of fossil.

96
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,970
[Keiko] Uh,
that would be a reasonable guess,

97
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,473
but we took this impression
in a muddy field in Indonesia.

98
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,517
Three weeks ago,
before the monsoons filled it in.

99
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,353
How does something this big
walk around without being seen?

100
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,729
Well, I'm leaning towards teleporta...

101
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,107
We have a number of working theories, sir.

102
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,192
[clears throat]

103
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,073
This is gonna give me nightmares.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,953
But until you show us what made this,
a footprint's just a hole in the sand.

105
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,830
You couldn't at least get me a photograph?

106
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,249
Why just settle for a photograph?

107
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,293
What if we had a way
to lure it out of hiding?

108
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,170
All we need is 150 pounds of uranium.

109
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,504
And let me explain that, sir.

110
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,214
That's as much as we dropped on Japan.

111
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,800
[Lee clears throat]

112
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,429
What are you playing at here?

113
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,474
General, while I was
researching my doctorate,

114
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,519
I discovered anomalous
radiation trails in the troposphere.

115
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,105
Mm-hmm. And we think that
they may be directly correlated

116
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,773
with the Titan's movements.

117
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,192
You think they're radioactive?

118
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:03,946
It's less that they emit radiation
than they absorb it, feed on it.

119
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,490
[Lee] I believe that we need to
seize the initiative on this, sir.

120
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,912
Facing them over there
is far better than facing them over here.

121
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,122
- Isn't that what Ike would say?
- President Eisenhower,

122
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,207
our commander in chief,

123
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,168
would say we need every last ounce
of uranium for national security.

124
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,924
With all due respect, sir,
a creature like this,

125
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,674
as big as this,

126
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,678
is an existential threat
to global security.

127
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,285
- Yes. Yes! We got it.
- [sighs]

128
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,870
Do you have any idea how huge this is?

129
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,790
- 150 pounds, I'd say.
- [chuckles]

130
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,543
[Lee] Maybe next time,
don't lead with teleportation.

131
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,627
- Oh.
- It's a theory.

132
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,462
[Lee] Yeah, and so is the flat Earth,

133
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,673
but it's not gonna get you
funding from the Pentagon.

134
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,717
We're talking about upending
centuries of accepted science

135
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,263
in evolution, zoology, physics.

136
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,557
You know, it requires open minds.

137
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,517
Yeah, and open eyes, Billy.

138
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,061
You gotta read the room.

139
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,772
This is a voyage of discovery.

140
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,858
So I'm not gonna bite my tongue
just to get support

141
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,443
from a bunch of gun-toting Neanderthals.

142
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,700
We got a lot of work to do.

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,201
Okay?

144
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,995
I'll see you guys in the office.

145
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,544
You know how he is.

146
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,296
I do.

147
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,426
If it wasn't for you,
neither of us would be here.

148
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,305
And that is not a theory, that's a fact.

149
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,685
So, you are saying that there is a place
for gun-toting Neanderthals?

150
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,811
[chuckling]

151
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,937
Thank you.

152
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,064
[chuckles]

153
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,693
[sighs] He is right, though.

154
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,820
If we hide who we are
and what we're trying to do,

155
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,865
then what's the point of doing it at all?

156
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,798
[chuckles] We started out
with pencil and paper.

157
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,009
Not much of a leap forward.

158
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,261
I don't know how
Billy kept these journals.

159
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,139
He'd scribble down
every crazy thing he came across

160
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,349
till his pencils were nothing but nubs.

161
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,642
- Dad did that.
- Yeah?

162
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,020
He'd sharpen them
with the penknife that he carried.

163
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,939
Left the shavings everywhere.

164
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,443
Mom got tired of sweeping up after him.

165
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:13,738
Now, there's something in here
Hiroshi didn't want Monarch to know about.

166
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,742
And my gut says if we find it
before they do, we find him.

167
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,495
Uh, May built something to read them,
but it's back at her place.

168
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,163
Great.

169
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,417
Well, n... no, I... I actually...
I... I digitized them already.

170
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,086
You know, save it for a rainy day.

171
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,963
[Lee] Well, all right, egghead.

172
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,925
Need you to look in there
for anything about Alaska.

173
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,761
Okay. Well, mining rudimentary visual data
for key words

174
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,888
isn't exactly a walk in the park.

175
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,057
Can't just google it.

176
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,311
Do you know what Google is?

177
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,899
Well, I wasn't
in solitary confinement, May.

178
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,318
When was Monarch founded?

179
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,197
Uh, late '40s, thereabouts.

180
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,743
Wouldn't that make you,
like, 90 years old?

181
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,665
- What can I say? Good genes, huh?
- [May] Hmm.

182
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,125
Oh, wow.

183
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,419
What is all this anyway?

184
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,755
Hopes.

185
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,925
Dreams. Ambitions.

186
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,511
It's what we wanted Monarch to be
before they lost their way.

187
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,390
And look at 'em now. They're chasing
you guys instead of monsters.

188
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,687
Did our dad really work for them?
For Monarch?

189
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,481
It is your family business.

190
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,776
He knew these things existed.

191
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,571
You all knew.

192
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,073
You could've warned people,
tried to stop it.

193
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,326
Hey, that's exactly
what we were trying to do.

194
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,953
But you were there. You saw it.

195
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,956
You really think anything on earth
could've stopped it?

196
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,250
Stopped that?

197
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,502
Then he threw his life away for nothing.

198
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,964
It's not our family business...

199
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,551
it's the family curse.

200
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,439
[ship horn blowing]

201
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,063
[exhales sharply]

202
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,147
You packed the large-format camera?

203
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,357
- Yes, Billy.
- All right.

204
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,400
- And the long lenses? The 500-millimeters?
- Oh, no.

205
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,986
I left it behind with the seismometer
and all the extra film.

206
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,822
That's too bad. So much
for the cover of <i>National Geographic</i>.

207
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,408
[soldiers chattering]

208
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,995
What the hell?

209
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,503
I told you we couldn't trust that bastard.

210
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,547
Hey, hold on. Let me handle this.

211
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,716
Let me just... Let me handle this.

212
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,309
[Lee] General.

213
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,691
General.

214
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,533
Sir, um, this appears to be going
in a direction we didn't discuss.

215
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,702
We discussed you needing
a large quantity of uranium.

216
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,161
Not in bomb form, sir.

217
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,747
Should've been more specific.

218
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,499
You could've told us.

219
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,127
Well, that's not how
top-secret nuclear tests work, son.

220
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,211
I understand, sir.

221
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,298
All they're asking for is a chance
to assess what we're dealing with.

222
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,841
We don't even know what these things are...

223
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,845
They're an existential threat
to global security.

224
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,763
Isn't that right?

225
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,848
Yes, sir.

226
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,933
How many stars do you see there?

227
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,101
- One, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,730
Which I understand means
you had to go through two or three...

229
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,899
four different levels
to get what we asked for.

230
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,609
And the judgment of all those stars

231
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,528
was that if we can lure this thing
out into the open, we deal with it here.

232
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,613
Now.

233
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,991
Now, monster or no monster, that thing,

234
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,952
that's not going back to Los Alamos
in a crate.

235
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,754
I realize that
this is not what they had in mind,

236
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,966
but it's become bigger than all of us.

237
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,596
You asked for the support
of the United States Army.

238
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,766
This is it.

239
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,521
[Billy sighs]

240
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,658
[May] Hey, it's me.

241
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,700
Sorry, it's windy.

242
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,038
I'm... I'm on a boat, on a ship.

243
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,999
You know I can't tell you that.

244
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,211
Hey, listen, I, uh...

245
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,713
Hey, can you just listen for a second?

246
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,884
Look, I might be coming back soon.

247
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,303
No, I mean it. For real.

248
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,224
If I knew more, I would tell you.

249
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,398
Hey, I gotta go. Yeah, time's up.

250
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,028
That's bad for the environment.

251
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,448
The fish eat the plastic,
and we eat the fish.

252
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,535
I'll make a donation to Greenpeace.

253
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,123
Or you can tell me why
you're ditching your phone in the ocean.

254
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,210
Do you need something?

255
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,462
He wants to go over the game plan.

256
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,426
You really trust that old bastard?

257
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,053
You don't need to stick your neck out
for us any longer,

258
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,555
not if you need to get back.

259
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,931
This is my fault.

260
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,600
- This is my mess.
- Yeah.

261
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,603
Yeah, it is your mess. And hers.
And you dragged me into it.

262
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,314
You cost me my business and my home,

263
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,984
my life, everything I've built, who I am.

264
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,821
- I didn't know this would happen.
- Yeah, fair enough.

265
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:33,285
But until we sort out your mess
and I get back what you cost me,

266
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,039
you do not get to tell me what I need.

267
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,926
[Lee] Okay, I greased the wheels
as best I could.

268
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,802
But here's the thing, guys.

269
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,430
We get one eager-beaver border guard
who finds these on us,

270
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,806
and it's game over immediately.

271
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,851
So we need to get rid of these.

272
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,855
No.

273
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,107
You told us the key
to finding my father is in there.

274
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,526
She's got a copy on her laptop.

275
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,069
- They're not holy reli...
- I don't care.

276
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,821
Why do I have to do everything you say?

277
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,865
And why are we going to Korea?

278
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,200
My father disappeared in Alaska.

279
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,618
Alaska is that way!

280
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,704
- Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- Well, I got us out of Japan, didn't I?

281
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,291
Onto this ship, no passport,
no Monarch in sight.

282
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,462
Now, there's someone in Pohang we need.

283
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,964
He's an old friend of mine.

284
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,259
He might be the last friend I have left.

285
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,760
[chuckles] But you're right.

286
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,763
Hiroshi is your dad.

287
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,848
And yours.

288
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,141
Now, you two wanna start
calling the shots, you got every right.

289
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,686
So, once we get there...

290
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,814
where to?

291
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,434
[announcer speaking Korean]

292
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,980
- Okay, where's your friend?
- Just trust me, okay?

293
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,197
Wait a minute. We're supposed to be
in line number two. Come on.

294
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:43,957
We're good.

295
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,546
I think we're supposed to be
in line number two.

296
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,258
Shit.

297
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,178
- [in Korean] Passport.
- [in English] Sorry?

298
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,263
[in Korean] Passport!

299
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,306
[in English] You speak English?

300
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,642
English?

301
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,144
Here's the situation.

302
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:08,356
I, uh... I got my sister's, uh,
adopted grandkids with me, right?

303
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,565
So we're... we're on that ship.

304
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,194
And I told 'em, uh, for safekeeping,
we gotta put everything in one backpack.

305
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,362
Backpack, right?

306
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,781
So, anyway, look, we're not terrorists,

307
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,367
and I've never been to North Korea...
[chuckles] ...so...

308
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:22,453
- Hey! Hold on. Hey!
- [Cate] Oh, my God. Please, please!

309
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,705
I have my passport. I have my passport.

310
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,917
[Cate] Couldn't you just let me
contact the American embassy...

311
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,842
Aw, no. What,
it's gonna get fined or something?

312
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,177
I'd be... 'Cause I'd be more than happy
to pay you guys,

313
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,721
- so you can do whatever you want with it.
- [Kentaro] What's going on?

314
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,348
- [Lee] What do you got to lose?
- [guard] My job.

315
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,267
- [Cate] We can't go to prison.
- [Kentaro] Shaw screwed us.

316
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,393
You run the show, don't you?

317
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,229
I just want you to know something.
I will make it worth your while!

318
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,605
We are not for sale.

319
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,315
Well, then you're
even dumber than you look.

320
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,652
- I mean, you... [grunts, groans]
- [May] Shit.

321
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,194
[in Korean] I told you

322
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,697
you would meet some really stupid people.

323
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,866
I know.

324
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,242
[grunts]

325
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,078
[in English] Jesus, man.
Ever heard of pulling your punches?

326
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,789
- No. [exclaims] My brother!
- [Lee chuckles]

327
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,250
It's been too long, Du-Ho. [chuckles]

328
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,210
[Du-Ho] You look younger every time.
You look good.

329
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,296
[Lee] Not really.
But that's what everybody tells me.

330
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,089
Hey, we gotta get going
before somebody finds him.

331
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,049
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

332
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,469
O, ye of little faith. [sighs] Come on.

333
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,013
Asshole.

334
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,267
[guard yelling]

335
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,102
[tires squealing]

336
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,109
[sighs]

337
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,087
[Tim] Welcome to Japan, ma'am.

338
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,590
Thank you, Tim. I appreciate
any opportunity to visit Japan.

339
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,925
Although I was supposed to be

340
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,219
moving my daughter into her college dorm
this weekend.

341
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,303
[stammers] Congratulations.

342
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,555
But now my ex-husband is celebrating
this milestone with her

343
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,266
because Lee Shaw has decided to
no longer avail himself

344
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,018
of his generous retirement package.

345
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,146
- Ma'am, if I may, I... I...
- No, you may not.

346
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,150
[in French] What did he tell you?

347
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,779
Some valuable data had been stolen.
We needed to retrieve it.

348
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,782
And did he mention that he had
no authorization to run

349
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,535
this rogue escapade of his?

350
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,457
I assumed...

351
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,086
[in English] That plane is being refueled
and will be ready to leave in 30 minutes.

352
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,170
You'll both be on it.

353
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,548
We can't leave.
They have Bill Randa's files.

354
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,632
Sixty-year-old field notes

355
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,093
and crackpot theories
are not gonna help us avert another G-Day.

356
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,595
Yeah, well,
Lee Shaw seems to think otherwise.

357
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,681
[clears throat]

358
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,396
If you really believed
they were so important...

359
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,647
[phone rings]

360
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,858
...why not bring it to
Dr. Serizawa or to me?

361
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,234
Why do it alone?

362
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,318
[speaks French]

363
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,404
[scoffs]

364
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,408
Is this about our mission or yours?

365
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,493
[in French] This is confirmed?

366
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,828
All of them?

367
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:12,916
All right, stand by.

368
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,252
[in English] Shaw is in South Korea.

369
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,212
Facial recognition AI flagged him
and the others

370
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,548
detained by customs at the port in Pohang.

371
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,759
Somehow, he managed to slip away though.

372
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,932
You, on that plane in 30.

373
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,018
You, get a tactical team
and get on Shaw's ass.

374
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,103
Whatever you need.

375
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,316
I need my partner.

376
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,612
What if he's right?

377
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,574
Shaw's been on ice for years.
Why make his move now?

378
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,952
If I move quickly, I might be able to
get the jump on Shaw, but not without him.

379
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,496
No one understands better
what Shaw might be up to,

380
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,583
why these files are so important to him.

381
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,377
Crazy knows crazy.

382
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,634
[Lee] Hey, Du-Ho.
Did you get the gear I asked for?

383
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,053
[Du-Ho] Yeah. It's already on board.

384
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,102
[Lee] Bamboo Bomber?

385
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:18,856
I said a jet, Du-Ho,
not an aluminum coffin with wings.

386
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,692
[laughs]
Everything that could go wrong with her,

387
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,152
- already has.
- [sighs] Yeah.

388
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,949
All right.
Air Du-Ho, ready for immediate boarding!

389
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,284
We're going all the way to Alaska in that?

390
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,079
[May] Hmm. Don't think of it as old.

391
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:33,872
Think of it as vintage.

392
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,335
[indistinct chattering]

393
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,967
[feedback on radio]

394
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,969
[indistinct radio chatter]

395
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,054
[petty officer groans]

396
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,280
[soldier] Still nothing on sonar, General.
How long do you plan on holding?

397
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,330
[Billy] It's hot enough to
fry the egg on Puckett's face.

398
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,874
If this thing's a no-show,

399
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,711
I think it's safe to say
we're losing the Army's backing.

400
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:26,258
It's better than watching them obliterate
something they don't even understand.

401
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,057
[breathes deeply]

402
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,857
[electricity crackles]

403
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:44,442
[petty officer gasps]

404
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,569
- [petty officer 2] What's that reading?
- What happened?

405
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,654
[petty officer] I don't know, sir.
It shorted out.

406
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,489
[Godzilla groans]

407
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,951
[technician] Give me an update.
What's going on?

408
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,786
[sonar echo pings]

409
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,832
Attention! Attention! Sonar contact.

410
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:11,011
[Godzilla groans]

411
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,809
[soldier] Is that a dinosaur?

412
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,478
[Billy] Is that armor?

413
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,398
What the hell
does that thing need protection from?

414
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,109
Us.

415
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,991
Well, I'll be damned.

416
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,411
Look at that thing haul ass.

417
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,748
How have we never seen this thing before?

418
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,168
If they go through with this,
how will we ever know?

419
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,213
This is wrong.

420
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,471
General?

421
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,600
General, I think we should
consider standing down, sir.

422
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,103
If we can't learn everything we can
about the enemy...

423
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,896
You wait to see
what the enemy is gonna do,

424
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,399
you've already lost, son.

425
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,581
[roars]

426
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,416
My God.

427
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,335
You're go for Castle Bravo!

428
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,129
[technician] <i>Attention! Attention!</i>

429
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,592
<i>Transmitting detonation signal
to Castle Bravo in 30 seconds!</i>

430
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,857
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

431
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,402
- [in Japanese] Let me go! Let me go!
- [in English] Kei. It's over.

432
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,486
[in Japanese] I have to stop it!

433
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,905
Stop!!

434
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,157
- [in English] <i>...two, one.</i>
- [in Japanese] Please don't do it!

435
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,283
You can't do this!

436
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,451
Please!

437
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,578
[roars]

438
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,838
[cheering]

439
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,593
[in English] Magnificent.

440
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,138
Yeah, it was.

441
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,063
[Keiko sobbing]

442
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,279
[sobbing]

443
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,519
[sobs] What have we done?

444
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,483
[sobs]

445
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,528
[Kentaro] Was this our father's real life?

446
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,947
When he said he was at
a software developers conference,

447
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,867
was he really sneaking across borders
and chasing monsters?

448
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:24,954
Well, the cowboy days were behind us
by the time Hiroshi came on board.

449
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,999
Monarch was mainly counting beans
and crunching numbers.

450
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,333
"Data-driven," they called it.

451
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,169
[Kentaro]
When was the last time you saw him?

452
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,920
I don't know. Almost 20 years ago.

453
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,715
When I was already a dinosaur.

454
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,637
If you two are looking for some insight
into your situation,

455
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:45,267
I... I got nothing.
I mean, Hiro was just a normal kid.

456
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,978
He didn't torture small animals.

457
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,980
No issues potty training.

458
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:53,357
[Cate] Classic profile of a sociopath.

459
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:54,817
"Seemed like a nice guy.

460
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,153
- Who would have suspected?"
- Can you give it a rest?

461
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:59,488
Took after his mom. I can tell you that.

462
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,490
[groans] Went after whatever he wanted,

463
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,701
and he never let anything get in his way.

464
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,954
- And he never lied to me.
- [scoffs]

465
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,957
This is a secret, Cate, not a lie.

466
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,460
It seems like a distinction
without a difference.

467
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,628
Not to me.

468
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:17,381
I hate to interrupt family therapy,
but, uh, I think I found something.

469
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,383
So I've been searching up
the keyword "Alaska,"

470
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:24,305
and all that comes up is missing
dogsledders and "Yukon Yeti" sightings.

471
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,849
But, um, you said "data-driven,"

472
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,685
so I did a numerical search
to see if I got a hit

473
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,855
on the longitude or latitude of Alaska.

474
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,607
[Lee] That's Billy's handwriting there.

475
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,318
Yeah. These are geo-coordinates
from all over the world.

476
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,946
I mean, Mexico, Asian steppes,
North Africa.

477
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:43,032
And everything on the list is checked off
except for this one.

478
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,077
- [Lee sighs]
- [May] And when I put it into the map...

479
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,286
[Lee] Oh, yeah.

480
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:50,623
If we knew where your father's airplane
was heading when he disappeared,

481
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,708
I c... I could pinpoint this.

482
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,753
It was flight 74-something.

483
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,922
Filed a flight plan from Nome to Barrow.

484
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,174
Nome to Barrow.

485
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,134
Bingo.

486
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,471
[chuckles]
I owe you two a steak dinner for this.

487
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,889
Time to cowboy up, Du-Ho.

488
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,058
- We got a new destination.
- I got it.

489
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,561
What does it mean?
Why was he going to Barrow?

490
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,105
Nah, he was headed to Barrow.

491
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,108
That's not where he was going.

492
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,654
[Keiko breathes shakily]

493
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:24,616
[Billy] Keiko?

494
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,206
[footsteps approaching]

495
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,503
You okay?

496
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,672
He shouldn't have stopped me. [shudders]

497
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,176
Yeah, he was being selfish.

498
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,804
What would've happened if he hadn't?

499
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,766
You'd have been fired, arrested,
probably deported.

500
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,978
They would have set off that bomb anyway.

501
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,901
General called me in
to discuss our funding.

502
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,447
I figured,
since we were going down anyway,

503
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,325
might as well shoot for the moon.

504
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,870
So I gave him a proposal,
a string of Monarch outposts,

505
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,040
extra staff, monitoring equipment,
the works.

506
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,044
He rejected it...

507
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,509
said we didn't ask for enough.

508
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:30,723
[chuckles]
They are giving us a blank check

509
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:34,185
to find out
if there are more of those out there.

510
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,187
How the hell did you pull that off?

511
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,688
Well, I asked a simple question.

512
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,316
What if the next one doesn't pop up
in the middle of the Pacific?

513
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:44,362
- What if it's near New York or Washington?
- Well, then we gotta tell the whole world.

514
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,072
You're saying that you want to go public

515
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,450
with the details
of a classified H-bomb explosion?

516
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,536
- Why not?
- Because they electrocuted the Rosenbergs.

517
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,829
What if...

518
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,209
Say we find another one...

519
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,294
Mm-hmm.

520
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,422
...does the general need to know everything?

521
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,217
I'm sorry, are you suggesting
that I lie to my superior officer?

522
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:11,806
No. But a lie and a secret
are two different things.

523
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:15,602
I'm not sure the court-martial tribunal
would see that distinction, Kei.

524
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,231
Do you trust us?

525
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,903
Do you trust her?

526
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,448
[chuckles] Okay.

527
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:36,373
All that I can tell him
is what you tell me.

528
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:44,506
And I trust that you will tell me
everything that I need to know.

529
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,261
Are you okay with that?

530
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:51,930
Are you?

531
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,435
[chuckles]

532
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,021
I'm fine with it.

533
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:03,024
[chuckling]

534
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:05,651
- Yeah. Right?
- [chuckles] Okay.

535
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,445
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [laughs] Yeah.

536
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:11,241
[all chuckling]

537
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,625
[Du-Ho] It's all okay.

538
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,169
Good morning.

539
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:26,215
[Cate] Where are we?

540
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,343
US of A. We come to Papa soon.

541
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,139
Not looking forward to reunion?

542
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,644
What is it to you?
Are you, like, another one of his sons?

543
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,230
Sorry. Didn't mean to pry.

544
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:45,858
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,195
It's just,
I don't know what I'm more afraid of:

546
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:51,323
That we don't find Dad, or we do.

547
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:57,287
Feels like a punch in the gut either way,
and I don't know how many more I can take.

548
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,625
Let me tell you a secret.

549
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,046
You don't appreciate life so much
until you're afraid to lose it.

550
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,506
Not so much
when you see other people lose theirs.

551
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:12,468
[Du-Ho sighs] I saw many people die.

552
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,514
My father, good friends.

553
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,935
You get out of the bed each morning,
you roll the dice.

554
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:25,107
Terrible things may happen,
but you shouldn't hide from pain.

555
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Look at you.

556
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,319
Hide under your covers
and never sneak into Korea,

557
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,572
never meet Du-Ho

558
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,826
and never have a chance to tell your papa
to go screw himself.

559
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,536
[laughs]

560
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,162
[plane clatters]

561
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,124
- [Kentaro] Whoa, whoa. What was that?
- [Du-Ho] Uh, hey, brother.

562
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,251
I think we're getting close.

563
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,961
- [alarm blaring]
- [Lee] I think this is the spot.

564
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,254
Whatever Hiro was after,
I think we just found it.

565
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,340
- I'll take it from here, Du-Ho.
- Your airplane.

566
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,091
We're gonna do a little fancy flying here.

567
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,511
Lock everything down back there.
It's gonna get rough.

568
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,014
- [Kentaro] What?
- No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

569
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:59,891
I need you to stay up here. Buckle in.

570
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,059
Whoa, whoa. I mean, why is he flying?

571
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,731
Lee Shaw is the best pilot I know
when flying by seat of the pants.

572
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,274
Great. Now I'm gonna piss mine.

573
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,818
Du-Ho usually keeps something
underneath the seat there,

574
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,236
in case of emergencies.

575
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,489
Yeah, that's it. Unscrew the cap.

576
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,784
Take a shot, a big one. Gonna need it.

577
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,369
It's just water.

578
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,207
Put the cap back on.
Put it right up here where I can see it.

579
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,375
Yeah. Oh! All right.

580
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,294
Now we got an attitude indicator.

581
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,505
Here we go!

582
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,011
- [May] Holy shit!
- [Cate whimpers]

583
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,056
[screams] Oh, my God! Stop!

584
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:43,852
- [Lee] Come on, baby.
- [Cate whimpers] Shaw! [gasps]

585
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,479
- [Kentaro] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [Lee] Level out!

586
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,189
There. We can land there.

587
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,858
- This is gonna be rough, guys. Hang on.
- Shit!

588
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,693
What's that down there?

589
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,738
- What? Wait, what?
- [Lee] Hang on to something.

590
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:58,784
- Here we go!
- [gasps]

591
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:08,043
[panting, laughing]

592
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:12,089
[laughing]

593
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,676
Everybody in one piece back there?

594
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:21,098
Brother, your landings
can use a little work.

595
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,100
Hell of a job, copilot. [sighs]

596
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:27,354
- [laughs]
- [Lee exhales]

597
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,951
Oh, no.

598
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,349
I don't need to see him.

599
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,917
It's not him.

600
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:41,136
His seat belt's unbuckled.
Maybe he got thrown free.

601
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,306
[Du-Ho] Oh. Wow.

602
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:46,975
I'll be a monkey's naked uncle!

603
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,659
[Cate] Oh, my God.
Do you think anyone's there?

604
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:44,241
So, if everyone died in the crash,
who set all this gear up?

605
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,542
I know that handwriting.

606
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:55,586
[sighs]

607
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,087
Me too.

608
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:05,804
[Cate] He survived.

609
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,642
He survived.

610
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:50,474
[grunts]

611
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:53,142
Huh.

612
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,394
[in Korean] It landed.

613
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,355
Safely.

614
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:13,121
[grunting, panting]

615
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,627
[in English] We go now!

616
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,507
[panting]

617
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:28,469
I taxi the plane. You come quick!

618
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,555
Move!

619
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,808
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Let's go!

620
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,143
[grunts]

621
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,608
[rumbling]

622
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,906
[pants, sniffs]

623
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,787
- Come on!
- [grunts] Just get to the plane!

624
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:58,916
[Cate gasps]

625
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,002
- [creature roars]
- [May] Shit.

626
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:04,256
[screams, grunts]

627
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:10,804
[screams]

628
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,526
[groans]

629
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,239
[Cate] Oh, no.

630
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,118
[shrieks]

631
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:35,579
[Lee] Whoa!

632
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,999
[roars]
