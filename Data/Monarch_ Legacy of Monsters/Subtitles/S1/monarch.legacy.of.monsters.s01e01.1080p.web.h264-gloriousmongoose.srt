1
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,502
Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,547
I don't know if this will get to you.
I hope so.

3
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,091
Actually, I don't,
because it'll probably mean I'm dead,

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,635
which you may not feel
too busted up about.

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,513
Sorry, I gotta keep this short.

6
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,515
You may never forgive me
for what I took from you,

7
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,643
and I can't go back in time and fix
all the mistakes that I made.

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,771
But maybe I could leave something
for the future.

9
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,272
A legacy.

10
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,109
And you'll realize it was all worth it.

11
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,871
Pull it over.

12
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,914
Pull it over.

13
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,749
Release.

14
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,275
What are you doing?
Get back to work!

15
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,027
Get back to work!

16
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,672
We have to wait.

17
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,846
<i>Welcome to Tokyo.</i>

18
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,433
<i>Please be seated for decontamination.
Thank you.</i>

19
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,106
It's all about giving us
the illusion of safety.

20
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,778
Like spraying us for parasites
would help prevent another monster attack.

21
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,710
What is the purpose
of your visit to Japan?

22
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,464
My father died recently,
and I'm settling his affairs.

23
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,259
So business, I guess. Family business.

24
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,639
Place your fingers on the glass plates, please.

25
00:07:58,729 --> 00:07:59,938
Okay.

26
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,152
I'm sorry for your loss.

27
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,883
Take me to this address, please.

28
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,038
You certainly seem prepared here.

29
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,500
The government is spending lots of money.
Missiles, drones.

30
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,918
Are you in the trade?

31
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,670
The trade?

32
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,214
Monster prep. Big business now.

33
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,802
People always find a way
to profit off someone else's tragedy.

34
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,720
More profit than tragedy.

35
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,683
- What do you mean?
- San Francisco was a hoax.

36
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,518
They did it with CGI.

37
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,815
Well, that's quite a revelation.

38
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,943
There's more. I have a podcast.

39
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,774
Hi, Mom.

40
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,235
<i>Hey. You said you'd call when you landed.</i>

41
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,779
- And I just landed.
- <i>Yeah, two hours ago.</i>

42
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,949
- <i>Cate, I've been wa--</i>
- I had to get through immigrations

43
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,077
- and customs, get a cab.
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

44
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,414
<i>Okay. So, what, you're there now?</i>

45
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,708
I'm here.

46
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,461
<i>And?</i>

47
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,879
And what, Mom?

48
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,549
You think he'll just be sitting here,
waiting for someone to bring him home?

49
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,385
<i>So we should have gone with your plan?</i>

50
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,639
<i>Sit here, staring at the walls,
never knowing what this means?</i>

51
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,433
<i>Cate. Cate?</i>

52
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,228
- I'll call you back.
- <i>Cate, do not hang up on--</i>

53
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,296
Who are you?

54
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,589
What are you doing here?

55
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,215
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

56
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,508
Stop!

57
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,510
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Whose apartment is this?

58
00:11:58,677 --> 00:11:59,845
What is it?

59
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,180
She was just standing there!

60
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,348
I think she might be unstable.

61
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,766
What are you doing?

62
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,143
Why do you have these pictures?

63
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,936
- They're family pictures.
- What?

64
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,106
- How did you get in here?
- I have the keys.

65
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,193
- Where did you get those?
- I found them in my father's desk,

66
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,653
along with the lease
for this apartment in his name.

67
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,323
I don't know who your father is,
but this is our apartment.

68
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,160
This is my father.

69
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,123
Kentaro...

70
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,044
Who is she?

71
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,721
- Mother--
- Do you want me to drive?

72
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,267
You couldn't have gotten us a vehicle
that was at least somewhat vehicular?

73
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,354
You said, "Blend in."
Would you have preferred an oxcart?

74
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:51,813
Yeah, maybe.

75
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,691
Feed it some hay.
It wouldn't complain half as much.

76
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,322
Billy, it's the pedal on the left.

77
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,493
Hey, what's the rule on commentary
from the back seats?

78
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,372
- Other left.
- Back seat.

79
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,502
- You sure this is the right road?
- Let me check.

80
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,633
5,000 millirems.

81
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,719
6,000.

82
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,055
Well, we're on the right road.

83
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,350
The hell with it.
Never planned on having kids anyway.

84
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,103
Really? Never?

85
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,941
There was a time when you were
at least entertaining the idea.

86
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,861
Well, there was a time where
that idea was very entertaining.

87
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,322
Please,

88
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,534
don't make things awkward and tell us
it's 'cause you never met the right woman.

89
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,829
I gotta give it to you guys,
you make it look easy.

90
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,834
Raising a great kid, being able to keep
Monarch together. That's no small feat.

91
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,587
What we've done, we've done together.

92
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,257
Yeah.

93
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,389
7,000 millirems and rising.

94
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,226
All right. Showtime.

95
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,043
End of the line.

96
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,213
These should give us
some level of protection.

97
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,674
I guess that depends on
what we need protection from.

98
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,177
You afraid you're gonna run into a titan?

99
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:49,181
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- The army gave me one job, swab.

100
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,016
It's keeping you eggheads alive.

101
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,894
All right? So just follow my lead
for a change, please.

102
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,687
Sir, yes, sir.

103
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,648
Okay.

104
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,192
We come back, proving the network is real,

105
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,654
and then our theory
is not just some insane fantasy.

106
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,738
Yeah.

107
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,741
This could make everything
we've sacrificed worth it.

108
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,642
Get the gear.

109
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,283
Billy, fall in.

110
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,368
Yeah, I'm coming.

111
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,311
Put down your weapon!

112
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,355
Calm down. Calm down.

113
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,481
Pla-- Kei!

114
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,611
Kei, keep your mask on.

115
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,279
This is a restricted area.

116
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:30,908
Who are you?

117
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,579
We are scientists.

118
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:37,998
We only want to help.

119
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,751
And if you eat those you will get sick.

120
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,837
Your family could die.

121
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,132
You mean "the contamination"?

122
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,093
It is a fairy tale

123
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,971
to scare away the curious.

124
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,349
Why?

125
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,850
What are people so curious about?

126
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,023
The old folks say...

127
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,108
the government burned a hole
through the earth,

128
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,402
all the way to Hell.

129
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,864
Do you believe that?

130
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,785
See for yourselves.

131
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,511
Must be getting close.

132
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,721
Thank you, Billy.

133
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,957
There a problem?

134
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,794
Hey, will you stop doing that?

135
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,381
The problem is there is no radiation.

136
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,426
That's impossible.

137
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,054
We detected it 1,000 miles down range.
We should be standing at ground zero.

138
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,681
But we're not.

139
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,563
The boy was right. It's a fairy tale.

140
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,940
Okay.
So, are we taking these things off or not?

141
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,692
- 'Cause it's hotter than hell in here.
- No.

142
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,776
Yes.

143
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,615
Great. So, now you're trying to die?

144
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,283
Well, Doc says yeah, so...

145
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,161
- Yeah, I'm a doctor too, you know?
- Of course. Yeah, I know.

146
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,556
She doesn't even look like him.

147
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,808
But...

148
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,435
...she has his keys.

149
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,395
But not his face.

150
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,190
Prove it.

151
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,570
Where's your proof? A bunch of pictures?

152
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,281
I've got pictures.

153
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,664
This is us camping at the Redwoods.

154
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,960
He got poison oak and had these
horrible red blotches all over his arms.

155
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,922
Drove him crazy. Ring any bells?

156
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,677
This is our backyard.

157
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,930
He built that playhouse
for me when I was five.

158
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,185
One weekend he was actually home.

159
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,897
Here's a good one.

160
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,359
I bought them a sunset cruise
for their wedding anniversary.

161
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,528
Thirty years.

162
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,989
That's an accomplishment.

163
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,660
- How long were you married to him?
- Don't talk to her like that.

164
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,454
I'm not judging her.

165
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,624
But aren't you even curious
who he was cheating on first?

166
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,376
Your mother or mine?

167
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,175
Wai-- What do you want?

168
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,677
Kentaro...

169
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,345
...what is going on?

170
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,058
Can you tell us anything?

171
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,187
We have been waiting,

172
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,397
looking,

173
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,653
but Hiroshi's gone.

174
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,758
I'm sorry I barged in here.
Let's just forget this happened.

175
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,218
Are you kidding me?

176
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,678
Please, help me understand.

177
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,560
I wish I could.

178
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,148
Here, these are yours.

179
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,873
I'm not reading anything.

180
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,334
Every time there's a small spike,

181
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,045
it fades away
like it's been absorbed by something.

182
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,339
Yeah. Or eaten.

183
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,803
What?
It's not like we haven't seen it before.

184
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,181
These things think the "A"
in A-bomb stand for "appetizer."

185
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,893
Come on, time for some science shit.

186
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:10,956
There you go.

187
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,634
All right. Last charge is set.

188
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,261
I think we need more spacing.

189
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,221
These are supposed
to be set at 50 meters apart.

190
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,473
That was for the larger ones.
The 3.8 megajoules.

191
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,976
- Well, that's what we brought.
- No, these are the 2.1's.

192
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,229
If you want to measure greater depth,
we get maximum overlap at 30 meters.

193
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,647
Only when we use the diamond grid.

194
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,608
- This was a circular dispersal.
- Fire in the hole.

195
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,709
Wait. Is that-- Wait.

196
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,627
- Voids.
- What?

197
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,629
Chambers. Deep in the bedrock.

198
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,465
There's something down there.

199
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,716
Those are off the charts.

200
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,135
Hell yeah, they are.

201
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,679
This is what we've been looking for.

202
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:09,848
Yes.

203
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,413
This is it.

204
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,257
Hi, Mom.

205
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,967
<i>Cate, why haven't you called back?</i>

206
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,803
- <i>What happened?</i>
- There's nothing here for us.

207
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,639
<i>What? Was someone there?</i>

208
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,600
- <i>Cate?</i>
- Did you know?

209
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:55,853
<i>Know what?</i>

210
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,189
- <i>Cate?</i>
- I gotta go.

211
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,943
<i>Cate, what did you find out?
Whose apartment is it?</i>

212
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:03,944
It's his.

213
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,363
Mom, are you there?

214
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,074
Mom? Mom!

215
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,134
- Get up.
- What's happening?

216
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,469
- It's the early warning system.
- Warning for what?

217
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,971
Godzilla.

218
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,679
- It's probably just a drill.
- How long do we have to stay here?

219
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,056
We have to wait for...

220
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,849
"All clear."

221
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,768
What if it's not a drill?

222
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:21,021
I thought you're from San Francisco.
You'd know better than we would.

223
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,076
She wants to know if he was with you.

224
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,160
What?

225
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,663
When it happened, was he with you?

226
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,584
What difference does that make now?

227
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,253
You don't think it would've
made a difference

228
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,004
if he'd been here with us instead?

229
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,676
No, he wasn't with me.

230
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,817
No, no. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

231
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:12,447
Everyone, it's gonna be okay.

232
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,741
I'm gonna get you out of here.

233
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,829
It's fine. Everyone, follow me. Follow me!

234
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,930
Kids! Come on!

235
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,516
I got you. It's okay. Come on.

236
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:42,936
It's okay. Come on.

237
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,319
No! No!

238
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,287
No!

239
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,582
I need to go! I need to go, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

240
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,543
We need to get out of here.
Let go. Let me out!

241
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,282
I'm fine.

242
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,702
I'm fine.

243
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,733
Holy crap.

244
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,861
Well,
there's definitely something down there.

245
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,654
Some new form of M.U.T.O.

246
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,781
They look embryonic.

247
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,451
Like larvae. Almost like a nursery.

248
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,536
Yeah.

249
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:27,457
And if it's a nursery,
Mom can't be far away, right?

250
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,793
We need to get a sample
of their genetic material.

251
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,172
So, you wanna go down there?

252
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,635
Well, yeah. I mean,
they appear to be dormant, right?

253
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:41,680
Appears to be?

254
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,391
We're talking about
a new goddamn species, Lee.

255
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:48,729
And we can't afford to pass up
an opportunity to learn w-whatever we can.

256
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,899
We can. We can
if it's gonna get our asses killed.

257
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,066
Then why are we here?

258
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,279
I just think that we should--

259
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,116
I have a bad feeling about this, okay?

260
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,243
Billy's right.
We're not going home empty-handed.

261
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:04,912
What are you doing?

262
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,956
- I know the sample particles.
- Kei, come back over the railing.

263
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,458
- Come on.
- I'm the lightest.

264
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,210
You boys can pull me up
if I get in trouble.

265
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,046
Okay.
We are not just letting you go down there.

266
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,172
No.

267
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:16,965
You're not letting me?

268
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:19,343
Billy.

269
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,850
She's right. It's gotta be her.

270
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,396
What are you doing? Billy, what are you--
Bil-- Hey! Hey, B-- Stop. Stop!

271
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,356
Both of you stop.

272
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,485
Tell me exactly

273
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,571
how much time you need down there
to collect enough genetic material.

274
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,448
Five minutes. Tops.

275
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,493
Okay. We'll do it together.

276
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,044
Be careful.

277
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:23,949
See? All clear.

278
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,534
<i>All clear.</i>

279
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>Emergency alert has been canceled.
Please resume regular life.</i>

280
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,176
So, everything just goes back to normal?

281
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,304
What should we do?
Run home and hide in the closet?

282
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:07,659
She's asking if you'll come
have tea and talk about your life.

283
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:13,540
That's very kind, and you can tell her
I'm saying whatever you want right now.

284
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,543
But I can't imagine anything
I'd like to do less

285
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,338
than have tea with the woman Dad
was cheating on my mom with.

286
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,050
Yeah. Well, from our perspective,
your mother was the other woman.

287
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,510
That's fair. I'm gonna go now.

288
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,054
The other woman's gonna have
a lot of questions.

289
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,889
Did you get the answers?

290
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,768
You flew halfway around
the world looking for something.

291
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,021
Or what these unlock.

292
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:39,066
And all you found was Dad
was apparently a lying asshole.

293
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:41,443
Is that enough for you?

294
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:42,778
I guess that'll have to do.

295
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,240
You think our father was so bad?

296
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,618
I wanna show you something.

297
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:15,769
Okay.

298
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:17,938
Look around.

299
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,818
Am I looking for anything in particular?

300
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:28,323
Well, him.
He just wasn't who you say he was.

301
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,117
Maybe you just didn't know him.

302
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,830
You gotta give it to the guy.

303
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,875
He had two families and still had time
to be obsessed with work.

304
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,335
- It was important.
- Please.

305
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,379
Do you even know what he did?

306
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:46,341
- Software for satellites.
-"Software for satellites."

307
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,973
Did you ever meet anyone he works with?

308
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,643
Ever get invited
to take-your-kid-to-work day?

309
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,770
What do you do anyway?

310
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,648
Let me guess. Computer engineering?

311
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,151
Something that would make
dear old Dad proud.

312
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:10,574
Hey!

313
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,076
What's in here?

314
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,704
I didn't know it was there.

315
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,334
What are you doing?

316
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,711
- What's your birthday?
- Stop doing that.

317
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,297
I thought you wanted to introduce me
to your dad.

318
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,798
Show me something I didn't know about him.

319
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,344
'Cause the only thing in this room
that isn't old news to me is this.

320
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,348
July 7th.

321
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:39,478
What about your mom?

322
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,230
He wouldn't be that obvious.

323
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,273
Afraid of what we'll find?

324
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,069
August 17th.

325
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,950
Keep that up.
You're gonna get me locked out.

326
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,538
Seriously, stop. I'll never get it open.

327
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,918
How did you do that?

328
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,172
Your birth month, my day.
Your mother's month, my mom's day.

329
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,355
It smells like fish.

330
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,686
- I need to know what this is.
- It's some kind of old data storage.

331
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,855
- It's private.
- I'll make you a deal.

332
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,942
You help me,
and I'll get out of your life forever.

333
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,447
I might know someone.

334
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,034
Go away. I'm eating.

335
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,077
Come on, May.

336
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,206
Have you seen a format like this before?

337
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,124
What do you think, '80s?

338
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,793
No. It's, like, '70s.

339
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:31,089
You know, I can't drop everything
when you need a favor. Life goes on.

340
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:34,384
I can pay you.

341
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,138
Not much, but make it worth your time.

342
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:41,558
Pay me?

343
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,019
You wanna pay me?

344
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,064
Okay. Whatever.

345
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:51,735
Wait here.

346
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:56,573
May.

347
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:00,911
May!

348
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:02,829
What?

349
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,207
We can keep this professional.

350
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,209
Is that what this relationship is now?

351
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,294
Transactional?

352
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,464
Or was it always that,
and I just didn't see it?

353
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:13,882
I told you I needed some time.

354
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,884
Yeah. And I gave it to you.

355
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,681
You don't get to ghost me for months
and then show up out of nowhere,

356
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,391
treating me like tech support.

357
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,227
I'm sorry.

358
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,229
And why should I do shit for you?

359
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,858
And her, really? Is that for real?

360
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,609
I don't know.

361
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,489
But my father had that old data
in his safe for a reason.

362
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,326
If there's something on it that
can explain this, or prove she's lying--

363
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,661
Everything all right?

364
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,164
I paid.

365
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,630
You live around here?

366
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:57,885
Yeah. It's cheap.
I mean, by Tokyo standards.

367
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:02,097
Everyone minds their business.
It's real. I like it.

368
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,101
But I wanna know more about this
'cause I have siblings.

369
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:10,564
You know, we dribble out every few years.
We get a nine month heads-up.

370
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:14,276
You just had one dropped
on you full-grown. This one, at that.

371
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,903
Great, thanks.

372
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:18,947
- I'm sorry.
- Nah, he's a delight.

373
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,075
I like you.

374
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,497
All right. Make yourselves at home.

375
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,667
You know where everything is.

376
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:31,752
Are you a collector?

377
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:37,716
No. The audiophile nerds swear
it's the only way to listen to vinyl.

378
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:42,054
They say it's warmer, more honest.

379
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:47,100
They'll drop two, 300,000 yen on some
antique I pulled from grandpa's garage.

380
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,228
Smack a fresh coat of wax on it.

381
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:52,231
There's not even science
that says the sound is better.

382
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,191
- It is.
- No, it's not.

383
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:58,612
But hey, people wanna listen
with their hearts instead of their ears.

384
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,614
I will gladly take their money.

385
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,952
May is not what you call sentimental.

386
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:08,121
Right. Because you know me so well.

387
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:13,126
It keeps me in ramen and Asahi
during the dry spells.

388
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:17,881
I mostly do
freelance coding and game design.

389
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:20,425
Is this from one of your games?

390
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,137
No. Actually, your brother did that.

391
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,515
Half-brother.
And that's still up for debate.

392
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,100
You said you were an engineer.

393
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,686
No, you said that.

394
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,564
All right. Here we go.

395
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:41,989
Corrupted?

396
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,490
Encrypted.

397
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,075
So, you can't read it?

398
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,537
Well,
encryption technology has come a long way.

399
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:53,542
What was military grade 40 years ago,
is off-the-shelf now.

400
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,278
Hey, it's Collins in data culling.

401
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,615
I've got something here you should see.

402
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,340
Yeah?

403
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,010
What is it?

404
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,807
Someone tried to run it through
some online decryption software.

405
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,852
It's got a Monarch recognition code
embedded so it pinged back to us.

406
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:55,771
How much did you get?

407
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,814
Not much. Just a few megabytes.

408
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,902
Well, whoever has it is being careful.

409
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,779
They ran a small sample through
the decrypt,

410
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,989
then immediately took it down
when they saw the software worked.

411
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,034
- Did you get an IP address?
- Just a general area. Tokyo.

412
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,830
So, do you want me to kick this up
to Verdugo?

413
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:17,709
You know, I'll take care of it.

414
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:21,839
Are you sure? 'Cause after G-Day, Verdugo
said she wanted to see everything--

415
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,260
Thank you for everything. You were really
helpful. You did a great, great job.

416
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,441
Hey. How's your Japanese?

417
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:52,953
What is this?

418
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,415
I don't know. But there is a lot of it.

419
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,251
Is that Bigfoot?

420
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:04,089
Wait-- Go back. What's that?

421
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,466
It looks like that big satellite map
in his office.

422
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,306
Yeah, but what is it a map of?

423
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,766
I don't recognize anything.

424
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,603
What's "Monarch"?

425
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:20,731
They were there.

426
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,275
In San Francisco.

427
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:28,447
Like soldiers or something.
With this on their uniforms.

428
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,326
Doing what?

429
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:37,497
I don't know. It felt like the whole city
was coming down.

430
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:41,376
People were trapped, dying,
and these guys were taking pictures.

431
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:45,422
Running around like kids on a field trip.
Like they'd been waiting for it.

432
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,509
You think that your father
was working for them?

433
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,094
This stuff was in his safe.

434
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,722
That's not who he was.

435
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,312
Why are we even talking to her?

436
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:03,732
If my father had been here with me
instead of San Francisco,

437
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,150
he'd still be alive.

438
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,736
But he wasn't in San Francisco on G-Day.

439
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:11,448
I thought you couldn't speak Japanese?

440
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,826
I never said that.

441
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:18,872
It was my dad's and my secret language.

442
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,584
I don't speak it anymore.

443
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,421
You expect us to trust you now?

444
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,173
After you tricked us?

445
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,177
I wasn't trying to trick anyone.

446
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,355
What do you mean?

447
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,566
He wasn't there?

448
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,461
- Dad?
- <i>Cate, where are you?</i>

449
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:09,756
Dad. Oh, my God. Are you all right?
We've been calling and calling.

450
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:12,426
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're at a camp.

451
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:16,054
<i>Where exactly?
Where are you standing right now?</i>

452
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,390
I'm at the Red Cross tent
near the north entrance.

453
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,476
Dad?

454
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:23,645
- Dad, are you there?
- Cate!

455
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,940
Dad. Dad!

456
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,402
Are you all right?

457
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,820
I've been trying to call you for days.

458
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,363
The cell network just came back up.

459
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,364
Where have you been?

460
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,909
I couldn't get a flight.
Everything was grounded.

461
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:37,910
Is your mother okay?

462
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:41,246
Come on. We've got a tent
on the other side of the camp.

463
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:42,414
I can't stay.

464
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:47,169
There's a bus heading east
out of the zone at 10pm tonight.

465
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:50,380
There are passes in there
for you and your mom.

466
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,799
When you get to Reno,

467
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,760
there's a hotel and a car
reserved in your name.

468
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,346
Reno?

469
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:58,430
What...?

470
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,767
You have to come now.
Mom's been sick worrying about you.

471
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,727
I need you to take care of your mother.

472
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:09,441
No.

473
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:11,026
There's something I have to do.

474
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,110
No!

475
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:15,989
I'm sorry, Cate.

476
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,200
But you are strong.

477
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,869
You'll be all right.

478
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,666
I'm sorry.

479
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:28,794
"Sorry"?

480
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,714
Tell your mom I love her.

481
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:35,759
I love you both.

482
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:41,557
Dad!

483
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:44,935
Dad!

484
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,778
About a week after that, we got a call
from the state police in Fairbanks, Alaska

485
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:57,447
saying the bush plane he was on
disappeared in a storm.

486
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,492
They never found the wreckage.

487
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,162
What are y'all gonna do now?

488
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:09,543
He wasn't perfect,
but he wasn't a monster.

489
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,880
He had some reason for doing what he did.

490
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:17,676
The answers have to be here.

491
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,762
Good luck. I hope you find it.

492
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,391
But nothing can justify what he did
to my mother and me.

493
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:30,439
Stop. Go back.

494
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:33,650
That?

495
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,655
That's my grandmother.

496
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,117
Yeah. She died when he was little.

497
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,496
Why is her picture in these files?

498
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,084
What is she standing in?

499
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:11,980
All right.

500
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,403
What do you see?

501
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,240
Same as you, Billy. Just closer.

502
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:23,575
Thank you.

503
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,509
You're already under three minutes,
so get to work.

504
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:44,805
There seems to be
multiple sets of appendages.

505
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,850
Definitely insectoid.

506
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,060
It's stunning.

507
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,481
When they powered up the reactor,

508
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,067
it must have drawn them toward
the surface to feed.

509
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:02,072
Holy shit!

510
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:04,324
Oh, my God. We gotta go.

511
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,495
Kei. Forget the timeline. We gotta go.

512
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,497
- One more minute. Okay.
- No, we gotta go now.

513
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,874
Get up there!

514
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,085
- You guys, run!
- Hey, look out!

515
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,504
Get out of there, guys!
Come on, get back here!

516
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:20,632
Come on!

517
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,430
Oh, my God.

518
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:30,517
Oh, my God. Go, go!

519
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,648
Go! Go! Keep going!

520
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:39,776
Pull!

521
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,237
Pull!

522
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,332
- Pull! Pull!
- They're coming! Hurry!

523
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:58,045
Billy! Pull!

524
00:47:58,629 --> 00:47:59,630
No!

525
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,508
No, don't drop me!

526
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:04,343
No!

527
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:05,802
There's too many!

528
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:11,266
- We're too heavy.
- No!

529
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,726
Give me your hand!

530
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:15,854
- I can't hold on!
- Reach, Kei!

531
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:17,898
Reach!

532
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:21,693
- I can't hold on!
- Pull! Pull!

533
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,613
No!
