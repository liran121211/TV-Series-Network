00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,474
[breathes heavily]

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,019
[Keiko, echoing] Hello.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,396
[breathes heavily] Are you all right?

4
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,942
[stammers] I can't really answer that
right now.

5
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,195
Can you walk? [exhales sharply]

6
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,697
[breathing heavily] Yes. Thanks.

7
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,034
- [grunts]
- [breathes shakily]

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,079
[exhales sharply] Those creatures
are very territorial,

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,457
and we are in their territory now.

10
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,459
All right, let's go. [breathes heavily]

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,002
- [Cate] You're really her.
- [sighs]

12
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,798
You're Keiko Randa. [breathes heavily]

13
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,717
Were you expecting someone else?

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,138
I wasn't expecting to be alive.
[breathes shakily]

15
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,349
I know the feeling.

16
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,977
We need to move. [exhales sharply]

17
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,978
Wait.

18
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,604
[breathes heavily]

19
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,567
[Keiko] Who are you? What's your name?

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,069
I'm... I'm Cate. [breathes heavily]

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,488
Well, how did you get here?

22
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,157
[breathes heavily] We fell.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
Oh, my God. May.

24
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,913
We have to find the people I came with.

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,082
Is Billy with you?

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,834
[breathes heavily] What?

27
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,460
Bill Randa?

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,046
- Lee Shaw?
- We... We have to go back.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,258
- We have to find them!
- We will. Calm down.

30
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,509
[breathing heavily]

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,636
This way.

32
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,059
Now.

33
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,451
[Kentaro, in Japanese]
What were you doing?

34
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,952
In Alaska,

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,162
out in the desert...

36
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,540
Did you know Godzilla was there?

37
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,542
I didn't know it would be Godzilla,

38
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,503
but I needed to draw out a Titan.

39
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,422
Why?

40
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,757
To open a rift.

41
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,635
To prove the network exists.

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,641
There's a gateway

43
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,643
that leads to their world

44
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,479
inside our own.

45
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,106
All this to prove your theory was right?

46
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,192
[sighs]

47
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,237
That my parents were right.

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,283
If they hadn't been dismissed as
lunatics, heretics, by Monarch...

49
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,827
maybe G-Day would never have happened.

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,667
Maybe Cate

51
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,711
would still be here.

52
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,421
[scoffs]

53
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,841
Cate's not dead because of Monarch.

54
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,762
She's dead because of us.

55
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,057
Because I believed in you.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,560
But all you ever cared about was this!

57
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,108
That isn't true.

58
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,780
I only wanted to protect you from this.

59
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,076
But you didn't need my protection.

60
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,914
That was my mistake.

61
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,003
[speaks Japanese]

62
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,050
You want to spare others the pain we feel?

63
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,639
You want to find a way for the
human species to survive?

64
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,226
Help me.

65
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,853
Work with me.

66
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,353
We can solve this.

67
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,272
Together.

68
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,607
Solve what?

69
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,442
The secret of co-existence.

70
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,241
All right.

71
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,954
If you can answer one question.

72
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,248
[sighs]

73
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,918
That's what matters to you now?

74
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,630
With the fate of the world at stake?

75
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,925
[sighs]

76
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,469
The choice I made...

77
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,266
You think I haven't tried
to understand it myself?

78
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,897
Would you rather that I hadn't
fallen in love with your mother?

79
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,357
That our family never existed?

80
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,235
Our family doesn't exist.

81
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,322
Not anymore.

82
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
[door opens]

83
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,006
[in English] If the rest of
your rescue party follow my beacon,

84
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,967
there's only one place they can come out.

85
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,594
- [roaring]
- [Keiko sighs]

86
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,057
I knew once they find my signal
they'd come.

87
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:32,976
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,895
- Signal?
- [panting]

89
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,980
What signal?

90
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,070
You're not part of a rescue party,
are you?

91
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,991
You didn't expect to find me here.

92
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,872
You're not Monarch.

93
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,707
Who are you?

94
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,585
[twigs snap]

95
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,338
[grunts, pants]

96
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,382
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- [May mumbles]

97
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,509
[breathes heavily] May. [sighs]

98
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,848
[May sobs] Oh, my God. [breathing heavily]

99
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,307
[Keiko] Tell me who you are.

100
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,810
Holy shit.

101
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,479
- [Lee] Keiko!
- [gasps, breathes heavily]

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,815
[Lee] Keiko, is that really you?

103
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,401
Of course it is.

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,361
Who is this?

105
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,325
It's me, Kei.

106
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,703
It's Lee.

107
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,165
Lee?

108
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,505
Your voice sounds different.
Come out where I can see you.

109
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,886
No... No, just s-s-stay...
stay there for a second.

110
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,472
There's some things
you need to understand first.

111
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,932
What things?

112
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,644
How long do you think
you've been down here, Kei?

113
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,482
By my estimation, 57 days.

114
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,068
Why?

115
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,822
Why are you hiding from me?

116
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,536
I came down here too, Kei. After you fell.

117
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,623
- I led a recon mission.
- Wait, you were here?

118
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,293
How? When?

119
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,838
That mission was in 1962.

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,301
[chuckles] It's 1959.
You're not making sense.

121
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,679
[Lee] I came down here in 1962.

122
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,098
I thought I was here
for only a week or so,

123
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,767
and then I was able to get right back up.

124
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,352
I escaped, but it was...

125
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,688
it was 1982.

126
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,399
No. [breathing shakily]

127
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:51,532
[Lee] And that... that was 33...
Thirty-three years ago.

128
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,252
Yeah.

129
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,465
With all the gravitational distortion...

130
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,009
some warping of space-time would make...

131
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,012
[sobs]

132
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,530
Is it true?

133
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,034
Is it 2015?

134
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,791
[Lee] You always were
good with numbers, Kei.

135
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,634
[breathes shakily, whimpers]

136
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:01,727
- Lee.
- I can't believe you're alive. I...

137
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,314
[sighs, breathes shakily]

138
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,399
[sobs]

139
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,570
[both crying]

140
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,536
It's you.

141
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,081
[breathes shakily] It is you.

142
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,958
Lee.

143
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,670
[Lee cries]

144
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,672
Billy...

145
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:37,428
N... No, Kei. He's... [stammers] He's gone.

146
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,099
- He died a long time ago. [cries]
- Oh, no. [crying] Oh, no, no.

147
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,896
No. No, no, no, no.

148
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,106
[Keiko sobbing]

149
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,327
[breathes shakily]

150
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,917
[breathes shakily] Hiroshi?

151
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,002
Hiroshi?

152
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,589
He's fine.

153
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,261
He's fine. He's okay.

154
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:22,348
How do you know? How do you know?
How do you know? How do you know?

155
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,684
Who are you?

156
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,065
I'm your granddaughter. [chuckles]

157
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,737
[whimpering]

158
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,171
How's the leg?

159
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,590
It's good. [sighs]
Only hurts when I walk on it.

160
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,133
Get your ass in a seat then.

161
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,760
The gamma emissions
seemed to have stabilized.

162
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,971
Still high, but not end-of-the-world high.

163
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,099
We called in every warm body we could.

164
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,060
Most of the outposts are back online...

165
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,812
barely.

166
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,816
Any word from Duvall?

167
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,611
Were you expecting one?

168
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,280
Not really.

169
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,242
[sighs] What about the signal?

170
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,662
- It is not our priority right now.
- Some... Someone could be alive

171
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,039
and that is not a priority?

172
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,250
With the whole planet still humming
like a pressure cooker?

173
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,213
With every station on alert
for a possible emergence? No, it's not.

174
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,674
If someone survived down there,
they might know what's going on.

175
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,929
- That feels like it might be a big deal.
- In normal times it would be a huge deal,

176
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,264
but we are looking at
a wave of Titan events

177
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,101
threatening the lives
of seven billion people.

178
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,646
I'm not peeling off resources
to save three.

179
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,857
Okay. What if the three
could save the seven billion?

180
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,695
Someone is alive down there.

181
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,199
And they might have the answers we need,
and they are calling us for help.

182
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,078
We cannot pretend that we don't hear 'em!

183
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,166
Look at the map, Tim.

184
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,629
Look at the scale of
what we are trying to stop.

185
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,090
My hands are tied.

186
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,843
Then untie them!

187
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,097
Otherwise Shaw was right about us.

188
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,810
He was definitely right about you.

189
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,483
I need you to think very carefully
about the next words you're gonna say.

190
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:44,283
Now, are you going to take your seat,

191
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,659
do your job,

192
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,370
and help us deal with this crisis?

193
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,836
Or do I need to
extend your medical leave indefinitely?

194
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,282
[Lee chuckles] Oh, my God.

195
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,326
Unbelievable.

196
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,620
[breathes deeply]

197
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,082
I reconfigured the emitter tube
to send out a directional gamma ray pulse

198
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,627
to let you know where I was.

199
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,420
[chuckles]

200
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,798
So Monarch made it to 1962.

201
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,510
They're around even today.

202
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,889
Dad was part of it.

203
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,642
Oh.

204
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,191
Tell me about him.

205
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,865
He's a... a family man.

206
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,368
He followed in your footsteps.

207
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,624
And when Monarch wouldn't let him,
he did it on his own.

208
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:22,714
[chuckles] He never knew...
knows when to stop.

209
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,390
Is he happy?

210
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,894
[Lee] Why don't you ask him that yourself?

211
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:44,111
Can you rewire this back
to its original configuration?

212
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,615
Yes. I think so.

213
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,200
Hmm.

214
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,037
Well... [sighs] ...in that case,

215
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,874
I'm gonna take you home.

216
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,636
[in Japanese]
I told you it wouldn't take long.

217
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,101
I gave most everything away.

218
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,648
I still need to make a few more trips.

219
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,110
Where will you go?

220
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,573
San Francisco.

221
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,952
Just for a few days.

222
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,788
There are some things I need to do...

223
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,374
for the divorce.

224
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,297
Emiko,

225
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,800
from now on...

226
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,640
After the attack on San Francisco,

227
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,934
we called everyone we could think of.

228
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,520
Hospitals. The Red Cross.

229
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,813
We searched the internet.

230
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,401
I never gave up hope that
you would come home.

231
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,782
[breathes deeply]

232
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,121
We dreamed about this day.

233
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:30,341
No matter what you did to me,

234
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:34,596
your son deserves a
relationship with his father.

235
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,816
So please,

236
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,361
when you find out where you'll be staying,

237
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,281
let Kentaro know.

238
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,597
[all breathing heavily, grunting]

239
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,056
[in English] You're good. Just keep going.

240
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,017
- [May] Can we go around?
- [Keiko] This is the only way.

241
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,227
- May, don't get hooked up on the tree.
- [Keiko] Steady, steady.

242
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,189
- [Lee] Look out. Oh, damn it.
- [Keiko groans] Got it.

243
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,607
- Yeah. Let's take five.
- [Cate pants]

244
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,941
We've got all the time in the world.

245
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,818
- Yeah. [grunts]
- I don't know about you guys,

246
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,780
but I'd like to get back to a world
with flying cars and robot butlers.

247
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,533
Yeah. And maybe nursing homes on the moon.

248
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,411
- [chuckles]
- Okay. I think we can all use a breather.

249
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,495
Works for me.

250
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,581
[Cate breathing heavily]

251
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,584
- [Lee panting] Hold on, Keiko.
- [exhales deeply]

252
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,795
Hey, seriously...

253
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,797
- don't go far.
- Don't go far.

254
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,300
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah. Yep.

255
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,761
Two, three...

256
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,772
[Kentaro sighs]

257
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,070
[sighs]

258
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,718
You mind if I join you?

259
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,638
Wha... What are you doing here?

260
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,432
Your mother said I might find you here.

261
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,689
[inhales sharply]

262
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:51,984
[grunts]

263
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,737
[sighs]

264
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,992
How's your leg?

265
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,910
It hurts when it rains.

266
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,996
Yours?

267
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,332
Makes a funny clicking sound.

268
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:12,921
<i>Kanpai.</i>

269
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,430
Wow.

270
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,891
I'm not, uh... not usually
a big whiskey guy...

271
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,476
What are you doing here?

272
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,940
[inhales deeply]

273
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,323
The gamma ray bursts,
we found a coherent signal.

274
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,659
A signal?

275
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,995
- A message.
- From who?

276
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,414
I don't know,

277
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,585
but it's coming from inside the rifts.

278
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:56,422
What am I supposed to do with it?
I don't know what any of this means.

279
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,508
No, you don't...

280
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,595
but your father might.

281
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,018
[Keiko exhales sharply]

282
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,522
- [Lee grunts, sniffles]
- [breathes sharply]

283
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,440
[exhales sharply]

284
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,152
[sniffs] Thank you.

285
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,030
[sighs]

286
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,741
- [sighs]
- [groans]

287
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,496
- Kei, I gotta tell you... [inhales sharply]
- Hmm?

288
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:33,709
...you look exactly as you've always looked
in my mind's eye.

289
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,795
All these years.

290
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,380
Exactly.

291
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:41,552
[sniffs]

292
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,850
I've been talking to you and Billy
in my head

293
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,518
the whole time I was here.

294
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,603
Yeah.

295
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,774
Who you were anyway.

296
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,776
[chuckles]

297
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,125
What happened to Billy?

298
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,879
I heard that... [sighs]

299
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,883
I guess he was leading
an expedition to some island and, um,

300
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:25,596
was trying to prove some of
the theories about all this

301
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:31,393
and, uh, he, uh... he never came back.

302
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,730
Oh.

303
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,607
But he did it, Kei.

304
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,775
He was the last man standing.

305
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,819
I mean, he went down swinging.

306
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,405
He saved Monarch.

307
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:48,118
He saved everything you and he built.

308
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,538
Everything the three of us built.

309
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,668
Yeah.

310
00:22:58,754 --> 00:22:59,796
Yeah.

311
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:09,013
I've lost so much time, Lee.

312
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,098
[sobs]

313
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,102
[sobs]

314
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:17,898
[sighs]

315
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,237
What's it like now?

316
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,406
2015.

317
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,077
[stammers] Even the words sound fantastic.

318
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:36,666
Yeah, cars are smaller and more efficient,
nowhere near as cool.

319
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,711
But the, you know, TV sets are bigger,
flat. Everybody's got one.

320
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,130
I mean, they're everywhere.

321
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,632
And, um, you know, gadgets.

322
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,469
You know, they got a phone
that does everything and it's, uh...

323
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,596
Oh, hey, we went to the moon.

324
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:51,807
Yeah.

325
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,979
[chuckles] Of course, I missed
that one too because I was down here.

326
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,316
But, you know, it's...

327
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,530
Same... Same old world.

328
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,909
Same people...

329
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,665
conflicts, triumphs.

330
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,754
You know, moms, dads...

331
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,425
kids.

332
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,443
Well, speaking of kids,
I guess I should check in on ours, huh?

333
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,904
[chuckles]

334
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,583
<i>I don't know if this will get to you.
I hope so.</i>

335
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:03,420
<i>Actually, I don't,
because it will probably mean I'm dead,</i>

336
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,756
<i>which you may not feel
too busted up about.</i>

337
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,633
<i>Sorry, I gotta keep this short.</i>

338
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,676
<i>You may never forgive me
for what I took from you,</i>

339
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,805
<i>and I can't go back in time and fix
all the mistakes that I made.</i>

340
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,434
<i>But maybe I could leave something
for the future.</i>

341
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,477
- A legacy.
- [knocking]

342
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,272
<i>And you'll realize it was all worth it.</i>

343
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:26,902
[sighs]

344
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,492
[sighs] Hello, Hiroshi.

345
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,243
Tim.

346
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,495
What are you doing here?

347
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,789
May we come in?

348
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,961
[in Japanese]
I thought you wanted my help?

349
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:54,763
[in English] Your father.

350
00:25:55,597 --> 00:26:00,227
I always appreciated your fidelity
to my parents' memory, Tim, but, uh,

351
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,729
I'm very busy.

352
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,275
And I have no interest
in working with Monarch.

353
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,026
Well, that's... that's probably good

354
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:12,154
because they wouldn't touch you
with a ten-foot pole. [chuckles]

355
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,823
Then what do you want?

356
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,284
Just show him.

357
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,418
Gamma ray bursts
coming from inside the rifts.

358
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,503
I'm well aware of gamma emissions.

359
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,797
No. Not these.

360
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,674
They're not the same
as the ones we detected before G-Day.

361
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,969
There is a coherent signal in there.

362
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:36,763
Coherent?

363
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:38,473
How? By what?

364
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,684
By who.

365
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,477
He thinks Cate could be alive.

366
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,318
Why are you doing this?

367
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,361
Look, it sounds crazy, I know.

368
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,156
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible. Shaw came back.

369
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:56,575
And the rest of the team didn't.

370
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,076
[breathes deeply]

371
00:26:58,077 --> 00:27:00,245
The variables are nearly infinite.

372
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,123
[in Japanese] You sound like you don't
want it to be true.

373
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,042
Of course I want it to be true!

374
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,170
But there's a big difference between
what you want to be and what could be.

375
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,175
[in English] This is cruel.

376
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,093
You said you wanted me to work with you.

377
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,929
To finish your journey.

378
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,264
Fine. I'm in.

379
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,184
But first, help me find my sister.

380
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:27,648
[sighs]

381
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,819
How? Monarch won't help.

382
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,488
Not with something like this.

383
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,031
[Tim] No, they won't.

384
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,784
And that's why I quit.

385
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,205
Monarch isn't the only game in town.

386
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,959
[Cate] So if we're in
the realm of the Titans or whatever,

387
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,002
why does it look so much like Earth?

388
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,213
[Keiko] Because it is.
Parts of it, anyway.

389
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,131
Different pieces of home.

390
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,384
Different pieces of their world.

391
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,845
All put together like a patchwork quilt.

392
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,764
[breathes heavily] I don't think
this is the realm of the Titans at all.

393
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,599
It's a place between places.

394
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,562
I call it "Axis Mundi."

395
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,564
The pole between heaven and earth.

396
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,649
You know.

397
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,900
- Schoolteacher.
- Oh.

398
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,861
- [rumbling]
- [May] Look, there it goes again.

399
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,572
[Keiko] Let's put it down.

400
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,159
[sighs, breathes deeply]

401
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,038
How... How is light getting in
when we're underground?

402
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,876
[exhales deeply] How do you know
we are underground?

403
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,877
- [sighs]
- 'Cause we fell down a hole.

404
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,921
- Did we fall?
- Yeah.

405
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,381
Or did we enter?

406
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,507
[sighs]

407
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,051
The rabbit hole.

408
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,138
[Lee] Welcome to it, Alice.

409
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,056
We're almost there.

410
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,267
Let's keep moving.

411
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,560
[breathes heavily]

412
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,604
- Okay. Ready?
- [sighs] All right.

413
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,813
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

414
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,316
- [grunts]
- Two, three. Up.

415
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,319
[all groaning]

416
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,738
[May] Okay.

417
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,537
[thunder rumbles]

418
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,352
[breathes heavily]

419
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,729
Well, there she is.

420
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,524
Right where I left her.

421
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,068
[Cate breathes heavily] What is that?

422
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,404
That... [sighs] ...is our ride.

423
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,198
Come on, let's go.

424
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,324
[breathes heavily]

425
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,409
[grunts]

426
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,625
[grunting]

427
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,316
Gotta be kidding me.

428
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:20,112
[chuckles] Oh, it's amazing.
This is amazing, isn't it?

429
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,572
It is.

430
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:23,991
Fifty-three years
and it's still got juice.

431
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,410
It's only been here a few weeks.

432
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,413
Thank you for reminding me, Dr. Randa.

433
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:36,128
All right, let's get these things wired up
and get the hell out of here. [grunts]

434
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,212
- Give it a little slack, May.
- [May sighs] Okay.

435
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,797
- And now, Kei...
- Yep.

436
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,718
...make sure you put the black line up top.

437
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,343
It allows us to control it...

438
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,511
- I got it.
- ...from inside the pod.

439
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,846
- [roaring]
- What?

440
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:47,848
That sounded close.

441
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,725
All right. Everybody in the pod. Let's go.

442
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:51,976
[May grunts]

443
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:54,228
- Kei. Kei, I got it.
- Do not rush me.

444
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,605
I got it. I know how to finish it.

445
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,273
- I've got this. I've got this.
- Kei. Stop.

446
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:00,068
- Kei, what is wrong with you?
- I'm staying behind. [sighs]

447
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,571
What?

448
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,159
Billy's gone.

449
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,079
And my boy grew up without me.

450
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,166
[inhales shakily]
I am not going to ruin his life...

451
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,587
[inhales sharply]
...again by reappearing suddenly.

452
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,675
Whatever's out there...

453
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,804
it's not my world.

454
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,641
Not anymore.

455
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,393
No.

456
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:40,651
These monsters... [breathes shakily]
...have taken everything from me.

457
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,071
No more.

458
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,742
This curse is broken.

459
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,915
You still have work to do up there.

460
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:04,925
And we need you.

461
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:25,279
Now let's move our asses
and get out of here.

462
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,656
She's your granddaughter.

463
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,242
[sighs, mouthing] Funny.

464
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,123
All right, if everyone will
fasten their seat belts,

465
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,000
we're first in line for takeoff.

466
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,084
[grunts]

467
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,378
I'm assuming this flight
doesn't have drink service.

468
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:46,049
Nope. But when we get back,
first round's on me. Yeah?

469
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,970
- Ready?
- Just waiting for you.

470
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,763
Kinda seems like old times, huh?

471
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,265
Speak for yourself.

472
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,184
[chuckles]

473
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:57,477
All right. [sighs]

474
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,479
Let's go home.

475
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,113
Hey, copilot.

476
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:11,407
- See that radar scope in front of you?
- [Cate] Yeah.

477
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,951
[Lee] When that thing starts blipping,
it means the device has lured a Titan

478
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:16,329
that will open the rift
and that's our way home.

479
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,455
But how do we take off?

480
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:20,458
Just hang on.
I think you'll know it when you feel it.

481
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,251
Just holler when it hits 3,000 feet.

482
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,088
I'll shut the device off.
The Titan's retreat will pull us in.

483
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,174
[grunts]

484
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,885
[roaring]

485
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,892
[Keiko] Lee, what is it? What do you see?

486
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,392
[Lee groans] Shit.

487
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,354
We lured a Titan that was already here.

488
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,610
[screeching]

489
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,529
Brace!

490
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,283
[alarm blaring]

491
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,828
[Cate] There's something coming
through the rift. 7,000 feet.

492
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,457
5,000 feet.

493
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,545
- [Lee] Come on. Come on!
- [Cate] 4,000.

494
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,921
Shaw! What do we do?

495
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,674
[Lee] We're running out of time
and we're not gonna get another shot.

496
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:10,759
[May] Oh, my God.

497
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:12,844
[growling]

498
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,774
[Cate] It's leaving.
It's going away from us.

499
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:27,693
Shit.

500
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,611
- Wait, what are you doing?
- My job.

501
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,239
- [May] What are you doing? No! Stop!
- [Keiko] Get back here!

502
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,993
[Keiko] Stop! Lee!

503
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:40,330
- [roaring]
- [Keiko] No! What are you doing?

504
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,841
[creature growls]

505
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:54,844
[grunts]

506
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,932
[grunts]

507
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,733
[groans] Oh, can't anything ever be easy?

508
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,359
Lee, get back here!

509
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,237
- [grunting]
- [growling]

510
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,950
[Cate] No, no, no, no, no.
We're losing it.

511
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:18,911
[grunting]

512
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,293
Lee!

513
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:29,796
[grunting continues]

514
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,141
[roaring]

515
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,479
[Godzilla roaring]

516
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,574
- Lee!
- No, no!

517
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,121
[breathing deeply, gasping]

518
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:05,874
[growling]

519
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:09,544
[grunts]

520
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,255
[creature growling]

521
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,730
[roaring]

522
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,657
[roaring]

523
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,723
[roaring, growling]

524
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,893
[grunting]

525
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:07,978
Lee!

526
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:26,496
Lee!

527
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:30,417
- Lee! Run! Lee!
- [grunts]

528
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,128
[pants, grunts]

529
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,797
- [groans]
- Lee, hold my hand!

530
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:39,218
- [grunting]
- I got you! Don't let go!

531
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,429
- [Keiko screams]
- [Lee screams, grunts]

532
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,847
- [Keiko] No!
- Come back!

533
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,184
- Lee, no! I got you!
- It's too much weight, Kei!

534
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,102
- [cries]
- It's all right, Kei.

535
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,479
No, I'm not letting go!

536
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,439
Thank you...

537
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,358
- No.
- ...for everything.

538
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,235
- [Keiko] Don't let...
- [grunts]

539
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,863
No! Lee! Lee!

540
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,872
Lee!

541
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:12,416
No! No!

542
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,127
Kei, look at me. Strap in!

543
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,605
[groans]

544
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,378
[whirring]

545
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,270
[grunts]

546
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,150
[breathes heavily]

547
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,825
[Cate breathes sharply] Where are we?

548
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:29,494
[exhales sharply]

549
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:35,667
[breathes heavily, stammers]
What is this place?

550
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,546
Who are you? [breathing heavily]

551
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:46,929
[Kentaro] Cate!

552
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:50,891
Cate.

553
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:56,939
Welcome back.

554
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,984
[exhales sharply]

555
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,576
- You did all this?
- Me? No.

556
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,453
I don't understand most of it.

557
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:15,082
But we were lucky someone
had already done a lot of the math.

558
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:21,880
Dad. [sobs]

559
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,086
Mama?

560
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,175
[sobbing]

561
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:15,142
[in Japanese] You got so big.

562
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:31,866
[crying]

563
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,452
I'm so sorry.

564
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,581
I'm so sorry.

565
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,376
[speaking Japanese]

566
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:43,462
[crying]

567
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,481
[in English] Kentaro,

568
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:07,778
I'd like you to meet our grandmother.

569
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,409
This is my brother.

570
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,790
[footsteps approaching]

571
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:26,964
I hate to interrupt, but we'd like
to get you into medical and debriefing.

572
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,131
It's this way.

573
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:32,761
Brenda, what are you doing here?

574
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,389
Well, someone had to pay for all of this.

575
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,436
Are you working with her now?

576
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,273
It's complicated.

577
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,027
A lot's changed in the past two years.

578
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,574
Two years?

579
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:57,077
- [security personnel shouting]
- [alarm blaring]

580
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,704
Shall we go?

581
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,163
Come on. Let's go, let's go,
let's go. Go, go.

582
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,790
What the hell is going on?

583
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,460
Only everything I ever promised you.

584
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:09,006
[rumbling]

585
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:16,930
Come on. Come on.

586
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,576
[roaring]
