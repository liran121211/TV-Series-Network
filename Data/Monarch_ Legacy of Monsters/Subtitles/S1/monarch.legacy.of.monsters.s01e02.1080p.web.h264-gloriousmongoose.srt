1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,673
Enter.

2
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,519
{\an8}Lieutenant Shaw reporting as ordered, sir.

3
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,233
{\an8}At ease.

4
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,031
{\an8}I believe that's gonna stick around awhile.

5
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,286
You know, this island is lousy
with sailors, Marines.

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,498
You couldn't pick a fight with one of them
instead of two of our own?

7
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,254
{\an8}Sometimes the fight picks you, sir.

8
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,797
{\an8}What was the fight even about?

9
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,678
{\an8}I guess I just can't abide bullies, sir.

10
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,430
{\an8}You know, your father
threw a few punches in his day.

11
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,766
Some of them at me.

12
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,019
{\an8}What do you think he'd make of you now?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

14
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,276
{\an8}Maybe we could sober him up and ask him.

15
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,905
All right.

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,991
{\an8}Well, some orders have come through.

17
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,536
Security escort for a Japanese scientist.

18
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,122
Sorry, sir. A Japanese scientist?

19
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,748
This isn't a milk run, Lieutenant.

20
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,043
We already lost a man
on one of these escort missions

21
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,170
a couple of months back.

22
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,175
{\an8}You will protect, observe, and report
when and if able. Understood?

23
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,426
{\an8}Understood, sir.

24
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,636
Then that is all, Lieutenant.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,931
{\an8}Dismissed.

26
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,324
Excuse me, sir, you don't happen to be
Dr. Miura, would--

27
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,660
Miura?

28
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,288
Sorry.

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,290
I think you're here for me.

30
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,961
Wish I could say I was,
but I'm here on army business.

31
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,507
Maybe we can get a drink
on my way out, huh?

32
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,221
They told me they were sending
a military escort,

34
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,389
and you're the only one here in uniform.

35
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,854
I'm supposed to meet a Dr. Miura.

36
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,105
I'm Keiko Miura.

37
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,234
- You're-- Keiko, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,318
You must be his daughter?

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,446
Or--

40
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm sorry. I think there's
a little miscommunication happening here.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,826
- Let's start over.
- Yes, why don't we?

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,203
- Okay.
- You are...

43
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,665
I am Lieutenant Leland Lafayette Shaw III,
but you can call me Lee.

44
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,503
I'm Keiko Miura,
and you may call me Dr. Miura.

45
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,140
You know, these things
aren't supposed to go that fast.

46
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,812
Would you like me to drive?

47
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,896
Why?

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,148
Am I making you nervous?

49
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,651
Nope. But...

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,280
I've been assigned to you
as your military escort.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,908
This is an army jeep
and I'm, you know, the army.

52
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,077
I've been driving up and down these roads
for weeks.

53
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,161
I know the way.

54
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,790
Okay then.

55
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,293
I'm starting to get the feeling
you don't really want me around here.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,422
Aren't you even curious why you're here?

57
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,506
Very much so.

58
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,303
A WB-29 on a routine weather mission

59
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,306
scooped up some airborne radioisotopes
over the Philippine Sea.

60
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,102
That's pretty far south
for a Russian bomb test. They don't--

61
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,062
That's because it's not the Russians.

62
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,193
Well, it's not us. So, who is it?

63
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,570
Well, they were the wrong isotopes
for bomb fallout.

64
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,616
And meteorological data
shows they likely originated here.

65
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,700
The Philippines?

66
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,535
That's gotta be a mistake.

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,996
That's what I'm here to find out.

68
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,457
Okay.

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,002
We should get to work. Hit the gas, Doc.

70
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,977
Every day the reading diminishes.

71
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,105
Soon it'll be entirely gone,
and the trail will be lost.

72
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,107
Uh-huh. Got that. Double-time.

73
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,150
Your English is very good.

74
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,947
It came in handy when I did
my postgraduate work at Berkeley.

75
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,576
It's impressive.

76
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,996
But doesn't that make you
a little overqualified

77
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,163
for this snipe hunt?

78
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,665
This what?

79
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,292
Wild-goose chase.

80
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,297
Come on, Doc. Don't you think
if those readings were legit,

81
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,507
Washington would've sent
half the eggheads at Los Alamos

82
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,425
to check it out?

83
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,595
Not a woman.
Certainly not a Japanese woman.

84
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,013
You got that right. Yeah.

85
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,435
You want me to lie
and pretend that's not the way things are?

86
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,814
You're telling me
you didn't take one look at me

87
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,525
and make a snap judgment
about who I am the second we met?

88
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,741
It's not the same,
Leland Lafayette Shaw III.

89
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,911
Suppose it's not.

90
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,726
Do you hear that?

91
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,026
Lieutenant?

92
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,243
Lieutenant?

93
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,632
Hey.

94
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,593
Hey.

95
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,928
Don't move.

96
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,846
Lieutenant.

97
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,347
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Don't shoot.

98
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,516
I'm American. Navy vet.

99
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,561
And what are you doing here,
American Navy vet, huh? You filming us?

100
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,146
Why? You guys doing something film worthy?

101
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,440
- I asked you a question.
- I'm just asking a question back.

102
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,692
Well, I got the gun, swab,

103
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,193
so who are you
and what are you doing here?

104
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,195
- Lieutenant.
- My name's William Randa.

105
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,741
Okay, Lieutenant Shaw?

106
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,414
Look, I promise I won't shoot you
if you don't shoot me.

107
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,082
Deal?

108
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,425
All right.

109
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,509
All right?

110
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,762
Still haven't answered my question.
What are you doing here?

111
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:07,186
Well, you could say
I'm on a hunting expedition.

112
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,021
I'm a cryptozoologist.

113
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,983
- You're a cryptozoo-- What?
- He studies animals that don't exist.

114
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,568
Yeah.

115
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,739
Atmospheric sampler? Spectrometer?

116
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,158
- Hey, is this a radiation monitor here?
- Hey.

117
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,576
- Easy.
- Don't touch that.

118
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,411
Sorry. I just--
I've never seen one before.

119
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,414
Just wanted to check it out.

120
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,709
'Cause it seems like maybe
we're out here hunting for the same thing.

121
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,879
And what's that, Mr. Randa?

122
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,381
The truth.

123
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,675
<i>Catey, where have you been?</i>

124
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:20,676
I'm sorry. I--

125
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,261
<i>I've been calling and calling you.</i>

126
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,054
Mom, I'm fine. I'm coming home.

127
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,807
<i>Already? What did you find out?</i>

128
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,517
It doesn't have anything to do with us.

129
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,769
<i>What does that mean?
What does it have to do--</i>

130
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,646
What did it always have to do with, Mom?
Him.

131
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,231
<i>Catey.</i>

132
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,233
- We'll talk when I get home, okay?
- <i>Don't do this.</i>

133
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,734
- Love you. Bye.
- <i>Catey, do not--</i>

134
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,617
American?

135
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,745
Excuse me?

136
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,664
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I just--

137
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,165
I overheard your accent.

138
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,545
Sometimes this place can make you feel
like you're stranded on another planet.

139
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,629
Glad I could help.

140
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,306
- Where are you heading?
- Look, I don't mean to be rude,

141
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,309
but I've made all the new friends
I can handle for one day, thanks.

142
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,186
Yeah. Nah, nah. Hey, I totally get it.

143
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:16,481
This young woman abroad
runs into a strange man

144
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,566
at the train station.

145
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,445
And next thing you know,
you're buried alive in a coffin somewhere.

146
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,824
I can't imagine that that helped.

147
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,620
Hey. Wait. Look. Hey, I'm harmless.

148
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,455
My name's Tim.

149
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,499
They don't come much more harmless
than the "Tim" variety.

150
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,584
Have a nice night, Tim.

151
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,629
I need to talk to you about the files.

152
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,715
I don't--

153
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,426
What files?

154
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,178
I work for Monarch.

155
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,098
You're not in trouble.

156
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,392
Not yet.

157
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,645
Those files belong to us,

158
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,106
and they are more important
than you could possibly imagine.

159
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,111
I need to make a call.

160
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,241
Okay. Let's make a call.

161
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,426
All right. All right.

162
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,512
Make your call.

163
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:31,265
Speaker, please.

164
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,851
Sure.

165
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,771
<i>Cate? Hello? Cate?</i>

166
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,987
No.

167
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:46,905
No.

168
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,494
I said you weren't in trouble.

169
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,371
"Yet". You said "yet."

170
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,799
Look, I swear we're not gonna hurt you.

171
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,967
No, you can't do this.

172
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,428
- I can't let you see where we're going.
- No! You don't understand.

173
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,263
I can't breathe. I can't--

174
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:14,892
I can't--

175
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,811
Relax. You're gonna be fine.
Just breathe, okay?

176
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,856
- Let me out. Let me out!
- Calm down. Relax.

177
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,650
- Let me out!
- Relax. Calm down.

178
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,528
Hey!

179
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,489
Get her under control, man.

180
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,532
Let me out!

181
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,715
What?

182
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,843
Why aren't you answering my texts?

183
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,554
When's the last time
I answered one of your texts?

184
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,139
I don't know... I thought...

185
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,224
You thought?

186
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,476
You thought that
because of your crazy family drama

187
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,354
that what happened between us
is ancient history?

188
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,024
What do you want from me?

189
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,364
I found this in my father's office.

190
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,576
I do audio, not home movies.

191
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,080
I told you I was sorry.

192
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,291
Apology accepted.

193
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,126
I'm sorry too.

194
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,255
I grabbed onto you
to keep my head above water,

195
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,882
and you didn't wanna drown. I get it.

196
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,054
You should go home now.

197
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,931
Wait, wait, wait.

198
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,517
I want those old computer files we found.

199
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,685
Why?

200
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,813
Because they're mine.
What difference does it make to you?

201
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,064
I'm busy.

202
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,983
Come back tomorrow.

203
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,522
She sounded French.

204
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,067
You said they were American.

205
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,151
The man was.

206
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,196
Tim?

207
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,866
Do you have some identification?

208
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,414
I lost my bag when I ran away.

209
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,625
My passport...

210
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,710
...my phone, all my money.

211
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,548
And you're sure this wasn't some kind of...

212
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,716
...misunderstanding?

213
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,261
What?

214
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,640
Tourists come here to enjoy
what Tokyo has to offer.

215
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,227
The nightlife. Some karaoke.

216
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,728
But...

217
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,397
...it's easy to overindulge.

218
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,441
You think I'm drunk?

219
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,279
I was almost kidnapped!

220
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,912
If you feel you are in danger...

221
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,208
...I would recommend you contact the
American Embassy.

222
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,003
Wait here.

223
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,005
I will get you the address.

224
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:42,993
I'm home.

225
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,244
Welcome back.

226
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,963
Have you had dinner?

227
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,673
I'm not hungry.

228
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,591
You haven't?

229
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,134
I was going to warm up the curry.

230
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:01,386
What's this?

231
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,098
His life was not easy, you know.

232
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,769
He lost so much when he was young.

233
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,690
You're defending him?

234
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,526
Aren't you angry?

235
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,780
You're angry, Kentaro.

236
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,200
Do you feel better?

237
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,963
What are you doing?

238
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,257
Now I'm angry too.

239
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,885
Join me, Kentaro.

240
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,598
Seriously?!

241
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:47,933
Throw it!

242
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,603
More.

243
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,729
Here.

244
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,282
Now we both feel better, right?

245
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,827
A little.

246
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,374
I'll warm up the curry.

247
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,608
So, you guys are
following the radiation, aren't you?

248
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:38,734
And how do you know about that?

249
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,986
Well, I know you're not gonna find
what's out there

250
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,446
following a Geiger counter.

251
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,364
What should we be following,
Mr. Randa?

252
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,866
Just Billy.

253
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,328
I think you should be following
the stories. Folklore. Legends.

254
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,748
You know, the people of these mountains,
they have an oral tradition

255
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:56,335
about a dragon that carves a path of fire
across the sky.

256
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,422
Or maybe a path of ionizing radiation.

257
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:05,344
So, you're hunting dragons.

258
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,931
I told you, I'm looking for the truth.

259
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,933
That's great. But we got work to do,

260
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,684
so it's time for you to hit the trail, bud.

261
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,186
Wait a minute, Lieutenant.

262
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,730
I don't think it's such a bad idea
for Mr. Randa to join us.

263
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,982
I think it's a terrible idea.

264
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,527
You're not here
to think for me, Lieutenant.

265
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,987
Look at him. Smell him.

266
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,614
He's probably been lost out here
for weeks.

267
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,241
Hey, hey. I know exactly where I am, pal.

268
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,617
- Do you?
- Yes.

269
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,995
No. Look, I am here at the behest
of the US Army, and my orders are--

270
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,414
Your orders are to provide me
with whatever assistance I require.

271
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:38,126
My orders are to provide you
with operational security,

272
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:42,548
and I cannot do that with our new friend,
Billy the jungle hermit, hanging around.

273
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:43,632
Wow.

274
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,263
Fine. Just go then.

275
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,348
Don't tempt me, Doc.

276
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,226
I didn't ask for you.

277
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:57,020
I don't need you and I don't want you.

278
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,899
So, you are relieved of
any responsibility for me.

279
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,944
Dismissed.

280
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,782
I'll send someone back with the jeep.

281
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,212
Shall we go?

282
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,645
So, have you ever seen a dragon?

283
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:39,688
Once.

284
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,983
Well, maybe.
It's kind of why I started doing this.

285
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,735
Trying to prove I'm not crazy.

286
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,111
You think I'm crazy?

287
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,529
I don't even know you.

288
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,031
That's true.

289
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,408
Do you often
follow strange men into the jungle?

290
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,369
This is my second time today.

291
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,373
We call 'em MUTO's.

292
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,461
For Massive Unidentified
Terrestrial Organisms.

293
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,962
I came up with that.

294
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,633
Terrestrial.
So, you don't think they're space aliens?

295
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,176
You do think I'm crazy.

296
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:10,677
I'm a scientist.

297
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,888
I believe what
the evidence tells me to be true.

298
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,097
Okay.

299
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,101
Everyone around here tells
some version of the same story.

300
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,770
- Okay.
- Lights in the sky.

301
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,358
And whatever's making them
has been tracing the same path

302
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,986
over and over and over again,
going back centuries.

303
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,989
- Like comets.
- No. More like migrating birds.

304
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:32,908
Hold on.

305
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,452
I have to show you something.

306
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,664
These are the tracks

307
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:41,375
of the radiation readings
from our surveillance aircraft.

308
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,881
See this?

309
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,890
Incredible.

310
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,770
- This way. This way. Come on.
- Okay.

311
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,605
Where are we going?

312
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,190
We're following the map.

313
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,079
We're almost there.

314
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,290
Almost where?

315
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:25,669
What is it?

316
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,426
What is that?

317
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:38,974
The <i>Lawton.</i>

318
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,183
I don't know.

319
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,852
You wanna take a look
and see what's on these.

320
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,687
I have no idea if they're any good but...

321
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,488
You do it.

322
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:55,175
Hiroshi was eighteen
when his father died in Vietnam.

323
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,349
His Uncle Lee was
the only family he had left.

324
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,270
If they were so close,
why didn't Dad ever mention him?

325
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,023
I think something happened between them.

326
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,526
He didn't like to talk about

327
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,821
some parts of his life.

328
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,324
Is he still alive?

329
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:21,994
Oh, I don't know.

330
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,455
This would have been a long time ago.

331
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,293
Sorry.

332
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,713
"CALL ME! IT'S IMPORTANT!"

333
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,801
I'll get it.

334
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:38,844
Thank you.

335
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,145
Good Evening.

336
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,189
Do you speak English?

337
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,607
Yes.

338
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,901
That's great, actually.

339
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,070
That makes this much easier,
for me anyway.

340
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,155
May we come in?

341
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:01,033
- No. Who are you?
- It's official business.

342
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,827
We're with
a special government task force.

343
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,746
- Which government?
- You know what?

344
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,457
We'll be in and out
before you even know it.

345
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:10,918
Wow. You have a lovely home.

346
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,045
Who are they?

347
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,131
What do you want?

348
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,051
I want Bill Randa's files.

349
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,344
No, you need to leave.

350
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,763
No, you need to hand over those files.

351
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,849
Otherwise, you, your friends,

352
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,185
and your mother
are gonna be in a lot of trouble.

353
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,436
Kentaro...?

354
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,354
It's okay.

355
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,607
There's something that your son stole.

356
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,152
He's going to have to come with us.

357
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:39,947
Is it true?

358
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,074
Did you take something of theirs?

359
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:43,534
They say I stole some files.

360
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:44,743
Enough.

361
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,370
Let's have it.

362
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,084
If he returns whatever he took,
will you leave him alone?

363
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,627
Of course.

364
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,300
If you have what they are looking for...

365
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,469
...you should give it to them.

366
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,179
Are you sure?

367
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,560
It must be very important.

368
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,233
I'll get it.

369
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,278
Amazing. Thank you.

370
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,031
Tea? You like tea?

371
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:24,950
Tea?

372
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,785
No. We're good. Thanks.

373
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,204
I hope my son hasn't caused
any trouble for you.

374
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,331
He's a good man now,

375
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,959
but when he was younger
there were so many problems!

376
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,545
- So much drinking!
- Hurry up!

377
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,131
I wanted him to find a nice girl.

378
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,633
Someone to settle him down.

379
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,219
You are very attractive.

380
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,554
Are you single?

381
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,310
Oh, shit.

382
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,645
- Shit.
- Kentaro!

383
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,606
Open up!

384
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,357
Kentaro, run!

385
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,824
You know this ship?

386
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,243
USS <i>Lawton.</i>

387
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,455
Went down 200 miles west of Pearl in 1943.

388
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,457
Pearl Harbor?

389
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,627
That's 5,000 miles from here.

390
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,711
Exactly.

391
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,564
Is this safe?

392
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,742
Mr. Randa.

393
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,746
You said you study myths, stories.

394
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,624
I'm interested in why
people tell the stories they tell.

395
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,047
What inspired the storyteller.

396
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:52,806
What terrified 'em.

397
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,367
What is it?

398
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,539
Mr. Randa.
Maybe we should stick together--

399
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,931
Mr. Randa.

400
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,768
Billy.

401
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,112
You were on this ship.

402
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,825
Yeah.

403
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,956
Is this what you were looking for?

404
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,124
Did you know it was here?

405
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,088
Did I know?

406
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,135
Let's say hoped.

407
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,223
Not very scientific.

408
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,645
I know we hit something
in the water that night.

409
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,981
We figured it was a Japanese sub.

410
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,110
The whole ship went down
in less than three minutes.

411
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:31,864
Who else survived?

412
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,452
Only me.

413
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,768
Going to the back.

414
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:43,852
Okay.

415
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,912
Who are you? Jason Bourne?

416
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,624
You're from San Francisco.
You were there that day.

417
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,417
You don't have a bag packed,

418
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,753
ready to head for higher ground
when the tide starts rising?

419
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:12,881
Yeah. It's full of bottled water
and batteries, not extra passports.

420
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,262
- May.
- Hey, are you okay?

421
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,597
What is she doing here?

422
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,474
Hey. She's in this too.

423
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:25,936
Somebody's after those files.

424
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,521
Why don't we just give 'em what they want?

425
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,731
Maybe then they'll leave all of us alone.

426
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,441
Okay, yeah. Good luck with that.

427
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,776
What's your plan? Just run?

428
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,320
Me? I have contacts.
I can get us fake passports.

429
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,865
I don't want a fake passport.
I want my real passport.

430
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,157
I haven't done anything wrong.

431
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,243
Okay. When have people in power
ever cared about--

432
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,327
Hold on.

433
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,414
I know where to go.

434
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,542
Trust me.

435
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,711
Come on.

436
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,679
- What is that?
- I don't know.

437
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,100
Looks organic.

438
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,381
Oh, God.

439
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,763
There are so many.

440
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,977
When did you say this ship sank?

441
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,438
Nine years ago.

442
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,109
I think I've seen everything I need to
in here.

443
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,361
Yeah.

444
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:07,996
That wasn't there before.

445
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,790
- This is fresh.
- Fresh what?

446
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,376
We'll find another way outta here.

447
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,002
How did it get here?

448
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,838
Is there something in here
that's making it--

449
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,214
I don't know. Come on.

450
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,111
You're here to see the Colonel?

451
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,071
Yes, we are.

452
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,448
If he's still alive.

453
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,701
So, we can see the Colonel?

454
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:08,974
Colonel Shaw?

455
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:23,447
What's your name?

456
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,741
Kentaro.

457
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:27,284
Kentaro what?

458
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:28,368
Randa.

459
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:34,583
Oh, my God. You're Hiroshi's boy.

460
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,920
And you?

461
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,464
I'm Cate Randa.

462
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,257
Course you are.

463
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:48,430
I didn't know Hiroshi even had a daughter.

464
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,599
Well, I didn't know he had a son.

465
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,227
Turns out he was good at keeping secrets.

466
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:59,191
Not my drama. No relation.

467
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,319
- We wanted to ask you about our fa--
- Why don't we...

468
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,240
Yeah. Come on.

469
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,450
Let's get some air.

470
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:10,577
Come on.

471
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,002
If you guys could just kinda keep
your voices down, that'd be good.

472
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,587
Tell me, how'd you get here?

473
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,422
Rented a minivan.

474
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:25,801
That's good.
But I mean, how did you find me?

475
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:27,636
My mom.

476
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,221
- Emiko.
- Yes.

477
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,561
We found something in my father's safe.

478
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,271
- Kentaro.
- What? He's my great uncle Lee.

479
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,314
What did you find in the safe?

480
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,691
Old computer files.

481
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:43,235
Bunch of crazy shit. Monster shit.

482
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:47,364
Can you please,
please keep your voices down?

483
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,910
What's this all about? Why are you here?
And you gotta make it kinda quick.

484
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,079
We wanna find out
what happened to my father.

485
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,206
You tell me.

486
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,377
Right after G-Day,
he said he had someplace he needed to go.

487
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,545
Wouldn't tell us where,

488
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,463
but a week later
we were told the plane he was on

489
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:04,715
disappeared somewhere in Alaska.

490
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,843
Turns out he had
a whole secret life in Japan.

491
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,470
I came here to try and figure it out,

492
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,973
but now we're being chased by
these Monarch people and--

493
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:15,934
"Disappeared"? As in, no body?

494
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:17,519
<i>No death certificate?</i>

495
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,522
- What are you saying?
- Hey.

496
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,566
Hey, what is this place?

497
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:28,780
This place is what Monarch
euphemistically refers to

498
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,824
as "secure asset management."

499
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,535
Right. So, you're imprisoned here.

500
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,370
Okay. Well, we're leaving.

501
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,873
Yeah, you can try,
but they're just gonna keep following you

502
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:41,460
and following you and following you,
until they finally get what they want.

503
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,961
Or?

504
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,338
Well, that's up to you.

505
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,341
Now, you can choke down
that mountain of Monarch bullshit

506
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,843
about your father disappearing
without a trace.

507
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:56,558
Or we can
get the hell outta here right now

508
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,894
and find out what really happened
with your dad.

509
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,692
Now you got just about 60 seconds
to make up your minds.

510
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,115
What's it gonna be?

511
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:20,666
Here, this way.

512
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,000
Are you sure?

513
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,961
I did two tours in this tin can, Doc.

514
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,591
What is that?

515
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:36,306
- Let's keep it moving. Come on.
- Okay.

516
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,896
- Are you all right?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

517
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,940
- Go back! Go!
- Oh, my God.

518
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,946
- Oh, my God!
- No.

519
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,407
Hang on!

520
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,328
It's leaving! Now's our chance!

521
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:02,291
- Push!
- I am pushing!

522
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,375
Come on!

523
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:05,502
Where'd it go?

524
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:10,174
Help!

525
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,258
Hurry!

526
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:12,968
What the hell is going on?

527
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:15,387
- Help! Help!
- Come on!

528
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,056
- Watch out!
- Holy shit!

529
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,938
Oh, my God!

530
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,106
Help me get him out!

531
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,483
Come on! Before it comes back!

532
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,568
Okay.

533
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,195
Here we go.

534
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:32,487
One, two, three.

535
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,200
It's too heavy.

536
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,078
I'm gonna stick this under,
and we're all gonna lift, okay?

537
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,079
Okay.

538
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,956
One, two, three.

539
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:48,837
Go! Get up! Billy! Hey, get up!

540
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,215
- Go!
- Okay.

541
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,387
Go!

542
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:00,849
Go, go, go!

543
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,944
Go!

544
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:28,919
Oh, my God.

545
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:31,338
It is a dragon.

546
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:50,023
It's incredible.
