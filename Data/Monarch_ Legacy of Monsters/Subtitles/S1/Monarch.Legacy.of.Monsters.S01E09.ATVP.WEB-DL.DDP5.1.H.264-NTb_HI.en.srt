1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,213
[whirring]

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,302
[Billy] Well, it's, uh...
it's a beautiful day.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,013
- [Lee] Yeah.
- [Billy] Yeah.

4
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,808
[Billy] I'd say it's, uh...

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,644
weather's gonna take us to the weekend.

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,729
[Lee] Oh, yeah.

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,397
[Billy] So...

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,067
- Mmm.
- Hey, buddy, cereal. Come on.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,241
I think it's about that time, pal.

10
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,118
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,457
Uh, little man, we are off to work.

12
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,918
Okay.

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,798
Now, your mimi is gonna be
watching you today.

14
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,385
And, uh, well, me and your uncle Lee,

15
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,762
we'll see you when he
gets back from his trip.

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,473
Where's he going?

17
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,521
I'll let your uncle Lee
fill you in on that. Okay?

18
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,647
Come here.

19
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,945
[door opens]

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,738
[door closes]

21
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,762
You know that it's top secret
army-explorer stuff, right?

22
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,559
Is it dangerous?

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,395
Well, we're doing it
for the good of the world.

24
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,315
You know, trying to keep everybody safe.

25
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,487
I guess what we do
is always a little dangerous.

26
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,075
Well, you know all about that, right?

27
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,702
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,789
What I can say is that there's a lot of
really smart, very careful people

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,627
working as hard as they can
to make this as safe as it can be.

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,669
Are you exploring far away?

31
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,633
That's, um... That's hard to explain, Hiro...

32
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,761
but I'll be back really soon.

33
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,013
In fact...

34
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,229
my lucky pocketknife.

35
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,940
I know we said we were gonna look into
getting you one when you were older,

36
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,401
so I'm not actually giving this to you, okay?

37
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,530
But I want you... [sighs]

38
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,992
I want you to keep it safe for me, okay?
Just until I'm back.

39
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,874
[chuckles]

40
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,063
[Billy sighs]

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
How'd that go?

42
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,651
He's fine. He's a tough little kid.

43
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,361
- [tech] Operation Hourglass commencing.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,572
- [tech] Personnel, standby.
- Takes after his mother.

45
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,828
You did good, swab.

47
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,457
She'd be proud.
It's a shame she can't be here to see it.

48
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,377
[chuckles] She'd miss all this.

49
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,922
- Running around, doing nine jobs at once.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,800
And doing all of them better than
any nine of us could do one.

51
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,595
[chuckles] That woman.

52
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,847
She'd be late
accepting her own Nobel Prize.

53
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,600
[tech] All stations, system check.

54
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,268
Well, we just have to make sure
that you aren't.

55
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,604
[soldier] Good morning, sir.

56
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,357
Yeah.

57
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,820
[exhales sharply]

58
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,618
You don't have to do this.

59
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,745
There's plenty of qualified candidates
we can...

60
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah, no, no. No, I'm not gonna ask anybody
to do something that I wouldn't do myself.

61
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,880
- Well, it could be me.
- [sighs]

62
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,175
Hey, did you ever manage
to get that Jeep out of third?

63
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,511
[chuckles] Go to hell.

64
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,472
[chuckles]

65
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,350
Don't mind if I do.

66
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,023
[tech] All stations,
commence rewind checks.

67
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,536
President is right, gentlemen.

68
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,746
Space is hard.

69
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,292
The moon's a decade away.
Two, if we do it right.

70
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,295
<i>Operation Hourglass is the culmination</i>

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,550
<i>of nearly two decades
of Project Monarch's work.</i>

72
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,554
Human discovery and
reconnaissance of the territory

73
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,598
between us and them.

74
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,517
Watch your heads, gentlemen.

75
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:16,065
<i>A place that will redefine
our understanding of the entire planet</i>

76
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,904
<i>and ensure the health and welfare
of all humanity.</i>

77
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,161
And if we don't get there first, Senator,
Comrade Khrushchev will.

78
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:29,955
<i>Na zdorovye.</i>

79
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,505
What you're about to see

80
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,884
is more than just a victory
for American scientific know-how

81
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,094
or our defense.

82
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,305
This mission is a matter of
global security

83
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,975
and the preservation of mankind, gentlemen.

84
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,144
Please, take a seat.

85
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,838
Well, Kennedy can have outer space
and all the big rocks floating in it.

86
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:25,594
We're about to plant our flag
in under space.

87
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,598
[tech] Hourglass is a go. Securing.

88
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:36,229
Our operating theory, gentlemen,
is that Titans get around underground

89
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,273
in a kind of a...
a king-sized rabbit warren.

90
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,067
[Suzuki] Gamma simulator activated.

91
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,151
<i>Clear the space.</i>

92
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,322
[Puckett] And Dr. Suzuki found a way in,
right here in the heartland.

93
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,202
Now, the thing is, the tunnel is
too unstable for us to enter.

94
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:55,831
The only thing which makes it passable
is a Titan.

95
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,293
- [radar beeping]
- Doctor, we have positive response.

96
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,755
All stations, Titan lock.

97
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,633
<i>Repeat, we have Titan lock.</i>

98
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,885
As we did on Bikini Atoll,

99
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,096
we lure the Titan
with the promise of a meal.

100
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,268
Titan's coming for our bait.
But, Jesus, that's a big one.

101
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,478
[tech] 5,000 feet to proximity.
On my mark.

102
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,355
And that promise will be unfulfilled.

103
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,398
Mark.

104
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,150
[automated voice] Ten, nine...

105
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,485
[tech] Titan at 4,000 feet.

106
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,362
[Puckett] But the tunnel
between here and there

107
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,573
stabilizes as they move through it.

108
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,657
[tech] 3,000 feet.

109
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,535
[Billy] Terminate gamma simulator.

110
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,495
[Puckett] So, rather than unleash hell
in Kansas, we cut bait.

111
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,038
[Billy] There it goes. It's going home.

112
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,585
And we sneak in behind them,
drafting down in their wake.

113
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,837
[automated voice] ...one.

114
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,881
[grunts]

115
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:51,471
- [onlookers gasping]
- [applause]

116
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,310
[Billy] There they go.

117
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,314
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

118
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,401
[antennas creaking]

119
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,181
[radio chatter]

120
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,934
[Lee] What the hell is going on up there?
Billy, do you copy?

121
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,229
[yelps, grunts]

122
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,440
[spectators clamoring]

123
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,651
[tech] Evacuate the staging ground.

124
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,694
<i>I'll say it again, evacuate the staging...</i>

125
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,365
[Lee] Damn it, Billy, can you hear us?
Billy. Goddamn it. Billy, can you...

126
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,409
[tech] I repeat,
evacuate the staging ground.

127
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,540
[people clamoring, shouting]

128
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,628
[grunts]

129
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,430
- [Lee] Mayday, mayday. Billy, do you...
- [alarm blaring]

130
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,809
[Lee] Mayday, mayday
the hourglass is imploding on us.

131
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,481
[breathes heavily]

132
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,837
What happened?

133
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,048
What the hell happened?

134
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,428
I don't know. [breathes heavily]

135
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,589
[monitor beeping]

136
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,263
Where... Where am I?

137
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,891
[Verdugo] Tokyo. We had to airlift you
out of Kazakhstan.

138
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,311
- What happened?
- [sighs]

139
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,439
Everything at the reactor plant...

140
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,652
[stammers] ...it went terribly wrong.

141
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,362
- What does that mean?
- [Tim] Shaw.

142
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,655
He imploded the rifts

143
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,576
and the whole thing
collapsed down on itself.

144
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,164
[screaming]

145
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,250
[panting, grunts]

146
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,215
[grunts, breathes heavily]

147
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,134
[crowd clamoring]

148
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,388
[Tim] Then the locals showed up.

149
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,807
<i>I'm lucky I didn't end up
in a Kazakh prison.</i>

150
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,353
[Verdugo] A lot of good people
didn't make it out.

151
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,065
Shaw...

152
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,859
May.

153
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,570
Cate?

154
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,158
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,372
[breathes heavily] Okay.

156
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,290
So where do we start looking for them?

157
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,376
[Verdugo] Kentaro...

158
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,170
they didn't make it.

159
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,173
[stammers] We finish Shaw's work...

160
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,553
Lee Shaw died doing what he loved,

161
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,682
pouring gasoline
on fires he doesn't understand.

162
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:31,270
He augmented a moment of global crisis
for this organization

163
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,564
that we have barely begun dealing with,

164
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,442
and he got your sister
and friend killed doing it.

165
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,695
I'm sorry, Kentaro.

166
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,488
Thank you for your help,

167
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,158
but your time in our world
has come to an end.

168
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,372
[sobs]

169
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,459
Wait, wait. No, they ca...

170
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,504
[stammers] We can... They're my family.

171
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,801
There has to be something I can do,
something we can do.

172
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,012
[Verdugo] There is.

173
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,390
Live.

174
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:22,738
[crying]

175
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,748
[in Japanese] I'm okay.

176
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,925
[groaning, grunting]

177
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,322
[grunting]

178
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,954
[in English] Cate?

179
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,584
Cate!

180
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,382
Cate!

181
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,892
Cate!

182
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,027
[muffled] Cate!

183
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,118
Cate!

184
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,996
[electricity crackling]

185
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,091
[grunts]

186
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,177
- May! All right, all right. Come on.
- Shaw...

187
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,303
- We can't stay here.
- Shaw.

188
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,388
We gotta get out of this place.
We gotta move fast.

189
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,683
You gotta hold my hand
and move exactly where I move, okay?

190
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,268
- Okay.
- Now. Come on. Come on.

191
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,061
We gotta avoid the lights.

192
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,771
No. This way, this way. Come on.

193
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,523
- [grunting]
- Come on. Keep moving!

194
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,984
- [May panting, whimpering]
- [Lee breathes heavily]

195
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,736
[May grunts]

196
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,739
- [Lee grunting] This way.
- [May] Shaw. Shaw.

197
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,575
- Come on, come on.
- [May whimpering]

198
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,661
This way.

199
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,876
[both panting]

200
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,837
What the hell?

201
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,297
- We're all right.
- What is going on?

202
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,175
We're all right.
We made it across the field.

203
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,846
After a rift closes, it leaves some kind
of electrical charge or something.

204
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,390
It affects your vision.
It affects the ground.

205
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,851
[stammers] It goes off
like a lethal static shock.

206
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,896
- How do you know that?
- Because I've been down here, May.

207
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,649
On a recon mission.
Same thing happened to my eyes.

208
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,819
[breathing heavily] Recon mission?

209
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,656
Where are we?

210
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,951
We're in it, May.

211
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:21,124
We're in their world. The Titans'.
This is just another part of their realm.

212
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,918
[breathes heavily] How did I get here?

213
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,046
I cleared the space,
and then I hit the timer.

214
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,048
She must have turned around
and come back inside.

215
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,133
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She followed me back.

216
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,052
- Whoa. No, no. Listen to me.
- Oh, my God, no.

217
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,804
- No. She started to fall.
- No, I gotta find her.

218
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,890
I caught her. Hey, we fell together.

219
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,976
May, she's down here somewhere.

220
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,561
- [stammers]
- I know that.

221
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,980
Is she alive?

222
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,692
- Did you see her when she...
- We're gonna find her, May.

223
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,114
But you gotta do everything
exactly as I say,

224
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,615
and I can keep you safe.

225
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,327
- Do you understand?
- [breathes shakily]

226
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,956
- Yeah, I just wanna find Cate.
- We will.

227
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,709
We will. Come on.

228
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,849
[Lee echoing] Cate!

229
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,268
[May echoing] Cate!

230
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,228
[Lee] Cate!

231
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,772
[May] Cate!

232
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:37,910
[sighs]

233
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,252
[sighs]

234
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:53,926
[sniffles]

235
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:58,930
[buzzer sounds]

236
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,517
[assistant] Dr. Randa?
General Puckett is here.

237
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,229
"As a result of
the catastrophic loss of life

238
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,856
in the undertaking of Operation Hourglass

239
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:14,445
and the inability of Project Monarch
to ascertain the cause of the catastrophe,

240
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,405
the Department of Defense has ordered

241
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:20,577
no further funds be allocated
to Project Monarch going forward."

242
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,084
- There's more, but you get the point.
- Hmm.

243
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,337
It's over, Bill.

244
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,173
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,050
[Billy sighs]

246
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:40,304
How are we supposed to
ascertain the cause of the catastrophe

247
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:43,599
- if they're shutting us down?
- Our DOD isn't big on theories

248
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,518
when proving them costs lives.

249
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,771
They really think NASA's getting to space
without losing some people?

250
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,482
Space they understand.

251
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:57,738
A network of portals connecting to
a hidden realm of monsters? It sounds...

252
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,907
- Insane.
- In a word.

253
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,202
And without an imminent threat
like our friend on Bikini Atoll...

254
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,497
Well, we could just bring one up, right?

255
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,708
Show 'em what a real catastrophe
looks like.

256
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,877
And what then?

257
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,883
Hope it's smaller than Godzilla
and listens to reason?

258
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:21,512
[sighs] I... I could've stopped it.

259
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,890
[Puckett] I could've stopped it.

260
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:28,937
"Older men declare war,
but it is youth that must fight and die."

261
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,442
I assure you, it's harder
when you know the youth in question.

262
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,029
He was my friend, too.

263
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,908
I can't let it go, Puck.

264
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,329
I won't.

265
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,168
Now, your boy's already lost a mother.

266
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,421
Now an uncle.

267
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,843
Do not take his father away too.

268
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,732
- We're never gonna find her.
- Come on, May.

269
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,943
- Cate!
- Time isn't on our side.

270
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,695
The longer we're down here,
the longer we're down here.

271
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,405
[sighs] What do you mean?

272
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,115
[sighs] Well, I'm not a science guy,

273
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,453
so it's, uh,
a little difficult to explain.

274
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,414
- Well, I got time.
- Actually, you don't.

275
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,793
- What are you talking about?
- I told you.

276
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,379
I've been here before and I made it back.

277
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,464
[monitor beeping]

278
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,286
Do you know what your name is?

279
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,912
Leland.

280
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:14,918
Leland Lafayette Shaw III.

281
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,256
- What is your rank and serial number?
- Do you know where you are?

282
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,508
- What happened? What is Project Monarch?
- How did you get here?

283
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,969
- What is Operation Hourglass?
- Do you know where you are?

284
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,307
- [agent] What monster were you hunting?
- Get m... Get me Bill Randa.

285
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,153
[nurse, in Japanese]
Shaw's been here a week

286
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,947
and he's still refusing to eat.

287
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,450
It will become a problem soon.

288
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,285
Mmm.

289
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,257
[nurse]
You are wasting away. You must eat.

290
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:07,387
[in English] I'd like to have Bill Randa
bring me a sandwich.

291
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,640
Um...

292
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,896
- [groans] Thank you.
- Shh.

293
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,564
Though it wouldn't be
much of a hunger strike

294
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,274
if I made any exceptions, would it?

295
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,361
- [nurse chuckles]
- [monitor alarm beeping]

296
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,988
- [sighs]
- [Lee, in Japanese] You are very kind.

297
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:26,990
[nurse chuckles]

298
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,287
[Lee] I am sorry.

299
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,455
[nurse] Whatever for?

300
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,207
[shrieks]

301
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:42,881
[in English] Bill Randa!
Get me Bill Randa!

302
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,843
- [in Japanese] What's going on?
- [in English] Get me Bill Randa! Get me...

303
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,306
[sighs] ...Randa.

304
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,975
William J. Randa!

305
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,393
Get me Bill Randa!

306
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,436
- [Lee, in English] Answer me, damn it.
- [in Japanese] Security!

307
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,938
- [Lee, in English] Somebody answer me.
- [in Japanese] Security!

308
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,482
[in Japanese] Anyone understand English?

309
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,734
- [in English] Shaw!
- Get me Bill Randa!

310
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,613
- Let her go.
- Go get me Bill Randa.

311
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,949
I can't. He's dead.

312
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,619
- [breathes heavily]
- We are in a Monarch medical facility.

313
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,292
You disappeared during Operation Hourglass
in 1962...

314
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,795
twenty years ago.

315
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,550
Uncle Lee.

316
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,635
Huh?

317
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,557
Huh?

318
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:52,951
Welcome home.

319
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,496
[Lee grunting] No.

320
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:00,250
No, no.

321
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,878
[grunting] No.

322
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,857
[Hiroshi, in Japanese] Ms. Matsumoto...

323
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,901
Dr. Randa.

324
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,614
I came to offer my apologies for today.

325
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,157
[sighs]

326
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,953
It looks worse than it is.

327
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,623
In some ways, Shaw is my responsibility.

328
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,877
I have no excuse for allowing
such a thing to happen to you.

329
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,672
[sighs]

330
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,715
Shaw was

331
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,926
terrified,

332
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,136
alone,

333
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,180
and in a lot of pain.

334
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:01,103
Lonely, scared people in pain

335
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,107
can do terrible things.

336
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,027
[both chuckling]

337
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:15,158
Thank you. [sighs]

338
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,327
Are you going to talk to him?

339
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,664
He's my responsibility. I think I have to.

340
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,710
But you don't want to talk to him.

341
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,212
- [sighs]
- Why?

342
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,548
When I was a boy,

343
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,259
he and my father and my mother promised me

344
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,428
that they'd come back.

345
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,306
I waited and waited,
but they didn't return.

346
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,934
I mourned them and moved on.

347
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,689
Dr. Randa...

348
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:50,861
it would seem like Shaw
has kept his promise.

349
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,077
[door unlocks]

350
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,163
[door opens]

351
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,169
Go slow.

352
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,670
Be careful.

353
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,964
I'm fine.

354
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,885
Good, good, good...

355
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,262
Sit down.

356
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,058
- [chuckles]
- I'm fine!

357
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,811
Let me move the table. Just a moment.

358
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,189
- Elevate your leg...
- Mom!

359
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,070
[sighs]

360
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,865
When you're able to move better

361
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,407
maybe you can call the office...

362
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,911
I don't want my old job back.

363
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,080
Kentaro...

364
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,748
Don't.

365
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,501
If it wasn't the right job,

366
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:49,502
you can find another...

367
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,420
I don't want to talk about work.

368
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,881
What do you want to do?

369
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,472
I should be with Cate.

370
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,809
Why would you say such a horrible thing?

371
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,644
I wanted to stop them.

372
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,855
I should have saved them.

373
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,150
I should have been with them.

374
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,528
I should have done whatever I could.

375
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,824
How can they expect me to go back
to the way things were?

376
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,830
No one expects that, Kentaro.

377
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,044
After that much loss...

378
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:35,799
...such grief and pain and despair...

379
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:40,304
...going back is not possible.

380
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,058
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,644
It's not your fault, Mom.

382
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,063
Mm-hmm.

383
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,524
I meant...

384
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,195
...I'm sorry that you have to
feel this at all.

385
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,822
But Kentaro...

386
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,912
You must let yourself feel it.

387
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,372
[sighs]

388
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,292
I don't know what to do.

389
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,253
Mmm.

390
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:15,756
Yes, you do.

391
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:18,841
But that woman said...

392
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,637
When have you ever done
what you've been told?

393
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,432
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles, sniffles]

394
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:27,142
[cries]

395
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:28,184
Yeah, you're right.

396
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,895
[chuckles]

397
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,863
[hip-hop music playing]

398
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,767
[in English] It's a signal! It's a signal!

399
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,102
[Tim] What is a signal?

400
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,189
The gamma burst. Th-The first... Okay.

401
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,816
Every time Shaw's
imploded another rift point,

402
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,985
we get more gamma rays all over the world, right?

403
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,529
Yeah. Big, noisy, chaotic,
and they're getting stronger...

404
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,657
Barnes, all 12 of them
seem like they're ready to erupt.

405
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:28,202
Yes, right, right, but not the first one.

406
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,162
That signal remained constant.

407
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:34,585
So I crushed it down
so that I could see all of it, and look.

408
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,212
When you zoom out, there's a pattern.

409
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,966
[stammers] Where...
Where is it coming from?

410
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,217
It's a message.

411
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,137
Somebody's sending us a message.

412
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,187
- [monitor beeping]
- [machinery clicks]

413
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,564
[sighs]

414
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,278
[breathes heavily]

415
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:08,577
[groans]

416
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,373
Is she okay?

417
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,335
She will be.

418
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,128
[groans] Good.

419
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,506
They sent you in here to talk to me, huh?

420
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,798
Think I'll open up to you?

421
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,468
Yes. You don't have to, of course.

422
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:29,096
Why is Monarch treating me
like I'm a prisoner?

423
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,308
No one's entirely sure if you are safe.

424
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,519
Hmm. Safe?

425
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,938
Not contagious or radioactive...

426
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,272
Or a Russian plant.

427
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,858
[chuckles]

428
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,406
- But you don't believe that.
- Of course not.

429
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,700
You're my Uncle Lee.

430
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,163
They just wanna know what happened to you,
and how.

431
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:58,084
Your survival, your age, defies logic.

432
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,585
And beyond logic...

433
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,673
[chuckles] Lies truth.

434
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,676
Some things never change, huh?

435
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,136
Not even at Monarch.

436
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:14,058
If I tell you the truth,
you're just gonna think I'm crazy.

437
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,311
If you keep it to yourself,
it was all for nothing.

438
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,398
[beeping continues]

439
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,234
[breathes heavily]

440
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,820
- [breathes heavily]
- [crew clamoring]

441
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,283
[breathing heavily]

442
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,327
- [clamoring, shouting]
- [roars]

443
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:41,003
We experienced an uncontrolled flight
into terrain.

444
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:45,716
[grunts, breathes heavily]

445
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,136
[breathing heavily]

446
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:02,274
<i>Ben... Ben was down on arrival.</i>

447
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,652
So we began planned EVA.

448
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,946
[radio static]

449
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,948
<i>While attempting to contact
mission control,</i>

450
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,410
<i>we began our recon of the landing site.</i>

451
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,707
- [monitor beeping rapidly]
- And then...

452
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,962
something happened.

453
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:31,636
<i>We encountered
a massive unknown terrestrial organism.</i>

454
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:33,763
I called for immediate evacuation.

455
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:35,098
[screams]

456
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:40,604
<i>Local phenomena made our egress...</i>

457
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,024
difficult.

458
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:45,776
- [screeching]
- [grunting]

459
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,279
[screams]

460
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:55,619
And then... the next thing I remember...

461
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:08,757
I was here.

462
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:13,386
They found you in the woods
outside of Higashizumo.

463
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,346
Inside it, there's a shrine.

464
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,975
They said it's the boundary between
the worlds of the living and the dead.

465
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,935
We found a rift in there.

466
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,228
"Mythography."

467
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:27,734
Your dad would've liked that.

468
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,612
He was right, Hiro.

469
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,864
Bill Randa was right.

470
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,242
What exactly was my father right about?

471
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:37,451
About everything.

472
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,829
Their world and ours.

473
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,955
Their balance.

474
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,500
[stammers] I think you are confused.

475
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,460
My father was crazy.

476
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,174
After he lost my mother and then you...

477
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:54,678
he lost himself.

478
00:34:55,846 --> 00:35:01,226
Monarch is moving you to a secure facility
for observation and study.

479
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:02,977
Study?

480
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:05,647
It looks and feels like a retirement home.

481
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,065
I think you'll be comfortable there.

482
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,570
No, wait, wait, wait. You can't...
Wait, Hiro... Hiro. Stop. Stop.

483
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,947
We can do this together.

484
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:15,616
We can figure it out.

485
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,951
You and me.

486
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,872
- We can do it.
- "We" are not doing anything.

487
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:25,374
300,000 years...

488
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:28,544
From the cradle of a civilization
to the moon...

489
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:32,508
We lived with the Titans until you three.

490
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,262
Some beasts
are best left undisturbed. I'm sorry.

491
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,268
This is your legacy.

492
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,523
This is your family business.

493
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:55,071
I buried that family
in three empty boxes a long time ago.

494
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,741
The madness
that devoured my childhood... [grunts]

495
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,995
Wasn't madness.

496
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,457
Then it was a choice.

497
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,418
Maybe that makes it worse.

498
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,645
[narrator 1] The pregnant macaque
has another reason to visit the onsen:

499
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:28,772
<i>pain relief.</i>

500
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,607
<i>A long soak in the natural hot spring</i>

501
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,026
<i>is exactly what
this soon-to-be mother needs</i>

502
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:36,613
<i>after a long day in the Japanese Alps.</i>

503
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,285
<i>Gestation will last
about five and a half months,</i>

504
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,830
<i>with the majority occurring
during the wintertime.</i>

505
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,833
[narrator 2]
The beetle's adventure now begins,

506
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:55,716
<i>as it searches for sources of pollen,
nectar, or its favorite, the rose.</i>

507
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,301
<i>With distinct marking...</i>

508
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:01,012
[reporter] We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

509
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,765
- [crowd shouting, clamoring]
- [Godzilla roaring]

510
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,039
[May] Oh, my God.

511
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,876
Yeah. Well, now you know.

512
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:34,796
You lost a lot of years
of your life. [sniffles]

513
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:40,885
Oh, I don't know. I don't think
I lost years, May. [sniffles]

514
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:45,557
I mean, if we find some way
to get you home...

515
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,561
[sighs] ...and what happened to me
doesn't happen to you,

516
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,856
well, then I'd say it was worth it.

517
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:59,403
Don't let this get to your head,
but you look good for 90-whatever.

518
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,989
That's what everybody tells me.

519
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,074
- [sighs]
- Cate! [echoing]

520
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,575
Where is she?

521
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:07,496
Cate! [sighs]

522
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:12,459
- Cate!
- Cate!

523
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,462
Cate!

524
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:31,770
Kentaro.

525
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,399
[in Japanese] Well, look who it is.

526
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,360
Back from the dead again?

527
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,571
How are you?

528
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,574
I just came back to Tokyo.

529
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,075
I haven't had time
to reach out to your mother...

530
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:50,622
More important things to do than to check
that we made it out of the desert alive?

531
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:51,999
We understand.

532
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,168
What are you doing here?

533
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,587
I was just leaving.

534
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:57,880
You?

535
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,715
Trying to continue my work.

536
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,341
Something went wrong in the desert,

537
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,261
and I need to know why.

538
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:08,264
Which will be considerably more difficult
if you avail yourself of my files.

539
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,017
How did you even get in here?

540
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:12,936
I got the keys from Cate.

541
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,981
What were you two doing
out there in the desert?

542
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:17,982
How did you find out I was there...

543
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,818
We were looking for you, Dad.

544
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,321
We thought you were dead.

545
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,659
I suppose I have a lot to explain
to you both.

546
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,245
How would you even start?

547
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:31,955
Kentaro...

548
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,540
...you were never meant
to know about her.

549
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,833
About that part of my life.

550
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:36,960
Too late.

551
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,589
What do you hope to accomplish with those?

552
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,966
I want my own answers.

553
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,301
And Monarch won't help anymore,

554
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,012
so I have to figure it out on my own.

555
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,056
It's no wonder you're angry.

556
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,641
I know I've hurt you both.

557
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:52,559
But...

558
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,186
...what you're looking for
is not in there.

559
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,312
If I could just talk to you
and your sister, I could...

560
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,480
I said it's too late for that!

561
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,941
What is too late?!

562
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,365
[sobs]

563
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,368
Cate died, Dad.

564
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,295
[sighs]

565
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,508
That can't be true.

566
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,887
You're saying that to hurt me.

567
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:32,432
I hurt you, you're trying to hurt me back.

568
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,685
Please tell me it's not...

569
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,191
Please tell me it's not...

570
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,405
[cries]

571
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:49,575
[in English] Oh, God! [sobs]

572
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:51,743
[in Japanese] What have I done?

573
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,453
[cries]

574
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:57,165
If you weren't

575
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,791
a sad, lying, secret little man

576
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,086
who kept running away from her,

577
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,839
Cate never would've
come barging into my life!

578
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:05,882
[breathes shakily]

579
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:07,217
This is your fault!

580
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:28,405
[breathes shakily, grunts]

581
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:33,202
[grunts, groans]

582
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,166
[groans, breathing heavily]

583
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,932
[grunts]

584
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,018
[whimpering, panting]

585
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:04,775
[grunting continues]

586
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:11,365
[breathes shakily, gasps]

587
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:15,702
[whimpers]

588
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,419
[breathing shakily]

589
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,268
[groaning]

590
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,312
[whimpering]

591
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,278
[grunts]

592
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:56,909
[grunts, squeals]

593
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,495
- [whimpering]
- [roaring]

594
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,748
[growls, squealing]

595
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,626
[panting]
