1
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,941
I know what this is.

2
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,030
[chuckles] You think you can intimidate me
with all this secret "black ops" bullshit?

3
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,283
[scoffs]

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
Good luck.

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,012
[yelling]

6
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,476
Hey! [breathes heavily]

7
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,312
[yelling] Where is Colonel Shaw?

8
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,484
I know you guys can hear me!
[breathes heavily]

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,195
[in Japanese]
I want to talk to someone in charge!

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,739
My father is

11
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,157
Hiroshi Randa!

12
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,784
Randa!

13
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,469
[door beeps, opens]

14
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,515
[in English] Feeling better?

15
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,603
I can still count to ten on my toes.
[sighs]

16
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,605
You're very lucky we rescued you
when we did.

17
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,690
You didn't.

18
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,734
- Kentaro did.
- What were you doing out there?

19
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,030
I assume you were following the data
on our stolen files.

20
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,617
We couldn't recover anything.

21
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,619
Maybe you're not as good as you think.

22
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,497
But a smart girl like you
would have a backup, no?

23
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,376
- Out there in the ether.
- Shouldn't you be off

24
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,754
chasing big, scary monsters or something?

25
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,716
You know, there's one not too far
from here.

26
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,720
We have a team in place.

27
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,055
They've never seen anything like it.
[sighs]

28
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:48,770
You know, traditionally,
when someone discovers a new species,

29
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,565
they get to name it for themselves.

30
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,152
But we have a dilemma here.

31
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,155
Should we call it...

32
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,660
Titanus May Hewitt?

33
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,662
Or...

34
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,831
is it...

35
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,254
Lyra Mateo of Tacoma, Washington?

36
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,135
That picture doesn't really look like you.

37
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,984
It's not crazy to think
we could help each other.

38
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:43,492
Like I said, it's always good
to have a backup, no?

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,332
[door lock clicks]

40
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,761
[door opens]

41
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,681
The Randa children know nothing.

42
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,767
W-Wait. Hang... Hang on a sec.
No, no, no. That-that's-that's...

43
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:13,480
N-No, they...
they are Hiroshi Randa's kids.

44
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,400
They are Bill and Keiko Randa's grandkids.

45
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,610
We're treating them
like they're criminals.

46
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,696
Says the man who tried to abduct them.

47
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,489
Okay. Mistakes were made.

48
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:27,286
She's a schoolteacher, okay?
No record. The son is "an artist."

49
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,370
What about her?

50
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,123
[agent] This one is interesting.

51
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,834
From the way she swept her apartment,
she knows how to disappear.

52
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,420
Why?

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,046
What is she hiding from?

54
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,717
Unclear. There's no outstanding warrants.
No one seems to be looking for her.

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,844
At least, not officially.

56
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,554
So, what do we do with them?

57
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,644
This organization is in their blood.
We-We can teach them who they are.

58
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,563
You don't mean recruit them?

59
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,565
Monarch is their legacy.

60
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,444
Legacy hasn't served people well
around here, has it?

61
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,740
You end up dead... or close to it.

62
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,617
Well, he's right about one thing.

63
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,076
They're looking for something.

64
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,163
It has to do with their father.
So, fine, it has to do with Monarch.

65
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,916
And I guess they're not going to give up,
right?

66
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,587
So I say we put them on a long leash,
see where they lead us.

67
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,755
What about him?

68
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,303
[sighs]

69
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,056
He's my problem now.

70
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,060
[engine hums]

71
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,980
[engine stops]

72
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,482
[footsteps approaching]

73
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,412
Hi.

74
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,456
Why don't you guys go ahead
and come on out? Um...

75
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,084
Please do watch your step though.
It's slippery.

76
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,884
Passports.

77
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,762
[clears throat]

78
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,223
New and clean.

79
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,728
And, uh, plane tickets, money, phones.

80
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,063
Courtesy of Monarch.

81
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,066
I'm, uh, very sorry about all of this.

82
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,442
- Prick.
- Asshole.

83
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm genuinely sorry for your loss.

84
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,448
Aw. Thank you, prick-asshole.

85
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,414
What do you think?

86
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:40,502
That you're on some, uh, righteous crusade
to uncover the truth, huh?

87
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,881
Wake up!

88
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,050
You stuck your noses
in shit you don't understand.

89
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,553
You are goddamn lucky to be alive.

90
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,847
So take your shiny new passports
and go home.

91
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,933
I've already used
what little influence I have

92
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,226
to cover your asses this time.

93
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,770
Don't expect it to happen again.

94
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,941
[engine starts]

95
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,904
[breathes heavily]

96
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,072
- How was that? [sighs]
- You're learning.

97
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,227
"I'm sorry for your loss." Like they care.

98
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,062
Clearly not. Basic economy.

99
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,274
Hey, what time is this flight boarding?

100
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,861
Tokyo.

101
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,530
Wowee.

102
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,031
- That's a ways from here.
- Mm-hmm.

103
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,075
How did you enjoy your time in Alaska?

104
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,078
I didn't. And that'll be reflected
in my Tripadvisor review.

105
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,204
Two stars tops.

106
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,289
Wait, wait, wait. You're leaving?

107
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:03,126
Yeah. You heard the man.
We have lives to get back to.

108
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,461
What life?

109
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,380
In Tokyo? The one you said I destroyed.

110
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,841
I have to do...

111
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,469
Stop it.
Is there a bar anywhere, somewhere?

112
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,721
It's not open yet.

113
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,806
One star.

114
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,518
Excuse me. Just...

115
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,312
Sorry.

116
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,273
- What about Colonel Shaw?
- What about him?

117
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,359
Everything he said turned out to be true.
He knew our father was still alive.

118
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,862
No. No, he did not. And neither do you.

119
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,322
- But we don't know that he's dead either.
- [sighs]

120
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,157
Not anymore.

121
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,952
I'm not stopping.
I need to know what happened to him.

122
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,036
Okay. So what now?

123
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,749
Monarch may know how to find the Titans,
but they don't know how to find Dad.

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,586
[stammers] Do we?
I already searched his office an...

125
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,421
Not the one in San Francisco.

126
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,089
Backup family. Backup office.

127
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,799
Worth a shot, right?

128
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,969
[Cate] I'm assuming you have
a copy of the files

129
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,387
in the cloud somewhere, May.

130
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,724
Y'all can have the files.

131
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,728
- But they could get you killed.
- [Cate] Or you.

132
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,229
We can't split up.

133
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,065
[Cate] We need you.

134
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,996
[projector whirring]

135
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,874
[whirring stops]

136
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,881
[whirring]

137
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,682
[scoffs]

138
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,312
[whirring stops]

139
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,858
[whirring]

140
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,285
[whirring stops]

141
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,498
Ah. [chuckles]

142
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,875
[door beeps, opens]

143
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,339
How's it going, Lee?

144
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,884
Deputy Director Verdugo.

145
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,928
I should have known.

146
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,806
How is the view from the almost top?

147
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,307
[chuckles]

148
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,810
Almost high enough.

149
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,687
Well, you're young.

150
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,771
Life's long.

151
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,483
[Verdugo] The Randa boy
had that film on him.

152
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,569
I'd never seen it.

153
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,864
We stand on the shoulders of giants.

154
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,699
[chuckles] It's kinda funny.

155
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,201
I mean, feels a little more
like you're sitting on them, you know?

156
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,329
Weighing them down,
doing what Monarch does best.

157
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,874
And what's that, Colonel?

158
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,000
Nothing.

159
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,503
Absolutely nothing.

160
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,885
And traipsing around the globe
with Hiroshi Randa's kids,

161
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,136
that's doing something?

162
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,680
Those kids have already survived
more situations

163
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,141
than half the people you got
working in your field out there.

164
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,268
And you nearly got them killed.

165
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,353
Oh, they're a lot tougher than you think.

166
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,564
Mmm. Not so much.

167
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,483
They're scared. They're gullible.

168
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,612
- Chatty.
- [chuckles] Stop.

169
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,822
They don't know anything.
I made sure of that.

170
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:19,948
And you already know it.

171
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,123
[Verdugo] You ever think
Hiroshi had a reason

172
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,167
for not telling his kids what he did here?

173
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,297
Maybe he didn't want this life for them.

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,883
I have thought about that, actually.
Quite a lot.

175
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,677
I'll ask him when I see him.

176
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,933
I'm assuming you don't mean
in the afterlife.

177
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,100
No.

178
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,395
- You're not going anywhere.
- And you're not getting anywhere, are you?

179
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,607
Deputy... Director.

180
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,868
You say he helped found Monarch.
But that was in the '50s.

181
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,496
Forties actually,
though he came a few years later.

182
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,541
So he should be, what? Ninety, at least?
How does he look like that?

183
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,587
There's rumors of a mission gone bad.
But it's classified.

184
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,631
Who is he now?

185
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,592
How did he go
straight from an old folks home

186
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:24,304
to finding a Titan no one
in the entire organization knew existed?

187
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,933
What does he know?
And don't tell me it's all in the files.

188
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,481
Probably is. [clears throat]

189
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,291
The car will be here in ten minutes.

190
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,834
[announcer] Attention, all passengers.

191
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,878
[narrator on television]
In uncertain times,

192
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,548
when unspeakable disasters strike
without warning,

193
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,425
the lucky might survive...

194
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,178
- [siren wails]
- ...but the smart will thrive.

195
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,183
Straata Secure Homes is a below-ground,
multi-level luxury living galleria,

196
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,311
offering titanium-forged
subterranean safety

197
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,479
from our violent, unstable world...

198
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,315
But who wants to live in a custom bunker?

199
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,152
Tech bros. Only ones who can afford it.

200
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,660
Hey.

201
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,205
[sighs] You good?

202
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,959
Not how I thought I'd make my first trip
to the States.

203
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:36,877
[chuckles]

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,087
What? Feeling lost?

205
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,008
Unsure of what you're looking for,
what you're gonna find.

206
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,803
You know, that's how she must have felt,
landing on your doorstep.

207
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,767
- [tires screeching]
- [car horn blaring]

208
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,145
Cate!

209
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,277
Damn it.

210
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,867
I'm sorry. What kind of car did you order?

211
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,369
- Who is this?
- It's James.

212
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,162
Cate.

213
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:16,291
- [chuckling] Hey, welcome home.
- What are you doing here, James?

214
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,543
I told Mom we'd be fine.

215
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,919
But we're not fine.

216
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,505
Oh, hello.

217
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,299
I'm James, Caroline's work friend.
Pleasure to meet you.

218
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,636
These are my friends not from work,
May and Kentaro.

219
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,096
- [James] Welcome.
- Hey.

220
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,222
Welcome.

221
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,765
Uh, hop in.

222
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:32,891
I got us a car.

223
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,102
- Cancel it.
- I don't wanna cancel it.

224
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,645
I told Mom we'd take a ride-share.

225
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,440
Uh, she insisted.

226
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:45,404
And, uh, it's my pleasure.
I'm here already. So grab your coat.

227
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,780
Grab your coat.

228
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,491
She's okay. Let's roll.

229
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,285
Hit the road!

230
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,009
[James] FEMA tried relocating people,
but most didn't wanna go.

231
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,845
Hard to walk away
from San Francisco real estate.

232
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,098
Is it true they're selling tours
of the destroyed city?

233
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,352
They did.
Before the military walled it off.

234
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,105
"Trauma tourists,"
getting off on the disaster porn

235
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,192
or trying to prove
it was all a government conspiracy.

236
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,736
Sick freaks.

237
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:26,820
Mmm.

238
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,615
My mother tried signing up for one...

239
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,242
to find my father.

240
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,091
[James] Get over there.

241
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,177
- [grunts]
- [James] Good?

242
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,386
Yeah. Thanks.

243
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,471
Take care of yourself.

244
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,559
Tell your mom I'll see her tonight.

245
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,728
Welcome back.

246
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,812
Thanks.

247
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,444
He seems very American.

248
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,530
[May scoffs]

249
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,827
We're gonna go on a walk.

250
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,330
Yeah. Uh, just give you guys
some time alone first.

251
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,708
[Kentaro] Good idea.

252
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,252
You can break it to her gently.

253
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,002
Like I did with your mom?

254
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,632
- [door opens, closes]
- Wow. Cate, you're back.

255
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,887
You're back. [chuckles]

256
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,768
Oh, hey.

257
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,855
And you've brought some friends.
[stammers]

258
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,483
Mom, this is May and Kentaro.

259
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,570
[chuckles] I'm Caroline.

260
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,654
- Hi. Pleasure.
- [chuckles]

261
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,114
Nice to meet you.

262
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,198
Welcome.

263
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,451
Wow. So you both come from Tokyo?

264
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,246
- Yeah.
- [Caroline] Which part?

265
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,622
Because my husband used to
travel there a lot...

266
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,040
Mom, this is Kentaro Randa.

267
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,339
You asked what I found in Tokyo.

268
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,056
[chuckles]

269
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,437
You must be so tired,
having come from so far.

270
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,522
Why don't you come on in?

271
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,486
Oh, my gosh. [chuckles]
I'm so sorry for the mess.

272
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,950
James and I... James is my work friend...

273
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,371
um, we collect people's personal items
from the ruins.

274
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,249
And it always seems I'm bringing work
home with me.

275
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,668
[chuckles] Please have a seat.

276
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,253
Mom.

277
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,299
Um, you know, people are so funny.

278
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,593
They never ask for money or valuables.

279
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,762
They always seem to be
asking for these things.

280
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,555
Their personal memories.

281
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,098
[sighs]

282
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,099
- Mom, stop.
- [Caroline grunts]

283
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,768
- Oh, wait, let me help you.
- I got...

284
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,520
[glass breaking]

285
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,480
Stop!

286
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,400
I got it. [stammers]

287
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,572
[sighs]

288
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,875
[breathes heavily]

289
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,838
[Cate] Why don't you guys wait in my room?
It's down the hall on the left.

290
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,936
What the hell is going on?

291
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,315
Quite a lot, actually.

292
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,817
You know what I mean.

293
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,778
Inviting him in to get settled

294
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:57,072
like your husband's secret son
walks in every day.

295
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,909
[Caroline] What do you expect me to do?
Throw him out?

296
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:03,912
Have a hysterical breakdown?

297
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,831
Go for it. I wouldn't blame you.

298
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,250
It's okay. [breathes shakily]

299
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,505
[crying] Cate.

300
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,340
Cate, uh... [sighs]

301
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,431
Your father was never really all here.

302
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,101
And when you found that lease,

303
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,353
I thought maybe that you could... [sobs]

304
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,899
...find out if he was having an affair
or had a girlfriend...

305
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,192
So you sent me there.

306
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,861
- But...
- You pushed and you pushed

307
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,196
because you wanted the truth,

308
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,156
but you were too chickenshit
to go yourself.

309
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,327
Don't talk to me like that. I only wanted
what was best for you and...

310
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,829
- And this was it?
- Yes. Yes.

311
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,456
[cries]

312
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,333
Okay, I... [breathes shakily]

313
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,417
I pushed you.

314
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,878
What was I supposed to do?

315
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,549
You spent all day, every day,
wasting away in that room of yours.

316
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,259
You wouldn't even try any support groups...

317
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,054
Because pottery classes are gonna
bring my kids back from the dead.

318
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,060
You couldn't even lift a finger
to help yourself.

319
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,187
It was my choice.

320
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,816
And I wasn't going to sit around
and watch my daughter kill herself.

321
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,276
[grunts]

322
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,656
[Cate] Fine. You wanted to get me
out of my room.

323
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,866
Give me something to live for.

324
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,826
Mission accomplished.

325
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,746
We're going to Dad's office.

326
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,540
What? Why?

327
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,041
To find what else he was hiding from us.

328
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,085
We don't even know
if there's anything left of his office.

329
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,087
Well, you can get us into the city
to find out.

330
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,755
No, not into the red zone.

331
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,883
The military has it cordoned off.
They're arresting looters every day.

332
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,260
Some of them even get shot.

333
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,136
So they're getting in.
We'll go in with them.

334
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,223
[keys clacking]

335
00:21:58,944 --> 00:21:59,945
[police radio chatter]

336
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,874
[engine stops]

337
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,041
Hey there.

338
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,794
Hey. Where's Colby tonight?

339
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,046
- Kid's got the flu.
- Again?

340
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,015
Here you go. For your troubles.

341
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,392
[Caroline]
We don't wanna hold your line up.

342
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,105
- [guard] All right, open it up.
- [door opens]

343
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,232
[guard 2] Hey!

344
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,527
[guard 2] Get these folks moving.
They're good to go.

345
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,821
- [guard 3 through radio] We're good to go.
- [guard] Roger that.

346
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,574
[breathes shakily]

347
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,742
[guard] All right. We're good.

348
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,161
- [bangs]
- [guard] All clear.

349
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,791
Hope you get a day off tomorrow, Carla.

350
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,002
You deserve it.

351
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:58,629
Thanks.

352
00:22:58,712 --> 00:22:59,713
[Carla] Good to go.

353
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,173
[gates opening]

354
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,257
[engine starts]

355
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,801
[guard] All right. Let them through.

356
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,478
How can anyone believe this is fake?

357
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,190
It's easier than waking up every day
and thinking,

358
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,860
at any moment,
the same could happen to you.

359
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,661
[Caroline] All right.
This is as far as we can go.

360
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:17,791
The guards make sure that
everybody we bring in comes out with us.

361
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,420
If they catch you,
they'll assume you're looters.

362
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:25,632
No questions, no excuses. You understand?

363
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,427
[Caroline]
And we need to leave by morning.

364
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,304
All of us, together.

365
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,513
We'll be here at 8:00.

366
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,224
At 8:15, they close the gates.

367
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,601
Mom, we get it.

368
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,977
[Caroline] I hope so.

369
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,422
[Verdugo] Yeah, I didn't like
what they did to you... [inhales sharply]

370
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:08,467
...after everything you sacrificed
for this organization.

371
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,093
I think you mean that.

372
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,095
Did you lift any fingers
to do anything about it?

373
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,182
I did what I could.
It wasn't my day to run the company.

374
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,850
[grunts] Still isn't, apparently.

375
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,060
[scoffs]

376
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:24,525
You went decades between escape attempts.

377
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,693
Why start raising hell again now?

378
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:31,823
The world is on fire.
I decided to do something about it.

379
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,992
Mm-hmm.

380
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,578
Do you wanna help?

381
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,914
[scoffs] I'd like to think I am.

382
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,208
We have the smartest people on the planet
working on it.

383
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,293
- Colonel, you can stand down.
- [sighs]

384
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,797
"The smartest people on the planet"
have had 60 years to prepare for G-Day.

385
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:48,674
"Let 'em fight."

386
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,385
That's the best they could come up with?

387
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:56,431
What if Godzilla had lost?

388
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,019
What's hiding in Bill Randa's files?

389
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,606
Nothing you don't already know,
and everything you don't wanna believe.

390
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,691
Word games.

391
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,652
- [sighs]
- Is that what it's gonna be, Colonel?

392
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,445
You think you had it rough,

393
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,948
playing shuffleboard
and trimming your bonsai trees?

394
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,033
I never said I had it rough.
I got pretty good at bocce ball...

395
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,159
I swear to God,

396
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:21,498
I can bury you deep
or I can bury you shallow.

397
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:25,669
Your call.

398
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:28,005
Bury me?

399
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,008
Who's playing word games now?

400
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,219
And wasting time none of us have.

401
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:39,224
Monarch is wrong.

402
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,643
And has been...

403
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,772
for a long, long time.

404
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:01,955
[May sighs]

405
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:03,832
[Kentaro] Whoa.

406
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,635
Were you not listening?

407
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,513
They shoot looters.

408
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,515
I'm eating the evidence.

409
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,016
[rumbling, clattering]

410
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,267
[Kentaro exclaims]

411
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,650
Even if a building looks undamaged,
the attack undermined the foundations.

412
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,652
So sometimes you'll hear one
just suddenly collapse.

413
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,947
- [rumbling]
- Let's go.

414
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,267
[Cate] I used to grade papers here.

415
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,979
- [May] Was this your neighborhood?
- [cat meows]

416
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,564
[Cate] Yeah.

417
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,901
It was our favorite little coffee shop.

418
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:22,244
- Hi.
- [chuckles] Hey.

419
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,873
- I needed this. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

420
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,092
I needed that.

421
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,177
[chuckles]

422
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:44,683
[both chuckle]

423
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,855
[friend] How long have you been waiting?

424
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,317
I was up and out by 5:30.
Trying to dodge Mrs. Yee.

425
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,570
Mmm. Yeah, of course.
It's the first of the month.

426
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,490
It's turning into a real cat and mouse.
She's got all my escape routes covered.

427
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:06,747
You know, you're paying a fortune
for an apartment that you're never at.

428
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,000
And it's cheaper to live with two
rather than one.

429
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,879
Look, you don't...
you don't have to choose between

430
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:17,883
your Ethiopian dark roast
or food every day.

431
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,349
Haven't you learned your lesson?

432
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,018
Haven't you?

433
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,656
Why don't you tell Mrs. Yee
that you're putting in your notice,

434
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:44,201
and that you'll be out
by the end of the month.

435
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:45,869
[chuckles]

436
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,715
So it begins.

437
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,717
[bell rings]

438
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,899
[student] The teacher's coming.
Teacher's coming.

439
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,568
[Cate] No phones in class.

440
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:19,862
[student] I told you guys.

441
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:23,323
Where is everyone?

442
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,158
They stayed home.

443
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,369
Their parents are scared of
the giant monsters.

444
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,579
Mine aren't.

445
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,999
My dad said it's a hoax
to burst the real estate balloon.

446
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,667
- [onlooker speaks indistinctly]
- [machine gun fire]

447
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,752
- [creature roars]
- [machine gun fire]

448
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,426
All right. Phones away.

449
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,431
Chad's father's probably right.
This has to be a prank of some kind.

450
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,058
Everyone okay here?

451
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,896
- Cate?
- We're fine.

452
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,983
Today's lesson: Don't believe
everything you see on the Internet.

453
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,111
We're monitoring the situation closely.

454
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,446
Make sure their phones are charged

455
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,656
and they all know
their family reunification plans.

456
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,576
We'll let you know
if we decide to close the school.

457
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,453
[helicopter whirring]

458
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,873
Ms. Randa.

459
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,959
Are they coming here next?

460
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,045
[creature roars]

461
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,671
- [clatters]
- [cat yowls]

462
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,551
- It's like a cat lady's fantasy island.
- [cat meows]

463
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,347
Or a cat man's.

464
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:32,935
Oh, uh, my uncle is a cat man.

465
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:36,104
- O-Oh. Cool.
- [cat meows]

466
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:56,875
We should keep moving.

467
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:01,380
[police radio chatter]

468
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,341
[guard] Yeah, I'll check it out.

469
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,634
Over there. Over there.

470
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,515
[guard] Who's there?
Come out where we can see you!

471
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,392
[exhales sharply]

472
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,476
[breathes heavily]

473
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,562
[schoolchildren screaming]

474
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,525
- [bell rings]
- [schoolchildren yelling]

475
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,404
- Where's this one headed?
- North, towards the Golden Gate.

476
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:26,822
- Come on in. Come on.
- Come on.

477
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,032
Eva, come on. Just leave it. It's okay.

478
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,951
- How can I help?
- It's up to you.

479
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,370
I'm staying with the kids in the gym
until they get picked up.

480
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,997
You go ahead. I'll be right there.

481
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,498
The mayor said shelter
in the BART stations.

482
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,667
Yeah, and we will
if the parents don't show up.

483
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,544
I don't know where those fools think
they're going.

484
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,671
They're only letting buses
across the bridges.

485
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,464
Cate, are you chaperoning this one?

486
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:46,383
I can take it if you want to stay
with Dani.

487
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,467
[parking guard] Pull up.

488
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,600
[guard] You're in violation
of a federal order. Come out slowly.

489
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,477
[police radio chatter]

490
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,525
[guard] Yo, come on out!

491
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,283
I know you're around here.

492
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,118
Cate.

493
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:14,328
[shushes]

494
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,454
I got this.

495
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,998
[police radio chatter]

496
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:31,762
[guard] You got movement?

497
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,603
[guard 2] Just more goddamn cats.

498
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:40,938
Think we should start shooting them.

499
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,439
- [chuckles] Come on, man.
- Yeah.

500
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,941
Yeah, I'm serious.

501
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:50,822
You all right?

502
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,658
[breathes shakily] I'm fine.

503
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,285
[breathes shakily]

504
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,540
- [breathes shakily]
- [police radio chatter]

505
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,221
Oh, yeah. We'll be there in no time.

506
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,014
This way.

507
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
[sighs]

508
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,071
Anyone know a good song?

509
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,034
[singing in Japanese]

510
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:37,119
[in English] Lower the volume.

511
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,583
Get out of my way.

512
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,717
- [singing in Japanese]
- [May, in English, shushes] Quiet.

513
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,217
[continues singing in Japanese]

514
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,179
[Cate chuckles]

515
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,516
Tastes so good! This is it.

516
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,144
[chuckles]

517
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,606
[in English] Dad would sing
these cheesy commercials.

518
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,234
He'd make his
serious, time-to-listen-to-me face

519
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:11,236
and then do something so silly.

520
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,530
Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,285

W-We were good.
You just... You don't want good.

611
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,076
I don't deserve this.

612
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,995
I don't think anyone deserves this.

613
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:56,874

that anyone would do shit for me

behind this door? [chuckles]

632
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:25,856
At least we know where to look.

633
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:38,785
What? No, no. There has to be something.

634
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:41,163
[May] Okay... [stammers]
...the sun's coming up.

635
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,624
So, let's just remember,
we gotta get out of here soon.

636
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,084
That's not being helpful. Be helpful.

637
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,253
I don't know your dad like that.

638
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,141
I used to think this had
something to do with his satellite work.

639
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,310
What do you mean?

640
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:09,149
The orbital arcs of satellites
are sine waves.

641
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:13,987
These pathways... they're something else.

642
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:17,741
You listened to Dad when he was
talking about that satellite stuff?

643
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,661
I teach science to middle schoolers.
They ask questions.

644
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:24,248
Let me see the files.

645
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:31,755
Okay.

646
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:38,220
[Cate] These... These points...

647
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:39,638
They're like constellations.

648
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,391
But it's not a star map.

649
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,268
No.

650
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,855
It's a world map,
but he's hidden the continents.

651
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:03,579
Give me that.

652
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,419
What are you doing?

653
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:13,922
Can you hold that up over there?

654
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,185
Why are we doing this?

655
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:29,021
My first art installation was
about projected images.

656
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:33,108
How putting one image on another
can reveal something completely new.

657
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:34,610
Yeah, I remember.

658
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,414

00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,423
Yeah.

00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:09,811
San Francisco.

662
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,397
Alaska.

663
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:17,319
Africa.

664
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:22,074
This must be the path he took.

665
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,868
Yes, this is... this is it.

666
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:28,121
This is what we wanted.
High fives all around. We gotta go.

667
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,275
So, you and James.

668
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:58,944
Are you guys...

669
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:04,741
He's waiting for me to be ready.

670
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,413
I'm sorry for what Dad did to you.

671
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:12,040
Thirty years. You wasted your life on him.

672
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:13,166
No. No, I...

673
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,464
I could have found out
that he was cheating on me.

674
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:21,341
I could've asked.

675
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,636
I could have gone to Tokyo.

676
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:31,143
But I didn't wanna know the truth.
I liked having a part-time husband.

677
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:34,771
But that meant that
you had a part-time father...

678
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,233
and you deserved more than that.

679
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:50,621
[breathes deeply]

680
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:53,081
Dad didn't die in Alaska.

681
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,751
What?

682
00:47:57,002 --> 00:48:02,799
He worked for some secret organization
like the CIA, but for Godzilla.

683
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,098
I'm gonna find him.

684
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,148
So, how are you feeling?

685
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:20,609
Good.

686
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,278
Like, for the first time
since my father disappeared,

687
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,406
maybe everything isn't shit, you know?
Is that weird?

688
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:31,787
I've recently updated my definition
for weird. So, I don't know.

689
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:35,832
I'm gonna call my mom.

690
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,502
Okay. Remember the rule.

691
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:39,586
- Nonspecific.
- Yep.

692
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:08,490
[sighs]

693
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,247
I wanna go home.
Tell me what I need to do.

694
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,712
Smart girl. I'll be in touch.
