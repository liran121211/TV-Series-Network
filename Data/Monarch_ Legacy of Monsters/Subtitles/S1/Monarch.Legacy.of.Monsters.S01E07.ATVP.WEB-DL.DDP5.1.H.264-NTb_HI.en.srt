1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,405
[coughing, breathes deeply]

2
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:35,285
- [airplane engine whirring]
- What the f...

3
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,999
What do you think Dad was doing out there?

4
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,252
I don't know.

5
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,295
I mean,
he's not working for Monarch anymore.

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,841
So, what?
Was he chasing Godzilla on his own?

7
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,718
Why? For f... For fun?

8
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,720
[scoffs] I've never flown first class.

9
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,557
Do you think we will be in those pods?

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,391
Pods?

11
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,269
Who gives a shit about pods?

12
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,938
Who gives a shit about him?

13
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,690
He took one look at us and ran away.

14
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,484
Well, maybe he was trying
to get away from Godzilla.

15
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,278
And left us behind to get stomped on?

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,405
How is that better?

17
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,702
At least I got a first-class plane ticket
out of May for screwing us over.

18
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,038
Where is she?

19
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,876
She went to the bathroom,
like, 40 minutes ago.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,669
[Kentaro] What did you expect?

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,922
You told her
to stay the hell away from you.

22
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,811
[breathing shakily]

23
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,321
I've never been kidnapped before,

24
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,449
so how does this work?

25
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,505
Okay. Wait here.

26
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,220
May, are you in here?

27
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,269
Look, I'm sorry I told you to go to hell.

28
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,855
May?

29
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,734
[sighs]

30
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,405
[gasps]

31
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,375
She wasn't in there,
but I found her passport and her phone.

32
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,420
Wait, wait, wait. Maybe she forgot it?

33
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,089
May? Our May?

34
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,431
[guard] They say transport will be there
when we land. [sighs]

35
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,099
[sighs]

36
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,478
[guard] He said he'll let us know.

37
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,946
[May chuckles] I don't know.

38
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,490
Writing code is like being an artist,
you know?

39
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,577
You have your studio, you work alone,
you're the boss.

40
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,454
Mmm. The boss of your parents' basement.

41
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,915
Okay, basements are underrated. [laughs]

42
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,792
Basements are the new garages.

43
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,253
I remember those days.

44
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,089
Marathon coding sessions,
you're buzzed on caffeine.

45
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,508
So deep in,
you don't know how long you've been at it.

46
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,510
Till the sun comes up, pulling you out.

47
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,013
[chuckles] Or your mum
coming down to do the laundry.

48
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,099
[chuckles]

49
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,269
Here we go.

50
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,690
What?

51
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,232
The end of the second bottle.

52
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,736
It's when you give your big sales pitch
and tell me how brilliant I am

53
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,991
and how I'm wasting my talent
when I could be saving the world at AET.

54
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,076
And the money.

55
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,828
- Of course, there's money.
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,830
So it's not your first rodeo then.

57
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,749
No, but this is by far
one of the best meals.

58
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,547
Well, you missed the most
important part where, quite frankly...

59
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,135
girl, I'm tired. [chuckles]

60
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,053
[chuckles]

61
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,308
And I know you are too,
of being the only one.

62
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,899
Look, you are brilliant,
and you can work anywhere.

63
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,446
But I think the future looks better

64
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,742
if you create it with me.

65
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,789
And, girl, there is a lot of money.

66
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,836
Cheers.

67
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,838
You check in with airport security,

68
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,715
and I'm gonna see
if she checked in for a flight.

69
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,592
This isn't your classroom, Ms. Randa.

70
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,720
Well, I'm still the older sibling,
so deal with it.

71
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,598
No way.

72
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,976
You!

73
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,269
You... Where is she?

74
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,437
[grunts]

75
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,813
What did you do with her?

76
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,901
Damn it! [pants]

77
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:48,158
I have had a very weird day.

78
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,538
So, maybe you could just
take it a little easy, okay?

79
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Thank you.

80
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,707
Where is May?

81
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,877
[Tim panting]

82
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,548
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for us?

83
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,508
[sighs, sniffs]

84
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,219
Actually, I'm, uh, trying to get hydrated,

85
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,763
figure out a way
to get the hell out of here.

86
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,098
How are you?

87
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,517
You came after us with guns.

88
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,812
Uh, no. We came after Shaw,
and you were supposed to go home.

89
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,105
Remember that?

90
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,315
What about the deal May made
with your partner?

91
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,609
Wha... What deal? What?

92
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,988
The deal. You know what I'm talking about.

93
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,785
Look, my partner and I,
we're having some issues.

94
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,161
Issues? Issues?

95
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,207
People died out there.
Is that who you people are?

96
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,168
Thank you.

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,463
No, that is not who we are.

98
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,636
Look, your grandparents, they created
something extraordinary in Monarch.

99
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,931
They were fearless enough to believe

100
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:59,520
that the world is so much more vast
than we could possibly imagine.

101
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,859
And they were humble enough
to accept our tiny place in it.

102
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:10,574
Your... Y-Your father,
he opened my eyes to that world.

103
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,579
What was he doing out there?

104
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,789
What do you mean?

105
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,166
He-He was here?

106
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,752
Was. He ran off.

107
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,128
He had some machine set up.

108
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,422
[breathes shakily]
And then Godzilla woke up and...

109
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,217
But wait... [stutters] ...what machine?

110
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,513
Is that what he was doing?

111
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,724
Was he trying to wake up Godzilla?

112
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,061
No. Your father spent his life
trying to prevent

113
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,188
something like G-day from happening.

114
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,235
I believe that
he's trying to prevent the next one.

115
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,697
Prove it.

116
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,824
Monarch seems to be plugged in
all over the world.

117
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,494
So, help us find May...

118
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,540
and we'll help you find Shaw.

119
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,334
Excuse us. We're... We're gonna go talk.

120
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,253
Brother-sister stuff.

121
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,046
[cell phone chimes]

122
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,050
Brother-sister stuff?

123
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,260
You're asking him for help?

124
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,179
Our options feel
kind of limited right now.

125
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,305
They're gonna wanna find Dad.

126
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,598
I don't wanna find Dad.

127
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,810
We don't even know what he was
doing out there or why he ran off.

128
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,271
Kentaro, we can't just quit now.

129
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,273
Yes, I can.

130
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,317
I started this crazy quest thinking
that he might be able to explain this.

131
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,362
I don't believe that anymore.

132
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,032
- [Verdugo] Where the hell are you?
- I am, uh...

133
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,829
Well, I'm at... I'm at the airport
in Algeria still, I think.

134
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,955
<i>Where's Sabitha?</i>

135
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,874
We can't contact anyone on the team.

136
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,084
<i>Uh, no, you wouldn't be able to
because they're, uh...</i>

137
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,544
[clicks tongue] they're gone.

138
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,964
Uh, Sabitha, the whole team, really.

139
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,508
<i>They're... They're... They're gone.</i>

140
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,595
What happened?

141
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,346
<i>Godzilla happened, actually.</i>

142
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,266
<i>He was, um... He was here.</i>

143
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,234
You're, uh... [sighs] You're sure?

144
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,611
Kind of hard to miss.

145
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,987
Majestic, terrifying.

146
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,323
Stay where you are.
I'm sending a team to bring you in.

147
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,657
<i>No, I can't. I...</i>

148
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,742
Why not?

149
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,369
The Randa kids are here.
I need to help them do something first.

150
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,830
Also, I might need to piggyback
some Monarch resources.

151
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,707
<i>I don't have any resources to piggyback.</i>

152
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,461
Get your ass on a plane and report
to the nearest Monarch base now.

153
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>If Godzilla's on the move,
we need a full debrief.</i>

154
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,757
[groans] He was huge.

155
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,800
He appeared out of nowhere

156
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,595
and then he disappeared...
guess what... into nowhere.

157
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,056
So, consider yourself briefed.

158
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,098
Consider yourself suspended.

159
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,558
<i>I'm suspended? Okay, great.</i>

160
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,228
<i>Then I can speak freely because
I think that you should hear this.</i>

161
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:49,273
Had you not treated these kids
like criminals, like I said,

162
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:54,028
then they might have led us to Godzilla
instead of running to Shaw.

163
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,947
<i>That's why I have to help them.</i>

164
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,323
[sighs] Help them do what?

165
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,700
I have to help them
find their friend May Hewitt.

166
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,120
They... They think that we kidnapped her.

167
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,164
We didn't kidnap her, did we?

168
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,792
Not that I'm aware of.

169
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,546
<i>And have you told them
the truth about their friend May?</i>

170
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,383
Can we please just find May first?

171
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,759
What if she doesn't want to be found?

172
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,929
Well, then she can tell us
to eat shit and die.

173
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:23,141
But after all we've been through, she
owes us an eat-shit-and-die to our faces.

174
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,686
[inhales sharply]

175
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,438
Tell me you really don't care
what happens to her,

176
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,944
and we can take our first-class tickets
and climb into our pods and go home.

177
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,603
You see that? There and there.

178
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,521
[Barnes] It's the same isotopic signature
as G-day,

179
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,733
but the transmission rate is really funky.

180
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,692
- Funky?
- Yeah.

181
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,487
[Barnes]
Not like sour-milk funky or something.

182
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,241
I'm not, like,
trying to step on your turf.

183
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,869
[chuckles] I'm, like,
a big advocate of remote work.

184
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,412
Trust me. [chuckles]

185
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,539
But the gamma-ray signatures
I was picking up,

186
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,625
they're all peaking at the Alaska Rift, so...

187
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,043
- Here you are.
- Here I am...

188
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,130
[chuckles] ...freezing my ass off.

189
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,469
Gotta pee. [chuckles]

190
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,396
[operatives murmuring]

191
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,732
[supervisor] What the hell?

192
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,444
[music playing through headset]

193
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,916
Good afternoon.
Could we have your attention, please?

194
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,795
[supervisor] What's going on here?
What is this?

195
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,672
Who the hell are you?

196
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,427
My name
is Colonel Leland Lafayette Shaw III,

197
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,889
and your base is now under my control.

198
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,600
You all may leave whenever you want.

199
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,103
You all know where the doors are,

200
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,565
which we will be locking down
for operational security.

201
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,150
But before that happens,

202
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,488
you each have a decision to make.

203
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,282
A choice.

204
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,994
Now, you can go on
as if the world hasn't changed,

205
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,621
pretending that humanity
didn't just wake up

206
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,293
and suddenly find itself
on the endangered species list,

207
00:13:55,294 --> 00:14:01,341
or you can stand with us
on the right side of history.

208
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,969
[door clicks]

209
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,262
[operatives murmuring]

210
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,695
It's Barnes. I'm at Outpost 47... Uh, 87.

211
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,739
Eighty-eight. It doesn't matter. Okay.

212
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,034
I need to speak
to Deputy Director Verdugo.

213
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,994
No, I can't hold.

214
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,470
[breathing shakily]

215
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,610
[sighs] Okay.

216
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,737
Can't make any promises,

217
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,949
but I will do whatever I can
to help you find your friend.

218
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,409
In exchange for what?

219
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,870
Just give us a chance.

220
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,789
Did you really know our dad?

221
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,500
He was one of the first people
that I met at Monarch.

222
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,585
He was quiet, private.

223
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,463
I didn't even know that he had two kids.

224
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,925
Scary smart.

225
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,554
He wouldn't say anything for a while...
you'd almost forget he was in the room...

226
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,559
then chime in with some perspective that
would turn the whole thing on its head.

227
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,102
The guy, he didn't miss a trick.

228
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:40,482
I mean, he used to write everything
down with these little pencil stubs.

229
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,818
Shavings everywhere.

230
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,367
Okay.

231
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,289
May told me if anything happened to her,
I should call her sister.

232
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,749
Can you run a search?

233
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,586
Yeah. Um...

234
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,006
Uh, I should tell you

235
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,217
we did background checks on all of you
while you were in custody.

236
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,680
The passport that she is using is fake.

237
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,518
<i>Her real name is not May.</i>

238
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,937
[Kentaro] What is it?

239
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,482
Corah,
I've been meaning to check in on you.

240
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,444
Really? I've been trying to
see you for, like, a month.

241
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,113
Ugh, sorry about that.
This rebranding thing has been insane.

242
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,199
I'm holding Walter's hand 24/7.

243
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,366
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I bet.

244
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,451
Hey, Brenda, I...

245
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:36,538
I do have to go, but call Taylor
and we'll get a lunch on the books.

246
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,749
Wh-Why did you hire me?

247
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,757
I know we had a few glasses of wine,
but I'm pretty sure I told you.

248
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,842
Your work was brilliant.

249
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,678
That's what you tell all of us.

250
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,680
I mean, it's like you snapped up anyone

251
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,099
who's ever spilled a Red Bull
on a keyboard. [sighs]

252
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,519
We're expanding. We need talent.

253
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,479
Talent. Really?

254
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,981
I'm here with Duri,
the North Korea hacker,

255
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,275
and Toby from Candy Crush.

256
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,193
- Are you too good for them?
- [chuckles]

257
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,071
Is this about your ego, Corah?

258
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,866
N-No, this isn't my ego.

259
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,618
This is about you telling me that
I could do great work here...

260
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,829
bleeding edge, you know... [stammers]
help people walk again, see again.

261
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,834
And you expected that in your
first six months, did you?

262
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:23,960
- [chuckles]
- No, of course not.

263
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,671
I didn't expect my code to disappear
down some rabbit hole

264
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,968
at the Cybernetic Neuro-Interface unit,
which sounds cool as shit, by the way.

265
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,470
I would like to work there.

266
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,305
That's above your pay grade.

267
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,058
Really? 'Cause you're paying me a lot.

268
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:43,479
For which you signed a contract which
stipulates any and all output you produce

269
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,276
while in our employ
is the exclusive property of AET.

270
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,778
It's not your code, Corah.

271
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,073
Are you serious?

272
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,079
There's a seat for you
at the table if you want it,

273
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,915
but that doesn't mean
you don't have to earn it.

274
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,251
Everybody doesn't get a trophy here.

275
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,972
It's 819. Try it again.

276
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,266
Do you have her?

277
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,393
Dr. Barnes, where are you?

278
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,062
<i>I don't know.
I'm at a gas station somewhere.</i>

279
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,064
- I was at Outpost 87...
- Eighty-eight.

280
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,442
<i>...monitoring the gamma ray bursts
coming from Alaska,</i>

281
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,069
<i>and then these people
came in and took over.</i>

282
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,030
What people?

283
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,031
<i>I don't know, but they had guns.</i>

284
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,033
<i>The guy in charge said something about,</i>

285
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:41,078
<i>uh, locking down the base
for operational security.</i>

286
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,623
Outpost 88 is offline.

287
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,751
Dr. Barnes, what was he doing there?
Why Outpost 88?

288
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,087
[operatives chattering]

289
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,344
Oh, yeah.

290
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,722
So, Colonel, what do you want to take?

291
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,683
Are you kidding?

292
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,312
All of it.

293
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:06,980
Thought so.

294
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,275
You heard the Colonel.
Let's get these packed up.

295
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,072
[agent] Hurry up. Let's go.

296
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,083
[Tim] Wait, slow down. Stop.
That's it. Stop, stop, stop.

297
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,381
[Cate] Are you sure this is it?

298
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,800
[Tim]
It matches what we pulled for last-known.

299
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,595
[Cate]
I just can't imagine May living here.

300
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,473
[Kentaro]
She didn't, but someone named Corah did.

301
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,228
[Tim]
Yeah. Well, one way to find out. [sighs]

302
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,279
I don't know. I still think we should
just tell them the truth. [sighs]

303
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,906
What if Corah doesn't
want them to know the truth?

304
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,992
That she's been hiding out,
using a fake name?

305
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,494
Or what if she's protecting them
from something?

306
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,414
We go barging in there
and spill the beans.

307
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,416
No.

308
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,751
We gotta play this cool.

309
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,171
So, follow my lead, okay?

310
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,019
[dishes clattering]

311
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,569
- [Kentaro] Thank you.
- Yeah.

312
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,864
Sorry, I don't have much to offer.

313
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,240
Oh, no, this is awesome.

314
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,367
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

315
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:43,744
[stammers]

316
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:46,038
- [May's parent] Oh, yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

317
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,417
So, how do you guys know Corah again?

318
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,670
- From online mostly.
- [clears throat]

319
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,673
Uh, then we connected in Japan.

320
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,593
Corah was in Japan?

321
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,429
Yes, briefly.

322
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,517
Uh, just passing through for work...
[chuckles] ...I think.

323
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,269
We're all in an online manga group.

324
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,439
I see. Well, that sounds like fun.

325
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,066
- [chuckles]
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,859
Did Corah tell you she'd be here?

327
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,071
[inhales sharply] No, uh...
Well, so the three of us were, uh...

328
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,699
were in town, and we thought
we'd take a chance, see if she was home.

329
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,496
I didn't know she had so much family.

330
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,832
Yeah, a sister and a brother.

331
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,461
And Pawpaw and me, of course. [chuckles]

332
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,840
So you saw Corah in Japan?

333
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,674
Yeah, uh, briefly.

334
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,008
So you all live there?

335
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,593
- No.
- Mm-mmm. [clears throat]

336
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,720
I do. I'm from Tokyo.

337
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:48,683
So, now you're here in Seattle,
looking for my sister.

338
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:51,894
[stammers] Yeah.
Uh, we're going to this manga thing.

339
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,229
[chuckles]

340
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,065
What kind of manga is Corah into?

341
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,900
- [stammers]
- Just your basic shojo stuff.

342
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:02,154
I mean, obviously Naoko Takeuchi,
Moto... [stutters] ...Hagio.

343
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,366
She's very, very big into Akira Toriyama.

344
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,160
Toriyama. [chuckles]

345
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,458
So, um, Corah doesn't live here now?

346
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,378
Well, she had her own place.
But, you know... [sighs] Mmm.

347
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,673
She travels so much now,
she doesn't really need it.

348
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,385
Yeah.
Uh, when was the last time she was home?

349
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:24,970
Two years.

350
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,682
Two years and a month.

351
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,988
I still think we should tell them
what happened with May...

352
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,572
Corah.

353
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,450
We don't know what happened with Corah.

354
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,161
Did you see her face? May's mom?

355
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,996
Did you see the sister's face?

356
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,332
She knows something, but she's not saying.

357
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:54,833
How do you know?

358
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,503
There she is.

359
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,255
[Tim] All right. Get in, get in, get in.

360
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:22,944
[Kentaro] Left, left, left.

361
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,570
- [Cate] Kentaro, please.
- [Kentaro] Go faster!

362
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,406
- [Cate] I know where to go.
- [Kentaro] You have to go faster.

363
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,158
- We're gonna lose her.
- [Cate] She's right there.

364
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,910
- She's right in front of us.
- [Tim] Not too fast.

365
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,203
It's just keep... I'm just saying...

366
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,455
- [Cate] I can still see her.
- ...keep a safe distance.

367
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,749
[Kentaro] There's only one way in and out.
How did you lose her?

368
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,584
[Cate] I did not lose her, okay?

369
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,503
We need to keep
an appropriate distance to avoid...

370
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,505
- [Tim] How did you lose her?
- [Kentaro] Is that her car?

371
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,924
- [Tim] That's her car.
- [Kentaro] Is she still in it?

372
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,970
[Tim] Slow... Just hold...
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

373
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,181
- [Tim] Jesus! God. [groans]
- Get out! Get out of the car!

374
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,519
Who the hell are you?
And don't give me that manga bullshit.

375
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,771
I'm sorry we lied to you.
[breathes shakily]

376
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,940
- Are you with the company?
- What company?

377
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,025
What do you want with my sister?

378
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,110
Tell me the truth.

379
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,653
We're her friends. That is the truth.

380
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,655
We did meet your sister in Japan.

381
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,491
She's been traveling with us,
helping us solve our own family mystery.

382
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:14,621
Then good luck with that.
But you need to leave our family alone.

383
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:20,669
She likes old tech, but thinks people
who collect vinyl are hopeless posers.

384
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,924
Hell, she thinks
most people are stupid, like me.

385
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,636
But it didn't stop her from helping me
when I needed her.

386
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,932
That's a family trait.

387
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,937
Look, we just wanna make sure
she's not in trouble.

388
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,564
It's too late for that.

389
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,900
[Tim] Wh-What do you mean?

390
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,110
Who is she in trouble with?

391
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:46,695
Who's the company?

392
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:52,576
Applied Experimental Technologies,
the company she worked for.

393
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,453
- Mmm.
- It is cake time.

394
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,537
Uh-uh. No, it's not.

395
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,706
Not till we sing.

396
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,916
[chuckles] I know.
It's pretty though, right?

397
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,502
[Lyra] Yeah. Mm-hmm.

398
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,971
[May's parent] No. No working.
This is a birthday party.

399
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,474
[May's parent] Hey. Hey.

400
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,644
I've... I'll be right back.

401
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,439
[breathing shakily]

402
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:42,750
- [Lyra] What's going on?
- I, um... I gotta... gotta go.

403
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,170
Mom wondered if you were running to puke
because you were pregnant.

404
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,839
I told her you're
working too hard to be getting any.

405
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,924
[chuckles]

406
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,677
Hey, what is it?

407
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,303
[May whimpers]

408
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,346
Corah, tell me.

409
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:59,767
I, um... I need you to... [smacks lips]
I need you to get me some cash.

410
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,228
And, um, I need to take your passport.

411
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,522
You can report it stolen next week, okay?

412
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,858
What? Hey, come here.

413
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,235
[sighs] I have to go away, okay?

414
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,987
[sniffles] I have to go away.

415
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,614
I have to disappear.

416
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:14,116
Wha...

417
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,412
I love you so much.

418
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,374
[stammers] What did you do?

419
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,918
[Tim] When was the last time
you heard from her?

420
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,129
A couple of days ago.

421
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,255
She called.

422
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,341
She said she might be able to come back.

423
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,303
She'd made some kind of deal.

424
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,891
[Tim clears throat]

425
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:43,729
We're gonna find her.

426
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,149
If you do find her,

427
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,362
can you just let her know
that we don't care what happened?

428
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,242
We just want her home, okay?

429
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,161
We will.

430
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,505
[engine starts]

431
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,425
[Brenda] Corah. Prodigal coder.

432
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,344
Brenda.

433
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:17,762
Can I get you anything?

434
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:21,390
Water, coffee, a good lawyer?

435
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,852
If I needed one of those, I don't think
we'd be having this conversation.

436
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,647
No, we wouldn't.

437
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,902
So, what now?

438
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:36,907
I offered you a tremendous opportunity.

439
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:41,160
To be a part of something great,
something transformative.

440
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,788
Yeah, I remember.

441
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,082
It was part of your sales pitch
after the second bottle of wine.

442
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,836
- I would have delivered on it.
- Oh, bullshit.

443
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,170
I saw what you were doing.

444
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,507
And you thought that you,
the boss of your parents' entire basement,

445
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:59,221
had the power, the ability,
the moral authority to put a stop to it.

446
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,988
[beeping]

447
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,199
{\an8}[beeping]

448
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,934
[monkeys grunting]

449
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,779
[Brenda] What you saw down there
was the future being created.

450
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,493
And I knew it was you
the moment I saw that code.

451
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,829
Might as well have signed your work.

452
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,292
I think I wanted you to know
that it was me.

453
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,378
Prideful.

454
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,172
It's one of the reasons I recruited you.

455
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,634
But you wiped out years of research.

456
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,885
Millions of dollars of work.

457
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:06,640
Oh, whatever. I'm sure Walter
has it in his couch cushions.

458
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,311
You're such a disappointment.

459
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,067
Why didn't you call the police?

460
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,736
There wasn't a warrant.

461
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,407
We prefer
to handle these things internally.

462
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,245
We got her on CCTV
coming here about three hours ago.

463
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,580
Monarch has CCTV access?

464
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:31,748
I called in a favor.

465
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:35,711
How do we get in?

466
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,004
Are you gonna do
the bag-over-the-head thing,

467
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,841
or does Monarch have
a secret rescue system?

468
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,846
Wait. Do you have a rescue system?

469
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,934
- Sort of.
- Another favor?

470
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:52,644
Not exactly.

471
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,784
[barista] I have a double cap for Joey.

472
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,455
[phone alarms ringing]

473
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,749
[sirens blaring]

474
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,960
[screaming, clamoring]

475
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,326
Tim.

476
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,372
It's a relatively new program
that we've been working on since G-day.

477
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:57,167
Japan has a similar system,
but we haven't actually gone public yet.

478
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,043
[Kentaro] Successful test.

479
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,170
[people clamoring, screaming]

480
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,464
[phone alarm ringing]

481
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,007
[alarm blaring]

482
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,802
[workers clamoring]

483
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,306
Mmm.

484
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,350
[stammers] Do you need to get that?

485
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:17,937
It appears the city may be in danger
of an imminent Titan attack.

486
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,064
Okay, well...

487
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,524
Shouldn't we go somewhere?

488
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:23,610
What do you know about monsters, Corah?

489
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,362
I-I know what everybody else knows.

490
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:29,073
Yet somehow you found yourself
in the Sahara desert

491
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,118
in the middle of what Monarch
refers to as an emergence event.

492
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,537
Okay. Well, why does that matter to you?
You're a tech company.

493
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:35,746
We're innovators.

494
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,832
That's why I recruited you.

495
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,836
Not to build on someone else's
tired ideas, but to see the future...

496
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,338
What, and the future is monsters?
Look at this.

497
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,757
You wanted to help
the paralyzed walk again.

498
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,843
Imagine what we can learn
from a nervous system

499
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:52,097
that allows something
as big as Godzilla to walk.

500
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:55,433
That's what the Cybernetic Neuro-Interface
were up to.

501
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:57,143
That's the work you destroyed.

502
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,228
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

503
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,396
Can we go now?

504
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:01,981
- This is ridi... [sighs]
- No need.

505
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:05,277
If this were real,
we would have had advanced warning.

506
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:11,324
Your friends are obviously using this
as a cover to rescue you.

507
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,243
I'd love for them to succeed.

508
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:19,248
You walk out of here, clean slate,
and even make sure you get your back pay.

509
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,167
And?

510
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:25,756
And you report back to me
everything you learn about these Titans.

511
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,385
You want me to be your spy?

512
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,180
Just keep doing what you've been doing:

513
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,015
Living a lie.

514
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,977
Or we can handle this officially,

515
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,522
and you will need that lawyer.

516
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,236
There she is.

517
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,948
Welcome to AET.

518
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,993
I'm so glad we got this settled.

519
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,871
Thank you for coming in.

520
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,000
[May sighs] What are you doing here?

521
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,087
May. Hey.

522
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,512
You can just leave?

523
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:17,099
- Come on.
- No. Hey.

524
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,518
[sighs] I need to tell you something.

525
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:25,148
I'm calling to say I love you.

526
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,235
And I'm gonna call again
for Mom's birthday.

527
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:32,906
Um, okay.

528
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,324
Right. [sighs]

529
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,202
Bye.

530
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,543
[in Japanese]
Did you just take my picture?

531
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,254
No.

532
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,300
[in English] I'm Kentaro.

533
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,594
I'm May.

534
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,347
May.

535
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,559
My name's not May.

536
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,728
My name is Corah Mateo,

537
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,563
and I used to work here as a programmer

538
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,150
until I did something
that I do not regret.

539
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:14,655
It's why I ran away,
and it's... it's why I lied to you.

540
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:15,782
And you.

541
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,660
When you came to me with your dad's files,

542
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,371
I thought that I could use them
to get myself out of trouble.

543
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:25,791
I... [sighs]
I didn't care about helping you.

544
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,294
I didn't care about your dad.
I was using you.

545
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,547
I was using you to save my own ass.

546
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,927
And I don't want to be
that person anymore.

547
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,681
And that's why I can't go with you
and I can't go home.

548
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:41,850
I'm sorry.

549
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,852
You have to go.

550
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,270
We came all this way to get you.

551
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,231
I know, but I didn't ask you to do that.

552
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,483
[stammers] I'm sorry for caring, May.

553
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:53,736
- I really... Seriously, you need to...
- May. May,

554
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,739
- May, May.
- My name is not May.

555
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,700
Are you listening to me?

556
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,955
I need you to get the hell out of here.

557
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,832
[Kentaro] Let's go.

558
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,927
[Cate] What are they gonna do to her?

559
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,929
[Tim] Probably prosecute her
for the damage that she caused.

560
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,723
Otherwise, make her work it off somehow.

561
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:24,976
I feel like they wanted
something from her.

562
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:26,894
- [Kentaro] Wait. [grunts]
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

563
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:27,813
- [guard] Get in.
- Hey!

564
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:30,023
- [guard] Move his head. Get inside.
- [stammers]

565
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,527
- [guard 2] Let's roll.
- [guard] Move out.

566
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,323
The Titan alert?

567
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:40,825
- Really?
- I improvised.

568
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,660
- I didn't think it was...
- No, you didn't think.

569
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,704
We're in a crisis, and you're
yelling "fire" in a crowded theater.

570
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,122
You said you didn't have any resources.

571
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,082
You said you were gonna help
Randa's kids find their playmate.

572
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,084
- Did you? Are we done playing Goonies now?
- Excuse me...

573
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:53,213
Sort of. It turns out that
she's in a bit of trouble with AET.

574
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,841
[sighs] Right. Well, that's done.

575
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:58,926
Now you have a job and an obligation,

576
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,678
- and we have a plane to catch...
- No, we can't.

577
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,182
Because it's possible we're all about to
be buried by whatever Shaw has planned.

578
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:05,934
- Did you think about that?
- Hey!

579
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:11,314
Miss Randa,
you're getting back on a plane.

580
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,650
And this time, if you wander into the
red zone, you'll find yourself in jail.

581
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,903
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

582
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:20,573
No, you don't. So stop acting
like you know my business

583
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,366
simply because your name is Randa.

584
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,037
What I do know
is that you have a Shaw problem.

585
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:28,415
You need to know where he's going
and what he's doing. Am I right?

586
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:34,046
And you're proposing a solution
to this Shaw problem of mine?

587
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,506
Okay, schoolteacher. Thrill me.

588
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,050
I'll make you the same deal I made him.

589
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,305
We found our dad's map, we found our dad,
and we found Godzilla.

590
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,226
All on our own, without you or Monarch.

591
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:51,605
You help us get May back,
and we'll help you find Shaw.

592
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:01,490
[May sighs]

593
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,119
Well, you made your choice.

594
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:14,002
Man, I used to love telling people
I didn't care about money

595
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,630
or the recognition.

596
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:20,133
And the moment you dangled it
in front of me, I bit.

597
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,971
I was pissed at you,
but I was pissed at myself.

598
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,724
The night that I broke into the lab,
I couldn't handle that.

599
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:30,227
So I screwed us both over.

600
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,897
So this is the moral of your story then?

601
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:38,068
From now on, I'm the only one
who'll pay for my mistakes.

602
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,488
Yes. You are.

603
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,367
[phone ringing]

604
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:47,743
Yeah? [sighs]

605
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:51,331
[assistant] There's a Natalia Verdugo
from Monarch here asking to see you.

606
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,048
- There we go. Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

607
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,634
[May] Room for one more?

608
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,510
- [all gasps]
- Corah.

609
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,847
- [screams] Oh, my God.
- [all screaming, laughing]

610
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,558
- [Lyra chuckles] Hey!
- [laughing]

611
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,853
- [May's parent chuckles]
- [Lyra] Oh, my God!

612
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:16,190
[May's parent] It's you! [chuckles]

613
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,744
You happy with this agreement?

614
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,747
What do you think?

615
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,669
What is Monarch gonna say
about the Titan alert?

616
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,922
PR will handle it.

617
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,381
Meanwhile, we need to get to Washington

618
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:45,469
and coordinate with the DOD
to get Shaw contained.

619
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,179
I hope your little friends come through.

620
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,685
I know that that is priority, but...

621
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:55,479
[Verdugo] Mm-hmm?

622
00:39:57,314 --> 00:40:00,233
I think that we... we should do...
that you should do this,

623
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,485
the... the PR thing...

624
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,617
The only way to do that...

625
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:15,958
We have to bring Monarch
out of the shadows.

626
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:27,594
[May] Hey!

627
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,221
[Cate] Hey.

628
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:31,765
What are you doing here?

629
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:33,851
Where are we going?

630
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,020
We are about to go help Monarch.

631
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:43,026
Monarch made a deal for my freedom
with a corporation we shouldn't trust.

632
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,697
We're not in the clear yet.
I'm going with you guys.

633
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:48,948
Are you sure?

634
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,116
You just got back.

635
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:51,451
What about your family?

636
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,912
Now I can call them anytime.

637
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:57,249
Come on. I wanna go with y'all.

638
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,337
Let's go.

639
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,681
Wait...

640
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,643
- Corah?
- [chuckles] No, you can call me May.

641
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:20,189
- M... May. [chuckles] May.
- Please call me May.

642
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:25,736
[director] Okay, we're live
in three, two, one.

643
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,948
My name is Natalia Verdugo.

644
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:35,037
I'm speaking to you today
as a representative of Monarch.

645
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:42,001
Monarch is a global collaboration
of governmental and scientific agencies,

646
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,461
<i>dedicated to the study of</i>

647
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:48,341
<i>Massive Unidentified
Terrestrial Organisms, or M.U.T.O.s,</i>

648
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,803
<i>including the creature we know
as Godzilla.</i>

649
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:56,224
<i>Now, our mission is to protect you,
the citizens around the world.</i>

650
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,309
<i>We bring the best minds</i>

651
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,938
<i>and the most cutting-edge technology
to this purpose,</i>

652
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:05,901
including the early-warning system
that was triggered in Seattle yesterday.

653
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:08,861
And fortunately, this time
it was just a false alarm,

654
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,948
and we regret any distress
this may have caused.

655
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:15,576
But I take great comfort
in knowing robust systems

656
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:19,790
are in place to give us ample warning
in a real emergency.

657
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,211
Listen.

658
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:28,465
I know that the events of G-day,
they rocked the world.

659
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,844
A world where everything that we love,
everything that we hold dear...

660
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:35,013
It just could be gone in an instant.

661
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,684
Now, let me tell you as a mother,
I share your fear.

662
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:42,229
<i>But this is now the world we live in.</i>

663
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,190
<i>Monsters are an inescapable reality,</i>

664
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:47,734
<i>a constant threat</i>

665
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,406
<i>that we must learn to survive.</i>

666
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,534
<i>And I believe we can.</i>

667
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:59,705
Together, I believe we will.

668
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,457
That is my commitment to you.

669
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:06,879
And that is Monarch's commitment to you...

670
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:10,632
<i>Thank you.</i>

671
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:15,137
Yes, sir?

672
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:18,974
Yes.

673
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:25,063
I think if she sticks to our agreement,
it could be very fruitful.

674
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:29,860
Oh, yes.

675
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,445
[computer chimes]

676
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:32,905
It just arrived.

677
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:39,411
I think it's perfect.

678
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:43,207
A bold statement
for AET's new corporate mission.

679
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,419
Good night, Mr. Simmons.

680
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,259
[sighs]

681
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,434
[operators shouting]

682
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:07,689
[explosives operator]
Armaments are all set.

683
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,198
Shaw here. Talk to me.

684
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,617
[explosives operator] Colonel,
both teams are at the safety points.

685
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,369
