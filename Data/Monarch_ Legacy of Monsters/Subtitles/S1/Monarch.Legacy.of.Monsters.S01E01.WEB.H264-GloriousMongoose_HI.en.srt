Hey, buddy.

I don't know if this will get to you.
I hope so.

9
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,091
Actually, I don't,
because it'll probably mean I'm dead,

10
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,634

too busted up about.

- Sorry, I gotta keep this short.

12
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,514
You may never forgive me
for what I took from you,

13
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,643
and I can't go back in time and fix
all the mistakes that I made.

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,771
But maybe I could leave something
for the future.

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,272
A legacy.

16
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,108

It's all about giving us

00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,778

Um... [chuckles] ...my father died recently,
and I'm settling his affairs.

53
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,259
So business, I guess. Family business.

You certainly seem prepared here.

Are you in the trade?

Monster prep. Big business now.

65
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,801
People always find a way
to profit off someone else's tragedy.

[driver] More profit than tragedy.

67
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,682

- San Francisco was a hoax.

68
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,518
They did it with CGI.

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,948
- <i>Cate, I've been wa...</i>
- I had to get through immigrations

And what, Mom?

81
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,465
You think he'll just be sitting here,
waiting for someone to bring him home?

82

<i>So we should have gone with your plan?</i>

She was just standing there!

I think she might be unstable.

Why do you have these pictures?

- I have the keys.

- I found them in my father's desk,

101

along with the lease
for this apartment in his name.

102

I don't know who your father is,
but this is our apartment.

This is my father.

Do you want me to drive?

109
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,266
You couldn't have gotten us a vehicle
that was at least somewhat vehicular?

110
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,354
You said, "Blend in."
Would you have preferred an oxcart?

111
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:51,813
Yeah, maybe.

00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,691

Well, we're on the right road. [sighs]

125
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,350
Eh, the hell with it.
Never planned on having kids anyway.

[associate] Really? Never?

127
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,940
There was a time when you were
at least entertaining the idea.

128
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,861
Well, there was a time where
that idea was very entertaining.

00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,322
Please,

130
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:45,534
don't make things awkward and tell us
it's 'cause you never met the right woman.

I gotta give it to you guys,
you make it look easy.

Raising a great kid, being able to keep

00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,213
These should give us

I guess that depends on

Okay.

We come back, proving the network is real,

is not just some insane fantasy.

Yeah.

You mean "the contamination"?

[in Russian] It is a fairy tale

00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,785
See for yourselves.

179
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,214
[all breathing deeply]

180
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,511
[Billy, in English] Must be getting close.

181
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,721
[associate breathing heavily]
Thank you, Billy.

182
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,791
- [associate] There a problem?
- [Kei exhales deeply]

183
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,793
[Billy] Hey, will you stop doing that?

184
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,170
[sighs]

185
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,381
The problem is there is no radiation.

186
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,425
[scoffs] That's impossible.

187
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,054
We detected it 1,000 miles down range.
We should be standing at ground zero.

188
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,681
But we're not.

189
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:24,563
[sighs]
The boy was right. It's a fairy tale.

190
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,939
Okay.
So, are we taking these things off or not?

191
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,691
- 'Cause it's hotter than hell in here.
- No.

192
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,776
Yes. [sighs]

193
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,614
Oh, great. So, now you're trying to die?

194
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,282
Well, Doc says yeah, so...

195
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,161
- Yeah, I'm a doctor too, you know?
- Of course. Yeah, I know.

196
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,556
[in Japanese]
She doesn't even look like him.

197
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,724
Hmm.

198
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:01,807
But...

199
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,435
...she has his keys.

200
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,395
But not his face.

201
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,190
[in English] Prove it.

202
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:13,570
[scoffs]
Where's your proof? A bunch of pictures?

203
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,281
I've got pictures.

204
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,664
This is us camping at the Redwoods.

205
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,960
He got poison oak and had these
horrible red blotches all over his arms.

206
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,922
Drove him crazy. Ring any bells?

207
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,677
This is our backyard.

208
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,930
He built that playhouse
for me when I was five.

209
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,185
One weekend he was actually home.

210
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,897
Here's a good one.

211
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,359
I bought them a sunset cruise
for their wedding anniversary.

212
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,528
Thirty years.

213
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,989
That's an accomplishment.

214
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,659
- How long were you married to him?
- Don't talk to her like that.

215
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,453
- [scoffs] I'm not judging her.
- [tenant speaks Japanese]

216
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,623
[in English] But aren't you even curious
who he was cheating on first?

217
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,376
Your mother or mine?

218
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,175
Wai... [scoffs] W-What do you want?

219
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,676
[in Japanese] Kentaro...

220
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,345
...what is going on?

221
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,058
[in English] Can you tell us anything?

222
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,187
We have been waiting,

223
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,397
looking,

224
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,653
but... [breathes shakily] ...Hiroshi's gone.

225
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,753
[keys jingle]

226
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,757
I'm sorry I barged in here.
Um, let's just forget this happened.

227
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,217
Are you kidding me?

228
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,678
Please, help me understand.

229
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,560
I wish I could.

230
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,148
Here, these are yours.

231
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,873
[Kei] I'm not reading anything.

232
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,333
Every time there's a small spike,

233
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,045
it fades away
like it's been absorbed by something.

234
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,339
Yeah. Or eaten.

235
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,635
What?
It's not like we haven't seen it before.

236
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:46,181
[scoffs] These things think the "A"
in A-bomb stand for "appetizer."

237
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,893
Come on, time for some science shit.

238
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,029
[grunting]

239
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,745
[Billy grunts]

240
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:10,956
There you go.

241
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,633
[associate] All right. Last charge is set.

242
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,260
[Billy] Uh, I think we need more spacing.

243
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,220
These are supposed
to be set at 50 meters apart.

244
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,472
That was for the larger ones.
The 3.8 megajoules.

245
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,975
- Well, that's what we brought.
- No, these are the 2.1's.

246
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,228
If you want to measure greater depth,
we get maximum overlap at 30 meters.

247
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,646
Only when we use the diamond grid.

248
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,608
- This was a circular dispersal.
- Fire in the hole.

249
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,708
Wait. Is that... Wait.

250
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,627
- Voids.
- What?

251
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:58,629
Chambers. Deep in the bedrock.

252
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,464
[Billy] There's something down there.

253
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,716
Those are off the charts.

254
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,135
Hell yeah, they are.

255
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,679
This is what we've been looking for.

256
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,807
- [chuckles] Yes.
- [Kei laughs]

257
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,227
- [rumbling]
- [grunts]

258
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,413
This is it.

259
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,294
[cell phone ringing]

260
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,256
[Cate] Hi, Mom.

261
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,967
[Mom] <i>Cate, why haven't you called back?</i>

262
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,803
- <i>What happened?</i>
- There's nothing here for us.

263
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,639
[Mom] <i>What? Was someone there?</i>

264
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,600
- <i>Cate?</i>
- Did you know?

265
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:55,853
[Mom] <i>Know what?</i>

266
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,189
- <i>Cate?</i>
- I gotta go.

267
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,942
[Mom] <i>Cate, what did you find out?
Whose apartment is it?</i>

268
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:03,944
It's his.

269
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,905
- Mom, are you there?
- [cell phone beeps]

270
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,073
Mom? Mom!

271
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:12,703
- [cell phone alarm buzzing]
- [alarm blaring]

272
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,497
[announcer speaking Japanese]

273
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,584
[people clamoring]

274
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:20,794
[Cate yelps]

275
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,133
- Get up.
- What's happening?

276
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,469
- It's the early warning system.
- Warning for what?

277
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,971
Godzilla.

278
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,103
[clamoring continues]

279
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,038
[speaks Japanese]

280
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,958
[speaks Japanese]

281
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,544
[tenant speaking Japanese]

282
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,678
- [in English] It's probably just a drill.
- How long do we have to stay here?

283
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,055
[in Japanese] We have to wait for...

284
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,848
[in English] "...All clear."

285
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,767
[stammers] What if it's not a drill?

286
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:21,021
I thought you're from San Francisco.
You'd know better than we would.

287
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,358
[tenant speaking Japanese]

288
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,447
[speaking Japanese]

289
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,075
[in English]
She wants to know if he was with you.

290
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,701
What? [breathes shakily]

291
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,663
[Kentaro]
When it happened, was he with you?

292
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,583
What difference does that make now?

293
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,252
You don't think it would've
made a difference

294
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,004
if he'd been here with us instead?

295
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,676
No, he wasn't with me.

296
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,139
- [glass shattering]
- [children screaming]

297
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,480
[Cate gasps]

298
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,817
No, no, no. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

299
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:12,447
- Everyone, it's gonna be okay.
- [children clamoring]

300
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,741
I'm gonna get you out of here.

301
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,829
It's fine. Everyone, follow me. Follow me!

302
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,414
[screams]

303
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,041
[gunfire]

304
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,632
[roars]

305
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,930
Kids! Come on!

306
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,516
I got you. It's okay. Come on.

307
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:42,936
It's okay. Come on.

308
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:47,065
[bellows]

309
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,318
[Cate] No! No! [screams]

310
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,362
- [children screaming]
- [screams]

311
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,286
No! [breathes shakily]

312
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,581
I need to go! I-I need to go, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

313
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,709
We need to get out of here.
Let go. Let me out! [sobs]

314
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,961
[speaking Japanese]

315
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,885
[panting]

316
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,433
[speaks Japanese]

317
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,282
[in English] I'm fine.

318
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,702
I'm fine.

319
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,176
[creaking]

320
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,732
Holy crap.

321
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,860
[associate] Well,
there's definitely something down there.

322
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,654
[Kei] Some new form of M.U.T.O.

323
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,781
[Billy] They look embryonic.

324
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,450
Like larvae. Almost like a nursery.

325
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,536
[associate] Yeah.

326
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:27,457
And if it's a nursery,
Mom can't be far away, right?

327
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,792
We need to get a sample
of their genetic material.

328
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:30,878
[Kei] Mm-hmm.

329
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,172
So, you wanna go down there?

330
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,635
Well, yeah. I mean,
they appear to be dormant, right?

331
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:41,680
[associate] Appears to be?

332
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:44,390
[Billy] We're talking about
a new goddamn species, Lee.

333
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:48,728
And we can't afford to pass up
an opportunity to learn w-whatever we can.

334
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,898
We can. We can
if it's gonna get our asses killed.

335
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,066
Then why are we here?

336
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,279
I just think that we should...

337
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,115
[sighs]
I have a bad feeling about this, okay?

338
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,242
Billy's right.
We're not going home empty-handed.

339
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,911
- Whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing?

340
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,955
- I know the sample particles.
- Kei, come back over the railing.

341
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,457
- Come on.
- I'm the lightest.

342
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,209
You boys can pull me up
if I get in trouble.

343
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,045
[scoffs] Okay.
We are not just letting you go down there.

344
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,172
No.

345
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:16,965
You're not letting me?

346
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:19,343
Billy.

347
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,849
She's right. It's gotta be her.

348
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,395
What are you doing? Billy, what are you...
Bil... Hey! Hey, B... Stop. Stop!

349
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,356
Both of you stop.

350
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,484
Tell me exactly

351
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,570
how much time you need down there
to collect enough genetic material.

352
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,447
Five minutes. Tops.

353
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,493
Okay. We'll do it together.

354
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,044
[Billy] Be careful.

355
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:20,319
- [PA system chimes]
- [announcer speaking Japanese]

356
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,948
- [people chattering]
- [in English] See? All clear.

357
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,533
[announcer 2] <i>All clear.</i>

358
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,994
- <i>Emergency alert has been canceled.</i>
- [speaks Japanese]

359
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,330
[announcer 2, in English]
<i>Please resume regular life.</i>

360
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,176
So, everything just goes back to normal?

361
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,304
What should we do?
Run home and hide in the closet?

362
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,560
[speaking Japanese]

363
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:03,030
[speaks Japanese]

364
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:07,659
She's asking if you'll come
have tea and talk about your life.

365
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:13,539
That's very kind, and you can tell her
I'm saying whatever you want right now.

366
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,542
But I can't imagine anything
I'd like to do less

367
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,338
than have tea with the woman Dad
was cheating on my mom with.

368
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,049
Yeah. Well, from our perspective,
your mother was the other woman.

369
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,510
That's fair. I'm gonna go now.

370
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,054
The other woman's gonna have
a lot of questions.

371
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,889
Did you get the answers?

372
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,768
You flew halfway around
the world looking for something.

373
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,021
Or what these unlock.

374
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:39,066
And all you found was Dad
was apparently a lying asshole.

375
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:41,442
Is that enough for you?

376
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:42,778
I guess that'll have to do.

377
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,240
[Kentaro] You think our father was so bad?

378
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,618
I wanna show you something.

379
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,228
Okay. [sighs]

380
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:17,938
Look around.

381
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,818
Am I looking for anything in particular?

382
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:28,322
Well, him.
He just wasn't who you say he was.

383
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,117
[Cate] Maybe you just didn't know him.

384
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:31,743
[Kentaro scoffs]

385
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,829
You gotta give it to the guy.

386
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,875
He had two families and still had time
to be obsessed with work.

387
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,335
- It was important.
- [scoffs] Please.

388
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,378
Do you even know what he did?

389
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:46,341
- Software for satellites.
- "Software for satellites."

390
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,973
Did you ever meet anyone he works with?

391
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,643
Ever get invited
to take-your-kid-to-work day?

392
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,770
What do you do anyway?

393
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,647
Let me guess. Computer engineering?

394
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,151
Something that would make
dear old Dad proud.

395
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,365
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

396
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,076
[Cate] What's in here?

397
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,704
[Kentaro] I didn't know it was there.

398
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,833
- What are you doing?
- [beeps]

399
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,711
- What's your birthday?
- Stop doing that.

400
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,296
I thought you wanted to introduce me
to your dad.

401
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,797
Show me something I didn't know about him.

402
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,344
'Cause the only thing in this room
that isn't old news to me is this.

403
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,348
July 7th.

404
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,518
[beeping]

405
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,478
What about your mom?

406
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,230
He wouldn't be that obvious.

407
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,273
Afraid of what we'll find?

408
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,069
August 17th.

409
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,446
- [beeps]
- [Cate sighs]

410
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,950
Keep that up.
You're gonna get me locked out.

411
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,538
Seriously, stop. I'll never get it open.

412
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,918
How did you do that?

413
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,172
Your birth month, my day.
Your mother's month, my mom's day.

414
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,355
It smells like fish.

415
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,174
[no audible dialogue]

416
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,512
[gasps, breathes shakily]

417
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,685
- I need to know what this is.
- It's some kind of old data storage.

418
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,855
- It's private.
- I'll make you a deal.

419
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,942
You help me,
and I'll get out of your life forever.

420
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,447
I might know someone.

421
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,034
Go away. I'm eating.

422
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,077
[Kentaro] Come on, May.

423
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,206
Have you seen a format like this before?

424
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,124
What do you think, '80s?

425
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,792
Um, no. It's, like, '70s.

426
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:31,089
You know, I can't drop everything
when you need a favor. Life goes on.

427
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:34,384
I can pay you.

428
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,138
Not much, but make it worth your time.

429
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:41,558
Pay me?

430
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,019
You wanna pay me?

431
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,064
Okay. Whatever.

432
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:51,735
Wait here.

433
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:56,573
May.

434
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:00,911
May!

435
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:02,829
[May] What?

436
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,206
[Kentaro] We can keep this professional.

437
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,209
Is that what this relationship is now?

438
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,294
Transactional?

439
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,463
Or was it always that,
and I just didn't see it?

440
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:13,881
I told you I needed some time.

441
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,884
Yeah. And I-I gave it to you.

442
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,680
You don't get to ghost me for months
and then show up out of nowhere,

443
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,391
treating me like tech support.

444
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,227
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,229
And why should I do shit for you?

446
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,858
And her, really? Is that for real?

447
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,609
I don't know.

448
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,489
But my father had that old data
in his safe for a reason.

449
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,325
If there's something on it that
can explain this, or prove she's lying...

450
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,661
[Cate] Everything all right?

451
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,164
I paid.

452
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,630
[Cate] You live around here?

453
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:57,885
Uh, yeah. It's cheap.
I mean, by Tokyo standards.

454
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:02,097
Everyone minds their business.
It's real. I like it.

455
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,100
But I wanna know more about this
'cause I have siblings.

456
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:10,563
You know, we dribble out every few years.
We get a nine month heads-up.

457
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:14,275
You just had one dropped
on you full-grown. This one, at that.

458
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,902
[Kentaro] Oh, great, thanks.

459
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:18,947
- I'm sorry.
- [chuckles] Nah, he's a delight.

460
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,075
I like you.

461
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,497
[sighs]
All right. Make yourselves at home.

462
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,666
You know where everything is. [sighs]

463
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:31,752
Are you a collector?

464
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,795
Uh, no. [chuckles]

465
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,716
The audiophile nerds swear
it's the only way to listen to vinyl.

466
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:42,053
They say it's warmer, more honest.

467
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:47,100
They'll drop two, 300,000 yen on some
antique I pulled from grandpa's garage.

468
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,227
Smack a fresh coat of wax on it.

469
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:52,230
There's not even science
that says the sound is better.

470
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,190
- It is.
- No, it's not.

471
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:58,611
But hey, people wanna listen
with their hearts instead of their ears.

472
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,614
I will gladly take their money.

473
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,951
May is not what you call sentimental.

474
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:08,121
Right. Because you know me so well.

475
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:13,126
It keeps me in ramen and Asahi
during the dry spells.

476
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:17,881
I mostly do, uh,
freelance coding and game design.

477
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:20,425
Is this from one of your games?

478
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,136
No. Actually, your, uh...
Your brother did that.

479
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,514
Half-brother.
And that's still up for debate.

480
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,100
You said you were an engineer.

481
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,686
- No, you said that.
- [chuckles]

482
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,563
All right. Here we go.

483
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,858
[hard drive whirring]

484
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:41,989
[Kentaro] Corrupted?

485
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,490
Encrypted.

486
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,075
So, you can't read it?

487
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,537
[May] Well,
encryption technology has come a long way.

488
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:53,542
What was military grade 40 years ago...
[sighs] ...is off-the-shelf now.

489
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,726
[computer beeps]

490
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,814
[beeping continues]

491
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,278
Hey, it's Collins in data culling.

492
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,615
I've got something here you should see.

493
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,340
[Monarch employee] Yeah?

494
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,010
What is it?

495
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,806
[Collins] Someone tried to run it through
some online decryption software.

496
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,852
It's got a Monarch recognition code
embedded so it pinged back to us.

497
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:55,770
How much did you get?

498
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,814
[Collins] Not much. Just a few megabytes.

499
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,901
Well, whoever has it is being careful.

500
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,778
They ran a small sample through
the decrypt,

501
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,988
then immediately took it down
when they saw the software worked.

502
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,034
- Did you get an IP address?
- Just a general area. Tokyo.

503
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,829
So, do you want me to kick this up
to Verdugo?

504
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,584
Uh, you know,
I'll, uh... I'll take care of it.

505
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:21,838
Are you sure? 'Cause after G-Day, Verdugo
said she wanted to see everything...

506
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,260
Thank you for everything. You were really
helpful. You did a great, great job.

507
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,441
Hey. How's your Japanese?

508
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:52,953
[Kentaro] What is this?

509
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,415
I don't know. But there is a lot of it.

510
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,251
Is that Bigfoot?

511
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:04,088
Wait... Go back. What's that?

512
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,466
It looks like that big satellite map
in his office.

513
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,306
Yeah, but what is it a map of?

514
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,766
I don't recognize anything.

515
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,603
What's "Monarch"?

516
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:20,731
[Cate] They were there.

517
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,275
In San Francisco.

518
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:28,447
Like soldiers or something.
With this on their uniforms.

519
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,326
Doing what?

520
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,785
[Cate] I don't know. [sighs]

521
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:37,496
It felt like the whole city
was coming down.

522
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:41,376
People were trapped, dying,
and these guys were taking pictures.

523
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:45,422
Running around like kids on a field trip.
Like they'd been waiting for it.

524
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,509
You think that your father
was working for them?

525
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,094
This stuff was in his safe.

526
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,722
[Kentaro] That's not who he was.

527
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,312
[in Japanese]
Why are we even talking to her?

528
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:03,731
If my father had been here with me
instead of San Francisco,

529
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,149
he'd still be alive.

530
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,736
But he wasn't in San Francisco on G-Day.

531
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:11,448
I thought you couldn't speak Japanese?

532
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,826
I never said that.

533
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:18,872
It was my dad's and my secret language.

534
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,584
[in English] I don't speak it anymore.

535
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,421
[Kentaro, in Japanese]
You expect us to trust you now?

536
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,173
After you tricked us?

537
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,177
[in English]
I wasn't trying to trick anyone.

538
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,354
[in Japanese] What do you mean?

539
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,566
He wasn't there?

540
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,777
[helicopter whirring]

541
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,787
[line beeping]

542
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,251
[cell phone ringing]

543
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,460
- [in English] Dad?
- [Hiroshi] <i>Cate, where are you?</i>

544
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:09,755
Dad. Oh, my God. Are you all right?
We've been calling and calling.

545
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:12,426
- [Hiroshi] <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're at a camp.

546
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:16,053
[Hiroshi] <i>Where exactly?
Where are you standing right now?</i>

547
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,390
I'm at the Red Cross tent
near the north entrance.

548
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,266
[line disconnects]

549
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,476
Dad?

550
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:23,645
- Dad, are you there?
- [Hiroshi] Cate!

551
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,940
Dad. Dad! [gasps]

552
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,401
[in Japanese] Are you all right?

553
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,819
I've been trying to call you for days.

554
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,362
The cell network just came back up.

555
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,364
Where have you been?

556
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,908
I couldn't get a flight.
Everything was grounded.

557
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:37,909
Is your mother okay?

558
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,827
Mm-hmm.

559
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:41,245
Come on. We've got a tent
on the other side of the camp.

560
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:42,414
I can't stay.

561
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:47,169
There's a bus heading east
out of the zone at 10pm tonight.

562
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:50,380
There are passes in there
for you and your mom.

563
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,798
When you get to Reno,

564
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,760
there's a hotel and a car
reserved in your name.

565
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,345
Reno?

566
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:58,430
What...?

567
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,766
You have to come now.
Mom's been sick worrying about you.

568
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,727
I need you to take care of your mother.

569
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:09,441
[in English] No.

570
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,025
[in Japanese]
There's something I have to do.

571
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,110
[in English] No!

572
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:15,989
[in Japanese] I'm sorry, Cate.

573
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,200
But you are strong.

574
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,869
You'll be all right.

575
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,666
[in English] I'm sorry.

576
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:28,794
"Sorry"?

577
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,714
Tell your mom I love her.

578
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:35,759
I love you both.

579
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:41,557
Dad!

580
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:44,935
Dad!

581
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:47,229
[gasps, breathes shakily]

582
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,777
About a week after that, we got a call
from the state police in Fairbanks, Alaska

583
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:57,447
saying the bush plane he was on
disappeared in a storm.

584
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,492
They never found the wreckage.

585
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,162
What are y'all gonna do now?

586
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:09,543
He wasn't perfect,
but he wasn't a monster.

587
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,880
He had some reason for doing what he did.

588
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:15,882
[scoffs]

589
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,676
The answers have to be here.

590
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,762
Good luck. I hope you find it.

591
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,391
But nothing can justify what he did
to my mother and me.

592
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:30,439
Stop. Stop. Go... Go back.

593
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:33,650
That?

594
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,655
[Cate] That's my grandmother.

595
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,117
Yeah. She died when he was little.

596
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,496
Why is her picture in these files?

597
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,084
What is she standing in?

598
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:09,853
[Kei sighs]

599
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:11,980
All right.

600
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,484
[Kei exhales sharply]

601
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,403
[Billy] What do you see?

602
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,240
Same as you, Billy. Just closer.

603
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:23,575
Thank you.

604
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:34,336
[rumbling, cracking]

605
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,509
You're already under three minutes,
so get to work.

606
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:44,805
[sighs] There seems to be
multiple sets of appendages.

607
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,850
Definitely insectoid.

608
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:49,977
Oh, it's stunning.

609
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,480
When they powered up the reactor,

610
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,067
it must have drawn them toward
the surface to feed.

611
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:01,488
- [rumbling]
- [Lee] Holy shit!

612
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,324
Oh, my God. We gotta go.

613
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:08,494
Uh, Kei. Forget the timeline. We gotta go.

614
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,496
- One more minute. Okay.
- No, we gotta go now.

615
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,874
[Billy] Get up there!

616
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,624
- You guys, run!
- [Kei shouts]

617
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,084
- [Lee] Hey, look out!
- [Kei screams]

618
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,503
Get out of there, guys!
Come on, get back here!

619
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:19,338
[screeching]

620
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,632
[Billy] Come on!

621
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,847
- Oh, my God.
- [screeches]

622
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:30,516
- Oh, my God. Go, go, go!
- [chittering]

623
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,518
[Lee grunting]

624
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,061
[grunting]

625
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:36,647
- [grunts]
- Go! Go! Keep going!

626
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:39,025
- [grunts]
- [chittering]

627
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,152
- Pull! [groans]
- [grunts]

628
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,237
[Lee] Pull!

629
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,199
- [insect screeches]
- [screams]

630
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,326
[Billy grunting]

631
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,037
- [Lee] Pull!
- [insects chittering]

632
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,332
- [Lee] Pull!
- They're coming! Hurry!

633
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:58,044
[Kei] Billy! Pull!

634
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,588
- [chittering]
- No!

635
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,508
- [screams] No, don't drop me!
- [gunfire continues]

636
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:04,342
No!

637
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:05,801
There's too many!

638
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,262
[groans]

639
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:09,223
[screams]

640
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:11,265
- [Lee] We're too heavy.
- [Kei] No!

641
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,559
- Give me your hand!
- [insects chittering]

642
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,854
- I can't hold on!
- [Lee] Reach, Kei!

643
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:17,897
Reach!

644
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:21,693
- I can't hold on!
- [Lee] Pull! Pull!

645
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,028
- [screams]
- No!

646
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:26,114
[Kei screaming]
