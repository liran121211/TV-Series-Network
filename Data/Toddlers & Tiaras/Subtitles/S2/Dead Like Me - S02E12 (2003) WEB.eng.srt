00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:16,925
AS FAR AS SENSELESS,
BRUTAL DEATHS GO,

113
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,318

WELL, WHY DON'T I HAVE
A PERSONAL DAY?

123
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,477
BECAUSE YOU'RE

124
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,740

125
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,699
ACTUALLY,
"FUCK-UP" IS A HYPHENATE.

126
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,832
WELL, IT IS.

127
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,313
THIS IS IN
A BAD PART OF TOWN.

128
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,750
I KNOW THAT ADDRESS.
THAT'S THE LINKLATER
BOXING GYM.

129
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:00,795
SOUNDS SWEATY AND VIOLENT.

130
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,059
WHY DON'T YOU
KEEP HER COMPANY?

131
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,584
I THINK I'M PAST THE
"I NEED PROTECTION" STAGE,
DON'T YOU?

132
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:10,848
I DON'T THINK I'D CONSIDER
MASON'S COMPANY "PROTECTION."

133
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,763

NO THANKS.

134
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,200
YOU ALREADY HAVE
COMPANY TODAY, PRINCESS?

135
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,942
YOUR BOYFRIEND

FOR YOUR REAP?

136
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,857
I DON'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND, OKAY?

137
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,598
I DON'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

138
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,427
MASON, I WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU COULD COME WITH ME
TO THE GYM.

139
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,515
I'D FEEL SAFER.

140
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,864
I WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO.

141
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,519
B-Y-E.

142
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:33,915
TELL ME ABOUT HER BOYFRIEND.

143
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,005
UH, KIFFANY?

144
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,310
I HAVEN'T MET HIM.

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,835
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.

146
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,839
WHAT?

147
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:45,883
WHAT DID YOU DO?

148
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,495
I MADE BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.

149
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,322
YOU MAKE THOSE
WHEN YOU FEEL GUILTY.

150
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,585
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

151
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,416
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE A REALTOR?

152
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,592
BECAUSE I'M GOING OUT
JOB HUNTING.

153
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,245
WHY?

154
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,247
BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU MONEY
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

155
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,774
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING TEMPORARY.

156
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,471
YOU KNOW, OFFICE WORK.

157
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,038
SOUNDS BORING.

158
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,909
WELL, REGGIE,
IT'S EITHER THAT

159
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:14,825
OR WE SELL THE DOG
TO A CHINESE RESTAURANT.

160
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,480
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

161
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:20,135
ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS THAT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

162
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:22,224
GOLDEN RETRIEVERS
JUST AREN'T GOOD EATIN'.

163
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,705
SO WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK,
WHO'S GOING TO WATCH ME?

164
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,358
WHO DO YOU WANT TO WATCH YOU?

165
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,099
NO ONE.

166
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,586
DAISY HAS ALLEGED IN THE PAST
THAT SHE HAS HAD DALLIANCES
WITH MEN,

167
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,981
SEXUAL ESCAPADES
WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE ALIVE
WHILE SHE WAS A REAPER.

168
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,940
IF SO...

169
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,595
IT'S A BLUNDER.

170
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,816
CHARLIE CHAPLIN,
TYRONE POWERS, BABE RUTH...

171
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,339

ERROL FLYNN,
WILLIAM HOLDEN--

173
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,605
I GET IT.

174
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,694
WILLIAM HOLDEN?YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS EITHER.

175
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,609
<i>SUNSET BOULEVARD?</i>

176
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,176
FACE DOWN IN
THE SWIMMING POOL?

177
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:04,919
JESUS.

178
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,965
THE POINT, GEORGE,
IS THAT, UH...

179
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,752
THESE ALLEGED
INDISCRETIONS...

180
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:16,408
THEY WERE NOT ON MY WATCH.

181
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,367
I AM NOT A SNITCH, RUBE.

182
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,847
I'M NOT TELLING ON DAISY.

183
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,327
GEORGIA,
SNITCHING IS NOT THE POINT.

184
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,329
THE POINT IS,
SHE SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE LIVING.

185
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,070
THE POINT IS,

186
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,856
KEEP THE SYRUP
AWAY FROM THE EGGS.

187
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,727
I LIKE SYRUP ON MY EGGS.

188
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,207
WHO'S THAT?WHO'S WHO?

189
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,643
THIS.

190
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,906
GEORGE, RIGHT?

191
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,691
YEAH, DAISY TOLD ME
THIS IS
ONE OF HER HAUNTS.

192
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:40,345
HEY. RAY SUMMERS.

193
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,391
RUBE.

194
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,262
QUITE A DEATH GRIP
YOU GOT THERE, RUBE.

195
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,048
YOU SEEN MY GIRL?

196
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,528
OH, SHE JUST LEFT.

197
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,574
SO MUCH FOR TIMING.

198
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,663
WHAT'S YOUR STORY, RAY?

199
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,536
MY STORY IS THAT I'M
A TELEVISION PRODUCER.

200
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:58,973
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN MY PROGRAM.
IT'S--

201
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,845
I DON'T WATCH
THAT MUCH TELEVISION.

202
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,631
LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE A READER.

203
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:05,806
I'M A READER.

204
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,548
HOW DO YOU KNOW DAISY, RAY?

205
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,550
MET HER IN A BAR,
BOUGHT HER A DRINK...

206
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,595
OR THREE.

207
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,032
WE MAY HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE OVER-SERVED
THAT NIGHT.

208
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:16,294
SO YOU'RE JUST
DRINKING BUDDIES?

209
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,166
NO. NO, NO.

210
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,863
DAISY'S MY, UH...

211
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,039
MY GOOD LUCK CHARM.

212
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,520
CHARM, PERHAPS.

213
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,131
GOOD LUCK...

214
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,568
NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE.

215
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,787
WELL, MAYBE NOT
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, BUT...

216
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,313
ACTUALLY,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

217
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,359
THE NIGHT I MET HER,
SOME GUY DIED.

218
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,188
YOU WERE THERE.NO, I WASN'T.

219
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,278
I WASN'T.

220
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,022
SO HOW DO YOU
KNOW DAISY, RUBE?

221
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,719
THAT'S NOT ANY OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

222
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,548
WOW.

223
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,811
DON'T CANDY-COAT IT
FOR ME, RUBE.
IF I'M NOT WELCOME HERE--

224
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:57,161
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.

225
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,773
DID I SAY SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

226
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,036
NO.THEN WHAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM?

227
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,778
I JUST DON'T LIKE STRANGERS
ALL THAT MUCH,

228
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:08,303
AND I DID NOT INVITE YOU
TO SIT DOWN AT THIS TABLE
WITH PEOPLE YOU DO NOT KNOW.

229
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,653
ACTUALLY, RUBE,
I KNOW GEORGE HERE.

230
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:11,872
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

231
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,141
OKAY.

232
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,231
YOU FOLKS HAVE A NICE DAY.

233
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,497
I DO NOT LIKE HIM.

234
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,761
DON'T YOU WANT
TO JUST SLAP THAT SMILE
RIGHT OFF HIS FACE?

235
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,902
YEAH, SO I REALLY
DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

236
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,773
FOR YOU TO INVITE RAY
TO A REAP.

237
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,688
OH, SUDDENLY YOU'RE
THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

238
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,647
COME ON.
IT'S RECKLESS.

239
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,648
HE MIGHT SEE SOMETHING.

240
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,171
PLEASE.

241
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,129
HE DOESN'T NOTICE
ANYTHING.
HE'S BLINDED BY LOVE.

242
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,523
HA!

243
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,615
YOU ARE FLIRTING
WITH DISASTER,
DAISY ADAIR.

244
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,443
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT
THAT I'M FLIRTING AT ALL.

245
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,837
COME ON.

246
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,230
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOU
IN THAT WAY ANYMORE...

247
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,188
ACTUALLY.

248
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,146
REALLY.

249
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,757
ANYMORE.

250
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,149
I BELIEVE YOU.GOOD.

251
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,197
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

252
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,967
HOW'S IT GOING?

253
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,061
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

254
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,279
CRYSTAL.

255
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,154
UM, WILL MISS HERBIG
BE BACK SOON?

256
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,285
MM-HMM.

257
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,998
I DON'T LIKE HOSPITALS.

258
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,347
WHY?

259
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,044
WHO THE HELL
LIKES HOSPITALS?

260
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,352
WELL, LET'S SEE.

261
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:28,791
DOCTORS, NURSES,
ORDERLIES.

262
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,055
PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK
AND WANT TO GET BETTER.

263
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,536
PEOPLE WHO KNOW PEOPLE
WHO ARE SICK
AND WANT THEM TO GET BETTER.

264
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,452
I DON'T SEE ANYONE
AROUND HERE

265
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,715
WHO LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
GETTING ANY BETTER.

266
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,587
WELL, IT'S THE
LONG-TERM CARE WARD.

267
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,200
THEY'RE PROBABLY
NOT GOING OUT
THE WAY THEY CAME IN.

268
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,556
DO WE KNOW HER?

269
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,644
WE DO.

270
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,690
NATURAL CAUSES
IS ONE OF THE...

271
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,954
NICER ASSIGNMENTS
FOR A REAPER,

272
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,782
ESPECIALLY IN A HOSPITAL.

273
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,131
NO CHASING ANYONE DOWN.

274
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,610
EVERYONE'S
GOT A NAME TAG.

275
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,742
NICE GIG.

276
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,833
EXCEPT EVERYONE'S
REALLY OLD.

277
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,443
YOU GOT SOMETHING
AGAINST OLD PEOPLE?

278
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,271
THEY JUST FREAK ME OUT
A LITTLE,

279
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,753
AND THE REALLY OLD ONES
IRRITATE ME.

280
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,060
THAT'S NICE.

281
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:24,281
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE
CROSSING A STREET
AT THE "WALK" SIGN,

282
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:28,155
AND THE TIME
IS TICKING BY,

283
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,548
AND EVEN IF THEY START
RIGHT AWAY,

284
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:34,639
THEY STILL NEVER
MAKE IT ACROSS

285
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:36,337
ON TIME.

286
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,167
THAT IRRITATES YOU?

287
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,431
THEY'RE REALLY SLOW.

288
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,087
GO FIND YOUR REAP.

289
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,262
OKAY.

290
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,525
HOW?

291
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:55,138
HEY, BUD,
DO YOU HAVE AN N. ROMMEY
ON THIS FLOOR?

292
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,400
IT'S N. ROMMEY,

293
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,272

WELL, I DON'T
BELIEVE WE ARE.

00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,953
IT'S A FAIRY TALE.

319
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:15,479
WELL, ONCE UPON A TIME,
YOU WERE ALIVE,
THEN YOU DIED.

320
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,307
THE END.

321
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,136
OH, HEY, I KNOW YOU.

322
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,399
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WAS KILLED
BY A TOILET SEAT.

323
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,662
GOD, WILL ANYONE
EVER LET THAT GO?

324
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,403
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH--

325
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,188

NINA, THIS IS GEORGE.

329
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,021
SHE'S COME TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

330
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,981
WE HAVE TO GO.
WE REALLY DON'T
WANT TO BE LATE.

331
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,637
OH, WE WON'T BE.

332
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,728
KATE HEPBURN BOXED.

333
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,296
ALSO KITTY LOMBARD.
IT'S A GREAT
ACTING EXERCISE.

334
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,910
I NEED TO FIND MY REAP
BEFORE RAY GETS HERE.

335
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,085
GOOD IDEA.

336
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,525
HE'LL BE DEAD AND GONE
BEFORE RAY EVEN SHOWS UP.

337
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,487
BOXERS ARE
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

338
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,014
BOXERS ARE
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

339
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,451
RAY'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

I'LL TELL YOU

I'M HOT. I CAN BOX.

00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,419
WHO IS IT, CROWD? WHO IS IT?

00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,986
IT'S KID MASON!

347
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,291

525
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,579
OH, MY GOODNESS.

526
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:42,236
ARE YOU ANY RELATION
TO THE YOUNG WOMAN
WHO DIED?

527
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,238
THAT WAS MY DAUGHTER.
GEORGE.

528
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,282
I HIRED HER.

529
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:47,720
GEORGIA LASS.

530
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,027
YOU'RE THE WOMAN
WHO GAVE HER THE JOB.

531
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:56,598
YOU CALLED THE HOUSE.
YOU AND I SPOKE
ON THE PHONE.

532
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,046
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

533
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,919
THANK YOU.

534
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:16,792
I DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE SEEMED SWEET.

535
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,141
DID SHE?NO.

536
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,970
SHE SEEMED COMPLICATED.

537
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:21,971
SMART.

538
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,061
WHAT ELSE?

539
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,236
DIFFICULT.

540
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,586
A HANDFUL...

541
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,891
BUT PROMISING,

542
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,937
WHICH IS WHY I HIRED HER.

543
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,638
WE DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS NOW, MS. LASS.

544
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,206
WE CAN RESCHEDULE,
OR NOT DO IT AT ALL--

545
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,033
NO.

546
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,122
I'M HERE.

547
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,253
I'M FINE.

548
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,647
I WANT TO WORK.

549
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,260
IT'S "JOY."

550
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,261
OKAY.

551
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:55,918
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO, JOY?

552
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,703
WHAT'S YOUR PASSION?
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

553
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,706
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

554
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:04,057
WELL, UH,

I LIKE
MAKING LISTS.

556
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:10,019
I LIKE BOXES.

557
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,109
FILES.

558
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,503
SHELVES.
SELF-STICKING LABELS.

559
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:16,635

560
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,643
SO SHE WAS IN THIS OFFICE?

561
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,037
YES.

562
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:36,045
WHAT DID GEORGE DO
THAT LAST DAY, FOR WORK?

563
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,528
I REALLY, UH...
DON'T REMEMBER.

564
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,926
OKAY, EVERYONE,
I KNOW THAT YOU ALL THINK

565
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,058
THAT YOU COULDN'T LIVE
WITHOUT THE INTERNET,

566
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:52,235
BUT BEFORE ONLINE RESEARCH,
THERE WERE CARD CATALOGUES

567
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,281
AND PAPER CARDS
IN LIBRARY BOOK POCKETS.

568
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:56,109
OH, REGGIE, DON'T PLAY
WITH THOSE BOOKS.

569
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,850
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
BAR-CODED YET.

570
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,722
THEY STILL HAVE THOSE
ANTIQUATED CHECK-OUT
CARDS IN THEM.

571
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,420

576
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,626
WHO?

577
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,324

578
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,021
THERE WILL BE A QUIZ
ON THIS MATERIAL.

579
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,719

00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,340
YOU'RE DEAD, NINA.

586
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,821
THIS IS THE LADY
WHO BRUSHES MY HAIR.

587
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:58,519
YES. THAT IS
YOUR DAUGHTER, BETH...

00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,086
AND YOU ARE DEAD.

589
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,226
SO WHO IS THIS,
THIS ROSIE?

590
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,012
NOBODY YOU KNOW.

591
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,144
IS IT SOMEBODY
YOU KNEW?
IS SHE RELATED TO YOU?

592
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,713
IS SHE RELATED TO YOU?

593
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,801

597
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:34,163
LOOK AT YOU,
DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE ROAD.

598
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,818

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, GEORGE?

607
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,528
I CAN'T GET HER TO GO.
SHE WON'T FOLLOW ME.

608
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:53,226
NINA FORGETS THINGS.

609
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,575
YEAH, I PICKED UP
ON THAT.

610
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,667
WHAT PENNY'S SAYING

611
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,018
I GET THAT.
HOW DO I GET HER
TO GO?

612
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:06,413
I'M TELLING YOU, GEORGE,
YOU HAVE TO GET NINA
TO CONNECT TO HER OWN DEATH

613
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:07,588
BEFORE SHE CAN MOVE ON.

614
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,198
HOW THE FUCK AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

615
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,896
OOH, SHE'S GOT
A MOUTH ON HER.

I LIKE TO LABEL.

639
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:22,445

873
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:01,317
GOOD FOR YOU.

874
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:03,058
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
TO END IT.

875
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:12,285
JUST ONE THING,
SWEETIE.

876
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:14,853
YOU DON'T END THINGS.
I END THEM.

877
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:17,943
YOU DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE DONE. I DO.

878
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,422
YOU'RE WORSE
THAN BAD LUCK.

879
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:21,555
YOU'RE
A BLACK FUCKING HOLE.

880
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,426
FUCK YOU.

881
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,212
YOU'RE NOT AS GENTEEL
AS YOU LOOK, DAISY.

882
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:27,474
IN FACT,
AS PRETTY AS YOU ARE,

883
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:29,563
I JUST CAN'T
SHAKE THE FEELING

884
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,435
THAT YOU'RE REALLY
JUST A CHEAP HILLBILLY
PIECE OF TAIL.

885
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,064
HE'S DEAD.

886
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:53,500
HE'S DEAD?

887
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,023
I... I...

888
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:03,989
I'M SORRY.I'M NOT.

889
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,908
THERE'S...

890
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,649
THERE'S NO POST-IT.

891
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:14,608
AND THERE'S NO
FUCKING SOUL.

892
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,132
FUCKING...

893
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:20,745
IS THERE A SHOVEL
IN HERE?

894
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:22,660
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A SHOVEL, HASN'T THERE?

895
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,139
IS THERE?

896
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:25,532
[ WHOOSHING ]

897
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:50,165
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
THIS IS ALL
MY FUCKING FAULT.

898
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,427
IT'S MY FAULT.
IT'S MY FAULT.

899
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:52,820
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
AND YOU'RE IN IT NOW.

900
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:55,344
YOU'RE IN IT NOW.
YOU ARE IN IT NOW.STOP IT.

901
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:56,519
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

902
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:00,480
UH, AND IT'S DONE.

903
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,048
ALL RIGHT?YEAH.

904
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,440
WE KEEP THIS
TO OURSELVES,

905
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,878
AND NO ONE
NEEDS TO KNOW.

906
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,708
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THAT?

907
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,057
HOW THE FUCK
DID YOU KNOW

908
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,798
THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,
THAT GRAVELING?

909
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,234
BECAUSE I'VE
SEEN IT BEFORE,

910
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,150
AND HE WAS RIGHT.
I'M BAD LUCK.

911
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:25,026
<i>THERE ARE THINGS INSIDE YOU
THAT NO ONE WANTS TO FACE,</i>

912
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:29,944
<i>THINGS THAT YOU KEEP SECRET,
EVEN FROM YOURSELF...</i>

913
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,339
<i>BUT SECRETS ARE FUNNY.</i>

914
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:35,036
<i>THE THINGS THAT
YOU TRY TO HIDE</i>

915
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,691
<i>ALWAYS TURN OUT TO BE
THE THINGS YOU CAN'T FORGET.</i>
