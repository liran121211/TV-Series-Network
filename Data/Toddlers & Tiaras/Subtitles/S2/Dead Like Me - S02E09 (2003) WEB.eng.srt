00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:46,553
UH, I WASN'T HERE
THAT DAY.

180
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,686
COME ON, PEOPLE!

181
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,862
WHERE'S MY
DEFIBRILLATOR CREW?

182
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:04,179
THERE'S CHEESE ON THESE!

183
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,791
WHO HAS BEEN MAKING
GRILLED-CHEESE SANDWICHES

184
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,880
WITH THE DEFIBRILLATOR
PADDLES?

185
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,583
CONGRATULATIONS, HAPPY TIME.

186
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,497
YOU JUST
KILLED A MAN.

187
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:22,676
THANK YOU, STAN.

188
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,642
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
DISAPPOINTED, PEOPLE.

189
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,558
WE HAD C.P.R. TRAINING
LAST MONTH,

190
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:38,909
AND WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN
TOMORROW MORNING, MANDATORY.

191
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:42,260
IT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING
GETTING THAT CLOSE TO DEATH,
ISN'T IT?

192
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,697
<i>MM. NOT SO MUCH.</i>

193
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,397
I THINK GEORGE
IS IN LOVE.

194
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,572
SHE TELL YOU THAT?

195
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,053
NO. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

196
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,185
UNLIKE YOU, I CAN
SENSE THESE THINGS.

197
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,622
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

198
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,145
I HAVE KEEN INTUITION.

199
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,060
OH, YOU WISH YOU HAD
MY INTUITION.

200
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,452
OH, ROXY,
IT'S NOT A CONTEST.

201
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:02,977
I GOT TO HOP,
GOT A SOUL TO TAKE.

202
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,070
I KNOW THIS ADDRESS.

203
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,376
THAT'S THE MILLSTONE HOTEL.

204
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,943
REALLY?

205
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,859
WELL, HOW FUN.
I LOVE HOTELS.

206
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,774
MAYBE I'LL DRESS UP
AS A HOUSEKEEPER.

207
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,602
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING
YOUR CROSS ANYMORE?

208
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:20,385
I LOST IT.

209
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,172
YOUR FAITH OR THE CROSS?

210
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,261
BOTH.

211
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,438
I WAS JUST PLAYING THE PART
OF THE NICE CATHOLIC GIRL.

212
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,918
I'M NOT,
I'M NOT THE REAL THING.

213
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,093
NO?

214
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,923
THE SPIRITUAL THING
ISN'T ME.

215
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:39,056
I'M AN ACTRESS.
I'M JUST A REALLY
GOOD ACTRESS.

216
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,406
WHATEVER YOU SAY, DAISY.

217
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:43,713
DAISY ADAIR.

218
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,761
SO OUR LITTLE GEORGIE IS
CRASHING A MEMORIAL SERVICE

219
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:48,849
TO CHASE A BOY?

220
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:49,937
YEAH. SHE WON'T ACTUALLY GO.

221
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,940
NO?SHE'LL CHICKEN OUT.

222
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,072
I HAVE THE MILLSTONE REAP,
AND SHE'S TOO AFRAID
TO GO ALONE.

223
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
[MAN] THIS WAY, PLEASE.

224
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,079
NO, REALLY NOT
MY CROWD.

225
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:04,647
YOU AND ME BOTH, PAL.

226
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,128
YOU COULDN'T FALL
FOR A NICE WORKING MAN,
COULD YOU?

227
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,260
YOU HAD TO FIND
A BLOODY ARISTOCRAT.

228
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:10,653
HE WORKS.

229
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,524
HE'S A JOURNALIST.

230
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:15,527
HAH, WORKS?
FOR HIS RICH, DEAD
FATHER'S NEWSPAPER--

231
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,833
CHA-CHING!

232
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:20,184
CAN YOU JUST TRY
TO BEHAVE YOURSELF

233
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,621
AND ACT
LIKE A GENTLEMAN?

234
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,491
FUCK OFF.

235
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,014
OKAY, FINE.

236
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,494
HOW DO I LOOK?

237
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,976
ACTUALLY,
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE.

238
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,064
VERY "COME HITHER."

239
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,544
OOH.GOOD.

240
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,026
SO WHICH ONE IS HE?

241
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,767
THE GOOD-LOOKING
GUY IN BLACK.

242
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,464
MM. YES. STILL NOT CLEAR.

243
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,032
THAT ONE.

244
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,514
I REALLY LIKE HIM,
SO DON'T SCREW THIS UP.

245
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,558
I WON'T.

246
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,561
GEORGE, WHY AM I HERE?

247
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:52,564
TO PAY YOUR RESPECTS
TO HIS FATHER,
THOMAS HESBURGH.

248
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,609
OKAY, GOT IT.

249
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,003
AND WHY ARE YOU HERE?

250
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,005
TO PAY MY RESPECTS
TO HIS FATHER.

251
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,397
THOMAS HESBURGH.

252
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,227
OH, MY GOD.
YOU REAPED
HIS FATHER.

253
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,489
NOW YOU WANT TO
SNOG HIS SON.

254
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,577
HAH.

255
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,538
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

256
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:13,716
LOOK, I HAVE ONE HOUR
BEFORE MY REAP, SO WHATEVER.

257
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,500
OH, LET'S
SYNCHRONIZE WATCHES.

258
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:16,588
GOOD IDEA.

259
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:17,938
I DON'T HAVE A WATCH.

260
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,071
[JOY]
IT'S ALMOST TIME TO GO.

261
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,420
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO DAD'S TONIGHT.

262
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,771
YOU HAVE TO.

263
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,642
WHY?

264
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,384
BECAUSE
IT'S COURT-ORDERED.

265
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,951
DO YOU HAVE ANY
HOMEWORK FOR TONIGHT?

266
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,216
I SORT OF DIDN'T FINISH
THAT BIOLOGY PROJECT.

267
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,347
THE HEART MODEL?

268
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,610
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
DUE TODAY.

269
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,309
IT WAS, BUT...

270
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,137
BUT WHAT?

271
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:48,229
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH ALL THE PAPIER-MACHE
I BOUGHT, HMM?

272
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,621
PUT IT IN THE BASEMENT?

273
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:52,276
ALONG WITH YOUR DRUM SET
AND YOUR RIDING CLOTHES?

274
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,192
THE TEENAGE GRAVEYARD.

275
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,281
IT'S NOT A GRAVEYARD.

276
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,806
I KNOW.
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

277
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,721
MRS. RICKET SAID
I COULD HAVE MORE TIME.

278
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,984
HMM.

279
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:06,290
THAT WAS VERY NICE
OF MRS. RICKET.

280
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,598
SHE HAD GEORGE IN HER CLASS.

281
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,687
MRS. RICKET WAS
VERY FOND OF GEORGE.

282
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,169
A LOT OF GEORGE'S TEACHERS
LIKED HER.

283
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,040
SO WHY'D SHE DROP OUT
OF COLLEGE?

284
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,912
TO MAKE ME MAD.

285
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,175
REALLY?

286
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,133
NO.

287
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,093
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

288
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,923
I THINK SHE WOULD
HAVE GONE BACK...

289
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,663
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY.

290
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,538
I DON'T KNOW.

291
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,801
YOU SHOULD BRING
THAT BIOLOGY PROJECT
TO YOUR DAD'S.

292
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,150
ALL RIGHT? YOU CAN
FINISH IT THERE.

293
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,196
WHY CAN'T
I DO IT HERE?REGGIE.

294
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,719
HIS PLACE IS CHEESY.

295
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,373
THERE'S CARPETS
IN THE BATHROOM,

296
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,375
AND YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE
MAKING SOUNDS
THROUGH THE WALL.

297
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,377
YOUR FATHER?NO, HIS FAT NEIGHBOR.

298
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,552
WHAT KIND OF SOUNDS?

299
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,597
BATHROOM SOUNDS.

300
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,948
UGH. THAT'S BAD.

301
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,298
AND I'LL NEVER
GET IT FINISHED THERE,
ANYWAY,

302
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,995
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GOOD AT
BUILDING STUFF.

303
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,738
HE WANTS TO SPEND
TIME WITH YOU.

304
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,435
HE EVEN ASKED
IF HE COULD GET YOU EARLY.

305
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,352
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND I
JUST GET STARTED ON IT,

306
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,311
AND IF WE DON'T
GET IT FINISHED

307
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,225
BY THE TIME
DAD GETS HERE...

308
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,228
YOU'LL FINISH IT.

309
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:15,707
REGGIE,

310
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,145
I CANNOT DO
ALL YOUR HOMEWORK
FOR YOU, OKAY?

311
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,624
YOU'LL NEVER LEARN ANYTHING.

312
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,322
YOU WANT ME
TO GET INTO COLLEGE,
DON'T YOU?

313
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,241
JUST GO
GET THE STUFF.

314
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,033
HOUSEKEEPING.

315
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,255
HEY, WHO STOLE
MY FUCKING CART?

316
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,348
ANYONE HERE?

317
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,219
HOUSEKEEPING.

318
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:53,136
OH, YES, COULD I GET
SOME FRESH TOWELS
IN THE BATH, PLEASE?

319
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,225
I JUST NEED
SOME FRESH TOWELS.

320
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,879
FOR ONE OR TWO?

321
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,663
UM, TWO, PLEASE.

322
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,883
HE LOVES FRESH TOWELS, SO...

323
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,450
THANK YOU, LATANYA.

324
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,408
SURE.
MY PLEASURE.

325
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,934
OH, MY GOODNESS.

326
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,284
WHAT EXQUISITE THINGS.

327
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,807
YOU THINK SO?YEAH.

328
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,201
I'D DO ANYTHING
FOR LOVELY THINGS
LIKE THIS.

329
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,856
WELL, I ACTUALLY HAVE...

330
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,423
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD WEAR?

331
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,513
IT'S NOT MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

332
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:25,168
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT HE LIKES RED.

333
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:28,345
UM, I'VE SEEN HIS WIFE
WEAR A LOT OF RED.

334
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,871
THEN MAYBE
SOMETHING NOT RED.

335
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,743
RIGHT.
ISN'T THAT THE POINT?

336
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,746
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE
HIS WIFE WOULDN'T DO?

337
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,922
TOO TRUE.
GO WITH THE PINK.

338
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,229
MEN LOVE PINK.
MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE
THE STRONG ONE.

339
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,101
THAT'S SO SMART.

340
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,320
I'VE GOT
A MILLION OF 'EM.

341
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,757
NICE HARD BED.

342
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,890
LOVE THAT.

343
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,283
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WORRY ABOUT THE PINK,

344
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,895
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT WOULD LOOK
A BIT TOO DESPERATE?

345
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,809
NO, NO, NO, NOT DESPERATE.

346
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:58,985
DELICATE.

347
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,943
YEAH, I-- I'M...

348
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,380
I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

349
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,382
I, UM...

350
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,384
TODAY'S THE DAY.
I DECIDED I AM...

351
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:15,262
I'M JUST TIRED OF BEING
"TUESDAY AFTERNOON TESS."

352
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,220
I'M TIRED OF BEING

OKAY.

531
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,230
SO WHAT'S THE ASSIGNMENT?

532
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,623
WE HAVE TO MAKE A MODEL
OF THE HEART.

533
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,451
OUT OF WHAT?ANYTHING.

534
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,540
COOL.

535
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,153
LOVELY.

536
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,895
DO YOU THINK
THEY TAKE REQUESTS?

537
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,113
I'LL ASK THEM.

538
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,507
"FREEBIRD!"

539
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,770
"FREEBIRD--"
YEAH, FREE, FREEBIRD!

540
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,646
CAN I BUY YOU
A DRINK?

541
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,474
IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB.
YOU DON'T
BUY PEOPLE DRINKS.

542
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,346
WHOO.

543
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,043
BITCHY HEIRESS.

544
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,044
YOU'RE JUST MY TYPE.
I LOVE IT.

545
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,526
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?MASON. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

546
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,527
DON'T TELL ME.

547
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,790
OOH, I LOVE THIS GAME.

548
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,358
WHITNEY?

549
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,013
PARKER?

550
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:55,581
WHITNEY?YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.

551
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,278
PARKER?IT'S ASHLEY.

552
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:59,019
FUCKING BOLLOCKS.
BULLSHIT. BULLBAGS.
I KNEW IT.

553
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,238
WHY ARE YOU HERE?HESBURGH FUNERAL.

554
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,024
I'M ASHLEY HESBURGH.

555
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,069
AND I'M VERY SORRY.

556
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,028
WHY ARE  <i>YOU</i>HERE?

557
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:09,856
I'M WITH HER.

558
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,946
YEAH?

559
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,600
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HER EITHER. WHO IS SHE?

560
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,297
SHE'S TRIP'S GIRLFRIEND.

561
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,516
REALLY?YES.

562
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,213
AND YET I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

563
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,911
BET THERE'S A LOT
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
BEFORE, WHITNEY.

564
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,177
SURE.

565
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,353
BUY ME A DRINK.

566
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:30,529
REALLY?MM.

567
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,182
REALLY?

568
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,575
MM.

569
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,012
WHOO. ANOTHER DRINK
FOR THIS YOUNG LADY, PLEASE,

570
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,318
AND PUT IT ON MY TAB.

571
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,758
FUCKING BOLLOCKS.

572
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:47,197
[YAPS]WHY ARE WE HERE AGAIN?

573
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,851
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO TALK
TO ANYBODY.

574
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,505
EXCEPT YOU.

575
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:54,335
MY SISTER AND I
STARTED DOING THIS
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

576
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:55,858
YOU KNOW,
ANYTHING TO GET AWAY.

577
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,906
IT'S SWEET THAT YOU TALK
TO YOUR SISTER.

578
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:02,996
I TOTALLY IGNORED MINE.

579
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:05,825
YOU DON'T
TALK TO HER ANYMORE?

580
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,914
WHY?

581
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,698
WELL, YOU JUST--
YOU USED THE PAST TENSE.

582
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:14,703
WELL, HOW ABOUT WE NOT
TALK ABOUT OUR FAMILIES?

583
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:16,966
DEAL.

584
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,361
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

585
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,801
<i>THIS IS SO NOT RIGHT.</i>

586
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,368
<i>I HAVE A DEAD PERSON
TO DEAL WITH,</i>

587
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,631
<i>HE'S GOT A DEAD PERSON
TO DEAL WITH,</i>

588
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,546
<i>BUT FOR JUST A MOMENT,</i>

589
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,592
<i>THIS WAS A NICE
LITTLE HIDING PLACE.</i>

590
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:35,985
TRIP.

591
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,118
BUSTED.

592
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,902
I HAVEN'T BEEN INTRODUCED
TO YOUR FRIEND.

593
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:45,386
I'M SORRY.
UM, GEORGE,

594
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:47,606
THIS IS
MY SISTER, ASHLEY.

595
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,173
ASHLEY, THIS IS GEORGE.

596
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,044
HI.

597
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,483
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

598
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,572
THANK YOU.

599
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,184
MAYBE WE SHOULD...

600
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:03,317
YEAH, YEAH, THAT WOULD BE...
LADIES FIRST.

601
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,884
THANK YOU.

602
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:07,016
OH! FOUND
MY CONTACT LENS.

603
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,149
THANK GOD.
CAN'T SEE A THING.

604
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:14,110
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS
BEEN TOGETHER?

605
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,591
WHAT'S UP, ASHLEY?

606
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,853
WELL, I'M JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

607
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,899
WHY YOU'RE AT
OUR FATHER'S
MEMORIAL SERVICE

608
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,075
DOING THE HIDEOUT ROUTINE
WITH SOME GIRL
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

609
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,598
ASHLEY, YOU'RE BEING
IMPOLITE.

610
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,122
ACTUALLY, TRIP,
YOU'RE BEING IMPOLITE.

611
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,995
YOU HAVE SPENT
ALL OF THREE SECONDS
TALKING TO DAD'S FRIENDS.

612
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,213
I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST GO.

613
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,432
DON'T BE SILLY.

614
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:33,782
SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN AN ITEM?

615
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:34,696
THAT'S ENOUGH,
ALL RIGHT?

616
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,133
SEE, BECAUSE, UH-- OH!

617
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,788
MASON HERE SAYS THAT
GEORGE IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

618
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,355
MASON.

619
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,356
YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY, SHE IS.

620
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,705
I AM?

621
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,620
WELL, THAT'S NICE.

622
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,795
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

623
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,667
GEORGE...

624
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,799
I DIDN'T CATCH A LAST NAME.

625
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:51,713
WHAT IS YOUR LAST NAME?

626
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,497
NO. DON'T.

627
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,021
LASS.

628
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,457
OKAY, SO, SHE'S
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

629
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,067
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HER LAST NAME?

630
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,070
GEORGE, WE HAVE
TO GO NOW.

631
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,159
MAYBE I'M JUST A SPOILSPORT,

632
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:05,771
BUT DAD IS DEAD,
AND THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE,

633
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:08,251
AND YOU, LITTLE BROTHER,
NEED TO GROW THE FUCK UP.

634
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,041
I'VE GOT TO GO.

635
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:16,695
THAT'S COOL...
UH, SO DO I.

636
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:19,349
I'M SORRY.

637
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,395
DON'T BE.
JUST GO DO
YOUR THING.

638
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,011
YOU SHOULDN'T NOT HAVE
TOLD HIM YOUR LAST NAME.

639
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:30,273
GEORGE LASS IS DEAD.

640
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,234
I GOT TO GO REAP SOMEBODY.

641
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,236
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

642
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,107
WHO AM I KIDDING?
THIS ISN'T ME.

643
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,198
<i>I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.</i>

644
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:43,983
<i>THIS PLACE WAS MEMBERS ONLY,</i>

645
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:48,161
<i>AND I WAS, AS MASON SAID,
NOT REALLY ELIGIBLE.</i>

646
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,168
WHAT'S UP?

647
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,085
THE OLDEST STORY
IN THE WORLD.

648
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,477
GUY'S TRYING
TO UNLOAD HIS MISTRESS

649
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,262
WHO GOT TO BE
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

650
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,959
DID HE LEAVE ANY PRINTS?

651
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,439
DIDN'T HAVE TO.

652
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:09,399
WE FOUND HIS NAME
WRITTEN ON A HOTEL PAD
BY THE PHONE.

653
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:11,227
LIKE SHE WAS
SPEAKING TO US
FROM THE DEAD.

654
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,188
PRETTY HANDWRITING.

655
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,146
GUESS HE WON'T BE
HURTING ANYBODY ANYMORE.

656
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,410
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

657
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,151
WE'VE GOT THINGS
PRETTY MUCH WRAPPED UP
AROUND HERE.

658
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,029
NOT QUITE EVERYTHING.

659
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,166
I GOT YOU, SWEETHEART.

660
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:39,212
YOU'RE OKAY.

661
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:41,823
COME WITH ME.

662
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,674
<i>I HAD IT ALL WRONG.</i>

663
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:09,372
<i>YOU DON'T GO TO A FUNERAL
TO MEET A GUY.</i>

664
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,592
<i>YOU GO TO A WEDDING...</i>

665
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,423
<i>WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF GUYS.</i>

666
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,339
<i>ALL GUYS.</i>

667
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,863
<i>ALL THE TIME.</i>

668
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,266
SO, ARE YOU
WITH THE GROOM
OR THE GROOM?

669
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,050
HUH?

670
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,617
I'M JUST GLAD
THAT KYLE AND JEFFREY

671
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,227
ARE FINALLY
MAKING THIS OFFICIAL.

672
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,663
NO SURPRISES
ON THAT WEDDING NIGHT,

673
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:40,708
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

674
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,407
I'M GORDON.
GORDON MAYNARD.

675
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,326
I KNOW.
I'M NOT FUNNY,

676
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,374
BUT I WAS JUST
TRYING TO MEET SOMEONE,
AND YOU SEEM NICE.

677
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,507
I'M KIND OF HERE
WITH SOMEBODY.

678
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:01,990
OKAY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

679
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:08,736
HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
YOUR TYPE ANYWAY, AT ALL.

680
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,129
OH, YEAH. I KNOW.

681
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,304
GORGEOUS GUYS,

682
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,045
THEY'RE JUST
SO HIGH-MAINTENANCE.

683
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,700
WELL...
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

684
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,056
YOU'RE A GIRL.
BUT THANK YOU.

685
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,492
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL THROW IT.

686
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:26,710
WE'RE NOT
THROWING IT.

687
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:27,886
JUST THROW
THE FUCKING THING.

688
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:29,670
IT'S A PHOTO-OP.

689
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,324
FINE.

690
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,499
HERE WE GO!

691
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:33,717
HONEY?

692
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:34,893
OVER THE SHOULDER.

693
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:36,459
RIGHT.

694
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:40,681
I'VE GOT TO CATCH
THE BOUQUET.

695
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,857
WELL, GO, GIVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT.

696
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,467
MM. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

697
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,818
I, UH, MADE
THE WEDDING CAKE.

698
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,393
ONE...

699
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,568
TWO...

700
00:31:58,612 --> 00:31:59,395
THREE!

701
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,633
HI, GAIL. IT'S JOY.

702
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:22,244
I'M REALLY SORRY,

703
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,159
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT TONIGHT.

704
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,335
YEAH, I KNOW.

705
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,163
I REALLY WANT TO START
JOINING YOU GUYS

706
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,296
ON THESE GIRLS'
NIGHTS OUT, I DO,

707
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,862
BUT I'M JUST
NOT FEELING WELL.

708
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,604
YEAH.

709
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,737
WELL, WE'LL DO IT
ANOTHER TIME, RIGHT?

710
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,565
I PROMISE.

711
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:41,437
OKAY. YEAH, THANKS, GAIL.

712
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:45,354
<i>SOMETIMES, YOU JUST HAVE TO
LOSE YOURSELF IN YOUR WORK.</i>

713
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,878
<i>LOSING YOURSELF IN YOUR WORK
COULD BE A GOOD THING.</i>

714
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,753
<i>BUT JUST BEING A LOSER...
NOT SUCH A GOOD THING.</i>

715
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,841
GORDON?

716
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:56,670
ARE YOU OKAY?

717
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,803
HE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

718
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,414
HE NEVER
LOOKED GOOD.

719
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,024
HE'S NOT MOVING.
CALL AN AMBULANCE.

720
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,721
OKAY.

721
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:06,723
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID I EVEN GET IT?

722
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,813
YOU GOT IT.

723
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:12,860
GREAT.

724
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,340
THEY'RE ALL HOOKING UP
WITH EACH OTHER

725
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,123
OVER MY DEATH,
AND I'M ALONE.

726
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,778
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

727
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,388
I DIED
WITHOUT A BOYFRIEND.

728
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:21,608
I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY CHANCE

729
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,827
OF GETTING ONE
ON THE OTHER SIDE?

730
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:25,742
THAT'S A GOOD
QUESTION, GORDON.

731
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,396
WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

732
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,095
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF.

733
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:32,401
BUT FOR NOW,
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

734
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:36,492
I KNOW I'M NOT
EXACTLY YOUR TYPE,

735
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:37,711
BUT...

736
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,060
I CAN BE BITCHY.

737
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,540
BITCHY'S COOL.

738
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,194
AND HEY, YOU SNAGGED
THE BOUQUET.

739
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,370
TRUE.

740
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,415
GORDON, I THINK
YOU'RE READY.

741
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,857
<i>NOBODY SHOULD
HAVE TO FACE DEATH ALONE.</i>

NOT IN THE MOOD.

744
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,487
YOU ARE SOME KIND
OF FUCK-UP.

745
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,793
THIS IS
SOME MASON SHIT.

746
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,186
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

747
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,667
YOU LEAVE THE SOUL,
AND YOU FINGER THE MURDERER.

748
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,885
I DID NOTHING OF THE KIND.

749
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,104
YOU LEFT THE MAN'S NAME!

750
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:25,846
NO, I DIDN'T.

751
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,804
I KNOW YOUR
HANDWRITING, DAISY.

752
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,068
YOUR SILLY
LITTLE CURLICUES.

753
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,939
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

754
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:33,375
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO GET AWAY WITH IT, OKAY?

755
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,073
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

756
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,597
YOUR JOB IS TO HANDLE
THAT WOMAN'S SOUL.

757
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,860
EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING
THEY DON'T DEAL WITH, ROXY.

758

I DON'T DO THOSE.

THOSE WHAT?WOMEN WHO END UP THAT WAY.

760
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,389
DEFENSELESS,
WITH A MAN COMING AT THEM.
I CAN'T WATCH IT.

761
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:48,477
THAT NEVER
HAPPENED TO YOU.

762
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,131
I DIDN'T SAY
IT HAPPENED TO ME.

763
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,525
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
FEELING SO GUILTY ABOUT?

764
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:53,787
I JUST FEEL GUILTY.

765
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,702
CAN'T A GIRL FEEL GUILTY?

766
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,269
MAYBE YOU NEED
TO GO BACK TO CHURCH.

767
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,879
MAYBE WE'RE DONE
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

768
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,280
DOESN'T THAT
FUCK WITH YOUR SLEEP?

769
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,456
I'M UP ANYWAY.

770

COMPLETELY STALKERISH,
