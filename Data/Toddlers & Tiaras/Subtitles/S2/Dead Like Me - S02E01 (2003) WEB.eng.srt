00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:10,009
[GEORGE]:  Everybody dies.
That's just the way it is.

2
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,663
I'm told I'm not
supposed to argue

3
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,492
or question or even
try to understand.

4
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:18,018
I'm told a lot these days,

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,759
ever since my
life was snuffed out
by a toilet seat,

6
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:23,632
and I joined
the ranks of the undead.

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,286
You, little dead girl,
are gonna be a grim reaper.

8
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:28,940
My name is George Lass.

9
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,333
I take souls for a living.

10
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:34,598
This is Rube.
He's undead, too.

11
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:38,125
He's the one
who gets the list,
who's to die, when and where,

12
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,996
which he passes on
to the rest of
us grim reapers.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,171
[GEORGE]: ETD?

15
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:47,046
[GEORGE]:  Do you guys
get off dropping
pianos on people?

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,353
[RUBE]:  It's not our
job to drop the pianos
or the toilet seats.

17
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,527
Whose job is it?

18
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:51,659
[RUBE]: Gravelings.

19
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,619
[GEORGE]:  Reapers don't get
a free ride.

20
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,100
What are you doing?

21
00:00:57,143 --> 00:00:58,493
Collecting my salary.

22
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,146
We don't get paid,
like, through proper channels?

23
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:04,237
Hi.
I'm Delores Herbig, as in...

24
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,456

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,632
What kind of universe

26
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:10,331
would give me the power
to extract souls
from people's bodies,

27
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:13,159
but still force me
to keep a suck-ass job
if I want to eat?

28
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:18,295
This was my home.
And this was my family.

29
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:20,036
They're having trouble coping.

30
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,037
[JOY]:  Keeping a dead
animal in your toy box

31
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,301
is something
a crazy person would do.

32
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:26,129
I'm not crazy.

33
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:28,566
[GEORGE]:  I was having
trouble coping, too.

34
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,871
I don't think I'm
supposed to be doing this.

35
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,439
[RUBE]: You're learning.

36
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,137
You gotta think
about all the things you like

37
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,834
and decide whether
they're worth
sticking around for.

38
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:38,968
And if they are,
you'll find a way to do this.

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,796
[GEORGE]:  What if I don't?

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,753
[RUBE]:  Then you go away.

41
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,522
[GEORGE]:  When I was alive,
I never looked
at the obituaries,

42
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:58,002
like, not even once.

43
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:01,832
Now I read them first,
the reaper's sports pages.

44
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,356
And every time I
see someone who lived

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,448
to even 50,
it kind of annoys me.

46
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,798
Was your name
ever in the paper?

47
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:13,062
[SIGHS] Constantly. I still
have all the clippings.

48
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:15,586
I made the police reports
a couple of times, you know.

49
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,110
"Unidentified male,
slender build,
seen fleeing the premises."

50
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:19,241
That kind of thing.

51
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,591
That doesn't count.

52
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,679
How about you, sweetie?

53
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,681
Mmm! Do tell.

54
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,771
"Teen Killed by Falling Debris
from Space Station."

55
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:30,731
Technically,
that was the day
after your life.

56
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,038
[MASON]: My demise
went unreported.

57
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,388
Drug-related
deaths in the '60s
were very common.

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,954
I've got to go wee-wee.

59
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,308
[GEORGE]:
Was your death reported?

60
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,527
Oh, please.
I perished in a huge fire

61
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,573
on the set of
Gone with the Wind.

62
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:46,965
Not a word, huh?

63
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,490
Nothing. The story was buried.

64
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,534
And three days later...So were you.

65
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,188
But my picture
was in the paper
a whole lot before I died.

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,973
Why?

67
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:57,280
On the arm of
whatever famous man
I was sleeping with.

68
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:00,151
Mmm... Right. Not my thing.

69
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,066
You never slept with anybody?

70
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,153
No.

71
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,721
Why didn't you?

72
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,507
Well, Daisy, first of all,
I was 18 years old.

73
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,943
Not a great excuse.

74
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,597
I never had a boyfriend.

75
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,381
[DAISY]: Not really a problem.

76
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,426
[GEORGE]: I lived at home
with my parents
and little sister.

77
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:14,602
Ever heard of a car?

78
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:20,259
Is it just my imagination
or have I become
much more attractive

79
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,957
since I've laid
off the booze and,
you know, whatnot?

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,220
Your breath is better.

81
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,091
Your eyes are less puffy.

82
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:29,399
And you don't have as much
drool around your mouth,
which is nice.

83
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,834
You know,
the most
attractive thing about you

84
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,663
when you were
drinking and whatnot

85
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,927
is that you really had no idea
if you were attractive.

86
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,713
'Cause when people know
they're attractive,
they're not.

87
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:41,411
And it's not about
what's on the outside.

88
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:44,675
It's not about this.
It's about this.
It's about what's in here.

handsome man.[GEORGE]: Hmm.

90
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,641
But am I pretty?

91
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,295
Oh, you're darling.

There's souls to
be taken, folks,

95
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,307
One, two, three, four, five.

96
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,744
Why do I only get one?

97
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,658
Because three doesn't
go into five evenly.

98
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,095

99
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:17,228

No, five deaths
is not a disaster.

How many deaths is a disaster?

106
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,199
More than five.
Five's bullshit.

00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,247
Sixteen to 20, disaster.

00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:03,449
Two more big bills
a week. Hunge.Huh.

858
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,016
I joined the Police Academy.

859
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:06,409
No, you didn't.

860
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:07,976
[RUBE]: Yes, she did.

861
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,847
They want more days,
these Happy Time people?

862
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,938
I think you should
decline the offer.

863
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:16,157
Fuck that.
It's done. I'm doing it.

864
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:17,376
Roxy,
give us a moment, will you?

865
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:23,295
Why can't I do this?
I'm doing this.

866
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:25,297
She's joining
the fucking Police Academy.

867
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,865
Roxy is not your concern.

868
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,563
I'm just worried
that you're
taking on too much.

869
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:35,177
People love to take roses
and they forget
about the thorns.

870
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:37,048
[SIGHS] Okay,
now, that's really beautiful,

871
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:39,311
but I'm taking the promotion.

872
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,188
Uh-uh. I wouldn't do that.

873
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:49,887
What did she do now?

874
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,541
Nice cross.

875
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:53,108
Have any trouble
getting the blood off?

876
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:54,806
[DAISY]: No,
just soap and water.

877
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,590
[RUBE]: I just think
you should go in there
tomorrow morning

878
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:01,159
and tell that Delores woman,
"Thank you, but no."

879
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:04,119
I want to do this.
I want more money.

880
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:07,034
"I want, I want."

881
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,820
Look, Peanut...

882
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,605
Don't call me that.

883
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:22,746
I just think all that wanting
is not so good at this point,

884
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:25,574
and that's all I have to say
about your promotion.

885
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,882
Well, as much
as I've enjoyed
this little pow-wow,

886
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,755
I think I'm just going to do
what I'm going to do.

887
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,282
[KIFFANY]: Miss,
your espresso?

888
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:37,762
I don't want it.

889
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,197
We made it.
Somebody's got to pay for it.

890
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:43,463
She's a cop.
Don't they get
everything for free?

891
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:47,119
[KIFFANY]: I thought
you were a meter maid.

892
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:49,164
[ROXY]: Well, I'm a cop now.

893
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,905
Good for you, baby.
Coffee's free for cops.

894
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,735
Un-fucking-real.

895
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,481
What do you mean,
you're a cop?

896
00:45:01,523 --> 00:45:03,309
I joined the Police
Academy this afternoon.

897
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:06,746
Yeah, I don't
think I care for that.

898
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,264
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

899
00:46:35,182 --> 00:46:37,054
[FROG CROAKING]

900
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:43,103
Hey, there, Mr. Frog.

901
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:44,322
How was your day?

902
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,282
Mine was fucked up.

903
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:02,123
My flower.

904
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:11,349
I thought you might want it.

905
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:17,224
So, who was that boy
on the phone today?
"Brendan."

906
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,706
Brennan.

907
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:21,621
Brennan.

908
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,405
Who's Brennan,
who thinks you
have beautiful eyes?

909
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:25,842
Nobody.

910
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,411
Okay, I kissed him.

911
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:31,065
And?"And?"

912
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:32,414
What was the kiss like?

913
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:37,114
It's not too late to
call him, you know.

914
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,159
I'm not gonna call him.

915
00:47:39,204 --> 00:47:42,467
Delores doesn't want
me getting involved
with anyone at Happy Time.

916
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,295
Besides, he's not my type.
Not even close.

917
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:46,427
He's a pretty boy.

918
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:47,559
That's obvious.

919
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:50,215
Go to bed, Daisy.

920
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:55,697
So, Rube doesn't
want you at Happy Time.
That makes you unhappy.

921
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:57,483
Delores wants
you at Happy Time

922
00:47:57,525 --> 00:47:58,918
but just so long
as you're unhappy.

923
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:00,311
It just sounds like a plan.

924
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:04,184
Life sucks, and then you die,

925
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:06,318
and then it still sucks.

926
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,103
What's with the cross?

927
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,106
I don't know. I like it.

928
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,326
What are you,
like, Catholic now?

929
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,197
[CLICKS TONGUE]
Yeah, why not?

930
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:17,981
Good for you.

931
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,376
You're so angry.And you're not?

932
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,333
Listen to me.

933
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:28,079
I died in 1938,
and there's not
a day that goes by

934
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:30,951
that I don't wonder
about the things I did
and the things I didn't do...

935
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:34,259
I know, and you were
going to be a great actress,

936
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:36,914
and you were
beautiful and talented

937
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:39,090
and you slept with all the men
under the moon.

938
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:41,440
Stop making fun of me.
Just shut up for once.

939
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,442
You think you know everything.
Look how unhappy you are.

940
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,403
I'm sorry you were so young
when you died, Georgia.

941
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:53,713
Good night.

942
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:04,811
[GEORGE]:  I knew who that
pink flower was for.

943
00:49:04,853 --> 00:49:07,682
I knew who I'd betrayed.

944
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:11,034
My short life was
like our family outings
to the circus.

945
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,211
It wasn't so bad,

946
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:18,650
a bit with a clown,
some cotton candy...

947
00:49:18,693 --> 00:49:21,175
And just as
things got interesting,

948
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:22,523
I covered my eyes.

949
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,313
I know what
that Wallenda smile
at the end was about.

950
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:36,407
Why they were so happy
with their mid-air
flips and near-misses.

951
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,106
They were happy because
they were brave
enough to be themselves.

952
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,503
I mean, if you're a Wallenda,
you have to
climb up that ladder.

953
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,550
You have to grab
that trapeze bar.

954
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:54,034
If you're a Wallenda

955
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,556
you have to jump off,

956
00:49:56,557 --> 00:49:58,255
eyes wide open.
