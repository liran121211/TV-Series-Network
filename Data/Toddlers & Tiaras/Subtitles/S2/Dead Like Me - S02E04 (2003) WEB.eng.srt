529
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,256
I JUST ASSUMED
YOU WERE GOING TO BE A WOMAN.

530
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,609
I WILL BE SOON.

531
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:58,872
I HOPE.

532
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,527
OF COURSE YOU WILL.

533
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:09,317
I SAW YOU PARKED YOUR JAG
IN THE HANDICAP ZONE, SARAH.

534
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,755
IS CELLULITE
NOW A RECOGNIZED HANDICAP?

535
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,974
TRAMP.

536
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,366
TART.SLUT.

537
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,237
MIDDLE-AGED.

538
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,216
CAN I HELP YOU?

539
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,610
OH, NO, I'M JUST BROWSING.

540
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,091
OKAY, WELL, JUST LET ME
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
ANYTHING FOR A TEST DRIVE.

541
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,317
YOU KNOW,

542
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:56,799
IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO TRY A NEW PRODUCT OR TWO.

543
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,106
OKAY, WELL,
IT'S LIKE YOUR HOUSE,

544
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:00,673
SO YOU START
FROM THE FOUNDATIONS,

545
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:01,935
THEN YOU BUILD
FROM THE GROUND UP,

546
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,372
SO FOR EXAMPLE,

547
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,766
WE HAVE "HATE YOUR HUSBAND
BUT WILLING TO STAY NEUTRAL,"

548
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,985
OR...

549
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,858
"ALREADY KICKED HIS ASS
TO THE CURB."

550
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,729
WHAT SHADE IS,
"HE'S BANGING ONE
OF HIS STUDENTS"?

551
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,036
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

552
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,821
JOY.THAT'S A PRETTY NAME.

553
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,651
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT, JOY?

554
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:26,046
THE LAST 10 YEARS
OF MY LIFE BACK.

555
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:27,787
I CAN DO THAT.

556
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,229
[GEORGE]:  <i>PART OF ME KNEW
THAT BEING MEAN WAS RECKLESS,</i>

557
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:37,405
<i>THAT IT WAS
KIND OF LIKE DRIVING TOO FAST.</i>

558
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,581
<i>SO WHAT IF I WASN'T
WEARING MY SEAT BELT?</i>

559
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,802
<i>SO WHAT IF I OCCASIONALLY
SCRAPED ANOTHER FENDER?</i>

560
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,717
JESUS CHRIST, CRYSTAL!

561
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,936
I'M SORRY, MILLIE.

562
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,460
PEOPLE HAVE TO WALK
AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW,

563
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,637
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PICK THIS CRAP UP.

564
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,336
<i>NICE GIRLS DON'T GET THE GUY.</i>

565
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:59,166
<i>NICE GIRLS DON'T RISE
TO THE TOP.</i>

566
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,950
[GRUNTS]

567
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,604
NOW YOU'VE
MADE ME MAD.

568
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:05,041
NOW WE CAN
NEVER BE FRIENDS.

569
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,178
[GEORGE]:  <i>NICE GIRLS
FINISH LAST.</i>

570
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,706
THEO.

571
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,055
THEO. THEO.

572
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,144
WE HAVE
THESE RULES, OKAY?

573
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:22,798
NO FUNERALS.

574
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,452
FUNERALS ARE
FOR THE LIVING,

575
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,759
SO THEY TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAYS
TO ARRANGE--

576
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,761
OH, ESPECIALLY
ONE LIKE MINE.

577
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,589
OH, IT'S GOING TO BE
AN EVENT.

578
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,503
I HAD FRIENDS.
I CAN'T WAIT.

579
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,854
THAT'S JUST IT, THEO.
YOU CAN'T WAIT.

580
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,812
YOU SEE, UH...
OH, GOODNESS,

581
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,422
HOW DO I
EXPLAIN THIS?

582
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,337
IT'S, UH...

583
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,383
YOU'VE CALLED
THE CABLE GUY, RIGHT?

584
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,733
AND YOU'VE MADE
AN APPOINTMENT,
AND THAT CABLE GUY

585
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,082
HAS MADE A WINDOW
FOR YOU,

586
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:49,216
AND THAT WINDOW IS
FROM 12:00 TO 5:00.

587
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:50,913
RIGHT?
SO IF YOU'RE NOT THERE

588
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,915
WHEN HE PRESSES
THAT LITTLE DOORBELL,
THEN...

589
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,091
NO CABLE, HUH?

590
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,745
I DON'T BLOODY KNOW,
THEO.

591
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,094
I REALLY BLOODY
DON'T KNOW.

592
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,749
SON, I APPRECIATE
THE EFFORT,

593
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,273
BUT I WAS IN SALES,

594
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:06,581
AND I GOT TO TELL YOU,
YOU'RE NOT CLOSING.

595
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,148
I'M GOING TO MY FUNERAL.

596
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,673
PLEASE AT LEAST
MEET MY BOSS, THEN.

597
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,762
OH, LOOK AT THIS, BETTY.

598
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,155
I'M TALKING TO GOD TODAY.

599
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,591
NO, HE JUST THINKS HE'S GOD.

600
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,725
YOU'RE SURE
NO ONE CAN SEE ME?

601
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,770
OH, UH... NO, NO.

602
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:23,250
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT WAS COMPLETELY
OBVIOUS BY NOW.

603
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,172
AND THAT JUST
IS NOT RIGHT FOR THEM.

604
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:33,608
OKAY?

605
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,308
HI.

606
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,270
THEO...

607
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,108
WHEN DO THEY CALL
MY PARENTS?

608
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,763
ARE THEY YOUR
NEXT OF KIN?

609
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,808
DID YOUR PARENTS KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

610
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,727
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL CROSS.

611
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,511
ARE YOU CATHOLIC?

612
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,774
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

613
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,254
WHEN I WAS A KID,

614
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:14,301
MY MOM USED TO PRAY
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

615
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,042
EVERY MORNING
BEFORE MY DAD
WOULD GO TO WORK,

616
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,565
EVERY TIME
I TOOK A TEST...

617
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,655
FOR THE POT ROAST
BEING TENDER.

618
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,919
SHE REALLY NEVER
STOPPED PRAYING.

619
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,139
THE POWER OF PRAYER

620
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,749
IS VERY REAL
FOR SOME PEOPLE.

621
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:30,056
YEAH, WELL,
A MILLION HAIL MARYS

622
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,535
DIDN'T TURN ME
INTO A GIRL.

623
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:34,713
I'M SORRY.

624
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,020
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S A CHANCE

625
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:39,282
I COULD I GO TO CHURCH
ONE LAST TIME?

626
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:41,850
OF COURSE.

627
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,769
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN SPECULATION, DOCTOR.

628
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,336
I'M INTERESTED
IN FACTS.

629
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,381
THE FACT IS,
YOU HAVE NO CHIN.

630
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,992
YOU NEED
A CHIN IMPLANT.

631
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,733
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.
HOW DO YOU...

632
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,212
HOW DO YOU EVEN
CHANGE PILLOW CASES?

633
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,781
AND THAT
IS EVERYTHING.

634
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,044
NOW, REGGIE,
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR
MIND OR WHATEVER,

635
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,829
THAT'S COMPLETELY COOL.

636
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,961
WOW, CHECK OUT
YOUR MOM.

637
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:08,181
WELL?

638
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,184
YOU LOOK LIKE A NEWSCASTER.

639
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,406
HOW MUCH?

640
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,756
195, PLUS TAX.

641
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,150
YOU'RE GOOD.

642
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:26,765
REGGIE!

643
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:28,767
REGGIE, STOP.

644
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,247
HI.

645
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:33,902
HELLO.
DO I KNOW YOU?

646
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,077
NO. I'M STEVE.

647
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,905
YOU'RE HOT.

648
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,167
FUCK OFF, STEVE.

649
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:43,694
WHO WAS THAT?

650
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,740
NOBODY.

651
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,003
NEWSCASTER, MY ASS.

652
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:54,749
SO EVERYTHING'S
ON YOUR HARD DRIVE,

653
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,577
AND I MADE YOU
A HARD COPY
IN THIS BINDER,

654
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,970
IN CASE, YOU KNOW,

655
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,102
THAT WHOLE NAZI
PROBLEM RESURFACES.GOOD.

656
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:03,584
WHY ARE THERE POST-ITS
ON MY BINDER?

657
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,065
I PUT THESE POST-ITS
AT THE TOP OF
EACH SUB-SECTION,

658
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:08,719
SO THAT IF, LIKE,
SAY YOU WERE TRYING
TO FIND A JOB FOR SOMEONE

659
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:09,982
WHO COULD TYPE AND ALSO DRIVE,
THEN YOU COULD JUST--

660
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,374
I DON'T LIKE POST-ITS.

661
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:12,636
OKAY. I JUST--

662
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,899
LOSE THE POST-ITS,
ETHAN.

663
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,335
OKAY, SURE.

664
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,859
SO, I DO ORIGAMI.

665
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,165
I REALLY LIKE CRAFTS,

666
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,514
AND I HAD
SOME EXTRA TIME

667
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:22,255
BECAUSE
I WORK SO QUICKLY
SO I MADE YOU...

668
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:24,910
I MADE YOU A SWAN.

669
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,347
OH.

670
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,218
ETHAN.

671
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,569
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

672
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:33,744
I'M SORRY.

673
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,094
YEAH.

674
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,009
IT WAS A PRETTY ONE.

675
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:39,925
UM, I GUESS
I COULD MAKE YOU
ANOTHER ONE.

676
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,143
THAT'S OKAY.

677
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,797
I DIDN'T REALLY
WANT TO ANYWAY.

678
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:44,625
OKAY, BYE.

679
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,934
[GEORGE]:  <i>I WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.</i>

680
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,635
<i>I USED TO BE A NICE PERSON.</i>

681
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,247
HI, BETH ANNE.

682
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,860
ISN'T IT WEIRD
HOW THERE'S SO MANY WAVES

683
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,470
BUT THE WATER'S
NOT REALLY GOING ANYWHERE?

684
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,081
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST BE NORMAL?

685
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,300
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SO WEIRD?

686
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,302
I DON'T KNOW.

687
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,612
<i>BUT BEING NICE
DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK EITHER.</i>

688
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:20,095
<i>IT'S LIKE ANY WAY I PLAY IT...</i>

689
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,836
<i>I WIND UP ALONE.</i>

690
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,452
I'M SORRY, DELORES.

691
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,412
YOU KNOW, MILLIE,

692
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,502
BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN
I HAD ALL THOSE RESTRAINING
ORDERS AGAINST ME,

693
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:38,287
I THOUGHT HATE
WAS THE ANSWER.

694
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:40,507
SERIOUSLY, DELORES,
I'M NOT A NAZI.

695
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,596
OH, I KNOW THAT, SILLY.

696
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,293
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY,

697
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:46,382
SOMETIMES WHEN I HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
A BULLWHIP AND A SMILE,

698
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,601
I CHOOSE THE SMILE.

699
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,955
THAT WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST THINGS
YOU EVER SAID TO ME.

700
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,522
HMM?

701
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:58,351
YOU SAID, "I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU SMILE ONCE."

702
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,919
I DON'T THINK SO.

703
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,529
I SAID THAT
TO ANOTHER YOUNG GIRL.

704
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,009
LOVELY YOUNG GIRL.
TRAGIC WHAT HAPPENED.

705
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,447
YEAH, MY MISTAKE.

706
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,361
MILLIE...

707
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,972
ETHAN JUST QUIT.

708
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,669
WHAT?

709
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:13,975
HE SAID
HE WASN'T CUT OUT

710
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,282
FOR THIS KIND
OF CORPORATE
CUT-THROAT CULTURE.

711
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,197
WHAT HAPPENED, MILLIE?

712
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,939
I HAD A BAD DAY.

713
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,331
NO. MILLIE...

714
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,944
ETHAN HAD A BAD DAY.

715
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,168
THIS PARK'S BEAUTIFUL.

716
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,302
ALL OF GOD'S
CREATURES, RIGHT?

717
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,782
I GUESS.

718
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,741
I WANTED TO BE
A GIRL...

719
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:42,569
EVER SINCE
I CAN REMEMBER.

720
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,137
WHO WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE A GIRL?

721
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,226
WE'RE SO MUCH
PRETTIER THAN BOYS.

722
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:48,705
YOU'RE KIND OF PRETTY.

723
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,881
YOU MAKE IT LOOK
SO EFFORTLESS.

724
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,535
YEAH, DON'T LET
THE FINAL PICTURE
FOOL YOU.

725
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,320
THIS IS TWO HOURS
OF HARD LABOR
IN THE MORNING.

726
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,713
NO, IT'S IN
EVERYTHING YOU DO.

727
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:59,760
THE WAY YOU WALK,
THE WAY YOUR HAIR
FLOWS,

728
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:02,023
THE WAY YOU MOVE
YOUR HIPS.
IT'S PERFECT.

729
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,111
ARE YOU FLIRTING
WITH ME?

730
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,200
I'M DEAD.

731
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,506
RIGHT.

732
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,465
STILL,
YOURS IS THE FACE

733
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,380
I WANTED TO SEE
IN THE MIRROR
EVERY MORNING.

734
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,556
YOU'RE JUST PERFECT.

735
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:15,776
I KNOW,

736
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,473
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
STAN? SO ARE YOU.

737
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,304
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE.

738
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:24,741
YOU'RE SWEET.
YOU'RE HONEST.

739
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,048
YOU'VE GOT GREAT STYLE.
YOU'D HAVE MADE
A GOOD WOMAN.

740
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:29,050
WOULD'VE, COULD'VE.

741
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,704
I GOT SCREWED.

742
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,706
YEAH.

743
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,012
IT'S ALL
PART OF HIS PLAN.

744
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,839
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

745
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,058
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

746
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:40,714
WHY ARE YOU
GOING TO CHURCH?

747
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,542
IT'S WHERE YOU
TALK TO GOD, DAISY.

748
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,370
IT'S HIS HOUSE.

749
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,293
REGGIE,
I NEED TO GET A MOVE ON
EARLY TOMORROW MORNING,

750
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:55,772
SO YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO...

751
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,558
WOW.

752
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,561
DON'T YOU KNOCK?

753
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,738
WOW, YOU LOOK
LIKE A...

754
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:06,566
YOUNG WOMAN.

755
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,482
PLEASE GET OUT.

756
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,006
I'M OUT.

757
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,234
THANKS.

758
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:23,931
MATZOH BALLS
ARE NICE TONIGHT.

759
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:29,197
DO YOU CARE IF
PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

760
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,894
DO I ACT
LIKE I CARE?

761
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:31,895
NO.

762
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,247
NOBODY LIKES COPS ANYWAY,

763
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,944
BUT THEY SURE ARE
HAPPY TO SEE US

764
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,598
WHEN THE SHIT
HITS THE FAN.

765
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,339
EAT YOUR SOUP
BEFORE IT GETS COLD.

766
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,997
JESUS, THOSE ARE
SOME ENORMOUS BALLS.

767
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,216
EXCUSE ME?

768
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,785
OH, GOOD GOD!

769
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,440
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

770
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,181
THIS MAN WANTS TO GO
TO HIS OWN FUNERAL.

771
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,747
HE DIED NAKED?

772
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:58,792
SMASHED INTO
A DIVING BOARD.

773
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,186
WITH HIS BALLS?

774
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:03,188
STUNNING, ISN'T IT?TELL HIM THE RULES, MASON.
NO FUNERALS.

775
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:04,624
I'VE TRIED THAT, RUBE.
THE THING IS--

776
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,842
THE THING IS WHAT, MASON?

777
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,931
YOU KNOW, THAT THING...
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

778
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:08,932
THE THING
THAT YOU CAN...

779
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,326
YOU'RE BETTER AT...

780
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,198
JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU KNOW...

781
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,373
THE TALKING.

782
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,897
WELL SAID.

783
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,725
PLEASE, RUBE.
HIS NAME'S THEO.

784
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,733
THAT'S JUST
TOO MUCH BALL.

785
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,434
NOW HE'S PUT ME
OFF MY SOUP.

786
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:33,870
SO YOU SEE
WHAT I'M SAYING?

787
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:34,828
I DON'T SEE WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, MASON.

788
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:35,916
I DO.

789
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,526
OH, GOD.

790
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,225
DER WAFFLE HAUS.

791
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,488
I REMEMBER WHEN
THE FIRST ONE OF
THESE WENT UP.

792
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,185
THE WAR WAS OVER.
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL

793
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,056
IN THE BEGINNING.

794
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,537
BETTY AND I
WERE ON OUR FIFTH DATE.

795
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:49,625
SHE HAD WAFFLES.

796
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,193
THANKS.

797
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,499
THANKS A MILLION.

798
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,893
COME ON, THEO.
LET'S CHAT.

799
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,636
OH, LOOK
AT THE LOVEBIRDS.

800
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,204
KISS HER, YOU PUTZ.

801
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,075
THIS WAY, THEO.

802
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,381
ARE YOU GOING
TO EAT THAT SOUP?

803
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,731
THAT'S JUST GROSS.

804
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,298
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
MANY OF THEM,
HAVE YOU?

805
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,561
MY FIRST... PAIR.

806
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:13,606
THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE THAT.

807
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:16,130
SOME ARE WORSE.

808
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,262
POOR BETTY.

809
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,350
WHO'S BETTY?

810
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,266
NO ONE.

811
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,876
HOW DOES THIS GUY
NOT CARE

812
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,747
IF PEOPLE SEE HIM
LIKE THAT?

813
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,184
HE JUST DOESN'T.

814
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,796
DO YOU CARE
IF PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

815
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,710
NO.

816
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,236
WHY? HAS SOMEBODY SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT ME?
IS IT DAISY?

817
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,368
DOES SHE NOT LIKE ME?

818
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,197
I HAVE TO GO.

819
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,938
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
WHAT, HAS DAISY SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT ME?

820
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,245
THAT OLD MAN IS
YOUR REAP, MASON.

821
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:46,291
SO BLOODY WHAT?

822
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,118
MAN, YOU NEVER
MET A PROBLEM

823
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:49,816
YOU COULDN'T
RUN FROM, HUH?

824
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,774
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT NEEDS SOME BALLS.

825
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,389
'NIGHT, RUBE.

826
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,479
CAN SHE SEE ME?

827
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,263
SHE CAN,

828
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,743
AND SHE'LL NEVER BE
THE SAME FOR IT.

829
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,528
YOU KNOW, THEO,

830
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,138
DEATH HAS
ITS OWN PROTOCOL.

831
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:10,097
IT'S LIKE A TRAIN.

832
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,578
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE FOR YOUR TRAIN.

833
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,319
EXACTLY WHAT THAT
MASON GUY SAID,

834
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:15,711
EXCEPT PRETTIER.

835
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,104
THANK YOU.

836
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,194
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO YOUR FUNERAL?

837
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:26,200
WELL...
I'M JUST CURIOUS
TO SEE WHO COMES,

838
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,071
HEAR WHAT PEOPLE
HAVE TO SAY.

839
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:31,727
I LIVED A LONG LIFE,
YOU KNOW.
STORIES WILL BE TOLD.

840
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,686
YOU'RE WORRIED SOMEBODY
MIGHT MAKE A JOKE OR TWO
AT YOUR EXPENSE?

841
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,298
I DON'T...
I DON'T KNOW.

842
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:40,345
I WAS A LOUDMOUTH.

843
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:44,218
BETTY ALWAYS LAUGHED
AT MY JOKES.

844
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,785
YOU KNOW, THEO,
YOU STRIKE ME
AS THE KIND OF GUY

845
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,613
WHO WAS WHO HE WAS,
NOT A LOT OF BULLSHIT.

846
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,658
YOU WERE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT BEING LIKED.

847
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:50,442
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
LIKED HIM.

848
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,403
HOW...

849
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,973
HOW LONG AGO DID
BETTY DIE, THEO?

850
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:03,368
SEVEN YEARS THIS NOVEMBER.

851
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,065
I'M SORRY, I'M...
I'M A BIT CONFUSED.

852
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:09,330
I MEAN, ISN'T SHE
THE ONE THAT YOU'D
REALLY WANT TO SEE?

853
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,811
AND I'M THINKING
SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE
AT YOUR FUNERAL.

854
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,160
YEAH.

855
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,293
I MISS HER.

856
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,470
I MISS MY WIFE.

857
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:22,387
I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD KEEP BETTY
WAITING ANY LONGER.

858
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:27,000
LET'S GO FIND HER,
THEN, EH?

859
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:30,830
COME ON.

860
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,795
RUBE, DO YOU THINK
DAISY'S UPSET WITH
ME FOR ANY REASON?

861
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,886
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY SHE WOULD BE.

862
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,715
COME ON, ALREADY.
I'M FREEZING
MY BALLS OFF HERE.

863
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,806
SORRY, THEO.
WOULDN'T WANT TO
KEEP YOU WAITING.

864
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,731
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
TIME ALONE, STAN?

865
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:04,951
PLEASE.

866
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,474
[♪♪]

867
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,187
YOU BASTARD.

868
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:25,711
STAN!

869
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,412
HYPOCRITICAL,
NO-GOOD,

870
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,240
BACKSTABBING,
JUDGMENTAL...

871
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,374
YOU SAID WE'RE ALL
GOD'S CHILDREN.

872
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,853
EXCEPT THE FREAKS.

873
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,812
EXCEPT FOR ME.

874
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,860
YOU. YOU DO IT.

875
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,384
I CAN'T. I WON'T.

876
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,124
JUST HELP ME.

877
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,561
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

878
