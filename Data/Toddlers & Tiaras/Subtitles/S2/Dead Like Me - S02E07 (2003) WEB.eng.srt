EXCEPT ME.</i>

883
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,613
OKAY, RUBE, I BLEW IT.

884
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,049
I COMPLETELY BLEW IT,

885
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:24,096
AND BELIEVE ME, I'M
SO PAINFULLY, PAINFULLY AWARE

886
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,446
OF MY FAILURES
THIS EVENING,

887
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,448
BUT, SAYING THAT,
BRING ON MORE PAIN,

888
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:29,667
BECAUSE, NO DOUBT,
I DESERVE IT, OKAY?

889
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,497
PECAN.

890
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,674
NOT BAD, EITHER.

891
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,419
THINK OF IT AS
A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE CARD.

892
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:47,597
NICE SHOT, ROXY.

893
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:48,642
THANKS.

894
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,687
HERE SHE IS.

895
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:52,602
[RUBE] LOOK AT YOU!

896
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,213
NICE GOING.

897
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:55,388
OW.

898
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:59,000
YEAH, IT WAS CRAZY
IN THERE.

899
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:01,089
I LIKE
YOUR OUTFIT.

900
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,439
THANK YOU, DAISY.
ROXY PICKED IT OUT.

901
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,833
HMM?

902
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:07,748
AIN'T NOTHING BUT WOMAN
UNDER THIS UNIFORM.

903
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,315
[DAISY CHUCKLING]

904
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:10,795
WHAT THE FUCK
YOU LAUGHING AT?

905
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:16,626
<i>NOT EVERY DEATH
GETS A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.</i>

906
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:24,199
<i>MOST DEATHS,</i>

907
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:26,898
<i>THEY JUST GOT
A SKY FULL OF STARS.</i>

908
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:28,334
<i>THAT'S NOT BAD...</i>

909
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:30,902
<i>FOR A NOBODY LIKE ME.</i>
