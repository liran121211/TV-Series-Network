<i>MAYBE IT'S JUST
THE UNIFORMS, BUT IN HERE,</i>

351
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:43,045
<i>IT FEELS LIKE
THERE'S ORDER IN THE WORLD.</i>

352
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,568
NEXT.

353
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,353
<i>AND IF YOU JUST GET
THE FACTS ONTO THE BOOKS,</i>

354
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:48,877
<i>ODDS ARE, THE SYSTEM
TAKES CARE OF YOU.</i>

355
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,139
HI.

356
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,967
I'D LIKE TO REPORT
THE THEFT OF MY BICYCLE.

357
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,925
IT HAPPENED
ALMOST AN HOUR AGO,
ON BAY STREET.

358
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,188
FILL THIS OUT.

359
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,059
WHAT'S THIS?

360
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,191
IT'S A HARVARD LAW DEGREE.

361
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,628
WE'RE ALL
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

362
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,456
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO BE
REALLY LATE FOR WORK.

363
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,588
CAN I JUST DESCRIBE
THE BIKE TO YOU,

364
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,634
AND YOU COULD PUT OUT
AN A.P.B. OR WHATEVER?

365
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:08,505
NO.

366
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,246
GREAT.

367
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:14,859
EXCUSE ME.

368
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:16,861
THANK YOU.

369
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,083
HOLY SHIT.

370
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,303
DID YOU JUST SEE THIS?MM-HMM.

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,393
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, DEAR?

372
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,526
SOMEONE...
STOLE MY BIKE,

373
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,095
AND IT WAS
A REALLY COOL BIKE.

374
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:37,056
A MAN FONDLED
MY BEHIND
ON A CITY BUS.

375
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,191
THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR THAT.

376
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:43,410
NONE.

377
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,934
I THINK
HE WAS STABBED.

378
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,590
YEP. "ASSAULT WITH
A DEADLY WEAPON,
KNITTING--

379
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:51,548
NEEDLES."

380
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,159
THE SHITHEAD
HAD IT COMING.

381
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,425
HERE WE GO,
HERE WE GO.

382
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,209
HERE WE GO, WHERE WE GO...

383
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,515
WHERE WE GO, NOBODY KNOWS.

384
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:04,170
THAT'S YOUR PATTER?

385
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,562
PATTER'S BULLSHIT.

386
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:06,911
PATTER'S HOW
YOU DRAW PEOPLE IN.

387
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,957
PEOPLE ARE DRAWN IN
BY THE GAME...

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,307
AND BY MY NON-THREATENING
GOOD LOOKS.

389
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,874
WELL.
THE PATTER SEDUCES.

390
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,268
IT'S NOT
YOUR STRONG SUIT.

391
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,705
THERE.

392
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,971
DO YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE
PLAY THE SHELL GAME?

393
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,929
BECAUSE THEY THINK
THEY CAN BEAT THE ODDS.WRONG.

394
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,845
THEY THINK
THEY CAN BEAT YOU.

395
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,456
THEY THINK
THEY'RE SMARTER THAN YOU.

396
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,283
IN THIS CASE,
THEY'RE RIGHT.

397
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,850
I'M SMARTER THAN YOU THINK.

398
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,591
ARE YOU SMART ENOUGH
TO PLAY STUPID?

399
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,463
I AM SO SMART,
I'M PRACTICALLY RETARDED.

400
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,772
ARE YOU DRINKING AGAIN?NO.

401
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,687
ARE YOU LYING?AS GOD IS MY WITNESS.

402
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,560
NOW, WHERE'S THE PEA?
FOLLOW THE PEA.

403
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,780
FIVE'LL GET YOU TEN,
TEN'LL GET YOU TWENTY,

404
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:50,955
FIFTY'LL GET YOU A HUNDRED.
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY,

405
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,261
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY,
JUST CATCH IT ONCE.

406
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,654
ONE TIME, ONE TIME,
ONE TIME.

407
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,746
YOU NEED A RHYTHM.

408
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,139
YOU NEED TO HYPNOTIZE
WITH YOUR WORDS.

409
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,097
MM-MM.

410
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,491
I CAN HYPNOTIZE WITH
MY CAT-LIKE MOVEMENT.

411
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:14,588
NOW, HOW SLICK WAS THAT?

412
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,417
THERE'S ONLY ONE MOVEMENT
I CARE ABOUT.

413
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,809
IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY
RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

414
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,029
AND THERE'S NOTHING
CAT-LIKE ABOUT IT.

415
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,030
IT'S UNDER THE ONE
ON THE RIGHT.

416
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,120
WRONG.

417
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:26,817
MY RIGHT.

418
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,475
I CAN DO THIS.

419
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:34,738
[SIGHS]

420
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:38,699
[CLEARS THROAT]

421
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,276
HOW IS THIS
LOW PRIORITY?

422
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,668
IT'S PETTY THEFT,
MISS.

423
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,670
IT'S A VICTIMLESS CRIME.

424
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,672
VICTIMLESS?
THEN WHO THE FUCK AM I?

425
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,587
AND THE LANGUAGE
WON'T MAKE IT
A HIGHER PRIORITY.

426
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,155
DID I WIN ANYTHING?

427
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,506
20 SCRATCH-OFFS,
AND I DIDN'T GET SQUAT?

428
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,813
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

429
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,728
WHO DO I HAVE TO KILL
TO GET SOME ATTENTION
AROUND HERE?

430
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,689
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

431
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,213
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS.

432
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,779
I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE, THANKS.

433
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,346
THANK GOD.

434
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,130
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME, ROXY.
IT WAS A YELLOW BIKE--

435
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:20,523
I CAN READ.

436
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,091
AND IT HAD A BELL,
AND A MISSING TIRE.

437
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,440
GEORGE,
I WILL TREAT THIS

438
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,615
WITH THE RESPECT
IT DESERVES.

439
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,618
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

440
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,186
LOOK, I'M HAPPY
TO FILE A REPORT,
I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP,

441
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,709
BUT DON'T EXPECT
ANYONE AROUND HERE

442
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,145
TO LOOK OUT
FOR YOUR BIKE.

443
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,625
SOMEBODY BROKE THE LAW.

444
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,453
SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY.

445
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,846
YOU'RE ON THE BOOKS, GEORGE.

446
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,805
[GEORGE]:  <i>I'M ON THE BOOKS,</i>

447
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,459
<i>BUT THE BOOKS
DON'T REALLY GIVE A SHIT.</i>

448
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,897
<i>IN THE END,</i>

449
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:48,551
<i>THE LESSON
THE SYSTEM TEACHES YOU</i>

450
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,510
<i>IS PRETTY SIMPLE...</i>

451
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:51,641
<i>YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.</i>

452
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,890
WHAT THE HELL?

453
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,544
IS IT SATURDAY?

454
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,720
[WOMAN]:
NO, ALL-STAFF MEETING.

455
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,112
HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT THERE?

456
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,157
PHONES.

457
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,904
"T.H.E.F.T."

458
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,559
"THIEVES HARM
EVERYONE'S FUN TIMES."

459
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:41,735
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN, PEOPLE.

460
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,825
WHAT DO I MEAN
WHEN I SAY HARM?

461
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,958
HARM WHO? YOU?

462
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,177
OR THE CUTIE
IN THE NEXT CUBICLE?

463
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,703
THE C.E.O.,
THE PRESIDENT,

464
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:54,791
EVERYONE
DOWN THE CHAIN--

465
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,446
SOMEONE STOLE MY BIKE.

466
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,056
AND EVERYONE IN HERE
IS A THIEF

467
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,710
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE...
INCLUDING YOU.

468
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,540
FREAK.OH, DID I MISS A JOKE?

469
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,720
LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

470
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,593
STEALING COMPANY
PROPERTY IS NO JOKE.

471
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,335
PEOPLE THINK,
"OH, THE COMPANY

472
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,380
IS SUCKING AWAY MY LIFE.
I'LL JUST TAKE
SOMETHING BACK."

473
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:19,860
WHO IS THIS GUY?

474
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,775
SECURITY EXPERT,
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE SUPPLY THEFT.

475
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,124
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
A PROMOTION

476
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,604
SO YOU'D SHOW UP
AN HOUR LATE.

477
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,040
I WAS TRYING
TO FIND MY BIKE
SO I COULD GET HERE.

478
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,999
YOU. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

479
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,566
[GEORGE]: MILLIE.

480
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,002
YOU LIKE YOUR
LIFE HERE, MILLIE?

481
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,221
[GEORGE]:  <i>NOT SO MUCH.</i>

482
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,310
TELL HIM YOU'RE HAPPY.I'M REALLY HAPPY.

483
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,790
GOOD.

484
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,183
GOOD, BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT PEOPLE DO

485
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,184
WHEN THEY'RE UNHAPPY,
DON'T YOU?

486
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:43,013
THEY... GET A CAT?

487
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,102
NOT YOU.[MAN]: WRONG.

488
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,887
THEY TAKE STAPLES...

489
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,149
OR ROLLER-BALL PENS...

490
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,543
OR POST-ITS.

491
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,895
PEOPLE WHO DON'T
LIKE THEIR LIVES
TRY TO GET EVEN,

492
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,811
AND THAT MAKES HAPPY TIME

493
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,552
AN UNHAPPY PLACE.

494
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,641
[GEORGE]:  <i>NO MATTER HOW
I TRIED TO PLAY THE GAME,</i>

495
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,730

497

YOU GOT A PROBLEM THERE,

YOU MISSPELLED

507
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,105
DROPPED AN "F."OH, I SEE.

A SMART-ASS.

509
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,589
DON'T YOU MEAN,
"SMART AS"?

510
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,765
[DELORES]: SHH, MILLIE.

511
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,422
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING THERE, MILLIE.

512
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,772
I CAN'T SING.

513
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,990
I CAN'T TAP-DANCE.

514
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,992
I CAN'T TWIRL A RIFLE.

515
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,690
I HAVE ONE TALENT,
MILLIE.

516
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,475
I FIRE TROUBLEMAKERS.

517
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,566
I FIND TROUBLEMAKERS,
AND I FIRE THEM.

518
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,177
THAT'S MY TALENT, MILLIE.
WHAT'S YOURS?

519
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:01,570
[GEORGE]:  <i>YOU DON'T
WANT TO FIND OUT.</i>

520
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,661
WATCH THIS ONE.
I DON'T LIKE HER.

521
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:09,709
R-I-P-O-F.

522
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:11,362
FIGURE IT OUT,

523
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:14,540

THE CROSSES,

I DON'T THINK SO.

731
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,884
ARE YOU CATHOLIC?

732
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:04,972
A LITTLE BIT.

733
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:06,278
SO ARE YOU RUSTY?

734
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,888

BUT YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

736
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,153
NOT EVEN A CHUCKLE?

737
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,416
IS RUSTY YOUR REAL NAME?

738
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,115
NO. I HAD RED HAIR
WHEN I WAS A KID.

739
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,594
MY REAL NAME'S JOHN.JOHN WHAT?

740
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:21,771

00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:24,122

I THINK I CAN GET
A BETTER DEAL
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

744
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,049

BEAUTIFUL THINGS, RUSTY.

750
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,773
FROM ONE CATHOLIC

751
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,601
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
HAVE PLENTY OF MIRRORS,

752
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,168
BUT I WOULD LOVE
ANOTHER CROSS.

753
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:12,605
HELP YOURSELF.

YOU'RE A SWEET MAN, RUSTY.

WAITING OUT THERE FOR YOU.

00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,278
[MASON]: YOU DON'T
EAT THE RIND?

757
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,888
THE RIND'S THE BEST PART,
DARLING. LOOK.

758
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,768
THAT'S FUN
IN THE KITCHEN.

759
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,379
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

760
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,641
YOU ARE SERIOUSLY BEGINNING

761
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,512
TO CREEP ME OUT,
SO PISS OFF.

762
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,166
GO ON, I MEAN IT.
PISS OFF. SHOO.

763
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,472
GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO, GO.

00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:56,083

GUILLOTINE, SIR.

773
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,277
[GEORGE]:  <i>A DAY OF FIRSTS.</i>

774
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,105
<i>FIRST TIME YOU'VE PULLED
INTO THIS DRIVEWAY</i>

775
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,107
<i>SINCE YOU DIED,</i>

776
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,023
<i>FIRST TIME YOU WALK IN
WITHOUT BREAKING IN,</i>

777
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,199
<i>AND MAYBE THE LAST TIME
YOU SEE THE PLACE.</i>

778
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,983
[WOMAN]: HI.
YOU MUST BE MILLIE.

779
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,028
HI.

780
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,813
NICE TO MEET YOU.

781
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,206
I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S A REAL COUP

782
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,556
WHEN A HOUSE ON THIS BLOCK
COMES UP FOR SALE.

783
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,427
MOST PEOPLE
KEEP THESE GEMS

784
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,776
IN THE FAMILY
FOR YEARS.

785
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,343
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL
OPPORTUNITY.

786
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,519
AND YOU'RE SURE
THE FAMILY WON'T
BE HERE, RIGHT?

787
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,651
OH, NO, NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

788
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,305
NO, I THINK
IT'S KIND OF, UM,

789
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,089
I DON'T KNOW, CREEPY

790
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,613
HAVING THE FAMILY
HOVERING AROUND

791
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,397
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THEIR THINGS.

792
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,051
CREEPY MIGHT BE
TOO STRONG A WORD.

793
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,053
NO, IT'S GOOD.

794
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,055
SO, YOU ARE,
UH, SINGLE?

795
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,535
ENGAGED.

796
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:57,971
TO A BANKER.
HE'S AT THE BANK

797
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,234
MAKING SERIOUS BANK.

798
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,844
SO THEN FINANCING--

799
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,281
IS THE LEAST
OF OUR PROBLEMS.

800
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:05,500
WELL, I THINK
IT'S NICE

801
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:06,762
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
ARE INTERESTED

802
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,851
IN A FAMILY HOME
LIKE THIS.

803
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,505
PREPARING
FOR THE FUTURE...

804
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,420
[GEORGE]:  <i>WHAT I WAS
REALLY DOING, OF COURSE,</i>

805
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:13,856
<i>WAS FACING MY PAST.</i>

806
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,600
NOW, WHAT'S SPECIAL
ABOUT THE DESIGN

807
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,776
OF THE INTERIOR
OF THIS HOME
IS THE FLOW.

808
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,128
WHY ARE THEY MOVING?

809
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:26,956
EXCUSE ME?

810
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:29,655
WHERE IS
THE FAMILY GOING?

811
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,613
OH, I WOULDN'T
KNOW THAT.

812
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,616
WELL, WHY ARE THEY LEAVING?

813
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,488
OH, WELL,
THERE IS NO PROBLEM
WITH THE HOUSE ITSELF.

814
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,055
I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.

815
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,275
NO, NO,
THIS PLACE HAS BEEN
PERFECTLY MAINTAINED.

816
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,320
THE MOTHER IS...

817
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,499
WELL, SHE'S VERY
PARTICULAR. MM.

818
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:51,938
IT JUST DOESN'T...

819
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,722
MAKE ANY SENSE.[WOMAN]: NO.

820
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:59,249
I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU THIS,
BUT... THEY LOST A CHILD.

821
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,643
OH, IT WAS VERY SAD.
TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

822
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,384
NOT IN THE HOME,
OF COURSE,

823
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,299
BUT I THINK THAT WAS
THE BEGINNING OF IT.

824
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,387
THE BEGINNING OF WHAT?

825
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,607
THE END OF THE MARRIAGE.

826
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,912
IT'S VERY COMMON.

827
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:11,261
MOST MARRIAGES
CAN'T SURVIVE

828
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,741
THE DEATH
OF A CHILD.

829
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:14,439
I DO LOVE
THOSE DOORS, THOUGH.

830
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,009
[GEORGE]:  <i>AND JUST
AS I DID AS A CHILD,</i>

831
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,708
<i>WHEN FACED WITH SOMETHING
I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR...</i>

832
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:25,406
<i>I HEADED STRAIGHT
FOR MY ROOM.</i>

833
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,060
[WOMAN]: CAN I SHOW YOU
ONE OF THE BEDROOMS, THEN?

834
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,237
OH, UM, THAT'S
A TRICKY HANDLE.

835
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,021
YOU MIGHT WANT TO--

836
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:32,892
...LIFT IT A BIT.

837
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,808
IT'S THE ONLY REAL FLAW

838
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,375
IN AN OTHERWISE
MINT-CONDITION HOUSE,

839
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,072
I CAN ASSURE YOU.

840
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,117
I THINK I'D JUST LIKE
TO GET A FEEL
FOR IT UP HERE...

841
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:42,945
BY MYSELF.

842
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,992
OH, SURE.
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.

843
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:51,389
[GEORGE]:  <i>BUT IT WASN'T
EVEN MY ROOM ANYMORE.</i>

844
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,043
<i>MY PARENTS WERE
GETTING A DIVORCE,</i>

845
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:56,002
<i>AND I DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE A BED TO CRY ON.</i>

846
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,832
<i>WHAT IS IT ABOUT
THE DEATH OF SOMETHING</i>

847
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,008
<i>THAT MAKES PEOPLE
JUST WANT TO
PUT IT IN A BOX?</i>

848
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,971
<i>AND FINALLY,
THERE I WAS...</i>

849
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,416
<i>BUT THERE WAS
NO PLACE FOR ME.</i>

850
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,288
<i>I JUST DIDN'T FIT.</i>

851
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:28,469
DID MILLIE
EVER COME BACK?

852
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,473
I WANTED HER
TO DO THIS TONIGHT.

853
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,649
[WOMAN]: JUST DON'T SING <i>
"WE ARE THE WORLD"</i>AGAIN.

854
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,259
POUR ONE
APPLE MARTINI
IN YOU,

855
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,131
AND IT'S 1983.

856
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:39,741
DELORES, DO YOU
WANT TO COME

857
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:41,264
TO THE KARAOKE
HAPPY HOUR WITH US?

858
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:43,571
OH, I CAN'T. I'VE GOT
RESPONSIBILITIES.

859
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:44,746
OH, COME ON, DELORES.

860
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,008
EVERYONE'S
GOING TO BE THERE.

861
00:40:57,846 --> 00:40:59,239
WELL, BACK TO
THE SALT MINES.

862
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,947
[GEORGE]:  <i>ROCK-STAR PARKING.</i>

863
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:13,775
<i>LUCKY ME.</i>

864
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,044
[♪♪]

865
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,536
[RUBE]: WHAT'S THAT?A MUSTANG.

866
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,451
TEMPS MUST BE
DOING REALLY WELL
IN THIS NEW ECONOMY.

867
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,194
DID YOU STEAL IT?NOT EXACTLY.

868
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:43,544
DID YOU BUY IT?

869
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:45,938
HMM, NOT EXACTLY.

870
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:46,982
WELL, HOW'D YOU
GET IT, EXACTLY?

871
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,985
I THINK I WAS
SUPPOSED TO GET IT.

872
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:51,509
THAT WHOLE BALANCE THING.

873
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:57,602
I HAD A REALLY
BAD DAY, RUBE.

874
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:03,956
I THINK I WAS
SUPPOSED TO GET IT.

875
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,873
OKAY.

876
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,135
SEEN THIS KID TODAY,
THIS MORNING,

877
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:12,181
LOUIS PICK,
19 YEARS OLD.

878
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,098
HE STOLE $17,
WAS KILLED
RUNNING AWAY.

879
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:17,665
HE'S NOT A BAD GUY.

880
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:20,276
NEVER STOLE
ANYTHING IN HIS LIFE.
HE WAS JUST HUNGRY.

881
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,410
HE WAS 19, YOU WERE 18.

882
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,978
WHAT ELSE DID IT SAY
ABOUT ME, ON THE LIST,

883
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,762
BEFORE YOU WROTE MY NAME
ON THE POST-IT?

884
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:32,941
IT SAID THAT YOU DID NOT
HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

885
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,424
AND YOU DIDN'T
GET THAT CAR

886
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:38,556
'CAUSE SOMEONE
STOLE YOUR BIKE.

887
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:42,298
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

888
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,997
MY PARENTS
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

889
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,130
LOOKING TO BLAME
SOMEONE FOR THAT?

890
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,176
I DON'T KNOW.

891
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:52,744
SWEETHEART?

892
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:54,267
MY EXPERIENCE,

893
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:57,400
THE DEATH OF A CHILD
DOESN'T KILL A MARRIAGE.

894
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,362
SOMETIMES IT GIVES IT
AN OVERDUE BURIAL,

895
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:03,885
BUT YOU CAN BLAME
YOURSELF IF YOU WANT TO.

896
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,280
THAT, YOUNG LADY,
WOULD BE UNFAIR.

897
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:12,328
SEE YOU TOMORROW?

898
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,337
DO ME A FAVOR?

899
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:23,165
BRING MY FRIEND A BOWL
OF CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

900
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,013
[GEORGE]:  <i>TONIGHT,
SOMEWHERE ELSE,</i>

901
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,058
<i>MAYBE THERE'S
A DIFFERENT GIRL</i>

902
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:47,450
<i>WHO'S DODGING A BULLET,</i>

903
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:48,756
<i>OR STEPPING
OUT OF THE PATH</i>

904
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,714
<i>OF A SPEEDING TRAIN,</i>

905
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,716
<i>A GIRL WHO'S LUCKY.</i>

906
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:52,673
<i>I DON'T KNOW...</i>

907
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,941
<i>I FIGURED THAT SINCE
I HIT A PRETTY HARSH</i>

908
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:02,248
<i>STRETCH OF BAD LUCK
WHEN I WAS 18,</i>

909
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,728
<i>YOU KNOW, THAT WHOLE</i>

910
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:05,860
<i>"TOILET SEAT FALLING
FROM THE SKY</i>

911
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:08,123
<i>AND INCINERATING ME"
KIND OF BAD LUCK,</i>

912
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,735
<i>I FIGURED
IT WOULD BE REASONABLE</i>

913
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,693
<i>TO EXPECT A CHANGE
OF FORTUNE
ON THE OTHER SIDE.</i>

914
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:25,837
<i>WHY SHOULDN'T I GET
THE BOOKS TO BALANCE?</i>

915
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,102
<i>WHY SHOULDN'T I
MAKE THINGS ADD UP?</i>

916
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:43,202
<i>I'M TIRED
OF PLAYING BY THE RULES.</i>

917
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:46,118
<i>I WANT TO BE BAD.</i>

918
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:47,075
<i>I WANT TO HAVE FUN.</i>

919
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,689
<i>I WANT TO KEEP
STEALING BACK PIECES</i>

920
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,560
<i>FROM WHERE MY LIFE
USED TO BE.</i>

921
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:57,695
<i>I'M JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE...</i>

922
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,220
<i>AND I'M READY
TO EVEN THE SCORE.</i>
