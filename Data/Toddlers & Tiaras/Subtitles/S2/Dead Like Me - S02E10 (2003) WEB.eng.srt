530
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:22,879
YES!

531
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:24,925
REGGIE.

532
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,666
HI, REGGIE.

533
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,494
I'M ANGELO.
YOU REMEMBER ME?

534
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,278
YOU OWNED THE APARTMENT
WE LOOKED AT.

535
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,411
YEAH.

536
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,108
YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
FOR THIS EVENING, REGGIE?

537
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,503
WELL, YOU DO NOW.

538
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,462
COOL.

539
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:41,507
WELL, LET'S GO.

540
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,422
I'M CHANGING.

541
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,385
THIS, JOSEPH,
IS A SYSTEM.

542
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:54,607
EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE,
LAID OUT.

543
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,218
YOU CAN TOUCH IT.
YOU CAN SEE IT.

544
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,655
SURE, BUT
NO INTERNET PORN.

545
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:02,658
SOMEONE EVER TELL YOU

546
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,443
THAT STUFF'LL
MAKE YOU GO BLIND?

547
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,487
ACCEPTABLE RISK.

548
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:09,926
HEY, HERE'S A BIRTH
CERTIFICATE FOR A ROSE SOFER.

549
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,232
THAT HELP?

550
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,233
LUCY'S DAUGHTER.

551
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:35,038
LET'S MAKE A PILE FOR
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, HUH?

552
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,781
MAN, THIS SHIT IS OLD...

553
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,524
LIKE, 80 YEARS.

554
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,700
FUCKING... INDIANS STILL
ROAMING THE PLAINS.

555
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,661
YOU SMOKE A LOT
OF MARIJUANA, JOEY?

556
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,445
NOT TILL AFTER WORK.

557
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,971
YOU'D THINK SOMEONE
BURNING TO A CRISP

558
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,452
WOULD HAVE THINNED OUT
THE CROWD A LITTLE.

559
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,888
JUST BY ONE, I'M AFRAID.

560
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,803
I WASN'T
TALKING TO YOU.

561
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,022
BUT YOU
DESPERATELY WANT TO.

562
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,806
WANT TO LET ME
BUY YOU A DRINK OR NOT?

563
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,155
YOU DO WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO.

564
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,635
NOTED.

565
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,681
MACY? I'LL HAVE
ONE MORE. THANKS.

566
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:11,988
SO, WHAT,
PEOPLE AROUND HERE

567
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,686
JUST DON'T CARE
THAT A MAN DIED?

568
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,557
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

569
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:16,906
DEATH DOESN'T SCARE ME.

570
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,951
NOTED.

571
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,084
YOU WANT A DRINK,
SWEETHEART?

572
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,216
A SHOT OF TEQUILA.

573
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,478
WHAT KIND?

574
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,045
WHATEVER'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE.
HE'S BUYING.

575
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:28,831
SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

576
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,398
THAT'S A LITTLE PERSONAL.

577
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:31,573
I-- I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD BACK OFF.

578
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,706
FUNNY BOY.

579
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:36,056
I KNOW IT'S RAY.

580
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,231
THEN WHY DID YOU ASK?

581
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:39,015
JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION.

582
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,887
I THINK WE'VE MOVED PAST
THAT LITTLE NUMBER.

583
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,105
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE.

584
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,760
OKAY.

585
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:46,588
THEN WHY DON'T WE START
WITH YOUR NAME,

586
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,372
AND WE'LL GO ON
FROM THERE.

587
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,070
THAT'S A LITTLE PERSONAL,
BUT THANKS FOR THE COCKTAIL.

588
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,988
I WANT HER.

589
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,206
WHOEVER SHE IS.

590
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,735
HEY, BARKEEP, <i>
DOS CERVEZAS, POR FAVOR,</i>

591
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:03,997
THEN  <i>DOS</i>MORE.

592
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,651
<i>GRACIAS.</i>

593
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:09,176
GEORGIE, SOME VAGUE
NOTION OF IMMORTALITY
NOTWITHSTANDING,

594
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,786
THAT IS NOT A PROPER WAY
TO DRIVE A CAR,

595
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,353
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,
I HOPE ONE OF THESE
BEERS IS MINE.

596
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,484
NO.

597
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:14,877
YOU MADE IT.

598
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,010
THANK GOD.
SHE IS IN SUCH
A BLOODY BAD MOOD.

599
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,968
YOU FINISHING THAT?

600
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,669
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
IT SMELLS LIKE
BUFFALO WINGS.

601
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,932
YEAH, THAT'S BUDDY.
HE GOT BURNED.

602
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,847
GOOD. ONE LESS MAN
IN THE WORLD.

603
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,413
[BELCHES]
EXCUSE ME.

604
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:30,676
UGH.

605
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,373
HI. I'M RAY.

606
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,114
FUCK YOU, RAY.

607
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,594
NICE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU GUYS.

608
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,420
RAY, THIS IS MASON--

609
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,901
MASON, RAY--

610
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,773
AND GEORGE.
CURIOUS GEORGE.

611
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,078
SO, DAISY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

612
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:42,862
I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST THE THREE OF US.

613
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:44,907
DAISY?

614
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,126
DAISY ADAIR.

615
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,693
[RAY CHUCKLES]

616
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,520
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO, RAY?

617
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:51,131
I'M A TELEVISION PRODUCER,
GEORGE.

618
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:52,785
SO YOU'RE RICH?

619
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:53,873
COMFORTABLE.

620
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,352
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE CHARMING.

621
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,615
TOLERABLE.

622
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,269
AND WOMEN JUST FALL
THE FUCK ALL OVER YOU.

623
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,054
NOT YOU, I SUSPECT.

624
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,490
GEORGIA,
YOU'RE BEING IMPOLITE.

625
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:03,839
NO, NO,
IT'S OKAY.

626
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:04,927
EVERYBODY LIKES ME
EVENTUALLY.

627
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,494
OKAY, DAISY, I NEED
A WORD WITH YOU.

628
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:07,364
I DON'T THINK SO.

629
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,714
[BELCHES]

630
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,585
SO, WHAT'S YOUR DEAL,
ASSHOLE?

631
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,065
OH, I'M JUST HAPPY
TO MAKE A NEW FRIEND,

632
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,283
DAISY HERE.

633
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:14,502
DAISY, REALLY,
A WORD.

634
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,721
REALLY, NOT NOW.

635
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,157
RAY. IS IT RAY?

636
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,680
RAY. RAY, HEY.

637
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,813
SO HAS DAISY TOLD YOU
OF HER EXTENSIVE--

638
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,205
SOME MIGHT SAY
INTIMATE--

639
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,946
KNOWLEDGE OF
ERROL FLYNN?

640
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,035
OH, YEAH?
I LOVE THOSE OLD MOVIES.

641
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,080
EXCUSE US.

642
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,650
YOUR FLY'S UNDONE.

643
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,001
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

644
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:36,785
I TOLD YOU.

645
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,873
I'M WORRIED ABOUT GEORGE.

646
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,007
SHE'S BEEN ACTING REALLY ODD.

647
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,661
YOU JUST SAW IT
BACK THERE, DIDN'T YOU?

648
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,445
SHE'S GOT A CRUSH ON A BOY.
SHE'LL BE FINE.

649
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,403
YOU DON'T
FUCKING UNDERSTAND.

650
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,797
EARLIER, IT WAS SHOUTING,
IT WAS MAYHEM,

651
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:49,972
IT WAS CHAOS, ALL RIGHT?

652
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,495
GEORGE IS A BIG GIRL,

653
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,933
AND EVEN
IF SHE'S NOT A BIG GIRL,

654
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:56,500
SHE'S A DEAD GIRL.
SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY,

655
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,067
AND IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

656
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,634
I'M KIND OF IN THE
MIDDLE OF SOMETHING,
SO EXCUSE ME--

657
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,157
JUST FUCKING WAIT.

658
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,463
WHAT IS IT, MASON?

659
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,639
ALL RIGHT.

660
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,208
I'VE ALWAYS
FOUND YOUR STORIES
CHARMINGLY NAUGHTY.

661
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,514
THE LEGENDARY
BLOWJOBS OF YORE.

662
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,605
THEY WERE ALL QUITE ROMANTIC
IN THEIR FASHION, YOU KNOW?

663
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,348
THANK YOU.

664
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:20,307
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN YOU
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

665
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,701
I'M NOT WITH HIM.

666
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:29,969
I'M SORRY.

667
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,013
I HAVE TO CHECK MY ROUGE.

668
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,148
WELL, MASON,
I GUESS IT'S TIME

669
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,106
FOR YOU TO GET
PRETTY WELL SHITFACED.

670
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,893
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS JUST PULL ON IT

671
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,156
A LITTLE BIT, LIKE THAT,
AND IT TURNS.

672
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,897
GOOD. GOOD.

673
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,420
IF YOU WANT IT
TO TURN FASTER,

674
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,639
YOU JUST PUNCH OUT
INTO THE AIR.

675
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:50,032
JUST A LITTLE.
JUST A LITTLE.

676
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,120
GOOD.

677
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,687
OH! NO!

678
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,908
I'M TERRIBLE
AT THIS.

679
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:56,909
JUST TAKES PRACTICE.

680
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,084
YOU GO LAUNCH IT.

681
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,651
YOU HAVING FUN?

682
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,784
YEAH. YEAH.

683
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,351
NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I'D HOPED FOR,

684
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:05,569
BUT...

685
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,006
WHAT DID YOU WANT?

686
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,399
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT WE'D HAVE
A LITTLE DINNER,

687
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:11,184
MAYBE A COUPLE
OF GLASSES OF WINE,

688
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,186
SOME AWKWARD
CONVERSATION,

689
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,404
AND THEN I ATTACK YOU.

690
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,061
OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

691
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:20,323
MM-HMM.

692
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,283
ALL RIGHT, REGGIE,
TOSS IT UP IN THE AIR!

693
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,328
NICE.

694
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,460
OKAY.

695
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:27,853
I'M READY.
MY TURN.READY?

696
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:29,158
SHOW ME WHAT TO DO.

697
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,770
ALL RIGHT, NOW.
GOOD.

698
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,946
HOLD ON.

699
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,425
DON'T LET GO, OKAY?

700
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:37,732
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

701
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,125
JUST DON'T LET GO.

702
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,040
<i>THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT KITES.</i>

703
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,476
<i>YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON TIGHT</i>

704
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,521
<i>SO THEY CAN FIGHT
AGAINST THE WIND...</i>

705
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,828
THAT'S IT, GEORGIA.
THAT'S GOOD. HANG ON.

706
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,264
