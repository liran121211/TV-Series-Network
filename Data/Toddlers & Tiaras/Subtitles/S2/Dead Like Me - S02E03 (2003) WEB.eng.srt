269
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,812
PUTTING FOOD ON THE FLOOR
DOESN'T MAKE IT A PICNIC.

SURE.YOU EVER WAIT TABLES?

286
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,593
HARDER THAN DIGGING A DITCH.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT

287
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,769
AND SEE WHAT A REAL JOB IS.
IT IS A NOBLE VOCATION.

288
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,989

289
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:11,818

I HAVE TWO REAL JOBS.

RETREAT TOMORROW.

292
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:17,780
PIE'S NICE.

293
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:18,781
DID YOU HEAR ME?

294
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,348
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

295
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,741
I USED TO TREAT THE CRUST

296
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,786
LIKE IT WAS JUST THERE
TO HOLD THE GOOD STUFF IN.

297
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,136
I USED TO LEAVE
THE WHOLE BACK END OF IT
ON THE PLATE.

298
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,401
BUT AS I GOT OLDER,
I LEARNED TO APPRECIATE CRUST.

299
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,621
STAYING ON THE OUTSIDE,
LOOKING IN,

300
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:35,319
IT'S NOT REALLY
THE BEST WAY TO LAY LOW.

301
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,887
THE MORE I STAY
OUT OF THE GROUP,

302
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:38,975
THE MORE THEY NOTICE ME.

303
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,803
THAT'S BAD.

304
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:41,935
YOU LEARN THAT
THE CRUST AND PIE

305
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,023
ARE TWO VERY
DIFFERENT RECIPES.

306
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,502
ULTIMATELY, THEY CO-MINGLE,

307
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:48,637
BUT THEY ARE
VERY SEPARATE ENTITIES.
