1
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,721
[GEORGE]:  <i>I'VE NEVER
BELONGED TO A CLUB.</i>

2
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,115
<i>I MEAN, I GET THEM,
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE IN THEM.</i>

3
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,986
<i>LIKE BOOK CLUBS.</i>

4
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,380
<i>"HEY,
CHECK OUT HOW SMART WE ARE.
WE CAN READ."</i>

5
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:17,990
<i>SHUT UP, ALREADY.</i>

6
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,297
<i>AND BICYCLE CLUBS.
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?</i>

7
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,300
<i>ONE GUY IN A BAD OUTFIT,
YOU'RE A TOOL.</i>

8
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:26,477
<i>FOUR GUYS
IN THE SAME GOOFY SHIRT,
SUDDENLY, YOU'RE THE SHIT?</i>

9
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,349
<i>GIVE ME A BREAK.</i>

10
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:31,352
<i>MY PARENTS ALWAYS TOLD ME
TO JOIN SOME CLUB AT SCHOOL,</i>

11
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:34,006
<i>ANY CLUB AT ALL,
JUST PICK A CARD,</i>

12
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,356
<i>BUT I DIDN'T,</i>

13
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,272
<i>AND THEN A CLUB
FINALLY PICKED ME.</i>

14
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,839
<i>I DON'T THINK THIS IS
WHAT MY PARENTS HAD IN MIND.</i>

15
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,973
DID YOU ROB A GRAVE
OR SOMETHING?NO.

16
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,714
I WAS COMBING THROUGH
SOMEBODY'S GARBAGE

17
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,194
LOOKING FOR THEIR
CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS.

18
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:52,112
THAT'S TERIYAKI SAUCE.
HERE, SMELL.NOT WHILE I'M EATING.

19
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,854
WELL, YOUR FINGERNAILS
COULD USE A LITTLE SPA TIME.

20
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,247
AW, THANKS.

21
00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,858
NOT WHILE I'M EATING.

22
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,991
OH, BLOODY HELL.

23
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,472
SORRY, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WOULD DO THAT
AT THE TABLE.

24
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,387
I CAN'T WIN
WITH YOU PEOPLE,
CAN'T I?

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,389
YOU'RE MOANING ABOUT
MY PERSONAL HYGIENE.

26
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,173
YOU'RE GOING ON
ABOUT MY ETIQUETTE.

27
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,262
I CAN'T FUCKING WIN.

28
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,046
MASON, IF YOU WEREN'T
A REAPER, WHERE WOULD
YOU BE RIGHT NOW?

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,918
DEAD.BUT IF YOU WEREN'T DEAD.

30
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,049
I'D BE DEAD.

31
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:20,618
I'D BE BACK IN COLLEGE,
A SOPHOMORE.

32
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:21,924
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU
GLAD YOU'RE DEAD.

33
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:26,972
[CRYING]

34
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,673
IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR THIS CRAP.
WE'RE MOVING.

35
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,240
WE'VE ORDERED.

36
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,198
THEY'LL FIGURE OUT.
THEY'RE
REALLY SMART HERE.

37
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,765
LET'S GO.

38
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:44,990
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,776
NOTHING, KIFFANY, THANK YOU.

40
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:48,864
YOU'RE NOT ORDERING
BREAKFAST TODAY?

41
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,213
NO, I'VE HAD BREAKFAST.

42
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,781
WHERE DID YOU EAT?

43
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,565
HUNGRY PETE'S,
JUST DOWN THE STREET.

44
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,089
ESCAPE FROM ROUTINE,
IT IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL.

45
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,656
HOW WAS IT?

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,702
AWFUL.
NEVER GOING BACK.

47
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,880
A TICKET TO CANCUN,
FIRST CLASS?
ARE YOU SHITTING ME?

48
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,361
THERE'S A POST-IT ON IT,
DUMB ASS.

49
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,711
IF YOU ARE PUTTING ME
ON A PLANE THAT'S GOING DOWN,
I SWEAR TO GOD--

50
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,495
I CAN'T SWIM, RUBE.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

51
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,541
THERE'S ONE
POST-IT EACH.

52
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,805
ODDS ARE THERE ARE
MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE
ON THAT PLANE.

53
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,634
ODDS ARE IF
THE PLANE GOES DOWN,
EVERYONE'S GOING TO DIE.

54
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:22,550
ODDS ARE THAT PLANE
AIN'T GOING DOWN.

55
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,029
PRESIDENT OF THE MATH CLUB?

56
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,727
JUST SMARTER
THAN MASON.

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,076
REALLY?

58
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,078
WELL, LOOK AT YOU...

59
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:30,819
WHAT'S
THE MONTGOMERY CLUB?

60
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,169
OLD-LINE COUNTRY CLUB,
BEAUTIFUL GOLF COURSE,

61
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,127
OLD MONEY, BIG MONEY.

62
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,607
MONEY MONEY.

63
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:39,131
DON'T GET LOST ON THE GREEN.

64
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,524
SHE GETS A VIP REAP
LAST WEEK,

65
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,179
AND THIS WEEK...
MONTGOMERY CLUB?

66
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,311
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

67
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:45,660
WELL, THAT'S NOT MY CALL.

68
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,618
HUMOR ME?

69
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,011
GIVE YOURSELF
EXTRA TIME.

70
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,622
SEE HOW THAT OTHER HALF LIVES.

71
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,407
ISN'T THAT WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING?

72
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,974
NOTHING FOR ME TODAY?NO, NOTHING FOR YOU TODAY.

73
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,237
WHAT'S YOURS?

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,022
ME, I'VE GOT A
1019 WEST SLANE STREET

75
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,893
OUTSIDE ROOM 216.

76
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,069
SOUNDS LIKE A HOTEL.
MAYBE A MURDER.

77
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,245
MAYBE.

78
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,202
I'M KIND OF IN THE MOOD
FOR A MURDER.

79
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,247
HMM.

80
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:12,034
WHAT IS THIS?

81
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:16,604
THAT, MY DEAR,
IS THE VERY SAME ORGANIC
WHOLE GRAIN BANANA NUT BREAD

82
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:22,566
THAT WON ME A BLUE RIBBON
AT THE NEW MEXICO
STATE FAIR IN 1975.

83
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,307
WHY WERE YOU
IN NEW MEXICO?

84
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,397
I WAS MANAGING A LLAMA RANCH
OUTSIDE OF SANTA FE.

85
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,009
IT SMELLS BAD.

86
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,577
ARE YOU ALWAYS SO AFRAID
OF TRYING SOMETHING NEW?

87
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,275
IF I THINK IT CAME OUT OF
A LLAMA'S BUTT.

88
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,842
FINE.

89
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,584
BE A CONFORMIST.
HAVE CAP'N CRUNCH.

90
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,021
MOM NEVER TOLD ME
SHE LIVED ON A LLAMA RANCH.

91
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,284
THAT'S BECAUSE
MOM NEVER DID.

92
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,068
YOUR MOM WAS
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE

93
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:50,246
WHILE HER MOM
WAS 800 MILES AWAY
SPREADING HER WINGS.

94
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,467
SANTA FE
WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

95
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,338
YOU AND YOUR SISTER
WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.

96
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,035
I WANT TO GO.

97
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,083
HONEY, MY LIFE IS
FILLED WITH STORIES.

98
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:05,783
STORIES DON'T HAPPEN
TO PEOPLE
WHO JUST STAY INSIDE.

99
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,524
REGGIE, GO GET READY
FOR SCHOOL.

100
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:08,699
I WANT TO HEAR MORE STORIES.

101
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,572
AFTER SCHOOL.

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,401
DID YOU KNOW
THAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER
ONCE DID TIME?

103
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,185
YOU WERE IN JAIL?MOM...

104
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,450
DID YOU STEAL SOMETHING?

105
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,932
I WAS IN JAIL
BECAUSE RICHARD NIXON
WAS A LIAR AND AN ASSHOLE.

106
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,414
ALL RIGHT. REGGIE? NOW.

107
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,726
THAT SO DOES NOT WORK
FOR ME.

108
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,598
WHAT?

109
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,731
I CAN'T LISTEN TO YOU
TELL STORY AFTER STORY
ABOUT YOUR SELFISHNESS

110
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,734
AND THEN CALL IT
A LIFE PHILOSOPHY.

111
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:46,171
I WAS A CONCERNED
AMERICAN CITIZEN.

112
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,825
I WANTED
THE WHITE HOUSE
TO HEAR MY VOICE.

113
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,305
I WAS 11.

114
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,220
I WANTED A RIDE HOME
FROM SCHOOL.

115
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,962
SO TELL ME, JOY,
DID YOU GET HOME
FROM SCHOOL THAT DAY?

116
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,008
YOU CANNOT, IN FRONT
OF AN IMPRESSIONABLE CHILD,

117
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,749
BRAG ABOUT GOING TO JAIL.

118
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,623
SHE'S 12.
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

119
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,973
SHE'S 11,
AND THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL.

120
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,368
SO ARE YOU PICKING ME UP
AFTER SCHOOL, GRANDMA?

121
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,547
ABSOLUTELY.

122
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,244
OKAY. BYE.

123
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,551
WE'LL HAVE
AN ADVENTURE,
SOMETHING WEIRD.

124
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,030
COOL.

125
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:25,428
LITTLE GIRLS LOVE ADVENTURES.

126
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:28,475
AT LEAST, MOST OF THEM DO.

127
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,302
YOU RUN AWAY
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

128
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:32,827
AND THEN YOU PARADE IT
AROUND YOU
LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR.

129
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,002
IT'S JUST BEYOND ME.

130
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:37,440
I DON'T RUN AWAY.
I RUN TOWARDS.

131
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:39,703
OH, PRETTY.

132
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:40,922
WHY DON'T YOU
NEEDLE-POINT THAT ON
A PILLOW FOR ME, HUH?

133
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,793
IT'S NOT MY THING.

134
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,621
NO.

135
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,101
YOU DON'T STICK AROUND
ANYWHERE LONG ENOUGH

136
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,929
TO DO THAT KIND OF PROJECT,
DO YOU?

137
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,148
I INVITED YOU TO ITALY.
YOU SAID NO.

138
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:53,064
MOTHER, YOU DON'T INVITE
A FOURTH GRADER TO ITALY.

139
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,326
YOU EITHER TAKE THEM
OR YOU DON'T.

140
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,980
RIGHT? I MEAN,
MAKE A FUCKING CHOICE.

141
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:01,769
I'M NOT THAT GIRL.

142
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,466
NOT WHAT GIRL?

143
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,947
THE GIRL
CLANCY IS SLEEPING WITH.

144
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,299
STOP TAKING IT OUT ON ME.

145
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,608
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?AWAY FROM YOU.

146
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,830
[GEORGE]: <i>
I GUESS WHEN YOU WANT
TO RUN AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE,</i>

147
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:23,443
<i>YOU JUST MAKE A BREAK FOR IT
AND HOPE NO ONE'S LOOKING.</i>

148
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:34,845
HEY, REGGIE.

149
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,458
IMAGINE YOURSELF
ON THE ISLAND OF KOMODO,

150
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,591
FACE TO FACE
WITH THE TERRIFYING DRAGON
THAT ROAMS ITS SHORES.

151
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,375
THAT'S A KOMODO DRAGON?

152
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,683
YEAH, I'M SHOWING
MY DRAGON TO SEVERAL
CLASSES THIS MORNING.

153
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,337
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
BE MY ASSISTANT?

154
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,947
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

155
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,035
JUST STAND THERE
AND LOOK PRETTY.

156
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:54,996
CAN I TOUCH IT?

157
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,301
DON'T BE ABSURD.

158
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,652
THE KOMODO DRAGON
IS A DANGEROUS CARNIVORE.

159
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,393
HE'LL EAT YOU
LIKE YOU'RE A PIECE
OF TURKEY BALONEY,

160
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,700
WHICH,
IN CASE YOU'RE ALL CURIOUS,
IS HIS FAVORITE.

161
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,485
WHAT'S HIS NAME?FRODO.

162
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,529
WHO?

163
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,400
LIKE THE HOBBIT.

164
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,228
HAVE YOU BEEN DEAD
FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS?

165
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,316
SEVEN.

166
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:17,235
I'M NOT GOING TO HURT HIM.
I JUST WANT TO PET HIM.

167
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,977
FRODO HURTING YOU
IS THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO.

168
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,067
SO, REGGIE,
DO YOU WANT TO BE
MY ASSISTANT?

169
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,765
MRS. BRODY SAID
I COULD PICK ANYBODY.

170
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,550

00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,123
<i>THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE.</i>

699
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,040
COME ON, DAD.LOOK AT HIM.

700
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,302
DON'T DO THIS.

701
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,217
HE LEARNED LIFESAVING
AT JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS.

702
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:24,263
HE REALLY LOVES YOU.

703
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:25,481
HE LIKES YOU.

704
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,484
I'VE SEEN THE WAY
HE LOOKS AT YOU.

705
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,659
SOMETHING
GOING ON THERE.

706
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:32,097
I DON'T...IT WAS
JUST FLIRTING.

707
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,446
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN DOING IT.

708
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,884
SAY GOODBYE TO MY SON,
WHY DON'T YOU?

709
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:41,715
UM, HE'S...BUSY

710
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,021
WITH YOU.

711
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,239
DON'T BE AFRAID.

712
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,241
WELL, SAY SOMETHING.

713
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:47,416
TELL HIM
YOU'RE SORRY.

714
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,378
GOD...OKAY.

715
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:54,728
[GEORGE]:  <i>I LIKE HIM.
DO I SAY, "I'LL CALL YOU"?</i>

716
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:57,078
<i>OR DO I JUST GIVE HIM
MY NUMBER?</i>

717
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,950
<i>THAT'S WHAT DAISY WOULD DO.
SHE'D SAY, "HERE'S MY CARD."</i>

718
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,387
<i>FUCK, HIS DAD JUST DIED.</i>

719
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:04,172
I...

720
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,652
I...

721
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:07,958
I'M JUST SORRY.

722
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,358
I'LL LOOK OUT
FOR HIM.

723
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:17,925
COME ON, PLEASE.

724
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,796
YOU LOOK OUT
FOR HIM, TOO, HUH?

725
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,884
OKAY.

726
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,234
PROMISE?

727
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:23,626
I PROMISE.

728
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:29,676
HI.

729
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:32,548
DID YOU GET REGGIE?YES.

730
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:36,422
COME ON, LEAVE THAT FOR LATER.

731
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,467
I'LL BUY YOU
AN ICE CREAM.

732
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,600
YOU USED TO LOVE
RAINBOW SHERBET, RIGHT?

733
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:45,387
WE NEED TO CHAT ABOUT REGGIE.

734
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:47,563
HER ISSUES ARE REALLY BURIED.

735
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:48,869
I'M DEALING WITH HER ISSUES,
MOM.

736
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,916
I STOPPED USING
TOP AND BOTTOM SHEETS.

737
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,310
I JUST TAKE
A BIG NAVAJO BLANKET,

738
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,530
TOSS IT OVER THE FUTON,

739
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,793
BOOM, BED'S MADE.WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

740
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,403
THE NEXT TIME
I GO CAMPING WITH TONTO,

741
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,057
I'LL BE SURE
TO GIVE THAT A SHOT.

742
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,800
I DON'T THINK
CONVENTIONAL THERAPY
IS THE WAY TO GO, JOY.

743
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:10,369
MY WORD, YOU'RE MAKING
THIS BED SO TIGHT.

744
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,153
YOU KNOW, MOM, IT'S MY BED,

745
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,634
AND I'M MAKING IT
THE WAY THAT I LIKE,

746
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,549
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO LIE IN IT.

747
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,768
TRUER WORDS
WERE NEVER SPOKEN.

748
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:19,682
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT'S TRUE?

749
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:23,033
YOU WOULD RATHER
STAND HERE

750
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:25,514
AND CRITICIZE
HOW I MAKE MY BED

751
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,777
THAN ACTUALLY
HELP ME MAKE IT.

752
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:31,085
YOUR IDEA OF HELP
IS TRYING TO KEEP ORDER.

753
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,522
SOMETIMES ORDER
IS NOT POSSIBLE, JOY.

754
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:36,438
IT IS NOT
ALWAYS POSSIBLE

755
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:39,615
TO MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYTHING...

756
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:42,096
IS IN THE PROPER PLACE.

757
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:46,492
OKAY, "HEY, SHOULD I CALL
MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER

758
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,971
"AND TELL THEM
WHERE I AM?

759
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,582
"NO, I THINK
I'LL JUST SEND THEM

760
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,758
"SOME SMOKE SIGNALS
FROM MY TEEPEE"!

761
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,238
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

762
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,458
YOU ARE SO FUCKING SELFISH.

763
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,895
"HEY, TIME.
WHO NEEDS TIME, RIGHT?

764
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:01,550
I'M A FREE SPIRIT.
I AM WAY BEYOND TIME."

765
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:06,512
"LET'S KEEP EVERYTHING
NEAT AND TIDY.

766
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:08,209
"LET'S MAKE SURE

767
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,603
"THAT EVERYTHING
IS IN ITS PROPER PLACE,

768
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:13,954
"THAT EVERYTHING
IS EXACTLY WHERE I LEFT IT,

769
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:16,696
"THAT NOTHING
WILL EVER CHANGE.

770
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,351
"MY MARRIAGE CAN END,
MY DAUGHTER CAN DIE,

771
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:22,180
BUT THANK GOD
THE HOUSE IS NEAT."

772
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,224
GO TO HELL!

773
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,573
GODDAMMIT, JOY!

774
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,881
SOMETIMES LIFE IS MESSY!

775
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,666
GET USED TO IT!

776
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:39,936
HI, SWEETIE.
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

777
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:41,764
GOOD.

778
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,162
SO...WHO'S UP FOR ICE CREAM?

779
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:59,260
DID YOU KNOW
THAT DUE TO THE KOMODO
DRAGON'S SPEED,

780
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:02,132
IT IS NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE

781
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,004
IF IT'S CHASING YOU?

782
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,006
THINKING ABOUT
GETTING A PET?

783
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:08,443
JUST LEARNING
SOMETHING NEW.

784
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,316
KIFFANY, ARE THERE
ANY OF THOSE FRESH
OATMEAL COOKIES LEFT?

785
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,101
I THINK SO.WILL YOU BRING ONE
FOR MY FRIEND HERE?

786
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,494
WILL YOU WARM IT UP, PLEASE?

787
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:16,538
ALL RIGHT.THANK YOU.

788
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,889
I FEEL SOMETHING BAD COMING.

789
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,282
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT?

790
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:22,936
ANY TIME YOU ORDER ME FOOD,

791
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,460
YOU ALWAYS FOLLOW IT UP
WITH BAD NEWS.

792
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,114
HOW WAS
THE MONTGOMERY CLUB?

793
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,463
FINE.

794
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,725
TELL ME THE BAD NEWS.

795
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,118
THERE'S NO BAD NEWS,
GEORGE.

796
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,513
I JUST WANT
TO LEAVE MY GIRL...

797
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:36,254
WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE.

798
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,043
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?I'M NOT SURE.

799
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,306
WE WERE AT A SCHOOL TODAY.

800
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,873
HE ACTS REALLY STRANGE
AROUND KIDS.

801
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,222
HMM.

802
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,571
STRANGER.

803
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,356
HOW WAS THE MONTGOMERY CLUB?

804
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,794
STUFFY, ENTITLED,
BULLSHIT.

805
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:56,970
I REALLY LIKED IT.

806
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,320
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

807
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,148
I THINK I'M GOING
TO GO BACK.

808
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,454
MM-HMM, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

809
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:03,759
TRIP.

810
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,326
TRIP?

811
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,067
HERE YOU GO,
SWEETHEART.THANK YOU, KIFFANY.

812
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:10,418
TRIP...

813
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:11,506
I KISSED HIM,

814
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,074
AND THEN
I REAPED HIS DAD.

815
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,206
COMPLICATED.

816
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,339
GOOD KISSER?

817
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,994
HMM, SMART, FUNNY...

818
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:21,951
MONEY?

819
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:23,736
PLEASE.

820
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,652
UP UNTIL HIS DAD DIED,

821
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:28,306
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO
BE MY FIRST BOYFRIEND.

822
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,437
MM-HMM, AND NOW?

823
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,701
HE'S MY FIRST BOYFRIEND.

824
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:36,139
WELL...IT'S A LITTLE RISKY,
GEORGIA.

825
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,926
WHAT HAVE
I GOT TO LOSE?

826
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:42,711
EVERYTHING.

827
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,107
I BET EVERYTHING.

828
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,501
OH, WELL,

829
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,938
THEN YOU SAY,
"ALL IN."

830
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,462
ALL IN.RIGHT.

831
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,377
ALL RIGHT, TOO RICH
FOR MY BLOOD.

832
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,465
I FOLD.

833
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,553
LET'S SEE.

834
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,600
OH...

835
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:04,994
OH, WOW.
YOU WIN, YOU WIN.

836
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,996
HERE, HERE. YAY!

837
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,695
UM...

838
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,784
I THINK IT'S YOUR BEDTIME,
REGGIE.

839
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,832
IF YOU WANT TO STAY UP
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER, HONEY,
IT'S OKAY WITH ME.

840
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,360
THAT'S OKAY.

841
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,188
I'M TIRED.
I HAD A LONG DAY.

842
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:26,799
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.'NIGHT.

843
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:29,758
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

844
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,677
JOY, HONEY?

845
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:37,549
HMM?

846
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:38,941
I THINK I'LL GO HOME TOMORROW.

847
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,247
REALLY?

848
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,770
MM-HMM.

849
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,817
WE NEVER DO SEEM
TO FIND A RESTING PLACE,
DO WE?

850
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:47,602
NO.

851
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:50,823
I DON'T MEAN
TO BE HURTFUL, MOM.

852
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,130
NEITHER DO I.

853
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,394
I KNOW.

854
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,396
I COULD ALWAYS COME BACK.

855
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,310
HMM...

856
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,272
SAY IT.

857
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,187
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK.

858
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,493
THANK YOU.

859
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:19,199
I WORRY...ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

860
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:20,940
I KNOW.

861
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:23,943
BOTH OF THEM.

862
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,773
I KNOW.

863
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,477
[GEORGE]:  <i>I THINK THAT
EVERYONE WANTS TO ESCAPE
WHEREVER THEY ARE.</i>

864
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,047
WE NEARLY MADE IT.

865
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,353
TO OUR NEAR ESCAPE.

866
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:44,398
CLINK.

867
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,192
I THINK IT WAS MEANT
TO BE A NARROW ESCAPE,
ACTUALLY, ROXY.

868
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,891
TO THAT TOO.

869
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:00,414
CLINK.

870
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,720
CLINK, YEAH.

871
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,814
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO MEXICO?

872
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:10,685
NO.

873
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:14,123
I'VE NEVER BEEN
ANYWHERE.

874
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:18,301
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN NICE.

875
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,739
ME TOO.

876
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,916
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE
HAD FUN.

877
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,788
ME TOO.

878
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:29,312
[GEORGE]:  <i>PEOPLE DON'T SEEM
REALLY HAPPY WHERE THEY ARE.</i>

879
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:31,445
<i>THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A DIFFERENT PLACE,</i>

880
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,622
<i>A DIFFERENT PERSON,
JUST DIFFERENT.</i>

881
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,537
<i>LIKE MY MOM USED TO SAY,</i>

882
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:39,105
<i>"THE GRASS
IS ALWAYS GREENER..."</i>

883
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:43,239
<i>EVERYONE'S SEARCHING
FOR THE OTHER SIDE.</i>

884
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:46,286
<i>I'M ALREADY THERE,
AND I'M STILL LOOKING.</i>

885
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:47,766
<i>WE'RE SORRY.</i>

886
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,550
<i>YOUR CALL CANNOT BE
COMPLETED AS DIALED.</i>

887
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:52,510
<i>PLEASE CHECK THE NUMBER
AND DIAL AGAIN, OR CALL...</i>

888
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,296
[GEORGE]: <i>
NO ONE WILL ADMIT IT,</i>

889
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:59,952
<i>BUT PEOPLE DESPERATELY WANT
TO BE IN CLUBS,</i>

890
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:03,303
<i>ESPECIALLY THE ONES
THEY CAN'T JOIN,</i>

891
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:06,915
<i>AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
NOW THAT I'VE FOUND THE ONE
I WANT TO BELONG TO...</i>

892
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:21,495
<i>SO I WENT BACK TO THE ONLY ONE
THAT WOULD HAVE ME
FOR A MEMBER.</i>

893
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,541

FOR YOUR FRIENDS, HON?

894
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,020
YEAH.

00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:26,848
I'LL COME BACK.

896
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:31,810
[GEORGE]:  <i>AND JUST BECAUSE
I HAD NO ONE TO TALK TO,</i>

897
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:33,638
<i>DIDN'T MEAN I COULDN'T LISTEN.</i>

898

FOR LUCK?

910
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:15,984

NEW LIFE,
