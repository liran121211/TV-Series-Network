[GEORGE]  <i>SOME PEOPLE
YOU JUST NEVER FORGET.</i>

3
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,599
<i>IT'S LIKE THEY GET
BURNED INTO YOUR BRAIN.</i>

4
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,344
<i>OTHER PEOPLE
MAKE NO IMPRESSION AT ALL.</i>

5
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,563
<i>IT'S LIKE THEY'RE THERE...</i>

6
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,217
<i>AND THEN THEY'RE NOT.</i>

7
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:30,786
CALL IT.

8
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,092
THAT ONE, SLEEPING.

9
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,138
THAT'S NOT A PERSON
UNDER THERE.

10
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,879
IS TOO, CURLED UP.

11
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,054
WHERE ARE THE LEGS?

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,534
MAYBE HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY.

13
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:41,492
ROXY.WHAT?

14
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,278
NOT EVERYBODY MAKES IT
THROUGH LIFE INTACT.

15
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,584
WE ALL DIDN'T GET
A COZY,
COMFORTABLE LIFE

16
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:47,890
IN THE SUBURBS,
LITTLE GIRL.

17
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:49,805
COZY, MAYBE.

18
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,676
COMFORTABLE, NEVER.

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,069
CLOCK IS TICKING.

20
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,157
MAKE YOUR PICK.

21
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,381
HE LOOKS
LIKE A SIMMS.

22
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,991
GO ASK HIM--
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE YOU

23
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,340
A BITE OF HIS
SQUIRREL KEBAB.

RELAX. I'M ON
A MISSION OF MERCY.

35
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,201

EW.

44
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,976
I'VE ALWAYS SAID
LITTERING SHOULD BE
A CAPITAL OFFENSE.

00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,805
PEOPLE. PEOPLE, BACK UP.

46
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,241
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

48
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,201
IS IT MONTANA?

49
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,289
WHO'S MONTANA?

NO I.D.

54
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,259
WHERE THE HELL IS
A. SIMMS?

55
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,869
I WAS ARTHUR SIMMS.

56
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,046

57
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,397

00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,321
NO, DON'T.

80
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:39,714
IT GETS COLD OUT HERE.

81
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,846
HE NEEDS IT.

82
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,935

93
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,836
WELL, CLASS, I GUESS

94
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,925
WE'LL ALL JUST HAVE TO
KEEP STANDING HERE

95
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:20,320
UNTIL MISS LASS DECIDES

96
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,105

NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS.

SO I'M GOING TO CUT YOU
SOME SLACK, BUT--

99
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,764
"SANDY" IS MY
WHITE SLAVE NAME.

100
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:30,808
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE CALLED "RAVEN."

101
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,419
I'M RAVEN.

102
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,030

ISN'T HER SISTER DEAD?

106
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:54,049
HOWARD HUGHES
DIED A DERELICT, YOU KNOW.

107
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,920
HE HADN'T CUT
HIS FINGERNAILS
OR TOENAILS

108
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,357
FOR FIVE YEARS.

109

RICH PEOPLE
HAVE ALL THE FUN.

110
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,404
I SAW A PICTURE.
HE WAS NASTY.

111
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,579
NO, NOT WHEN
I KNEW HIM.

112
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:04,059
HE WAS QUIRKY,
BUT HANDSOME.

113
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,365
WHEN HOWARD HUGHES DIED,

114
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,281
400 PEOPLE
CLAIMED TO BE HIS HEIRS.

115
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,022

116
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,328

00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,115
$2 BILLION?
BILLION?

119
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,684
THAT'S-- HANG ON.
THAT'S $2 BILLION
DIVIDED BY 22 PEOPLE,

120
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,642
THAT EQUALS...

121
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,515
THAT EQUALS A FUCKLOAD
OF MONEY EACH.

122
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,474
GEORGE, YOU SHOULD
GO TO THE MORGUE

123
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,823
AND GIVE JOHN DOE
HIS NAME BACK.

124
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,607
TRIED THAT ALREADY.
IT DIDN'T WORK.

125
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,435
WELL, WE COULD BE
DISTANT RELATIONS.

126
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,828
HE COULD BE LOADED.

127
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,569
WE NEED
TO GET DOWN THERE.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

128
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,353
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS
DOWN AT THAT MORGUE.

129
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,050
I HAVE NO BUSINESS
DOWN AT THAT MORGUE?

130
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,878
ALL OF OUR BUSINESS
IS DOWN AT THAT MORGUE.

JUST DO YOUR JOB.

132
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,101
THOSE ARE
VERY STRONG WORDS

FOR A BOSS
WHO WENT A.W.O.L.

134
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,235
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
SHOW US THOSE SLIDES
FROM YOUR VACATION?

135
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,500
OR WAS IT A BUSINESS TRIP?

136
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,372
I THINK WE'RE DONE
TALKING ABOUT ME.

137
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,721
WE NEVER STARTED
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

138
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,114
WELL, THEN YOU'LL
HAVE TO BEGIN

139
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,898
WITHOUT THE BENEFIT
OF MY PARTICIPATION.

140
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,641
I HAVE REAL BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO.

141
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,647
YOU KNOW WHAT?WHAT?

142
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,997
GO TO THE FUCKING MORGUE
IF YOU WANT TO.

143
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,043
SLIDE YOUR DEAD
DRUNKEN ASS
INTO A DRAWER

144
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,958
WITH SOME OTHER
DEAD DRUNK.

00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,220
TAKE A NAP
IN A BODY BAG.

146
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,657
I DON'T CARE.

147
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:23,573
HE'S CHANGED, ISN'T HE?

148
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,445
YEAH. WHERE DID HE GO
ON THOSE DAYS OFF?

149
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:27,925
ROXY?

150
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,884
HE DIDN'T TELL ME SHIT.

151
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,712
ANYWAY, HE'S GONE.

152
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,323
GEORGE, YOU NEED TO LEARN
A FEW THINGS

153
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,280

163
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,170
THAT'S BETWEEN ME AND HIM.

164
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,433
I HOPE SO.SO ARE YOU?

167
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,307
I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL
THAT LIKES TO KISS AND TELL.

168
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:03,395
SINCE WHEN?

169
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,788

THEN YOU SHOULD COME DOWN.
RAY WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU.

172
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,272
I WILL.

AND YOU, TOO, GEORGE.

174
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,667
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
DIDN'T CARE FOR RAY MUCH.

175
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,495
YEAH, RAY IS AN ASSHOLE,
ISN'T HE?

176
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,192

355
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,230
WE WERE PLANNING
ON GETTING TOGETHER.
WE HAD...

356
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,973
SCHEDULING ISSUES.

357
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,454
I ALWAYS WONDER
HOW MY CLIENTS
END UP WHERE THEY DO--

358
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,021
ON THE FRINGES, YOU KNOW?

359
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,197
AND THEN I RUN INTO
SOME FAMILY MEMBER

360
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,720
WHO DOESN'T GIVE TWO SHITS,

361
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,722
AND THAT'S IT,
THE MYSTERY'S SOLVED.

362
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,116
I GIVE A SHIT.

363
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,422
NOT TWO.

364
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,945
OH, IS THAT WHY
THE COUNTY'S TAKING
CARE OF HIM?

365
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:17,079
I JUST DON'T HAVE 400 BUCKS
LYING AROUND.

366
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,603
YEAH, AND SINCE YOU LEFT HIM
TO CHARITY HIS WHOLE LIFE,
WHY CHANGE NOW?

367
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,605
I'M SO SICK
OF YOU PEOPLE!

368
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,259
SHAME ON YOU.

369
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,828
A LITTLE HEADS-UP
ON THE DEAD, MICKEY.

370
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,395
PUT THEM
IN A MARBLE TEMPLE,

371
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,918
STICK THEM IN A COFFEE CAN,

372
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,615
EITHER WAY,
THEY DON'T CARE.

373
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:32,834
THEY'RE DEAD.

374
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,360
<i>I'M GOING TO HELL.</i>

375
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,493
<i>OR MAYBE
I'M STAYING HERE FOREVER.</i>

376
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,277
MILLIE,
WHAT WAS THAT?

377
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,367
OH, IT'S NOTHING, DELORES.

378
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,065
JUST A FAMILY THING.

379
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,632
MILLIE, IS HE
ASKING YOU FOR MONEY?

380
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,200
BECAUSE MY COUSIN, LOUIS,
TOOK ME FOR A TIDY SUM,

381
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,375
NEVER PAID IT BACK,

382
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,203
AND NOW HE LIVES
IN ECUADOR

383
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,075
WITH A MAN SERVANT
AND EVERYTHING--

384
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,728
NO, DELORES,
SOMEONE DIED.

385
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:58,990
SOMEONE CLOSE?

386
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,818
NO, IT'S JUST
THE MONEY'S FOR HIS BURIAL,

387
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,081
AND I DON'T HAVE IT.

388
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,257
HOW MUCH?$400.

389
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,564
WELL, SILLY,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK.

390
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:08,696
FAMILY EMERGENCY.

391
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,437
THAT'S WHAT ADVANCES
ARE FOR, MILLIE.

392
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,482
I'LL GET A CHECK CUT FOR YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

393
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,225
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU CARED SO MUCH.

394
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,141
<i>NEITHER DID I.</i>

395
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:28,107
HEY, J.D.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

396
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,804
I DON'T DO
PREPPY DOGS.

397
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,459
WELL, HE'S NOT PREPPY.

398
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:33,851
HE IS.

399
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,157
GET HIM
AWAY FROM ME.

400
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,161
MOM! COME GET J.D.

401
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,989
REGGIE, YOU DON'T
NEED TO SHOUT.

402
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,382
I'M RIGHT HERE.

403
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:45,646
HELLO.

404
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,735
HELLO.

405
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,824
GUESS YOU DON'T
REMEMBER ME,
MRS. LASS?

406
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,001
OH, MY GOD...

407
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:56,135
SANDY SIMONS, IS THAT YOU
UNDER ALL THAT EYELINER?

408
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:57,962
IN THE FLESH.

409
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,225
OH, I HEARD
YOU MOVED BACK TO TOWN.

410
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,837
HOW'S YOUR MOM?DIVORCED.

411
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,012
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

412
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,231
DON'T BE.
MY DAD'S A FREAK.

413
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,624
COME ON, REGGIE.
LET'S GO ONLINE.

414
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,105
SO, SANDY...

415
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,194
WHERE DID YOU
DISCOVER THIS...

416
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,413
NEW LOOK?

417
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,762
FLORIDA.

418
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,067
MY NAME'S "RAVEN" NOW.

419
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,157
NICE.

420
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,945
MOM, CAN YOU
TAKE J.D., PLEASE?

421
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:26,121
WHY? DON'T YOU WANT HIM
WITH YOU?

422
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,514
NO. HE'S TOO PREPPY.

423
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,255
PREPPY?

424
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,474
FINE.

425
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,261
DO YOU GIRLS
WANT SOMETHING
TO EAT?

426
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,349
SOMETHING SWEET.

427
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,048
UH, DO YOU HAVE
ANY CHARCOAL?

428
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,572
NO. NO, NO, GIRLS.
I'M SORRY, NO MATCHES.

429
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,183
CHARCOAL EYELINER.

430
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,271
I'M GOING TO DO
REGGIE'S MAKE-UP.

431
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,621

I'LL GET IT.

433
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,844
[J.D. WHIMPERS]

434
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:56,978
OH, DON'T YOU WORRY.

435
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,067
SHE NEEDS A FRIEND
WHO'S HUMAN.

436
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,287
OR SOMETHING CLOSE.

437
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,522
SAY IT AIN'T SO.

438
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,749
OH, BROTHER.

439
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,579
TRULY STUNNING WORK,
YOUNG REMBRANDT.

440
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,364
WHAT'D YOU CALL ME,
ASSHOLE?

441
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:36,409
CHRIST.

442
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,455
I WAS HOPING TO PAY TRIBUTE
TO YOUR ARTWORK.

443
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,544
WELL, I THINK IT'S SHIT.

444
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:42,937
ALWAYS STRIVING.

445
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,765
ALWAYS PUSHING
TO MAKE YOUR WORK
A CUT ABOVE.

446
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:47,071
I APPRECIATE THAT
IN A YOUNG PERSON.

447
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,247
IN FACT, I'D LOVE
TO SHAKE YOUR HAND.

448
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:50,901
START CLIMBING THEN, GRANDPA.

449
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,296
HOW ABOUT YOU COME DOWN?

450
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,428
THE CLIMB UP
IS HALF THE EXPERIENCE.

451
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:57,473
FALLING DOWN THE OTHER HALF?

452
00:20:58,474 --> 00:20:59,823
MAYBE FOR YOU.

453
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:00,824
I NEVER FALL.

454
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,348
EVER.

455
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,797
I WANT TO PAY YOU
FOR YOUR WORK.

456
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,147
CALL IT
ART APPRECIATION.

457
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,455
HOW ABOUT, SAY...
30 BUCKS?

458
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:24,544
CASH ON THE BARREL HEAD,

459
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,720
IF YOU COME DOWN
IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES.

460
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,330
YOU MEDICI MOTHERFUCKER.

461
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,333
YOU CAN'T RUSH ART.

462
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,814
I'LL MAKE IT 40.
$40 FOR AN ORIGINAL WORK
BY THE GREAT "B. BOYD."

463
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,251
WHAT THE FUCK?

464
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:38,732
I AIN'T THAT HACK, MAN.

465
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,822
I'M UP HERE
BLOTTING HIS SHIT OUT.

466
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,741
WHAT THE FUCK, INDEED.

467
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:50,744
GET THE FUCK OUT
OF MY AIRSPACE, MOTHERFUCKER,

468
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:53,529
BEFORE I SHOOT YOU DOWN!

469
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:56,010
TERRIBLE, WHAT PEOPLE DO
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY.

470
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,360
SHIT! HEADS UP!

471
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:04,192
TAG.
YOU'RE IT.

472
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,455
B-BOY! B-BOY,
GET UP, MAN!

473
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,543
GET UP!

474
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,156
DAMN, LOOK AT
THAT PATTERN.

475
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,291
WATCH YOUR STEP NOW.

476
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,600
I HAVE TO SAY

477
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:21,905
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS.

478
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:23,472
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT.

479
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,996
I JUST FEEL LIKE
IT'S UNDERHANDED,

480
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,868
FILMING A GUY
WHO'S CHEATING HIS WIFE.

481
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:30,827
HEY, HEY, HEY...
HIS WIFE'S THE ONE
THAT CONTACTED US.

482
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,351
SHE THINKS THIS IS
WHERE HE COMES
TO PICK UP WOMEN.

483
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,656
DON'T MAKE ME OUT
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

484
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,962
I'M NOT.

485
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,920
SO HOW DO I LOOK?

486
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:38,357
GOOD ENOUGH
TO END A MARRIAGE.

487
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,793
WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS?

488
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,404
THERE. THERE.

489
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,406
THERE AND THERE.

490
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,494
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

491
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:46,495
NO. YOU?

492
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,411
YEAH.

493
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,326
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
HOW TO SEDUCE A MAN?

494
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,546
I DON'T KNOW.
DO I?

495
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,420
WE'LL SEE.

496
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,863
EVERYTHING PINK GOES?

497
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:07,951
BURN IT.

498
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,562
IS THAT HER?

499
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,219
YEAH. THAT'S MY SISTER.

500
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,396
IT'S THE ONLY
YEARBOOK PICTURE OF HER
I EVER FOUND.

501
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,224
SHE WAS TOO COOL
FOR THAT BULLSHIT.

502
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,618
SHE WAS NEVER
IN ANY CLUBS OR ANYTHING.

503
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,446
NOT BEING IN STUFF
IS COOL.

504
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,839
NOT LIKE MY SISTER,

505
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,581
PRESIDENT OF THE "MY SHIT
DOESN'T STINK SOCIETY."

506
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,585
CAN I SEE HER ROOM?

507
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,456
[DOOR OPENS]YOUR ORDER, LADIES.

THANKS.

510
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,334
HER NAME'S
NOT "REGGIE" ANYMORE.

511
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:44,901
DARE I ASK?

512
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:46,294
IT'S "SPIDER".

513
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,470
SPIDER, HUH?
THAT'S PRETTY.

514
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,910
UM, YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
SWEETS IN THE HOUSE,

515
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,609
BUT I DID FIND THESE.

516
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,566
I THINK THOSE ARE
REALLY STALE.

517
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,350
THAT'S OKAY,
I LIKE STALE.

518
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:02,179
IT'S CLOSER TO DEATH.

519
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,660
WELL, TRY NOT TO GET
A LOT OF CRUMBS
ON THE FLOOR.

520
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:12,276
SO, UM, WELL,

522
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,763
SURE.TERRIFIC.

523
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:21,721
CAN WE INVITE
A COUPLE OF FRIENDS?

524
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,289
OF COURSE. YEAH.

525
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,465
CAN WE HAVE PIZZA?

526
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,032
PIZZA IT IS.

527
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:35,256
YOUR MOM'S COOL.

528
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:37,345

COME HERE MUCH?

530
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,570
ISN'T THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE
A MAN'S LINE?

531
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:46,572
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A SCRIPT.

532
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,182
WANT TO HEAR MY GUESS
ABOUT YOU, WALTER?

533
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,923
UH-OH... NOW
I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

534
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,535
ANOTHER SHOT OF COURAGE,
MY FRIEND?

535
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:54,667
THANK YOU.

536
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,625
HOW ABOUT YOU, MISS?NO, I'M GOOD.

537
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:57,974
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

538
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,543
MY GUESS, WALTER,

539
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:03,980
IS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE AT HOME RIGHT NOW,

540
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,505
BUT YOU WORK A LONG DAY,
AND THE WIFE ISN'T ALWAYS

541
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,245
A WELCOME FACE
AT THE END OF IT.

542
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,596
I SHOULD GET GOING.

543
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,383
YOU HAVE A NICE NECK.

544
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,472
IT'S STRONG.

545
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,215
DOES YOUR WIFE
KISS YOUR NECK, WALTER?

546
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:22,956
SHE SHOULD.

547
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,653
JESUS.JESUS.

548
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,089
I'M SORRY.

549
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,483
I'M MAKING YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE.

550
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,530
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY
THAT BELIEVES IN STAYING
WITH SOMEBODY FOREVER.

551
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,183
I GAVE UP ON FOREVER.

552
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,097
IT DOESN'T LAST.

553
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,711
I'M A BIG FAN OF JUST
ONE REALLY GOOD NIGHT.

554
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,453
ARE YOU A GOOD KISSER,
WALTER?

555
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,587
UM...
I DON'T KNOW.

556
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,721
I BET YOU WOULD BE.

557
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,811
I'M SORRY.

558
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:54,378
I'M NOT A CHEATER.

559
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:58,731
YOU'RE NOT, ARE YOU?

560
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:01,908
NO.

561
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,040
TOP YOU UP THERE, PAL?

562
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:05,651
I'M FINE.

563
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,262
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

564
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:11,047
WATCH MY BAG?

565
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,492
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

566
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,146
HE DOESN'T WANT TO CHEAT.

567
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,495
REALLY? HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

568
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,801
BECAUSE HE SAID SO.

569
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:26,933
MEN SAY A LOT
OF FUCKING THINGS, DAISY,

570
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,109
ALL DAY LONG,
BUT MOSTLY AT NIGHT.

571
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,284
OR MAYBE
YOU DON'T KNOW MEN.

572
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:31,372
I KNOW MEN FINE.

573
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,767
THIS GUY IS CLUELESS.

574
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,942
HE WANTS TO BE TOLD
WHAT TO DO.

575
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:37,770
HE WANTS TO BE TOLD
WHAT HE WANTS.

576
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,598
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

577
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,382
HE WANTS
WHAT WE ALL WANT.

578
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,166
HE WANTS TO FEEL ALIVE.

579
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,516
RIGHT, DAISY?

580
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:47,823
I DON'T KNOW.

581
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:51,000
HE'S NOT A CHEATER,
I CAN SEE IT.

582
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,872
SO WHAT ARE YOU,
A FUCKING MARRIAGE
COUNSELOR NOW?

583
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,048
NO.NO.

584
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,616
YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

585
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,792
ACT LIKE YOU WANT TO
MAKE HIM HAPPY.

586
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,795
ACT LIKE YOU WANT TO
MAKE ME HAPPY.

587
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:05,275
FINE.

588
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,757
AM I BEING HARD ON YOU?YES.

589
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,237
I'M AN AWFUL GUY.

590
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,368
I'M MEAN. I'M TERRIBLE.

591
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,196
YOU REALLY ARE.

592
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,545
I REALLY AM.

593
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:22,815
NOW GO OUT THERE...

594
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,295
AND SHOW HIM NO MERCY.

595
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:28,951
ALL RIGHT?MM.

596
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,389
ALL RIGHT, MILLIE.

597
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:35,262
HERE YOU GO. $400.

598
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:37,917
THANK YOU, DELORES.

599
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,179
FOR YOUR UNCLE'S BURIAL.

600
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:41,137
UNCLE ARTHUR, WAS IT?RIGHT.

601
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,139
<i>THE GOOD NEWS
WAS I HAD A CHECK</i>

602
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,011
<i>FOR 400 BUCKS.</i>

603
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,926
<i>THE BAD NEWS WAS...</i>

604
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,189
<i>I WAS THINKING ABOUT
KEEPING THE MONEY.</i>

605
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,582
THIS IS A SWEET THING
YOU'RE DOING--

606
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,889
WORKING OVERTIME
TO PAY HIM TRIBUTE.

607
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,849
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
FOR FAMILY, I GUESS.

608
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,459
<i>I WAS WORKING FOR IT,</i>

609
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,504
<i>SO WHY SHOULD I
SPEND IT ON SOME GUY</i>

610
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:02,202
<i>JUST BECAUSE HE'S DEAD?</i>

611
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:03,420
<i>I'M DEAD, TOO.</i>

612
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:04,378
HONORING THE DEAD

613
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:07,337
HELPS US GO ON LIVING.

614
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:08,904
I KNOW.

615
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,471
<i>ONE HOT LEATHER JACKET,</i>

616
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,212
<i>AND NO ONE WOULD BE
THE WISER.</i>

617
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,954
THE THING THAT'S LOVELY
ABOUT THIS GESTURE

618
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,696
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST
LOOKING FOR A PAT
ON THE BACK.

619
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,959
<i>ON MY HOT NEW
LEATHER JACKET.</i>

620
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,656
RIGHT.

621
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,223
THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL
ABOUT MY KIDS.

622
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:26,443
WHAT KIDS?

623
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:27,836
THE LITTLE ONES I SPONSOR.

624
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:29,664
OH!

625
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,147
SAY HELLO TO...
KASAWALA.

626
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,496
AND ANJALI.

627
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:38,760
AND...

628
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:40,631
THIS IS CHING-ZI.

629
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,764
I SAW HER PICTURE
IN MY SUNDAY PARADE,

630
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,984
AND I JUST COULDN'T RESIST
ADDING ONE MORE.

631
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,202
AND THIS...

632
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,031
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO PLAY FAVORITES.

633
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:51,730
THIS IS FALLANDA.

634
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,688
ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

635
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,734
$15 A MONTH
FROM YOURS TRULY

636
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,824
GETS HER
A MONTHLY SUPPLY
OF HIGH-PROTEIN LUNCHES,

637
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,434
AND HER VILLAGE
GETS A WATER PUMP.

638
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,089
THAT'S SO SWEET, DELORES.

639
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,743
OH.

640
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,702
I MEAN, SHE'LL NEVER
THANK ME IN PERSON,

641
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,791
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT,
AS YOU KNOW.

642
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,841
THANK YOU, DELORES HERBIG,
AND YOUR BIG, BROWN EYES.

643
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,758
RIGHT.

644
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:23,936
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
WHEN LIFE PRESENTS US
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

645
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,502
TO HELP SOMEONE
WHO CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES,

646
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:27,809
WE HAVE TO STEP UP,

647
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,680
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

648
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,160
<i>AND JUST LIKE THAT,</i>

649
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,859
<i>I LOST MY HOT NEW
LEATHER JACKET.</i>

650
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:37,645
THANK YOU
FOR THE FINE EXAMPLE
YOU SET.

651
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,736
HEY... THIS IS NICE.

652
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,999
I LOST MY OTHER JACKET
WHEN I DIED.

653
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,610
THANK YOU, GEORGIA LASS.

654
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:48,308
YOU'RE WELCOME.

655
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:53,617
PRETTY GIRL
YOU WERE TALKING TO.

656
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,750
SEEMS NICE.

657
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,796
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

658
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,102
I DON'T THINK
THAT ONE'S SO NICE.

659
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:02,017
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

660
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:03,279
WOULDN'T YOU JUST KILL
TO FIND OUT, THOUGH?

661
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,586
GOD, I KNOW I WOULD.

662
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:08,850
EXCUSE ME.

663
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,899
GOOD EVENING, SIR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

664
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,857
I'VE COME TO SEE DAISY ACT.
WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS?

665
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,032
THEY'RE HIDDEN,
AND SHUT THE FUCK UP.

666
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,862
EXCUSE ME?SHUT THE FUCK UP.

667
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,429
AND DON'T TALK TO HER.

668
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,561
FINE.

669
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,433
THE ONLY REASON
YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH
IS TO POUR BOOZE IN IT.

670
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,653
AND WHAT ARE WE
DRINKING TO, RAY?

671
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:30,829
THEY'RE BOTH FOR YOU.

672
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,355
LOOKING GOOD, DAISY.NOT NOW, MASON.

673
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,880
I'M NOT GOING
TO FUCKING TELL YOU AGAIN.

674
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,450
WELL, LOOK
WHO'S STILL HERE.

675
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,845
YOU ASKED ME
TO WATCH YOUR BAG.

676
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:47,976
OH.

677
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,978
LUCKY ME.
I FOUND A BOY SCOUT.

678
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,720
OKAY, GO HOME,
BOY SCOUT.

679
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:53,895
YOU DID YOUR GOOD DEED.

680
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:00,380
YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS
ON THEIR DEATHBED, WALTER?

681
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,035
THEY WISH THEY'D HAD
MORE FUN.

682
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,604
AND MEN WISH
THEY'D HAD MORE WOMEN.

683
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,741
FIVE REASONS
MEN COME
TO A BAR, WALTER.

684
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:16,787
ONE...
THEY DON'T LOVE
THEIR WIFE ANYMORE.

685
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,877
TWO, THEIR WIFE
DOESN'T LOVE THEM.

686
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,489
THREE, THEY WANT TO SEE
WHAT THEY'RE MISSING.

687
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:25,013
AND FOUR,

688
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:28,887
THEY WANT,
IF JUST FOR A MOMENT,
TO TASTE IT.

689
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,585
FIVE...

690
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,598
MAYBE THERE WERE JUST FOUR.

691
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,037
YOU WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE
WITH ME, WALTER?

692
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:53,868
I DO.

693
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:56,871
BLACKSTONE HOTEL.

694
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,786
GET US A ROOM.
I'LL FOLLOW.

695
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,963
NOW?NOW.

696
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,443
UM, I HAVE TO PAY
MY BAR TAB.

697
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:04,923
NO, I GOT IT.

698
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,489
GO THE HOTEL,
BOY SCOUT.

699
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,463
HOW'S THAT FOR NO MERCY?

700
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,595
JIMMY,
BLACKSTONE HOTEL, NOW.

701
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,770
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

702
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,772
NO, YOU'RE NOT,

703
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,513
THOUGH IT SURE SEEMED
LIKE YOU WANTED TO.

704
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:33,212
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THAT KISS?

705
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:35,431
I WAS JUST
PLAYING THE PART, RAY,
GOING WITH IT.

706
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:36,650
A LITTLE TOO WELL.

707
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,434
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

708
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,827
WELL, MAYBE I'M JUST
PLAYING THE PART
OF THE JEALOUS BOYFRIEND.

709
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:43,004
[SIGHS]

710
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,571
I'M SORRY.

711
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:45,398
SEE? SEE WHAT YOU DO TO ME?

712
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,401
YOU ARE
A HELL OF AN ACTRESS.

713
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:50,446
THANK YOU.

714
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:52,318
COME HERE.

715
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,280
I'LL SEE YOU
LATER TONIGHT?OKAY.

716
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,721
GOOD SEEING
YOU, MASON.

717
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,643
WHAT WAS THAT?I WAS ACTING.

718
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,080
ACTING LIKE WHAT,

719
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,386
A WHORE?

720
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,780
BECAUSE IT WAS
BLOODY BRILLIANT,
DEFINITIVE.

721
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,303
YOU'RE DRUNK, MASON,
AND YOU SMELL.

722
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:23,262
YOU SMELL.

723
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,003
HE SMELLS. THIS WHOLE
BLOODY THING SMELLS.

724
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:26,526
GO HOME.

725
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,234
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
YOU WERE REALLY GREAT.

726
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,411
THANK YOU.

727
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:45,284
IT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU
TO COME UP
AND TELL ME THAT.

728
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,199
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE SHY
ABOUT APPROACHING ACTORS,

729
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:48,809
BUT IT REALLY MAKES MY DAY.

730
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:49,592
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

731
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,204
MELISSA. I'M HIS WIFE.

732
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,597
OH."OH?"

733
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,426
THAT'S IT?

734
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,733
THAT'S ALL I GET?
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE LEFT?

735
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,126
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WOULD BE HERE.

736
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,257
THEY DIDN'T TELL ME.

737
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,259
OKAY. LET'S BLAME THEM.

738
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,969
[GIRL]
SO SHE'S DEAD?

739
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,319
I'M DEAD.

740
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,799
READY?

741
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:25,063
SPEAK TO THE SPIRITS.

742
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,804
"LIGHT AS A FEATHER,
STIFF AS A BOARD."

743
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,546
"LIGHT AS A FEATHER,
STIFF AS A BOARD.

744
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,853
LIGHT AS A FEATHER,
STIFF AS A BOARD."

745
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:34,159
SORRY TO INTERRUPT, GIRLS.

746
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:35,551
JUST THOUGHT
I'D BRING IN SOME SODAS.

747
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,076
MOM.

748
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,425
THAT'S COOL,
MRS. LASS.

749
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,426
THANKS.

750
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:44,125
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PLAY A GAME?

751
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,300
NO WAY.

752
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,345
WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING?

753
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:48,738
NOTHING.REGGIE...

754
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,523
CHILL OUT.

755
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:51,480
YOUR MOM IS COOL.

756
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,702
UM, WHY DON'T YOU GIRLS
LEVITATE WITHOUT ME?

757
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,229
"LIGHT AS A FEATHER,
STIFF AS A BOARD."

758
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,234
WOW. AREN'T YOU...

759
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,845
I MEAN...AREN'T I WHAT?

760
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,022
YOU LOOK GOOD.

761
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:14,982
THANK YOU.

762
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,766
I'M GOING TO GO TAKE A PEEK.

763
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,159
IF SHE SEES YOU,
SHE'LL FREAK.

764
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,336
THANKS FOR INVITING ME.

765
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,165
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
I KNOW NOTHING.

766
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,300
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS "GOTH"?

767
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,693
DAD! YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

768
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:31,564
NO BOYS ALLOWED.

769
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,436
REGGIE?WHAT?

770
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,613
WE'RE EATING
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

771
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,006
UH, REGGIE--

772
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,268
I THINK THE GREASY FOOD
SHOULD STAY IN THE KITCHEN.

773
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:41,835
MOM, DON'T EMBARRASS ME.

774
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,532
DAD, GET OUT!

775
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,800
WHAT THE HELL, JOY?

776
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:53,673
A FEW SIMPLE
SACRIFICES TO THE DEVIL,

777
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,109
FOLLOWED BY PIZZA.

778
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,851
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS.

779
00:35:57,894 --> 00:36:00,201
IT'S HARMLESS,
ALL RIGHT? A PHASE.

780
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:01,333
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

781
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,945
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH IT,

782
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,555
BUT IT'S
AN ACTUAL PARTY, CLANCY.

783
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:08,949
WITH ACTUAL FRIENDS.

784
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:10,559
REGGIE HAS FRIENDS?

785
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,388
REGGIE HAS FRIENDS.

786
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:22,528
WOW. LOOK WHO'S BACK.

787
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,530
STILL PANNING FOR GOLD
IN DRY GULCH?

788
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:26,271
NO.

789
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,536
SO WHAT'S THE SAD STORY
THIS TIME?

790
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,277
I THINK
YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE.

791
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,495
ONCE UPON A TIME,

792
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,586
THERE WERE THESE FOUR GUYS
NAMED BENJAMIN,

793
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,459
AND THEY COULD HAVE
TURNED INTO
A NICE LEATHER JACKET,

794
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:44,985
BUT INSTEAD,
THEY ENDED UP
ON YOUR CRUMMY DESK.

795
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:47,988
I THOUGHT ARTHUR SIMMS
DIDN'T HAVE A FAMILY.

796
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,163
HE DOES NOW.

797
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:50,686
COMPLICATED GUY.

798
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:53,602
CAN I JUST HAVE
A RECEIPT, PLEASE?

799
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:55,822
ONE SECOND.

800
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:00,957
NICE FROG.

801
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:03,612
THAT'S GENERAL TSAO.

802
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,920
AND THIS...

803
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,356
IS ARTHUR SIMMS.

804
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,403
YOU'RE SHITTING ME?

805
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,057
WHAT'D YOU THINK
YOU WERE GETTING FOR $400?

806
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,321
A GRAVE. A HEADSTONE.

807
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:19,237
THE CITY HASN'T HAD FUNERALS
FOR TRANSIENTS FOR YEARS.

808
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,195
WE BURN THEM.

809
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,631
THERE'S A LANDFILL
OVER BY THE FREEWAY--

810
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:23,806
YEAH, I GET IT.

811
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,200
NO, NO, NO, NO.

812
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,465
YOU PAID FOR THEM,
THEY'RE YOURS.

813
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,078
WHAT THE FUCK
DO I WANT THEM FOR?

814
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,342
ASHES HAVE MANY USES.

815
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:40,127
ALL KINDS OF THINGS
YOU CAN DO WITH PEOPLE.

816
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,042
DON'T TRY TO PLAY
CREEPY DEATH GUY WITH ME.

817
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:44,131
I SEE DEATH ALL THE TIME.

818
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:45,872
WELL, YOU MAY SEE DEATH
ALL THE TIME, SWEETHEART,

819
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,439
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

820
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:49,615
AND THIS ONE'S YOURS.

821
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:53,706
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

822
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,321
NOT VERY HEAVY
FOR A WHOLE DEAD GUY.

823
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,062
ASHES TO ASHES.

824
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,281
BUT YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT THAT,
DON'T YOU?

825
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,458
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

826
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,372
MM.

827
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,424
OKAY, SO TELL ME
THE RULES.

828
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,947
YEAH, ME TOO.

829
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:18,948
WE'LL JUST GO
AROUND THE CIRCLE
UNTIL YOU GET IT,

830
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,298
THEN YOU CAN JOIN IN.

831
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,342
DON'T EMBARRASS ME.

832
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,475
TABITHA... GO.

833
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,042
OVERDOSE.

834
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,217
OF WHAT?

835
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:29,350
ASPIRIN.BORING.

836
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,396
OKAY, WAIT.

837
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,615
BOILING OIL.

838
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:34,877
BOILING ACID.

839
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,011
ELECTROCUTION.

840
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:38,838
DECAPITATION.

841
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,056
FLAYING.

842
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,363
BRAIN EMBOLISM.

843
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,496
CARPAL TUNNEL.

844
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:45,932
WHAT'S THAT?

845
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,586
IT'S REALLY, REALLY BAD.

846
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,502
OKAY. MRS. LASS?

847
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,985
UM, WELL...

848
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:03,036
IN MY SLEEP,
AGE 98,

849
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:06,213
SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS...

850
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,215
AND GRANDCHILDREN...

851
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:11,653
AND ALL THE PEOPLE I LOVE.

852
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,394
JESUS, MOM, THAT'S NOT
HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME.

853
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,048
WELL, THAT'S MY ANSWER.

854
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,049
THAT'S OKAY, REGGIE.

855
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,267
YOU GO.

856
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:19,487
OKAY...

857
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:21,881
I'M KILLED...

858
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:25,232
BY A TOILET SEAT

859
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,930
THAT FALLS
FROM A SPACE STATION,

860
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,279
AND I'M BLOWN TO BITS.

861
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,282
WOW.

862
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,416
OKAY, PARTY'S OVER.
TIME TO GO.

863
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,811
BUT MY MOM CAN'T
PICK ME UP UNTIL LATER.

864
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,116
I SAID IT'S TIME TO GO.

865
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,640
MOM.COME ON, GIRLS. NOW.

866
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,076
CALL YOUR PARENTS.

867
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,947
MRS. LASS,
I TOTALLY THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

868
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,340
SANDY,

869
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,428
I THINK YOU NEED
TO GO UPSTAIRS

870
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,038
AND GET YOUR THINGS
AND GO HOME,

871
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:50,605
AND PUT SOME COLD CREAM
ON YOUR FACE,

872
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,433
AND FOLLOW IT UP
WITH SOME ASTRINGENT, HUH?

873
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:54,740
'CAUSE THAT PANCAKE MAKEUP
IS GOING TO DESTROY
YOUR SKIN.

874
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,089
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
ACNE SCARS.

875
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:57,830
SO MEAN!

876
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:03,401
THANKS A LOT.

877
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,446
YOUR SISTER'S DEATH
IS NOT A GAME.

878
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:07,840
WHATEVER.

879
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,625
I'M SORRY, REGGIE,
BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE--

880
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:22,594
WHO'S THAT?

881
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,074
SAY HELLO
TO ARTHUR SIMMS.

882
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:25,901
HE'S HAD QUITE A DAY.

883
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:27,076
YEAH.

884
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,644
HEY, KIFFCOFFEE?

885
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:30,906
NO, I'M GOOD.

886
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,994
IS THAT
SOMEONE'S ASHES?

887
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,953
NO. NO WAY.

888
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,347
DON'T PUT SOMEONE'S ASHES
ON MY TABLE.

889
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:38,566
IT'S BAD LUCK.

890
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,093
HE WOKE UP
THIS MORNING
LIFE-SIZE...

891
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:45,443
NOW LOOK AT HIM.

892
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:48,358
NO HEADSTONE.
NO NOTHING.

893
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:49,534
YOU DON'T NEED
A HEADSTONE

894
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,665
IF NOBODY'S GOING TO
COME TO SEE IT.

895
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:55,801
ARE THOSE ASHES?

896
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:57,498
YES.

897
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,760
I WAS CREMATED,
YOU KNOW.

898
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:00,153
YOU BURNED TO DEATH.

899
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,371
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

900
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:03,243
GONE WITH THE WIND...

901
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:04,462
ON  <i>GONE WITH THE WIND.</i>

902
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,335
I DIDN'T FIND THAT FUNNY.

903
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:10,468
I DID.

904
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,469
HOW'D YOUR BIG DAY GO?

905
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,254
PERFECT.

906
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:16,865
I NAILED EVERY SCENE.

907
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,389
REALLY?APPARENTLY, I'M A VERY
GIFTED ACTRESS.

908
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,348
REALLY?

909
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:22,697
ASK MASON.
HE WAS THERE.

910
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,526
WHAT'S THAT?ARTHUR SIMMS.

911
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,311
WHO'S THAT?UNCLE ARTHUR.

912
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,400
UNCLE ARTHUR!

913
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:33,447
YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT.
CHEERS. CHEERS.

914
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,101
CHEERS.

915
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:38,408
SO, MASON, WAS DAISY
A GOOD ACTRESS?

916
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:42,543
YES, SHE IS.THANK YOU.

917
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:43,762
ALWAYS HAS BEEN,
IT TURNS OUT.

918
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:46,025
MY EYES HAVE BEEN OPENED.

919
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:49,115
MY EARS HAVE HEARD
THAT WHICH THEY THOUGHT
THEY NEVER WOULD.

920
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,683
ALL RIGHT, MASON.

921
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,511
WELL, LITTLE
MISS MOVIE STAR,

922
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:56,514
WE FINALLY GOT SOMEONE
THAT'S SOMEBODY.

923
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,559
MM. YES, I AM.

924
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,866
AND THAT SOMEBODY
SHOULD PICK UP THE CHECK.

925
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,609
UH, ROXY?

926
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:07,176
CAN YOU DO ME
ONE MORE BIG FAVOR?

927
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,222
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH THAT DEAD MAN.

928
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:10,397
IT'S A HEALTH CODE
VIOLATION.

929
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,748
CIRCLE OF LIFE,
RIGHT?

930
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,621
OKAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO GO
ON MY SHIFT WITH ME.

931
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:18,231
AND HE SITS
IN THE BACK SEAT.

932
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:19,449
THAT'S FINE.

933
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:22,670
CONGRATULATIONS, DAISY.

934
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:23,715
THANK YOU.

935
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,030
YOU KEEP DOING THAT,
YOU KNOW.

936
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:37,076
WHAT?FIXING YOUR FACE.

937
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,860
A GIRL'S GOT TO LOOK GOOD
FOR HER MAN.

938
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:43,386
THAT MAN GRABBED YOU
BY THE ARM, DAISY.

939
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:47,608
I DON'T THINK
I CARE FOR HIM MUCH.

940
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,915
WHAT YOU DON'T CARE FOR
IS THAT HE'S DATING ME.

941
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,874
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT

942
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:55,703
IF YOU'D BE CIVILIZED
WHEN HE SHOWS UP.

943
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,706
HE'S COMING HERE?YEP. OF COURSE.

944
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:00,926
RUBE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

945
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:02,928
YOU'RE RIGHT.
RUBE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT,

946
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,712
BUT HE'S NOT HERE,
AND YOU STILL ARE.

947
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:08,237
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

948
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:11,589
AND I LOVE YOU.

949
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,724
I JUST DON'T
LIKE YOU ANYMORE.

950
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:32,435
<i>IN A LIFETIME,
WE GET TO BE MANY THINGS.</i>

951
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,351
<i>RICH MAN, POOR MAN,
BEGGAR MAN, THIEF...</i>

952
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:40,052
<i>DOCTOR, LAWYER,
INDIAN CHIEF.</i>

953
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:43,795
<i>DAUGHTER, SISTER, SCOUT,
COLLEGE DROPOUT,</i>

954
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,405
<i>FRIEND,</i>

955
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:47,320
<i>DEAD GIRL...</i>

956
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:52,020
<i>OR MAYBE
WE JUST PLAY THE PARTS</i>

957
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:54,544
<i>FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
UNTIL THE CURTAIN FALLS.</i>

958
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,597
<i>FROM THE MOMENT I MET HIM,</i>

959
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,513
<i>I KNEW SOMETHING
ABOUT ARTHUR SIMMS
WAS FAMILIAR.</i>

960
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:09,864
<i>I UNDERSTOOD
WANTING TO DISAPPEAR.</i>

961
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,606
<i>I WANTED TO MY WHOLE LIFE.</i>

962
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,609
<i>AND THEN I DID.</i>

963
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,133
OKAY, ARTHUR SIMMS,
HERE YOU GO.

964
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:21,267
YOU LIVED,
AND THEN YOU DIED.

965
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,182
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN.

966
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:25,010
[♪♪]

967
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,154
I COULD USE
SOME BREAKFAST.

968
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:40,765
YOU HUNGRY?

969
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:41,853
I COULD EAT.

970
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:44,507
FEELS LIKE
AN OATMEAL MORNING.

971
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,074
HMM.

972
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,557
MAYBE I'LL TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TODAY.

973
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,081
YOU SHOULD.

974
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,474
IT'S A BIG MENU.

975
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,084
YEAH...
