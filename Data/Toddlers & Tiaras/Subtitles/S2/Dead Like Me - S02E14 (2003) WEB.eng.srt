00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,663
OH, HI, CLANCY.

350
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,056
CLAIRE.

351
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,535
OKAY. I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

352
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,102
THAT THREE
OF MY BEST FRIENDS

353
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,756
SAW HOW YOU ORGANIZED
MY KITCHEN,

354
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,888
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
WANTS TO CALL YOU.

355
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,630
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT...

356
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,763
BUT MAYBE WE COULD TALK
ABOUT THIS TOMORROW, OKAY,

357
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,504
BECAUSE NOW
IS JUST NOT SO GREAT A TIME.

358
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,943
AND I ALSO WANTED TO ASK YOU

359
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,424
IF YOU WOULD TAKE A LOOK
AT MY PRESENT-WRAPPING
STATION.

360
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,948
I THINK I COULD SET IT UP
A LITTLE BETTER
IN THE FAMILY ROOM--

361
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,906
WHAT ABOUT
"NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME"
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

362
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,561
CLANCY.EXCUSE ME?

363
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,433
YOU LEFT THE GATE
TO OUR YARD OPEN?

364
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,087
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

365
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,479
THE HELL YOU DON'T.

366
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,351
CLANCY.NO, JOY, LET'S SAY IT.

367
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,266
THIS IS THE WOMAN

368
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,920
WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT OUR DOG
TAKING A CRAP
INTO HER PRECIOUS FLOWERS

369
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:52,837
AND THEN, SUDDENLY,
THE DOG
IS ACCIDENTALLY LET OUT

370
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,143
AND THEN DIES.

371
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,233
HE'S JUST UPSET.

372
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:58,843
HE LOVED THE DOG.

373
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,629
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS...

374
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:03,805
AGAIN.

375
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:05,720
I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

376
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,156
YOU DO THAT.

377
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,244
TRY NOT TO KILL
ANY MORE DOGS.

378
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:17,471
JESUS CHRIST, CLANCY,
I STILL LIVE HERE.

379
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,863
I HAVE TO SEE HER.

380
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,126
THINGS HAVE TO BE SAID.

381
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,218
SO. COUNSELING FOR REGGIE.

382
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,915
OR WHOEVER'S INTERESTED

383
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,010
I JUST FEEL SICK,

384
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,839
SICK AND TIRED...

385
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:44,150
AND I MISS THE STUPID DOG.

386
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,590
I MISS YOU.

387
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:52,462
I MISS MY DAUGHTERS.

388
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,294
I MISS EVERYTHING.

389
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,430
WHO THE FUCK
YOU CALLING INSOLENT?

390
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,649
<i>WHEN INTERVIEWING,
THEY TELL YOU TO RELAX,</i>

391
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,521
<i>TO JUST BE YOURSELF.</i>

392
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,479
<i>WELL, LOOK WHAT THAT GOT ME.</i>

393
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,961

<i>WHAT ARE THEY ALL HIDING?</i>

397
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,623
<i>WHAT'S THE REAL STORY?</i>

398
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,284
SO, MISTY?

399
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:33,895

400
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:35,636
NO.

401
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,811
ARE YOU SINGLE?

402
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:38,029
YES.

403
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:39,248
MISTY.

404
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:44,645
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN,
SASSOON AND JORDACHE,
AND...

405
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,475
I THINK I'M STILL MARRIED
IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA

406
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,694
AND PROBABLY KANSAS.

407
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:52,914
TOPEKA'S IN KANSAS,

408
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,718
SPECIAL FORCES, CRYSTAL?

409
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:38,002
<i>GOD, I COULDN'T EVEN
LAND THIS JOB
WITHOUT A NOTE FROM MY MOM.</i>

410

00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,016

00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,773
ABSOLUTE FUCKING FASCISM.

I'M GOING TO LIVE
IN THE MOMENT.

441
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,604
I'M LIVING OFF THE LAND.

442
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,606

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,159
UGH.

452
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,596
FORAGING IN NATURE.

453
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,338
DID YOU TAKE THAT MAN'S STEAK?

454
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,035
HE WAS FINISHED,

WOULD WE, KIFFANY,

456
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,821
NOT WHEN THERE ARE CHILDREN
STARVING IN BOSTON.

457
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,129
HOW ABOUT MY PAYING CUSTOMER?

458
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,783
I'LL HAVE A COBB SALAD,
KIFFANY.

459
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,659
YOU'RE MAKING
ALL THE WRONG MOVES, MASON.

460
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:37,921

I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
JUST STEAL THAT MONEY
FROM ME.

464
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,329
I WAS KEEPING IT
SAFE FOR YOU.

465
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,636
I WANTED YOU

466
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,073

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,423
OUT?THAT'S RIGHT.

468
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,816
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

469
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,208
THIS IS DER WAFFLE HAUS.

470
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,602
AND YOU'RE DER-OUT-OF-HERE.

471
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,083
KIFFANY, I'VE HAD
A REALLY BAD...

472
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,998
COUPLE OF DAYS.

473
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,175
THAT'S ONE COBB SALAD,
AND HE BETTER BE GONE
BY THE TIME I GET BACK.

474
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,224
YOU HEARD
WHAT THE LADY SAID.

475
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:21,661
YOU GOT TO GO.

476
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:22,792
NO.

477
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,061
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF POLICE BRUTALITY?

478
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,020
BECAUSE THAT
IS POLICE BRUTALITY.

479
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,414
YOU REALLY DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU, MASON?

480
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,155
THIS IS OUR HOME,
AND YOU JUST PISSED
ALL OVER IT.

481
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,505
I WAS LIVING OFF
THE FAT OF THE LAND.

482
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:40,941
NO, WHAT YOU WERE DOING

483
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,770
WAS DISRESPECTING
THE LAST PLACE
YOU ACTUALLY BELONG

484
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,772
AND THE ONLY
LIVING PERSON YOU KNOW

485
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,948
THAT PUTS UP
WITH YOUR
FREEZE-DRIED BULLSHIT.

486
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,428
DO YOU CALL THAT
PUTTING UP WITH ME?

487
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,432
I'D CALL THAT
BREAKING THE CAMEL'S BACK.

488
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:57,261
ENJOY THE STREETS,
MASON,
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT.

489
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:15,932
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

490
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,325
YEAH. ME TOO.

491
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,032
I FEEL LIKE I'VE
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

492
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,208
YOU'VE BURIED
AN ANIMAL HERE BEFORE?

493
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:33,428
NO, BUT...

494
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,909
I'M HAVING THE MOST
POWERFUL SENSE OF DEJA VU.

495
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,214
IT'S WEIRD.

496
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:39,565
GOOD AFTERNOON.

497
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,131
I'M JED.

498
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,699
CAN I OFFER YOU FOLKS
A COLD BEVERAGE OR A SNACK?

499
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:44,918
NO, THANK YOU.

500
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,136
I'M GOOD. REG?

501
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,312
NO, THANKS.

502
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:51,533
YOU'VE LOOKED OVER THE OPTIONS
FOR BURIAL AND CREMATION?
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

503
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,535
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

504
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,015
IS THAT CRAZY?

505
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:57,539
YOU PROBABLY
REMEMBER IT IN ITS
PREVIOUS INCARNATION...

506
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,585
AS A FOSTER'S FREEZE.

507
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,935
I WAS ON THE GRILL,
AND MY WIFE WAS
ON THE TILL.

508
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,720
IS SHE A REDHEAD?

509
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,026
MORE AUBURN, REALLY.

510
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,595
NO REAL FUTURE
IN MILKSHAKES,
I'M AFRAID.

511
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,510
DEATH JUST MAKES
MUCH BETTER BUSINESS SENSE.

512
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,511
WELL...

513
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,338
CONGRATULATIONS.

514
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,036
THANK YOU.

515
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,386
THAT'S FOR YOUR
SMALLER DOG,

AND YOUR WIENER DOG,

518
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:24,435
ANYTHING IN
YOUR TOY GROUP.

519
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,046
J.D. WAS A BIG DOG.

520
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,701
HE WAS A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

521
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,399
WELL, I'M SURE HE WAS
