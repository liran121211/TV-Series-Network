00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,599
{\an1}<b>the music record store.</b>

157
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:45,669
<b>-</b><b><i>I felt that if I could get</i></b>
<b><i>Bill back to the city</i></b>

158
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,539
<b><i>where they first dated, it</i></b>
<b><i>might jog some of his memories.</i></b>

159
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:51,542
<b><i>So I booked us a flight</i></b>
<b><i>to Little Rock, Arkansas,</i></b>

160
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,244
<b><i>to begin our search</i></b>
<b><i>for Frances.</i></b>

<b><i>[mid-tempo music]</i></b>

162
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,717
<b><i>It had been some time</i></b>
<b><i>since Bill had been back</i></b>

163
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:02,553
<b><i>in his home state,</i></b>

164
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,488
<b><i>and he seemed enthusiastic</i></b>
<b><i>to return.</i></b>

165
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,423
<b>Are you excited, Bill?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

166
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:10,494
{\an1}<b>It's hometown, man.</b>
<b>I grew up here.</b>

167
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,496
<b>-</b><b><i>And as I had hoped,</i></b>
<b><i>it wasn't long</i></b>

168
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,265
<b><i>before old memories began</i></b>
<b><i>to come back.</i></b>

169
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,568
{\an1}<b>- God, mother used to</b>
<b>pick me up right there,</b>

170
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,736
{\an1}<b>that station.</b>

171
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,371
{\an1}<b>There was a plant</b>
<b>right there.</b>

172
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:24,608
<b>Dr. Pepper Company</b>
<b>right there, man.</b>

173
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:27,211
{\an1}<b>Now, that's the old</b>

174
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,146
<b>My uncle taught there.</b>

175
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,148
<b>-</b><b><i>With Bill's past</i></b>
<b><i>fresh in his mind,</i></b>

176
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:33,717
<b><i>we headed downtown</i></b>
<b><i>to Moses Melody Shop,</i></b>

177
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,853
<b><i>the last place</i></b>
<b><i>Bill had seen Frances</i></b>

178
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,521
<b><i>over 50 years ago.</i></b>

179
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:40,157
{\an1}<b>- It used to be right there,</b>
<b>the second building.</b>

180
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,725
{\an1}<b>I don't think</b>
<b>it's there anymore.</b>

181
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:42,893
{\an1}<b>Everything has</b>
<b>changed.</b>

182
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:44,928
<b>-</b><b><i>Things had changed.</i></b>

183
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:47,431
<b><i>Moses Melodies was now</i></b>
<b><i>a wig store,</i></b>

184
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:49,299
<b><i>but once inside,</i></b>

185
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,335
<b><i>memories of that final</i></b>
<b><i>encounter with Frances</i></b>

186
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,203
<b><i>began to resurface.</i></b>

187
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,405
{\an1}<b>- Well, there was</b>
<b>a counter, like, here.</b>

188
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,243
{\an1}<b>I was right here,</b>
<b>and she came in that way.</b>

189
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:02,579
{\an3}<b>I was behind</b>
<b>the counter here.</b>

190
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,281
{\an1}<b>- Okay.</b>

191
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:06,283
{\an3}<b>- She brought</b>
<b>her tape recorder.</b>

192
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:08,552
{\an1}<b>That's the last</b>
<b>time I saw her.</b>

193
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,321
<b>-</b><b><i>As he continued,</i></b>
<b><i>I began to understand</i></b>

194
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,656
<b><i>what a loss this was</i></b>
<b><i>for him.</i></b>

195
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:15,592
{\an1}<b>- She cried, said,</b>
<b>"I'll love you to my grave."</b>

196
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,227
{\an1}<b>I never will</b>
<b>forget that.</b>

197
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,629
<b>- That's what</b>
<b>she said to you?</b>

198
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,598
{\an1}<b>- Mm-hmm, that's</b>
<b>what she told me.</b>

199
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,700
{\an3}<b>- So why'd you never</b>
<b>see her again?</b>

200
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:26,637
{\an1}<b>- She said, "You want your</b>
<b>career." I headed to Hollywood.</b>

201
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,640
{\an1}<b>She said,</b>
<b>"You want your career."</b>

202
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,511
{\an1}<b>Those are the breaks.</b>
<b>[chuckles]</b>

203
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:36,580
<b>-</b><b><i>I was starting</i></b>
<b><i>to realize</i></b>

204
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:39,449
<b><i>why I was so drawn to</i></b>
<b><i>Bill's story.</i></b>

205
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,952
<b><i>As someone who also left</i></b>
<b><i>a lot behind</i></b>

206
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:44,488
<b><i>to pursue a career</i></b>
<b><i>in Hollywood,</i></b>

207
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,890
<b><i>I couldn't help but feel</i></b>
<b><i>an odd kinship with him.</i></b>

208
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:48,692
<b><i>But the fact</i></b>
<b><i>remained that</i></b>

209
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,328
<b><i>we still had nothing concrete</i></b>
<b><i>to go off of</i></b>

210
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:54,364
<b><i>besides a first name</i></b>
<b><i>and Bill's sketch.</i></b>

211
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,935
{\an8}<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- White?</b>

212
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,970
{\an8}<b>- White.</b>
<b>- She's white.</b>

213
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:02,506
<b><i>It was as if we were trying to</i></b>
<b><i>find a missing person.</i></b>

214
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,744
{\an7}<b>This is a woman.</b>

215
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,479
<b><i>And it was hard to know</i></b>
<b><i>what would lead us to her</i></b>

216
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:12,349
<b><i>or where to even begin.</i></b>

217
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:13,884
<b><i>On the way back</i></b>
<b><i>to our hotel,</i></b>

218
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,019
<b><i>Bill wanted to take me by</i></b>
<b><i>his old high school.</i></b>

219
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:20,023
<b>- Central High, the integration,</b>
<b>nine black students.</b>

220
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:21,692
{\an1}<b>They had to get</b>
<b>the federal troops in here</b>

221
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:25,629
{\an1}<b>to enter them.</b>

222
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:27,664
{\an1}<b>We always got along</b>
<b>with the blacks,</b>

223
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,267
{\an1}<b>no problem.</b>

224
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,436
{\an1}<b>It's too bad that</b>
<b>it had to come to this,</b>

225
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,571
{\an1}<b>but it happened.</b>

226
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:35,873
<b>-</b><b><i>It was neat to learn</i></b>
<b><i>a bit of the history</i></b>

227
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,841
<b><i>of Bill's high school,</i></b>

228
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,410
<b><i>but then something came up</i></b>
<b><i>that could be useful.</i></b>

229
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:43,046
{\an3}<b>Did Frances go to</b>
<b>your high school?</b>

230
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,317
{\an1}<b>- Um...</b>

231
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:50,687
{\an1}<b>No, she went to</b>
<b>Dumas High School, I believe.</b>

232
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:53,991
{\an1}<b>Dumas, Arkansas.</b>

233
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,726
{\an3}<b>- Dumas.</b>

234
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,828
<b><i>It turned out that Dumas</i></b>
<b><i>was a town</i></b>

235
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,963
<b><i>just under two hours</i></b>
<b><i>from Little Rock,</i></b>

236
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,032
<b><i>and if I could get in touch</i></b>
<b><i>with their high school,</i></b>

237
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,334
<b><i>they'd most likely have</i></b>
<b><i>student records</i></b>

238
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:06,937
<b><i>or even an old yearbook that</i></b>
<b><i>could give us a clue.</i></b>

239
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,705
<b><i>But the school was closed</i></b>
<b><i>for the day</i></b>

240
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,574
<b><i>so we'd have to call</i></b>
<b><i>in the morning</i></b>

241
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,342
<b><i>In the meantime,</i></b>
<b><i>we checked into our hotel</i></b>

242
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,545
<b><i>in downtown Little Rock,</i></b>

243
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,847
<b><i>and after getting unpacked</i></b>
<b><i>and grabbing some dinner,</i></b>

244
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,384
<b><i>we decided to</i></b>
<b><i>call it a night.</i></b>

<b>[cell phone chimes off]</b>

246
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,456

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,691

00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,864
<b>- Can I ask you</b>
<b>something?</b>

251
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,899
<b>- Yes.</b>

252
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:39,303
<b>- What's your favorite memory</b>
<b>of Frances?</b>

253
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,080
<b>- Probably when we were</b>
<b>on the bed there together.</b>

254
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:51,481
<b>- When you were</b>
<b>on the bed together?</b>

255
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:52,783
<b>- Yeah.</b>

256
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:55,018
<b>- What did you do</b>
<b>on the bed?</b>

00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:58,488

<b><i>any of their</i></b>

00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,277
<b><i>I guess</i></b>

282
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,912

00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:05,382

284
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:07,718
<b><i>But after doing a bit of</i></b>

285
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,720
<b><i>something occurred to me</i></b>
<b><i>that could possibly be</i></b>

286
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,688
<b><i>our way in.</i></b>

287
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,557
<b><i>Dumas' main claim to fame</i></b>
<b><i>was that</i></b>

288
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,726
<b><i>they were the shooting location</i></b>
<b><i>for the 2012</i></b>

289
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,662
<b><i>Matthew McConaughey movie</i></b>
<b><i>"Mud."</i></b>

290
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:22,366
<b><i>It was clearly a point of pride</i></b>
<b><i>for everyone in Dumas.</i></b>

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,234
<b><i>So if we could pretend that</i></b>
<b><i>we were in town</i></b>

292
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,269
<b><i>to shoot a sequel</i></b>
<b><i>to "Mud,"</i></b>

293
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,537
{\an1}<b><i>called "Mud 2: Never Clean,"</i></b>

294
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:29,506
<b><i>I was confident the city</i></b>
<b><i>would grant us access</i></b>

295
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,942
<b><i>to any location</i></b>
<b><i>in Dumas,</i></b>

296
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:33,644
<b><i>including their</i></b>
<b><i>high school</i></b>

297
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,446
<b><i>with its archive</i></b>
<b><i>of yearbooks.</i></b>

298
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,715
<b><i>But to pull this off,</i></b>
<b><i>we'd need some credibility,</i></b>

299
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,185
<b><i>so I contacted an actor named</i></b>
<b><i>Richard Ledbetter</i></b>

300
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,854

302
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,391

303
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:50,460

00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,299

489
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,301

493
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,175
{\an1}<b><i>Bill headed upstairs to his</i></b>

498
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,184

499
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,119

500
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:22,256
{\an1}<b>So this is</b>
<b>Easter 1939,</b>

501
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,191
{\an1}<b>and that's Bill.</b>

502
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,726

<b>- I know.</b>

503
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,362
{\an1}<b>That's a picture</b>

504
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,830
<b>- This is Bill?</b>

505
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:32,066
<b>- Uh-huh,</b>
<b>in his younger years.</b>

506
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,167
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

507
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,702
{\an1}<b>Look at that hair.</b>

508
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:35,836
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

509
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,072
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

510
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,674
<b>-</b><b><i>I was stunned to see that Bill</i></b>
<b><i>was once incredibly handsome,</i></b>

511
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,177
<b><i>and for the first time,</i></b>
<b><i>his Hollywood aspirations</i></b>

512
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,346
<b><i>started to make sense.</i></b>

513
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,948
{\an1}<b><i>So I was hopeful Shelly would</i></b>
<b><i>be able to shine more light</i></b>

514
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,284
<b><i>on this man who left</i></b>
<b><i>the love of his life</i></b>

515
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,019
<b><i>for a shot at fame.</i></b>

516
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,722
<b>- Bill's dad died</b>
<b>when he was five years old,</b>

517
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,792
<b>and his dad,</b>
<b>I think,</b>

518
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:59,627
<b>was in his 50s</b>
<b>when he died,</b>

519
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,861
<b>so he was fairly young.</b>

520
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,763
<b>- Huh.</b>

521
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,765
<b>- And he really struggled</b>
<b>emotionally</b>

522
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,768
<b>trying to</b>
<b>deal with that.</b>

523
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,970
<b>And I think there's just</b>
<b>different points of his life</b>

524
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,940
<b>that he just kind of felt,</b>
<b>you know,</b>

525
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:16,644
<b>that maybe he's been entitled</b>
<b>to certain things</b>

526
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,914
<b>and life doesn't always</b>
<b>work out that way.</b>

527
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,250
<b>I think that's harder for him</b>
<b>to move past.</b>

528
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,720
<b>- Bill's memories about Frances</b>
<b>are very foggy...</b>

529
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:27,655
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>- and vague...</b>

530
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,256
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

531
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,859
<b>- and there's a lot of</b>
<b>half information.</b>

532
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:35,930
<b>And so I was hoping maybe you</b>
<b>might know stuff or--</b>

533
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,065
<b>Has he mentioned her</b>
<b>to you?</b>

534
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:40,868
<b>- Briefly, but yeah,</b>
<b>briefly, he has.</b>

535
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,237
<b>Evidently, I think</b>
<b>he dated her</b>

536
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,972
<b>and my grandmother</b>
<b>didn't want him to marry her.</b>

537
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,340
<b>Is that what</b>
<b>he's told you?</b>

538
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,275
<b>- He said something</b>
<b>like that, yeah.</b>

539
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,978
<b>I get a sense he really regrets</b>
<b>not marrying her.</b>

540
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,346
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- He says he should have</b>

541
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,681
<b>married her.</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

542
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,349
<b>And Bill keeps</b>
<b>in touch with--</b>

543
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,985
{\an1}<b>I mean, you know, he has his</b>
<b>little, literally, black book</b>

544
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:00,454
<b>and he keeps in touch with</b>
<b>a lot of people:</b>

545
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,089
<b>relatives, friends.</b>

546
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:05,326
<b>He's very, very good</b>
<b>about that.</b>

547
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,895
<b>So the fact that</b>
<b>he lost touch with her</b>

548
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,964
<b>is kind of interesting</b>
<b>to me.</b>

549
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,967

550

935
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:48,865

00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:51,101

937
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:55,705

938
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:57,273
<b>Well...</b>

939
00:39:57,307 --> 00:40:00,076

00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:03,680

00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:09,252
{\an3}<b>I--</b>

944
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:12,122

945
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:16,292

946
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,194

947
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:20,630

948
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:22,899

{\an1}<b>and notice what</b>

956
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:02,404

00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,347

964
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:19,755

966
00:41:22,324 --> 00:41:25,661

00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:41,410
<b><i>Frances was head over heels</i></b>

974
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:43,612

978
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:52,454

{\an1}<b><i>We can work together for the</i></b>

<b><i>to reach your goal</i></b>
<b><i>as an actor and singer,</i></b>

982

00:42:21,784 --> 00:42:24,153
{\an1}<b><i>Let us drop that subject now.</i></b>

992
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:26,288
<b>-</b><b><i>In these letters,</i></b>
<b><i>Bill almost seemed like</i></b>

993
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:28,490
<b><i>a different person</i></b>

994

997

<b>-</b><b><i>Okay.</i></b>

1003
00:42:50,646 --> 00:42:52,514

1007
00:42:59,822 --> 00:43:02,324

1008
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:04,159
<b>-</b><b><i>[laughs]</i></b>

1009
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:07,162
<b><i>I have a lot of clients</i></b>

1010
00:43:07,196 --> 00:43:10,232
<b><i>or a lot</i></b>

<b><i>[laughs]</i></b>

1012
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,238

1013
00:43:16,271 --> 00:43:18,373

<b><i>much about the escort business,</i></b>

1014
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:20,676
<b><i>she was cool with my request to</i></b>

1015
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:22,478

1016
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,379
<b>-</b><b><i>Yeah,</i></b>
<b><i>mm-hmm.</i></b>

1017
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:26,181
<b>-</b><b><i>So I made a booking through</i></b>
<b><i>her website</i></b>

1018
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:28,217
<b><i>at her flirtation rate</i></b>
<b><i>of $350 an hour</i></b>

1019
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,486
<b><i>and then met up with Bill</i></b>

1020
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,521
<b><i>to see if I could get him to</i></b>
<b><i>agree to a date with Maci.</i></b>

1021
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:34,389
<b>I thought it might be nice for</b>
<b>you to have</b>

1022
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:35,891
<b>some companionship,</b>
<b>you know,</b>

1023
00:43:35,924 --> 00:43:37,826
<b>someone to</b>
<b>hang out with.</b>

1024
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,662

1025
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:42,831
<b>with an escort.</b>

1026
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:45,734
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>Really?</b>

1027
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:50,906
<b>Escort service?</b>

1028
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:52,841
<b>- Yeah, she's</b>
<b>a professional escort.</b>

1029
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,910
<b>- No,</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1030
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:56,712
<b>- You don't</b>
<b>want that?</b>

1031
00:43:56,745 --> 00:43:58,247
<b>- I hate to use</b>
<b>that term,</b>

1032
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,517
<b>you gotta know</b>
<b>what you're sticking it in.</b>

1033
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,585
<b>- Jesus, Bill.</b>

1034
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:05,721
<b>- That's right.</b>

1035
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:08,357
<b>- Even after I told Bill it</b>
<b>wasn't supposed to be sexual,</b>

1036
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,893
<b>he declined, saying it went</b>
<b>against his values.</b>

1037
00:44:10,926 --> 00:44:13,362
<b>- Sodom and Gomorrah sin.</b>

1038
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:15,364
<b>- A sin?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

1039
00:44:15,397 --> 00:44:17,266
<b>-</b><b><i>It was too bad Bill didn't</i></b>
<b><i>want to do it</i></b>

1040
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:19,401
<b><i>but since we had already</i></b>
<b><i>paid her,</i></b>

1041
00:44:19,435 --> 00:44:21,470
<b><i>I felt it might be worth</i></b>
<b><i>interviewing Maci</i></b>

1042
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:23,672
<b><i>to see if she had any insights</i></b>
<b><i>into the mind-set</i></b>

1043
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,774
<b><i>of old, single men.</i></b>

1044
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:27,743
<b><i>So later that day,</i></b>
<b><i>she agreed to meet up with me</i></b>

1045
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:29,778
<b><i>for an on-camera chat.</i></b>

1046
00:44:29,812 --> 00:44:30,879
<b>- I've never</b>
<b>done this, so...</b>

1047
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:32,347
<b>- You've never</b>
<b>been on camera.</b>

1048
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:33,882
<b>- Like--no.</b>
<b>- Oh, really?</b>

1049
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,250
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>Never.</b>

1050
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:36,418
<b>- Is it weird for you?</b>

1051
00:44:36,452 --> 00:44:37,619
<b>- It is</b>
<b>a little weird, yeah.</b>

1052
00:44:37,653 --> 00:44:39,354
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>Are you okay with it?</b>

1053
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:40,689
<b>- Yeah, I'm okay.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

1054
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,724
<b>- It's just different.</b>

1055
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:44,393
<b>-</b><b><i>It took a little time</i></b>
<b><i>for Maci to get comfortable</i></b>

1056
00:44:44,426 --> 00:44:46,361
<b><i>with the cameras,</i></b>
<b><i>but she soon volunteered</i></b>

1057
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:47,696
<b><i>to tell me about</i></b>
<b><i>what she does.</i></b>

1058
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,431
<b>- A lot of IT people,</b>

1059
00:44:49,465 --> 00:44:52,768

<b>corporate America finance.</b>

1060

<b>- That's who you see</b>
<b>the most.</b>

1061
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:56,271
<b>- Attorneys, doctors.</b>

1062
00:44:56,305 --> 00:44:58,640
<b>- Oh, wow.</b>
<b>What about judges?</b>

1063
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:01,243
<b>- I've met a judge,</b>
<b>I have.</b>

1064
00:45:01,276 --> 00:45:02,745
<b>- Really?</b>
<b>- I've met a preacher.</b>

1065
00:45:02,778 --> 00:45:04,980
<b>I've met--</b>
<b>[laughs]</b>

1066
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:07,316
<b>I've actually met</b>

00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:08,517

1068
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,586
<b>- Yeah.</b>

1069
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,287
<b>-</b><b><i>I was surprised to learn that</i></b>

<b><i>and accepted</i></b>

<b><i>than I initially thought.</i></b>

1072
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:16,792

1073
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:18,727
<b>and they'll want to</b>
<b>keep in touch.</b>

1074
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:20,763
{\an1}<b>Like, they'll send emails and be</b>
<b>like, "Hey, how are you doing?"</b>

1075
00:45:20,796 --> 00:45:21,663
<b>- Really?</b>
<b>- "Hope everything's okay."</b>

1092
00:45:50,692 --> 00:45:52,428

1093
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,296

<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>- What do you mean?</b>

1111
00:46:22,758 --> 00:46:25,727
{\an1}<b>- You lied to</b>

1112
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:27,863
<b>- I mean,</b>

1121
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,446
<b><i>I found myself stuck</i></b>

1122
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,815
<b><i>with a lot of free time</i></b>
<b><i>on my hands.</i></b>

1123
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:48,650

1124
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,886
<b><i>and watching TV</i></b>

1125
00:46:50,919 --> 00:46:53,956

1126
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:58,393

00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:03,699

<b>that's not good.</b>

1129
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:07,469
{\an1}<b><i>But overall, I found the social</i></b>

1130
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:10,105

1140
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,460
<b>or...</b>

1141
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,997

{\an1}<b>- Good to see you.</b>

1148

1149

1153
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:54,917
{\an3}<b>I just wanted</b>
<b>to make sure.</b>

1154
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,885
{\an1}<b>- It's a gift card</b>
<b>or a gift bag.</b>

1155
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,020
{\an3}<b>- Oh, what</b>
<b>do you mean?</b>

1156
00:47:58,053 --> 00:47:59,154
{\an1}<b>- So it doesn't look</b>

1157
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:00,823
{\an3}<b>- What am I</b>

1159

{\an1}<b>- When you're</b>

1160
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:04,426
{\an3}<b>- You give</b>

1161
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,895
{\an1}<b>- Like a card,</b>

1167

<b>- You did. You're learning.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

1185
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,977
{\an1}<b>This is the type of place</b>

1186
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,678
<b>- Oh, you're not gonna</b>

1187

{\an1}<b>- No, I'm not.</b>

{\an3}<b>- Okay, good.</b>
<b>[laughs]</b>

1189
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:01,517

1190
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,684
{\an3}<b>- It is kind of</b>

{\an1}<b>- Yeah.</b>

1192

00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:45,373
<b>Remember, she said</b>
<b>she'd love me to her grave.</b>

1395
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:47,575
<b>-</b><b><i>And for the first time</i></b>
<b><i>since agreeing to help Bill,</i></b>

1396
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:49,878
<b><i>I didn't know</i></b>
<b><i>what to do.</i></b>

1397
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,834
<b>-</b><b><i>Bill was dead set</i></b>
<b><i>on going to Michigan</i></b>

1398
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,270
<b><i>to profess his love</i></b>
<b><i>to Frances.</i></b>

1399
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:58,272
<b><i>I knew he felt strongly</i></b>
<b><i>about her,</i></b>

1400
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:00,474
<b><i>but I hadn't considered</i></b>
<b><i>the possibility</i></b>

1401
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:03,043
<b><i>that Bill would try to get her</i></b>
<b><i>to divorce her husband.</i></b>

1402
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:06,080
<b>Do you think there's a chance</b>
<b>she'd do that?</b>

1403
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:07,448
<b>- There's a chance.</b>

1404
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:10,317
<b>It's the roll</b>
<b>of the dice.</b>

1405
00:59:10,351 --> 00:59:12,620
<b>7 come 11.</b>

1406
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:15,422
<b>-</b><b><i>My gut was telling me that</i></b>
<b><i>this was a bad idea</i></b>

1407
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,725
<b><i>and that Bill's chances of</i></b>
<b><i>succeeding were slim.</i></b>

1408
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:19,527
<b><i>But who knows?</i></b>

1409
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,662
<b><i>Frances' love for Bill</i></b>
<b><i>in those letters</i></b>

1410
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:23,597
<b><i>seemed so deep.</i></b>

1411
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,132
<b><i>Maybe after</i></b>
<b><i>all these years</i></b>

1412
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:27,735
<b><i>she felt the same regret</i></b>
<b><i>he did.</i></b>

1413
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:30,204
<b><i>Regardless, if Bill really</i></b>
<b><i>wanted to surprise Frances</i></b>

1414
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,572
<b><i>at her front door,</i></b>

1415
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:33,574
<b><i>I felt obligated</i></b>
<b><i>to make sure</i></b>

1416
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:35,743
<b><i>he was putting</i></b>
<b><i>his best foot forward.</i></b>

1417
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,312
<b><i>So I found a professional</i></b>
<b><i>actress online</i></b>

1418
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:41,649
<b><i>who closely resembled</i></b>
<b><i>Frances' look and age</i></b>

1419
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:43,584
<b><i>to be Bill's</i></b>
<b><i>rehearsal partner.</i></b>

1420
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,686
<b><i>I then arranged with</i></b>
<b><i>a local theater company</i></b>

1421
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:46,820
<b><i>who is currently staging</i></b>
<b><i>a production</i></b>

1422
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:49,089
<b><i>of "Young Frankenstein"</i></b>

1423
00:59:49,123 --> 00:59:51,125
<b><i>to let us use their venue</i></b>
<b><i>as a practice space</i></b>

1424
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:52,826
<b><i>during one of</i></b>
<b><i>their days off,</i></b>

1425
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,596
<b><i>and using some furniture</i></b>
<b><i>we found backstage,</i></b>

1426
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:59,333
<b><i>we created a makeshift set</i></b>
<b><i>to play as Frances' home.</i></b>

1427
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:02,603
<b><i>Bye the time June, our actress,</i></b>
<b><i>arrived from Los Angeles,</i></b>

1428
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:05,105
<b><i>she had studied up on</i></b>
<b><i>Frances' letters,</i></b>

1429
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:07,308
<b><i>which I had given her</i></b>
<b><i>so she'd have a better sense</i></b>

1430
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:09,109
<b><i>of the woman</i></b>
<b><i>she'd be portraying.</i></b>

1431
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:12,646
<b>- He disappointed her and--</b>
<b>and hurt her.</b>

1432
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,282
<b>-</b><b><i>And before long, it was time</i></b>
<b><i>for her to meet the man</i></b>

1433
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:17,251
<b><i>she had read</i></b>
<b><i>so much about.</i></b>

1434
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,186
{\an1}<b>- Oh, hi, Bill.</b>

1435
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,188
<b>- June is the actress that</b>
<b>will be playing Frances.</b>

1436
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:22,857
<b>- Pleasure meeting you.</b>
<b>- Pleasure.</b>

1437
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,659
<b>- What do you think?</b>
<b>Is the look pretty accurate?</b>

1438
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:26,861
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- Yeah?</b>

1439
01:00:26,894 --> 01:00:28,395
{\an1}<b>- Not bad.</b>

1440
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:29,597
<b>- [laughs]</b>

1441
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,265
<b>- Not bad.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

1442
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,666
<b>- Of course, it's not--</b>
<b>- You've got nice teeth.</b>

1443
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,368
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- You've got nice teeth.</b>

1444
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:36,136
<b>- It's so long since</b>
<b>you've seen her, right?</b>

1445
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,305
<b>- Ooh, look at her teeth.</b>
<b>Look at 'em.</b>

1446
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,207
<b>You've got 'em all.</b>
<b>They're yours.</b>

1447
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,342
<b>- Yes, they're mine.</b>
<b>- Nothing fake.</b>

1448
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:44,345
{\an1}<b>- They're mine.</b>
<b>They're all mine.</b>

1449
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:46,413
<b>-</b><b><i>Right away, I began to see</i></b>
<b><i>the side of Bill</i></b>

1450
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:49,416
<b><i>that Frances had alluded to</i></b>
<b><i>in her letters</i></b>

1451
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,485
<b><i>and I knew we had a lot of work</i></b>
<b><i>ahead of us.</i></b>

1452
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:53,754
<b><i>For our initial</i></b>
<b><i>run-through,</i></b>

1453
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:56,390
<b><i>I asked Bill to show me</i></b>
<b><i>what he was thinking of doing</i></b>

1454
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:58,526
<b><i>when he arrived</i></b>
<b><i>at Frances' home,</i></b>

1455
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,262
<b><i>and then we would adjust</i></b>
<b><i>from there if necessary.</i></b>

1456
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:03,697
<b>All right, so, Bill, you're</b>
<b>arriving at Frances' door.</b>

1457
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:05,533
<b>This is the first time</b>
<b>you've seen her in 50 years.</b>

1458
01:01:05,566 --> 01:01:06,700
<b>Okay, ready?</b>

1459
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,636
<b>And action.</b>

1460
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,705
<b>[knock on door]</b>

1461
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:18,546
{\an1}<b>- Frances, God, I can't</b>
<b>believe it's you!</b>

1462
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,548
{\an1}<b>- Bill, oh, my God!</b>

1463
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:22,850
{\an1}<b>It's been so long.</b>

1464
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:24,718
{\an1}<b>Is it really you?</b>

1465
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:26,887
<b>- Man.</b>

1466
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:29,190
{\an1}<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>Oh, my goodness.</b>

1467
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:31,725
{\an3}<b>- I can't believe</b>
<b>it's you.</b>

1468
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,494
{\an3}<b>[cries]</b>

1469
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:34,895
{\an3}<b>All these years.</b>

1470
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:36,931
{\an1}<b>- I know, I know,</b>
<b>I know. Sit.</b>

1471
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:39,433
{\an1}<b>- We should have married.</b>
<b>Why didn't you marry me?</b>

1472
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:42,837
<b>- So, Bill, tell me</b>
<b>all about yourself.</b>

1473
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,905
{\an1}<b>Now, easy on.</b>
<b>It's been 47 years now.</b>

1474
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:47,675
{\an1}<b>I'm a married woman,</b>
<b>so just take it easy.</b>

1475
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,710
{\an1}<b>Just take it slow.</b>

1476
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:51,612
{\an1}<b>I just want--</b>
<b>Now--</b>

1477
01:01:51,645 --> 01:01:53,914
<b>- Okay, pause.</b>

1478
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:57,852
<b>Bill, can I ask you why you</b>
<b>rubbed her leg like that?</b>

1479
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,887
{\an3}<b>- Where?</b>
<b>Her leg?</b>

1480
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,824
<b>- Yeah.</b>

1481
01:02:03,858 --> 01:02:06,260
{\an3}<b>- I don't know.</b>
<b>It's just--</b>

1482
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:08,562
<b>- June, as Frances, how do you</b>
<b>think she would feel</b>

1483
01:02:08,596 --> 01:02:09,630
<b>if he touched her?</b>

1484
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,266
{\an1}<b>- Uncomfortable.</b>

1485
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:14,268
<b>-</b><b><i>The first run-through</i></b>
<b><i>was troubling.</i></b>

1486
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:16,637
<b><i>Bill's initial attempts</i></b>
<b><i>to win over Frances</i></b>

1487
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,439
<b><i>came across</i></b>
<b><i>as either creepy...</i></b>

1488
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:19,640
{\an3}<b>- Is your husband</b>
<b>a jealous man?</b>

1489
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:21,242
<b>-</b><b><i>or desperate.</i></b>

1490
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:24,612
<b>- But I'm asking you again</b>
<b>to marry me, please.</b>

1491
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:26,947
<b>-</b><b><i>He just couldn't engage</i></b>
<b><i>with Frances</i></b>

1492
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:28,649
<b><i>like a normal</i></b>
<b><i>human being.</i></b>

1493
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:30,451
{\an3}<b>- Surprise!</b>

1494
01:02:30,484 --> 01:02:32,620
<b>-</b><b><i>And bringing in</i></b>
<b><i>our "Mud 2" actor</i></b>

1495
01:02:32,653 --> 01:02:35,623
<b><i>to play her husband only seemed</i></b>
<b><i>to make things worse.</i></b>

1496
01:02:35,656 --> 01:02:37,791
<b>- I'm here to marry...</b>

1497
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:39,293
<b>- My wife.</b>
<b>- your wife.</b>

1498
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:40,327
<b>Do you understand...</b>
<b>- But she's my wife.</b>

1499
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:41,962
<b>- English?</b>

1500
01:02:41,996 --> 01:02:43,831
<b>-</b><b><i>He was just unable</i></b>
<b><i>to see the situation</i></b>

1501
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:45,766
<b><i>from Frances'</i></b>

1502
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:48,469
<b><i>And worst of all,</i></b>
<b><i>our Frances stand-in</i></b>

1503
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:49,670
<b><i>was not convinced.</i></b>

1504
01:02:49,703 --> 01:02:52,473
{\an1}<b>- You should be</b>
<b>a little bit more...</b>

1505
01:02:52,506 --> 01:02:54,642
{\an1}<b>understanding,</b>

1506
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,745
{\an1}<b>'cause if you push that</b>
<b>on her too fast--</b>

1507
01:02:57,778 --> 01:02:59,313
<b>- Yeah, that could be bad.</b>
<b>- You know what I mean?</b>

1508
01:02:59,346 --> 01:03:01,448
{\an1}<b>You know, be more like</b>
<b>a gentleman.</b>

1509
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:02,850
<b>-</b><b><i>So to help Bill better</i></b>
<b><i>understand</i></b>

1510
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:04,618
<b><i>what Frances</i></b>
<b><i>might be feeling,</i></b>

1511
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:07,621

1512
01:03:07,655 --> 01:03:09,990
<b><i>using a wig I picked up</i></b>
<b><i>from a store down the block.</i></b>

1513
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:12,426
{\an1}<b>- You don't know how</b>
<b>I've cried myself to sleep</b>

1514
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,562
{\an1}<b>thinking of you.</b>

1515
01:03:14,595 --> 01:03:16,697
{\an1}<b>Losing sleep</b>
<b>for hours.</b>

1516
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,333
<b>- I'm sorry, Frances.</b>

1517
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:21,669
{\an1}<b>- Well, it's like when</b>
<b>a person kills somebody,</b>

1518
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:24,438
{\an1}<b>they're sorry, but that doesn't</b>
<b>bring 'em back to life.</b>

1519
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,641
<b>-</b><b><i>After embodying Frances</i></b>
<b><i>for nearly an hour,</i></b>

1520
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:29,777
<b><i>it seemed to give Bill</i></b>
<b><i>some new perspective.</i></b>

1521
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,513
{\an1}<b>- Never heard from you,</b>

1522
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:34,682
{\an1}<b>call you on the phone,</b>

1523
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:36,951
{\an1}<b>ignore the calls.</b>

1524
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,953
{\an1}<b>All you wanted</b>
<b>was the career,</b>

1525
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,988
{\an1}<b>the career</b>
<b>in Hollywood.</b>

1526
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:44,625
{\an1}<b>You were just doing it</b>

1527
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:47,661
{\an1}<b>Self-centered.</b>

1528
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:50,331
<b>-</b><b><i>And once he switched back</i></b>
<b><i>to himself again,</i></b>

1529
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:52,633
<b><i>a softer side of Bill</i></b>
<b><i>seemed to emerge.</i></b>

1530
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:56,504
