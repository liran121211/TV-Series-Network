I'll handle this.

190
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:37,885
[together]
Whoa!

191
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,587
- Howdy, neighbor.

192
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,755
Would you like a cookie?

193
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,558
They're made with heart.

194
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,163
- Stop right there, villain.

195
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,666
Your reign of terror has...

196
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,569
[munching]

197
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,570
[mumbling]

198
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,438
- [sighs]

199
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,207
What?

200
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,342
- Up, down, and away!

201
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,612
Ahh!

202
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,415
Ooh.

203
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,953
Oh, perfect.

204
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,656
- Good thinking, son.

205
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:20,661
Let's drive a wedge into
Granny Tentacle's schemes.

206
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,896
[laughter]

207
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,498
Fore.

208
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,868
- Yahoo!

209
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,336
Hey, Granny.

210
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,337
- Huh?

211
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,640
- Going to hit you with a boat.

212
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,307
- What's that?

213
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:40,681
[loud explosion]

214
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,916
- The day is saved.

215
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,818
[crowd jeering]

216
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,319
- That was terrible.

217
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,220
- Boo.

218
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,690
- We hate you, Superstars.

219
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,925
You make everything worse.

220
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,026
- Yeah.

221
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,495
You traumatized this poor kid.

222
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,730
- Hi.

223
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,066
- And you stole
my purse that I stole.

224
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,468
- He stole it fair and square.

225
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,603
- But... but we're the heroes.

226
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:07,775
President Krabs
hired us to protect the city.

227
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,776
- [gasps]

228
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:09,977
Um, no.

229
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,178
I didn't hire...

230
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,680
I mean, uh...

231
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,247
I'm-a someone-a else-a.

232
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,849
Not-a President-a Krabs-a.

233
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,651
Go, go, go, go.

234
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,856
- But we're the good guys.

235
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,424
- No, you ninny.

236
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:28,662
The citizens
wanted me to stop you.

237
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,964
I'm the good guy.

238
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,501
[cheers and applause]

239
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,136
See?

240
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:42,575
- Since she's the good guy, why
don't we just be the bad guys?

241
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,712
- Oh, yeah.

242
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:50,017
We're evil now.

243
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,720
All: Evil goatees.

244
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,787
- What the?

245
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:54,988
- All right.

246
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,024
Time for some villainy.

247
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,359
[grunting]

248
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:03,731
But first, let's get
rid of this pesky hero.

249
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,034
Evil ink web.

250
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,236
Now let's wreak some havoc.

251
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,370
- As a family.

252
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,239
[laughter and explosions]

253
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,109
- Let's go.

254
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,713
- Try jiggling the antenna.

255
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,722
- [humming]

256
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,657
[all munching]

257
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,393
I've got a special
stack for someone

258
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,132
who got a special job as an
art museum security guard.

259
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,199
- Wow.

260
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,103
It looks exactly like me.

261
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,205
Thanks, hon.
- Mwah!

262
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,075
I am so proud of you.

263
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,910
- Oh, what's the big deal?

264
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,279
It's his fifth job this week.

265
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:56,116
- Can't I make you
proud just once, Dad?

266
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,218
- Son, I'm never proud of you.

267
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,754
But at least I'm consistent.

268
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,022
Mwah!

269
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,623
- Oh, Dad.

270
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,793
[bell tolling]

271
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,160
Holy smokes.

272
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,929
I'm going to be late
for my first day.

273
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:12,399
[grunting]

274
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,268
- See you in the morning, hon.

275
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,669
- Good night, honey.
- Snoring

276
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,539
[regal music]

277
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,876
- Welcome to your
first night, Mr. Star.

278
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,013
Your duty is to guard
the Upton collection

279
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,215
of priceless artwork.

280
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,351
And make sure
no ill will comes to it.

281
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:36,189
You have no idea
what unspeakable atrocities

282
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,525
my family had to perpetrate...

283
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:43,163
uh, I mean, endure...
to obtain this collection.

284
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,597
The horror.

285
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,899
The bloodshed.

286
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,335
The... hmm?

287
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,905
- This security guard
flashlight sure is nifty.

288
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,606
- And don't touch the art.

289
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,944
Make sure all the artwork
stays in its proper place.

290
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,880
Such as this one.

291
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,450
Finally, and most importantly,

292
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,421
do not let anyone in.

293
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,823
- All right, everyone.

294
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,091
You heard the lady.

295
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,059
- Whoa!

296
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,126
- Scram.

297
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,128
Get out of here.

298
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,465
No one allowed in the museum.

299
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:24,872
- After closing, you nincompoop.

300
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:29,709
I am offended.

301
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,479
- Huh?

302
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,416
Dad left the most important
part of his job uniform

303
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:41,554
at home,
his official security briefs.

304
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,825
I can't imagine the
torture he's going through.

305
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,395
- [teeth chattering]

306
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,330
- I'm coming, Dad.

307
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:54,067
- Patrick, it's cold
out this time of night.

308
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,803
If you're going to go
all the way to see your dad,

309
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,206
make sure you wear your sweater.

310
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,974
Not to mention your face warmer.

311
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,611
And here's a bag to store
your father's underwear.

312
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,812
There.

313
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,747
Now you're safe
to go out at night.

314
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:11,318
Oh, remember, what's a nice,
positive thing to say

315
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,087
to everyone you meet tonight?

316
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,190
- Reach for the sky.

317
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,391
Thanks, Mom.

318
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,895
Gotta run.

319
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,830
- Hmm.

320
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,099
Oh. Oh, no.

321
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,536
My first night on the job,
and some vandal graffito

322
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,972
tagged this painting.

323
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,140
[grunting]

324
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,474
Ha.

325
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,944
There.
That's better.

326
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,546
Hmm.

327
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,249
You got a little schmutz
on your everything.

328
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,684
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

329
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,055
Hey, no food allowed
in the museum.

330
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,292
[spitting]

331
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,359
Whoo!

332
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,761
An art thief.

333
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,864
Hey, buddy, no one
allowed in the museum.

334
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,668
You better not be
stealing stuff.

335
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,971
Ah, so you won't talk, eh?

336
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,975
Strong, silent type.

337
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,276
Ooh.

338
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,978
I don't like that
stone-cold look

339
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,379
on your chiseled features.

340
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,015
If you're not going
to comply, sir,

341
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,317
then I'll take you by force.

342
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,919
Yah! Ah-hoo! Ha!

343
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,121
[grunting]

344
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,455
[panting]

345
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,823
Give up yet?

346
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,192
[grunts]
Uh-oh.

347
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,359
[groaning]

348
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,195
[mumbling]

349
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,063
[grunts]

350
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,298
[panting]

351
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,565
And stay out.

352
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,370
- [sobbing]

353
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,206
Finally.

354
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,341
I'm free.
I'm free!

355
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,408
I'm free!

356
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,012
[tires screeching]

357
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,815
- Wow.
Thanks for the super-fast ride

358
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,651
and the free watches
and wallets.

359
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,853
You guys are so nice.

360
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,223
- Floor it!

361
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,992
- Keep reaching for the sky.

362
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,928
- Hey, kid,
could you lend me a hand?

363
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,296
Or a whole body?

364
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,665
- No can do, Mr. Severed Head.

365
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,301
I gotta get my dad
his lost underwear.

366
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,203
- Cripes.
That's important.

367
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,239
Go, go, go.

368
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,774
- On it.

369
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,144
[grunting]

370
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,112
Oh, barnacles.

371
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,081
- Same thing happened to me.

372
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,149
- Dang it.

373
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,850
Hmm.

374
