375
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,415
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

376
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,985
With this amount
of skin slippage,

377
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,155
this corpse must be
at least two weeks' old.

378
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,958
Time to start
the embalming fluid.

379
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:55,795
This'll be a tough job,
but I will make you beautiful.

380
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,431
- And bread.

381
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:02,769
[blubbering]

382
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,541
[chomping]

383
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:13,146
Ahh, that was the best
pre-soup snack I've ever had.

384
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,684
I just wish I had somewhere
comfier to digest it.

385
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,121
Ooh, I can build
something comfy out

386
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,990
of these fun blocks for kids.

387
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:28,761
Speaking of kids, I wonder what
my kids, Patrick and Squidina,

388
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,230
are up to?

389
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,233
- [laughs] Golly gee, where, oh,

390
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,735
where can Patrick be hiding?

391
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:36,802
- [giggles]

392
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:37,836
- Hmm.

393
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,771
[thunder booming]

394
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:39,839
- [giggles]

395
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,074
- Maybe...

396
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,176
[thunder booming]

397
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,243
Maybe...

398
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,647
[thunder booming]

399
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,481
Hmm.

400
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,383
- [giggles]

401
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,851
- Found you!

402
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:52,819
- What?

403
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,154
How?

404
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,488
Oh, you're good.

405
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,190
[thunder booming]

406
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,727
Ooh, ooh,
now it's my turn to hide!

407
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,561
- Hey!

408
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,396
You're the seeker!

409
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,366
You count while I hide.

410
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,135
- Oh.

411
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,603
I get it now.

412
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:16,109
1, 2, C, uh, banana.

413
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,378
- 1, 2, 3...

414
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,646
- Hey!

415
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,482
You guys are messing up
my counting.

416
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,051
- Hey, you.

417
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,053
- [whimpers]

418
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,720
- You skipped a number.

419
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,056
- We'll help you count.

420
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,691
We're real good at counting.

421
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,793
- OK.

422
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,930
- One platinum watch,
two silver cufflinks,

423
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,167
three gold teeth...

424
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:45,705
- Hmm, that yoga class has got
to be around here somewhere.

425
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,141
Aha!

426
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,442
Here I go.

427
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,244
Ugh!
[birds cawing]

428
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,312
Hi!

429
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,646
Sorry I'm late.

430
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,216
I had a doozy of a time
finding you guys.

431
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,586
[gasps]
Such perfect form.

432
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,255
Why, it's like
you're made of stone.

433
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,058
[laughs]

434
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,693
Oh, how embarrassing.

435
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,130
I didn't realize
you're doing silent yoga.

436
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,464
Oh.

437
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,601
[whispers] I mean,
you're doing silent yoga.

438
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:19,672
Well, uh,
I'll just follow your lead.

439
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,509
[grunts]

440
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,312
[spooky music]

441
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,879
- Ahh!

442
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,315
- Uh-oh.

443
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,984
I better check on my saggy,
baggy, corpse-y customer.

444
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,921
- [gulping]

445
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,956
Blah!

446
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:43,130
Wow, that energy drink
made me feel 75 again.

447
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,198
I'm so full, I'm stiff.

448
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:49,569
Even my varicose veins
look plump and youthful.

449
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,172
I feel like a new star.

450
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,840
Whoa!

451
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,043
- I hate it when the dead
can't sit still.

452
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,446
Let's get you into
your burial suit.

453
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,014
- A new suit for the new me.

454
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,285
I love this place.

455
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,787
- [sobbing]

456
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,690
- I can't believe this park
doesn't have

457
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,459
a playground for the children.

458
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,894
- Excuse me, Dad.
I need to hide.

459
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,864
- [laughs]
Build it and they will come.

460
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,233
- Whoa!

461
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,668
Whoa!

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,339
Ugh! Ugh!

[giggles]

465
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,143
Patrick will never find me here.

466
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,845
- We are gathered
here to celebrate...

467
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,914
- Me!

468
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,150
Finding Squidina!

469
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,951
[laughter]

470
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,018
[all gasp]

471
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,052
- Tag, you're it!

472
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,522
Tag, you're it!

473
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,823
- Hold it!

474
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,426
You two shouldn't be fighting

475
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:50,163
without wearing these cool
mallet mittens I made you.

476
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,898
- Oh, boy!

477
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,799
[groaning]

478
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,001
- Tag, you're it, son.

479
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,470
[laughter]

480
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,472
- I can't look.

481
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,442
- Ah, I can't stop looking.

482
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,911
All: Ahh!
It's a zombie!

483
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,314

[statues rumbling]

487
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,986
- Ooh.

488
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,924
I don't think I know that pose.

489
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,460
- [screams]

490
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:24,697

- [chomping]

495
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,741
- Can you keep it down?

496
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,278
I was promised eternal slumber.

497
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,114
- Oh, I'm gonna give
them a piece of my mind.

498
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,850
[all grumbling]

499

- [growling]

504
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,632
- You wouldn't believe
the time I had.

505
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,002
And I learned
a great new yoga pose.

506

- [groans]

507
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,473

511
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,082
- Wait a minute.

512
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,717
This isn't a park.

513
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,820
It's a cemetery full of zombies!

514
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,390
[all screaming]

515
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,358

Zombie!

517
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,528

- [growling]

520
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,867
- Lloyd, my old driver.

521
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,970
How about once around the
park for old times' sake?

522
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:42,409
- Nobody told me we were
playing hide and hide again!

Look at you.

535
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,706
You're all just skin and bones.

536
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,742
Soup's on at our place.
