That's perfect!

388
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,033
I can write Leilani a message
so she knows I'm OK.

389
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,703
I just need something
to write with.

- Huh?
That's weird.

454
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,440
Where'd this come from?

455
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,742
- Hmm.
[gasps]

456
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,212
There's a message

Go to him.

566
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,521
- Speak to me!

567
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,257
Oh, Skip, why would you
leave me like that?

568
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:35,962
- Well, I wanted
to get you these!

569
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,431
- Oh, they're lovely.

570
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,932
It's beautiful.

571
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,201
- I hope you can still love me,

572
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,371
even though I'm only
half the man I used to be.

573
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:47,373
- [giggles]
I think we can remedy that.

574
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:50,377
- Hot dogs, snacks, tattoos.

575
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,380
- Well, I think that
worked out, wouldn't you say?

576
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,982
- And how.

577
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,150
[giggles]

578
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:02,021
- From now on, just call me
Skip the Scooter.

579
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,856
[engine rumbling]

580
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,392
[laughs]
