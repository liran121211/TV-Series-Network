He rides the subway to work and feels like he's a sardine in a tin can. Similarly with the elevators in the office tower where he works. A fellow employee gives him a book that suggests you can accomplish anything through concentration. He decides to make people go away simply by willing that they vanish. He gets rid of his landlady who is knocking at the door asking for the rent and has a lovely ride to work in an empty subway car. He's soon lonely and bored though he won't admit it. His solution to the problem doesn't quite work out as he had hoped.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0734662", "rating": 6.4, "votes": 2571, "number_of_episodes": 156}
