Confused, they try to theorize why everyone is motionless until a resident springs to life and explains.", "In a far corner of the universe, a spaceship with three astronauts lands on a planet with gravity and air conditions virtually identical to that on Earth. Their surroundings appear as Earth did 200 years ago, but the planet has two suns, so they're fairly certain they didn't somehow end up back home. The people there, however, seem to be frozen in time. They eventually stumble upon Jeremy Wickwire, who is the caretaker for the locale. His explanation of what he is and where they are defies belief, but in the end, he does grant them their wish.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0734565", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 3993, "number_of_episodes": 156}
