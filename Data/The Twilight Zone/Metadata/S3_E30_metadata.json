As he tells it, he holds doctoral degrees from several universities and his advice to Henry Ford helped create the American auto industry. His friends always have a good laugh, but two visiting strangers take a keen interest in Somerset upon hearing some of his more outrageous claims. The visitors are aliens who are convinced they've found a remarkable human specimen to take back to their home planet. Somerset wants nothing to do with this plan and, to his surprise, finds the instrument he needs to make good his escape in his pocket. This experience with visitors from outer space gives rise to yet another tall tale with which to entertain his pals at the store.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0734573", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2592, "number_of_episodes": 156}
