He's gone out and hired an agent, Gerald Hugo, but there's just one problem - he just can't write worth a damn. He's continually pitching hackneyed ideas but when he learns that Hugo is working on a show about black magic he goes off to a bookstore intent on learning more about the subject. The book he finds - actually it sort of finds him - is a book of spells and to his delight, he conjures up none other than William Shakespeare. He soon has Will, as he calls him, writing his scripts and they're a big hit. They're not much of a hit with Shakespeare however when he visits the set and sees just what they have done to his work.\u2014garykmcd", "The former bus driver Julius Moomer is an aspirant television writer without any talent.
