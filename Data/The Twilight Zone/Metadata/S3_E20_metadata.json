He is, to say the least, difficult to deal with. He is frequently late on the set, arrives unprepared and often requests script changes just as they are about to shoot a scene. To top it off, he's quite inept at handling his gun which he inadvertently tosses into the saloon mirror on more than one occasion. He's given a dose of reality however when he inexplicably finds himself back in time, coming face to face with the real Jesse James.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0734619", "rating": 6.3, "votes": 2385, "number_of_episodes": 156}
