Ground control loses all contact with him and although he returns safely, he apparently blacked out and has no recollection of what may have happened. Nor can he explain how the craft landed on land - completely undamaged - when it was meant to splash down in the ocean. When Gaines returns home he finds that little things are different: he's now a full colonel and has been for some time; his house now has a picket fence; he no longer seems to take sugar in his coffee; and even his wife senses he is different after she kisses him. It is soon apparent that Gaines has returned to an Earth in an alternate universe.\u2014garykmcd", "Major Robert \"Bob\" Gaines is an astronaut that orbits the Earth; out of the blue, he loses contact to the ground control for a few minutes. When he returns to Earth, he has no recollections of what has happened to him.

Then he researches an encyclopedia and learns a different history, and President Kennedy has never been the president of the US.
