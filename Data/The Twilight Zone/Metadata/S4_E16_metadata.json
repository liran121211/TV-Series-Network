Their leader William Benteen has trouble accepting that big changes are coming in their lives.", "The colonists of Pilgrim I, Earth's first space colony, have spent 30 years on their new home. It's a lonely, barren place more akin to hell then Eden. Now, they're awaiting the arrival of a ship to take them to Earth. Some colonists are at their wits' end; another - the 9th in 6 months - commits suicide. Their leader, William Benteen, a tough drill sergeant-type, who they call Captain, does his best to keep them together. When the ship arrives, they're given 3 days to prepare to leave. As the day of departure approaches, Benteen's assumption that the community will stay together on Earth, is wrong; most will go their own way once on earth. Hearing this, Benteen decides they should stay. When the group decides otherwise, Benteen's left with only one option.\u2014garykmcd", "A party of colonists has been stranded on a far-flung, inhospitable planet for 30 years.

They've managed this under the tough control of William Benteen, who's lead them like a cult leader would; total control. When a ship arrives and offers them a new life back on Earth, Benteen feels his control will be lost, and urges the colonists to stay.\u2014Charles Dill"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0734606", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 2316, "number_of_episodes": 156}
