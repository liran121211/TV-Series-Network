All three have had a major influence on his life, though not the kind that made him a success. His former military commander had him court-martialed; his former teacher ridiculed and humiliated him in class after she caught him cheating; his church minister ruined his reputation after he drove a girl to suicide. All he requires of them is one thing: a brief apology. The impact of what they've done to him is far greater than it appears.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0734608", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 2576, "number_of_episodes": 156}
