00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,420
[eerie music]

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,216
(male presenter, off)
There is a fifth dimension

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,510
beyond that
which is known to man.

4
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:14,839
It is a dimension
As vast as space

5
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,725
And as timeless as infinity.

6
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,993
It is the middle ground
between light and shadow

7
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,256
between science
and superstition

8
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:27,313
and it lies between
the pit of man's fears

9
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,090
And the summit
Of his knowledge.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,663
This is the dimension
of imagination

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,988
It is an area which we
call The twilight zone.

12
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:41,917
[music intensifies
Dramatically]

13
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:49,076
[cheerful music]

14
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:58,689
Right here,
Ladi es and gentlemen,

15
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:01,569
Special july clean up sale!

16
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,049
Lovely things,
Calamine lotion,

17
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:06,500
Good for sun-burns!

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,861
How about binoculars?

00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:12,771
(male presenter, off)
Street scene

20
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,645
Summer, the present.

21
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,156
Man on the sidewalk
Named Lou Bookman.

22
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,258
Age, sixtyish.
Occupation, pitchman.

23
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:25,052
Lou bookman,
A fixture of the summer.

24
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:28,044
A rather minor component
To a hot july.

25
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,339
A nondescript
Commonplace little man,

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,646
Whose life is a treadmill

27
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:34,616
Built out of sidewalks.

28
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:36,797
In just a moment,
Lou bookman

29
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,095
Will have to concern
himself with survival.

30
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:43,053
Because as of 3 o'clock
This hot july afternoon

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,435
He'll be stalked
by mr. Death.

32
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:50,625
[ominous music]

33
00:01:54,704 --> 00:02:00,899
[cheerful music]

34
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:07,781
[lou iaughs]
(chiidren) Hi, Lou!

35
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:10,131
(lou) Hello, darling!
Oh, here, here.

36
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,742
Oh, my goodness,
It is hot today!

37
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,752
Yeah.

38
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,952
Let's sit down.

39
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:21,036
What are you
selling today, lou?

40
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,910
Toys, lou?
Are you selling toys?

41
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:26,895
I'll show you What I
was selling. [chuckies]

42
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,200
There's one for you.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,130
Thanks, lou!

44
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,331
That's alright, maggie.
Here, ricky.

45
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,438
Thanks, lou!

46
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,514
Now the lou bookman
Social and ice cream hour

47
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,995
Takes place
Right after supper.

48
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,505
The regular
Turn now!

49
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,524
Don't forget!

50
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:43,938
Good bye.

51
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,325
(chiidren)
Bye, lou.

52
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,919
(lou) Don't forget
The ice cream, huh?

53
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,114
[humming]

54
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,965
[intense ominous music]

55
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,756
You're, you're the man I saw
on the sidewalk today.

56
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:22,646
You were writing
In a book.

57
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:24,607
You are lou bookman,
aren't you?

58
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,296
That's right.
Louis J. Bookman,

59
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,186
Is there something
I can show you?

60
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,459
Maybe something In collar
stays? I'll get that.

61
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,815
No, mr. Bookman.
I'm not here to buy anything.

62
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,951
Now let's get
To business, shall we?

63
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:39,232
Louis J. Bookman,
Aged 69, right?

64
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,397
I'll be 70
In september.

65
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:45,047
Hm. Occupation,
Pitch man, right?

66
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:46,823
Yeah, that's right.
[chuckies]

67
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,709
Are you
A census taker?

68
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,955
Born in new york
City in 1890.

69
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,766
That's right, 1890.

70
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:57,491
Father jacob bookman,
Mother flora bookman.

71
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:00,754
Father's place of birth,
Detroit, michigan,

72
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,859
Mother's place of birth
Syracuse, new york, right?

73
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:05,800
That's right. My
goodness, [chuckies]

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,681
You got it all down
In that book there.

75
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:10,068
Yes, we have to keep
these things efficient.

76
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:13,326
Now today
Is the 19th of july.

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,792
And your departure's
At midnight tonight.

78
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,429
My departure?

79
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:20,276
[knocking at door]

80
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,530
Oh, excuse me.

81
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:26,589
Hi, maggie!

82
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:28,895
The key's bad, lou.
Can you fix it?

83
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:31,234
Oh, sure,
Come on right in!

84
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,737
Come on in.
(chuckies)

85
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,435
Let me see it.

86
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,276
Well, there's your
trouble right there.

87
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:40,022
See that little cogwheel?

88
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:44,621
Well, you've been pushing in that key
when you were winding it. You see?

89
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:46,959
See? Now
It's all right.

90
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,631
See?

91
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,990
I'd introduce you two, only I
don't know your name.

92
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,545
No need.

93
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,083
I think I got it
Now, lou.

94
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,006
This gentleman came here to
ask me a lot of qu estions.

95
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:58,352
What gentleman?

96
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,694
[ominous music]

97
00:05:00,694 --> 00:05:01,905
That gentleman!

98
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:05,841
What gentleman?

99
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,651
(mr. Death) Mr. Bookman,
she can't See me or hear me.

100
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:11,202
Why not?

101
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,528
Why not what, lou?

102
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,513
Why can't you
see him or hear him?

103
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,303
See who, lou?

104
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,679
It works great now, lou.

105
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:22,403
Thanks an awful lot.
See you after supper, huh?

106
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,088
Now wait a minute. You
haven't forgot your manners.

107
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,927
Aren't you gon na
Say goodbye?

108
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,192
Oh, yeah. Good bye,
lou. Thanks a lot!

109
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:31,117
No, no, I mean
To the gentleman there.

110
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,266
Oh, it's a gam e.

111
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,369
The invisible man.
Goodbye, invisible man.

112
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,616
See you
After supper, lou.

113
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:47,396
[suspense music]

114
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:50,361
I can see you,
yet she can't.

115
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,823
(mr. Death) Only those who are
To accompany me can see me.

116
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:55,603
Understand, Mr. Bookman?

117
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:58,831
Uh, mr. Bookman,

118
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,984
Only those who are
To accompany me can see me.

119
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,835
Now don't you think you ought to
start making your arrangements?

120
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,999
Arrangements?
For what?

121
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:11,655
For your departure.

122
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:13,948
My departure where?

123
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:17,087
[sighs]
You just don't get it.

124
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,728
I just will never
understand you people.

125
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,330
You get the idiotic notion
That life goes on forever.

126
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,935
Of course, it doesn't.

127
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,232
Everyone has
To go sometime.

128
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,291
Go? You mean--

129
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,848
That's right. And what I
further don't understand

130
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,469
How little you appreciate
The nature of your departure.

131
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,836
Think of all the poor souls who
go in violent accidents.

132
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,446
The non precognition victims.

133
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,282
We're not permitted
To forewarn them.

134
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,856
You, mr. Bookman,
fall into the category

135
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:42,982
Of "natural causes."

136
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,990
"natural causes?"

137
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:48,754
Number one, I find you
A very devious sort,

138
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,781
Number two,

139
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,058
I think that
you're dishonest.

140
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,541
Number three, Why don't
you say what you mean!

141
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:58,687
Mr. Bookman, I've done everything
but phone your own undertaker.

142
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,502
How much clearer
Do you want it?

143
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,405
If you still
don't know who I am

144
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,539
Then you're the dumbest
man I've come up against.

145
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:13,009
[intense ominous music]

146
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,762
You are--
You're death?

147
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,726
Exactly, mr. Bookman.

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,815
Now, shall we get
down to business?

149
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:29,952
Time of departure
Is midnight tonight.

150
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:31,794
I trust that
will suit you.

151
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:35,041
Preordination is
for death during sleep.

152
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,001
I assume this too will
meet with your approval.

153
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,265
You'll find this a relatively
Simple and painless--

154
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:43,069
No, just a minute.
I don't wanna go!

155
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,945
No, they never do.

156
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:47,925
But there's no reason to go.
I'm a very healthy man!

157
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:51,405
Outside of a slight cold
I had last winter,

158
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,646
And a sliver that festered
In that finger there,

159
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:57,374
I don't think i've had
A sick day in 20 years!

160
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,106
That may be,

161
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,994
But departure time
Is set for midnight.

162
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,135
And departure
Will be midnight.

163
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:05,384
Don't I have anything
To say about that?

164
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,001
We do listen to appeals

165
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:10,870
But frankly, mr. Bookman,
There's very little here

166
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,383
In the way of an
Extenuating circumstance.

167
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,120
There are three major
Categories of appeals.

168
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:16,898
One, is hardship cases.

169
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:18,522
Now do you
Have a wife or family

170
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:21,751
Who might su ffer beyond a
reasonable point Your dem ise?

171
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,814
[softiy]
No, no family. No.

172
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:29,224
The second category
Is priority cases

173
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:32,081
Statesmen, scientists, Men
on the verge Of discoveri es.

174
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:38,599
I take it you're not working On any major
scientif ic Pursuit at the moment.

175
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:40,835
[softiy]
No [chuckies] no.

176
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,777
[firmiy]
What's the third category?

177
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:47,091
I don't think you're
Qualified here either.

178
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:50,112
Unfinish ed business
Of a major nature.

179
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,937
You don't have Any unfinished 
Business, do you?

180
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,604
Ah, but i do!

181
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,201
Indeed i do!

182
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:58,773
That's it,
You see. I-- yeah.

183
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:01,922
I have some
Unfinished business.

184
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,870
Unfinished business, yes.

185
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,783
I've never flown
In a helicopter. That's it.

186
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,919
I've never flown--

187
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,495
(death)
Insufficient, mr. Bookman.

188
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:19,258
Anything else?

189
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,136
Now you look here. I've lived
in this Room for 2 1 years.

190
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:26,949
And you keep popping up in corners of
the room I've never even seen before.

191
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,958
Will you please
Stay in one place?

192
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,878
Is there anything
Else, mr. Bookman?

193
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:33,465
Yes, yes.

194
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:36,381
I have never seen
A zulu war dance.

195
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:38,226
Now that's
The answer right there.

196
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,686
So you'll have to give Me a couple of
months to go Over to that zulu cou ntry

197
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:44,384
No?

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,754
No. Unfinished business
Of a major nature

199
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,472
Is something a man
Had yearned for

200
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,731
And something He m ight
accomplish Given an extension.

201
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,981
Well, there is one thing.

202
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:56,867
What is it, mr. Bookman?

203
00:09:57,085 --> 00:10:00,080
Well, between you and me,

204
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,981
I never made
A truly big pitch.

205
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,726
I mean, i mean
A big pitch.

206
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:10,014
A pitch big enough
For the skies to open up.

207
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:13,578
You know,
A pitch for the angels.

208
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,119
Of course, It wouldn't
mean Very much to you,

209
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,657
But it would mean
A great deal to me.

210
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,580
It would mean
That for one moment

211
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:24,616
In my whole life I would have
done Something successful.

212
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:29,734
It would mean That maybe the children 
Would be very proud of me.

213
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:31,468
The children?

214
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:35,740
Yes, yes, i've always Had quite a
fondness For children, you know.

215
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,767
Yes, that's all
Here in the record.

216
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:42,389
The problem here, Mr. Bookman, is
that You'd require delay until--

217
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,575
Until I make a pitch!

218
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,033
The kind of pitch
I was talking to you about.

219
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,413
The one for the angels?

220
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,912
That's right.
One for the angels.

221
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:55,432
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Bookman,

222
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:56,955
But, no.

223
00:10:57,705 --> 00:11:02,090
You see, these categories
Are very specific

224
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:05,631
And when reference is made to unfinished 
business Of a major nature,

225
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,220
The only interpretation
To be made here

226
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:09,172
Is simply that--

227
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,072
What-- what i mean
Is that, uh,

228
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,644
Unfortunately, mr. Bookman,

229
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:18,644
An ability to, to succeed

230
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,442
In a given
Profess ional venture

231
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:23,278
Is really hardly
Of a major--

232
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,668
Mean a great
Deal to you, does it?

233
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:31,955
A great deal.

234
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:42,995
All right,
Mr. Bookman.

235
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,816
Under the circumstances I
believe i can grant You a delay.

236
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:47,125
Unti l--

237
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,702
What do you mean 'until?'
Until you've made this pitch.

238
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,933
I can live til then?

239
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:53,693
That's the agreement.

240
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,577
Oh, well i think
That's a f in e bargain.

241
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:59,824
I didn't get your name.

242
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,310
Now, about
This pitch, mr. Bookman,

243
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,477
When might
We expect it?

244
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:06,361
When?

245
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,110
Oh, soon.
You know.

246
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:13,146
Maybe not this year, maybe Not for a
couple of years, [chuckies] but soon.

247
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:16,911
I have the very odd feeling That
you're taking advantage of me.

248
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:19,347
Oh, you have?
Well, that's a pity,

249
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,845
Because I am!

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,492
You'll never catch me
Making a pitch anymore.

251
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:28,484
You think you can
Fool me, eh? [chuckies]

252
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,352
I'll hardly open
My mouth from now on.

253
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,009
[mischievous music]

254
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,644
Really, mr. Bookman?

255
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:37,033
This is much more
Serious than you imagin e.

256
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,979
It's much more complex Than
yourealize, what you've just done.

257
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,507
Here I've gon e
Out of my way to help you

258
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,516
And this is the way
Yourepay me?

259
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,730
Mr. Bookman.

260
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,302
It won't just end here,
You understand?

261
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,498
There will be
Consequences, you see?

262
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:31,929
FYI, that means
For your information

263
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,895
You made your bed And you
shall have to sleep in it.

264
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:38,313
We made a bargain that I don't
have to go until I make a pitch.

265
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,950
And you'll have to wait
unti l i make that p itch.

266
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:44,798
I can say this without the
least Fear of contradiction.

267
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,027
Have you got A long
wait! [chuckies]

268
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,641
That may well be,
Mr. Bookman,

269
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:51,848
But since you won't
Come with me,

270
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,346
I've been forced
To select an alternative.

271
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,074
[brakes screeching
And woman yelling]

272
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,896
[people shouting]

273
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,295
Maggie!

274
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:11,834
I swear
I didn't see her.

275
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:15,545
She jumped right Off the
curb and I had no chance to stop.

276
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:18,914
I swear to you I never had
no Chance to stop at all.

277
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:20,601
Well, then someone
Send for a doctor!

278
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,056
Get an ambulance.

279
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:23,894
I'll call one.

280
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,620
(lou) You're gonna
be all right, darling.

281
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,417
You're gonna
Be just fin e.

282
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:40,943
Hi, lou.

283
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,395
Hello, sweetheart.

284
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,417
[intense ominous music]

285
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,248
Lou?

286
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:49,061
Yes?

287
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,629
Who's that man?

288
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,454
[ominous music]

289
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,540
Do you see him?

290
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,058
Yes, lou.

291
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,771
Hey, wait a minute.

292
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:11,269
You can't take her.

293
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,049
No, siree,
You can't take her.

294
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:16,044
Now listen, I'll go.
Never mind the pitch.

295
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:19,074
I don't even want to wait,
I'll go right now.

296
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:20,256
You can't take her.

297
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,910
I'll go with you, i'll--

298
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:29,804
[ominous music]

299
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:50,853
(man)
How's maggie, doctor?

300
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:52,516
(doctor) I can't
tell. I can't tell.

301
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,024
Doctor?

302
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:01,086
It's hard to tell. She's
a very sick Little girl,

303
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,045
But we'll know Soon, she should 
have a crisis by midnight.

304
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,279
By midnight?

305
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,656
I think by then.

306
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,372
He won't come here.
I won't let him come here.

307
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:30,178
[suspense music]

308
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:43,251
[intense ominous music]

309
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,669
Good evening,
Mr. Bookman.

310
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:48,645
You've got
Business in there?

311
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,616
I most certainly do.

312
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,251
It's quarter to 1 2 :00.
In 15 minutes, midnight.

313
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,544
That's my appointment.

314
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,660
Mr. Death, that little
Girl's only 8 years old.

315
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm ready now.

316
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,303
I'm sorry, mr. Bookman, But i
had to make Other arrang em ents.

317
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,193
It's impossible
To change them now.

318
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,635
She's to come
With me at midnight,

319
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,228
So I must be
In there at midnight.

320
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:18,660
And if you're
Not in there?

321
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,688
It would be pretty
much unheard of.

322
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:24,465
You see, If i didn't get in
there at precisely midnight,

323
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,521
Then the whole Timetable
would Be upset.

324
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,689
It's unheard of.

325
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,765
It's unheard of?

326
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,318
What are you
Doing, mr. Bookman?

327
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,592
I'm just setting up
A pitch, that's all.

328
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:41,732
At this time
Of night?

329
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:45,632
Oh, I very often Have a
late sale. Very often!

330
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,422
Not many customers.

331
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:49,987
Oh, they'll be here.

332
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,479
They'll come round--
You're here, anyway.

333
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,397
Oh, yes, i'm here.

334
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:57,586
But i'm afraid
I'm not much of a custom er.

335
00:17:57,586 --> 00:18:00,031
How do you know?
Have you seen my stock?

336
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:03,264
Take this lovely tie
Here, for instance.

337
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,004
Oh, oh, excuse me.

338
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:12,564
What does that
Look like to you?

339
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:13,932
It looks like a tie.

340
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,559
Feel it.

341
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,441
So--

342
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,527
Ladi es and gentlemen,

343
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:24,529
If you wi ll
Feast your eyes

344
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,485
On probably the most
Exciting invention

345
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,408
Since atomic energy.

346
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,387
A s imulated silk
So fabulously conceived

347
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:37,954
As to mystify even the ancient
Chinese silk manufacturers.
