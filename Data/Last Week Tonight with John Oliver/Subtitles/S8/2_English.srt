WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,866
STILL TAKING PLACE

8
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,100
IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,066
I'VE NICKNAMED IT

00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,266
"PRINCE PHILLIP'S COFFIN"

LAST SUNDAY, I CAN SAFELY SAY:

17
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:43,833
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A FUCKING

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,600
NIGHTMARE.

19
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,200
FROM THE NEWS HE WAS PULLED OVER

20
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,400
FOR MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS,

21
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,466
INCLUDING HAVING AN

LINE FLAG AFTER THE SHOOTING.

30
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,266
WHICH IS JUST CORN-FED,

31
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,466
DEEP FRIED BULLSHIT.

32
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,000
THE WEEK SANK INTO A

33
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,266
DEPRESSINGLY FAMILIAR CYCLE,

34
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,933
WITH THE PRESIDENT INSISTING ON

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,400
"PEACEFUL PROTEST" -- WHICH IS

36
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:10,833
SO OFTEN JUST ANOTHER WAY TO

37
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,766
PRIORITIZE COMPLIANCE OVER

38
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,166
RIGHTEOUS DISSENT,

39
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,566

00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:15,466
HUMAN LIVES.

41
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,633
AND THOSE KIND OF CALLS WERE

42
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,766
ESPECIALLY GALLING, GIVEN

43
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,466
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,400

RUBBER BULLETS, AND FLASH BANG

47
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,566
GRENADES AT PROTESTORS,

48
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:25,533
CREATING MORE TENSION AND

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,933

EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTED CITY.

51
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:31,166
AND LOOK, WE COULD KEEP UP OUR

00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:33,166
PART IN THAT CYCLE.

53
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:34,933
RIGHT NOW, I COULD CITE

54
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
STATISTICS ABOUT POLICE USING

55
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,866
EXCESSIVE FORCE.

56
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:39,933
I COULD DUNK ON ALL THE

APPALLING RESPONSES FROM

58
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,600
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA FIGURES.

59
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,566
I COULD REITERATE, YET AGAIN,

60
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:44,633
THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS COMPLETELY

61
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,000
WRONG, BUT THE FACT IS,

62
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,200
WE COULDN'T EVEN FINISH WRITING

63
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,400

64
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:49,500

CHILD, ADAM TOLEDO -- FOOTAGE

69
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,966
WHICH CLEARLY CONTRADICTED

70
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,366
THE PICTURE OF AN

71
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,166

72
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,866
THE POLICE AND THE MAYOR,

73
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:07,133
AS WELL AS A PROSECUTOR WHO'D

74
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,533
SAID TOLEDO HAD A GUN IN HIS

75
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,233
HAND WHEN HE WAS SHOT.

76
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,633
WHICH HE DID NOT.

77
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,233
AND THAT REVELATION BEGAN

78
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,366
THE CYCLE OF PROTESTS,

79
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,133
CALLS FOR PEACE, AND POLICE

80
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,466
OVERREACTION ALL OVER AGAIN.

81
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,366
AND HERE IS THE THING.

82
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,233
THIS SHOW HAS BEEN ON THE AIR

83
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700
FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW.

84
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,100
WHICH, I KNOW, SOME MIGHT ARGUE

85
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,533
IS EIGHT YEARS TOO MANY.

86
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,833
AND IN THAT TIME, WE HAVE

87
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,033
REPEATEDLY COVERED

88
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,633
THE MULTIPLE WAYS POLICE

89
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
TERRORIZE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

90
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,333
IN THIS COUNTRY.

91
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,700
WE'VE DONE STORIES ON POLICE

92
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,400
MILITARIZATION, ON THEIR OVERUSE

93
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,733
OF MUNICIPAL VIOLATIONS

94
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,500
AND RAIDS, ON THEIR LACK OF

95
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,000
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND ON HOW

96
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,800
THE HISTORY OF POLICING IN

97
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,766
AMERICA IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED

98
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,133
WITH WHITE SUPREMACY.

99
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,100
AND I COULD MAKE THE SAME

100
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,233
ARGUMENTS TO YOU AGAIN NOW.

101
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,200
I COULD DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM TO

102
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,366
YOU, BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT

103
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,233
-- AND WHO -- IT IS.

104
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,733
I CAN OFFER SOLUTIONS, BUT I

105
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,466
THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

106
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,400
I CAN OFFER ANGER, BUT IF YOU'RE

107
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,000
A SENTIENT HUMAN BEING ALIVE

108
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,533
RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE NOT ALREADY

109
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
FULL OF THAT, I HONESTLY DON'T

110
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,233
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

111
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,800
BECAUSE THE FACT IS,

112
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,200
BLACK PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE

113
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:01,233
MOWED DOWN BY THE POLICE THAT

114
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,000
THEY PAY FOR.

115
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,100
AND IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE NEWS

116
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,500
AT ALL THIS WEEK, YOU'RE

117
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,533
PROBABLY EXHAUSTED.

118
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,066
BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA

119
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,366
DEFINITELY ARE.

120
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,066
NOT JUST FROM THIS WEEK,

121
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,000
BUT ALSO FROM THE, Y'KNOW,

122
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,666
EVERYTHING.

123
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,600
THE BLACK WRITERS ON THIS STAFF

124
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,400
SET UP AN OUT OF OFFICE REPLY

125
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:21,266
THAT JUST SAYS, "NAH."

126
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,466
AND HONESTLY, I KIND OF GET IT.

127
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,766
SO GIVEN ALL THAT, WE THOUGHT

128
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,200
TONIGHT WE'D TRY AND BREAK OUR

129
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,500
PART IN THIS CYCLE AND INSTEAD

130
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,266
ATTEMPT TO DO SOMETHING

131
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,466
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

132
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:30,100
BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED TO GIVE

133
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:30,733
ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT A CHANCE TO

134
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,066
REGROUP.

135
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,733
AND THE NEXT SEVEN MINUTES ARE

136
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
FOR ANYONE WHO'S FELT CRUSHED

137
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:36,700
BY THIS WEEK.

138
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:37,700
IF YOU CAN'T WATCH THOSE CLIPS

139
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:38,533
AGAIN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW

140
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,733
THEM TO YOU.

141
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
INSTEAD, WE'RE GOING TO

142
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,233
HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME TINY

PIECES OF STUPID, SILLY JOY

144
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:44,966
BEFORE WE ALL PLUNGE BACK INTO

145
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,033
THE FIGHT.

146
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,833
AND SO THAT IS WHY OUR FIRST

147
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,733
STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS A GIANT

148
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,966

190
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
FROM HAPPIER TIMES.

191
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,400
>> HE'S NOW BRINGING OUT

192
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,566
CHILDREN'S BOOKS, HE'S DOING

193
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,266
A CALENDAR, HE'S DOING

194
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,333
A WORLD TOUR.

195
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,766
THERE'S NO STOPPING DARIUS!

196
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,933
>> John: WELL, IT TURNS OUT

197
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,100
THERE WAS ONE WAY TO STOP

198
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:06,333
DARIUS!

199
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,100
AND THAT'S STRAIGHT SNATCHING UP

200
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,633
ALL 51 EXTREMELY WEIRD INCHES OF

201
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,433
HIM.

202
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,033
I GUESS PRIDE GOETH BEFORE

203
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
THE FALL, AND AGGRESSIVE

204
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:13,466
COMMODIFICATION GOETH BEFORE

205
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,433
THE JUMBO JACKRABBIT JACKING.

206
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,400
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS

207
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,766
ABSOLUTE MONSTROSITY WAS NOT

208
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,133
THE ONLY BLISSFULLY STUPID STORY

209
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,866
THIS WEEK.

210
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,066
FOR A FEW DAYS, THE INTERNET

211
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,266
LIT UP WITH THE CLAIM THAT

212
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,300
USHER TIPPED VEGAS STRIPPERS

213
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,700
IN USHER BUCKS WITH HIS FACE

214
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:27,633
ON THEM.

215
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,266
WHICH, ON THE ONE HAND, IS

216
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,533
ICONIC, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND,

217
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
IS FUCKING ICONIC.

218
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,366
AND I WOULDN'T BLAME THE DANCERS

219
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,766
FOR BEING MAD ABOUT ENDING

220
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,700
THEIR NIGHT WITH A THONG FULL OF

221
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,266
USHER SELFIES.

222
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,500
ALTHOUGH, I DO HAVE TO TELL YOU,

223
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,966
THE STRIP CLUB INSISTS USHER

224
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,000
DIDN'T USE FAKE MONEY TO TIP

225
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,100
THE DANCERS, ADDING,

226
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,666
"HE CONVERTED THOUSANDS OF

227
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,066
REAL DOLLARS TO TIP THEM" AND

228
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,566
"USHER WAS A TRUE GENTLEMAN."

229
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,333
BUT TO ME, THAT ACTUALLY MAKES

230
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,600
THIS STORY EVEN BETTER, BECAUSE

231
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,000
"USHER WAS A TRUE GENTLEMAN" IS

232
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:52,866
NOW MY FAVORITE THING I'VE EVER

233
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:53,766
BEEN LEGALLY REQUIRED TO

234
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,566
CLARIFY.

235
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:56,933
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

236
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,366
>> WE'RE GETTING A LOOK AT WHAT

237
00:05:59,433 --> 00:05:59,900
SOME ATHLETES WILL WEAR AT

238
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:01,700
THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN TOKYO.

239
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,133
RALPH LAUREN UNVEILED THESE

240
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,033
UNIFORMS FOR TEAM USA.

241
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,066
THIS ENSEMBLE WILL BE WORN

242
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,666
DURING THE CLOSING CEREMONY AND,

243
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,633
>> John: OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO

244
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,766
SAY IT: THAT IS A TERRIBLE

245
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,366
OUTFIT.

246
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,433
THEY LOOK LIKE THE CAST OF

247
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,633
A CBS SCI-FI DRAMA THAT NO ONE'S

248
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,366
EVER HEARD OF DESPITE BEING ON

249
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,566
THE AIR FOR 16 SEASONS.

250
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,100
ALSO, WHY IS THE U.S. OLYMPIC

251
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,600
TEAM ALWAYS OUTFITTED BY

252
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,300
RALPH LAUREN, WHICH HAS BEEN

253
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,300
HANDLING IT SINCE 2008, AND HAS

254
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,500
CONSISTENTLY PRODUCED SHIT LIKE

255
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:28,166
THIS, THIS, AND THIS -- AN

256
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,166
OUTFIT THAT DOESN'T SCREAM,

257
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,433
"I'M GOING TO THE OLYMPICS!"

258
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,900
SO MUCH AS IT SCREAMS,

259
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:31,433
"YOU THINK I'M RICH NOW?

260
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,733
WAIT TILL MY DAD DIES!"

261
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,700
I'M JUST SAYING, IT IS A CHOICE

262
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,033
TO TAKE A DIVERSE COUNTRY OF

263
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,166
300-PLUS MILLION PEOPLE AND

264
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:39,733
GO WITH THE AESTHETIC OF

265
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,733
THE BAD GUY IN EVERY '80s

266
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,233
FRAT COMEDY.

267
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,333
ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, OUR OLYMPIC

268
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,766
OUTFITS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES

269
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,133
GRABBING ATTENTION THIS WEEK.

270
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,966
>> HERE'S THE TEAM CANADA

271
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,333
UNIFORM.

272
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,766
>> OKAY.

273
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,400
I LOVE IT.

274
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:54,600
>> YOU LOVE IT?

275
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,300
>> I DO LOVE IT.

276
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,200
>> IT'S BILLED AS A TWIST ON

277
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:00,866
THE ICONIC CANADIAN TUXEDO.

278
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,800
>> John: OKAY, THAT JACKET IS

279
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:04,666
STRAIGHT GARBAGE.

280
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:05,766
IT LOOKS LIKE JAY LENO GOT

281
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,833
TAGGED BY A STREET GANG OF

282
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,100
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

283
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,366
AND THAT JACKET MIGHT LOOK GOOD

284
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:13,800
ON ONE PERSON.

285
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,933
THE PROBLEM IS, ON A GROUP OF

286
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,100
HUNDREDS, THEY'RE ALL GOING TO

287
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:16,633
LOOK LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL

288
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,266
PRODUCTION OF CANADIAN "GREASE."

289
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,933
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

290
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,933
I'VE ALWAYS FELT IT'S WRONG THAT

291
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,166
"CANADIAN TUXEDO" REFERS TO

292
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,666
HEAD-TO-TOE DENIM, AND NOT

293
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,466
FORMALWEAR SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

294
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,866
FOR A FANCY MOOSE.

295
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:27,933
THIS BIG BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP.

296
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,933
BLAST ME, KING.

297
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,233
AND IF THAT WASN'T ALREADY FUN

298
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,066
ENOUGH NEWS FROM CANADA THIS

299
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,700
WEEK, THERE WAS ALSO THIS:

300
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:35,366
>> THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE

301
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,700
CANADIAN PARLIAMENT WHO WAS

302
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,466
CAUGHT NAKED --

303
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,433
[LAUGHS]

304
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,200
NAKED ON A VIRTUAL

305
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,566
HOUSE OF COMMONS MEETING.

306
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:46,733
HE HAS SINCE APOLOGIZED IN AN

307
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
SAYING HE HAD BEEN CHANGING INTO

308
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,566
HIS WORK CLOTHES AFTER GOING FOR

309
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:50,100
A JOG.

310
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,633
QUITE WHY HE DID THAT IN FRONT

311
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,100
OF A CAMERA, I MEAN, WHO KNOWS.

312
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:56,566
[LAUGHS]

313
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,066
>> John: NOW, OBVIOUSLY,

314
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,500
I FEEL TERRIBLE FOR THAT MAN.

315
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:02,466
IT WAS CLEARLY A COMPLETE

316
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:03,233
ACCIDENT.

317
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,100
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, HE'S GOT

318
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,533
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO BE

319
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:06,933
ASHAMED OF THERE.

320
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,500
HE'S KEEPIN' TIGHT AND HE'S

321
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,400
KEEPIN' IT RIGHT.

322
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,366
HE'S MAINTAINING WHILE THE REST

323
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,000
OF US ARE GAINING.

324
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:10,466
A JOG?

325
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,333
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK DAY?

326
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,233
THAT IS HOT MALE BEHAVIOR.

327
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,600
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A JOG

328
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,366
IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORK DAY

329
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:17,166
SINCE SEPTEMBER 11th.

330
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:19,133
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK HE

331
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,933
LOOKS GOOD WITH HIS CLOTHES OFF,

332
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,500
WAIT TIL YOU SEE HIM WITH

333
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,433
CLOTHES ON.

334
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,466
HEY, CANADA!

335
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,700
CHECK YOUR CARBON EMISSIONS,

336
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:25,800
BECAUSE THERE'S A MASSIVE SMOKE

337
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,266
STACK IN YOUR PARLIAMENT.

338
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,033
AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S TRULY

339
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,333
DELIGHTFUL WATCHING A NEWS

340
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,866
PACKAGE THAT'S JUST "TIMID MAN

341
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:35,500
POLITELY GIGGLES OVER PHOTO OF

342
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:36,133
NAKED PALE GUY," OR AS IT'S MORE

343
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,800
COMMONLY KNOWN: "HARD CORE

344
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,466
CANADIAN PORN."

345
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,466
AND AS IF THIS STORY COULDN'T

346
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,433
GET ANY BETTER, JUST WATCH HIS

347
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,666
FELLOW M.P. ADDRESS THE INCIDENT

348
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,500
IN THE MOST EXCEEDINGLY TACTFUL

349
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,433
WAY.

350
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,566
>> WE'VE SEEN A MEMBER DURING

351
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:54,033
QUESTION PERIOD IMPROPERLY

352
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,366
DRESSED -- THAT IS, UNCLOTHED.

353
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:59,400
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE MEMBER WAS

354
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:01,333
IN VERY GOOD SHAPE, BUT I THINK

355
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,166
THAT THIS MEMBER SHOULD BE

356
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,366
REMINDED OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE

357
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,333
AND TO CONTROL HIS CAMERA.

358
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
THANK YOU.

359
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:08,666
>> John: THAT IS AN AGGRESSIVELY

360
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,533
CANADIAN RESPONSE.

361
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,833
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT

362
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,366
CANADIANS -- AND THESE OUTFITS

363
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,500
SAY MORE THAN ANYONE EVER COULD

364
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:16,433
-- BUT ONE THING YOU CAN'T

365
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,866
ACCUSE THEM OF IS BEING

366
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,066
IMPOLITE, EVEN IN THE FACE OF

367
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:25,066
UNREQUESTED NUDITY.

368
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,400
AND WHILE I AM REALLY SORRY THAT

369
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,333
HAPPENED TO THIS GUY, WHO SEEMS

370
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,300
TO HAVE WEATHERED THE INCIDENT

371
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,600
WITH GOOD GRACE, I HONESTLY

372
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,433

00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:31,533
BEING CHARACTERIZED AS AN

559
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,033
"EASY OUT," THE WAY IT'S

560
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,066
CURRENTLY SET UP, IT'S SOMETIMES

561
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:35,900
NOT AN "OUT" AT ALL, AS THIS

562
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,633
COUPLE LEARNED.

563
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,333
>> BEFORE YOU'RE DONE AND OVER

564
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,066
WITH, YOU'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING

565
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,100
TO SPEND AT LEAST $1,000 TO

566
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,733
FILE -- TO CLAIM BANKRUPTCY.

567
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,366
WE DON'T HAVE $1,000.

568
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,100
>> ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU CAN'T

569
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,200
AFFORD --

570
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,033
>> WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO

571
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,066
BANKRUPT.

572
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,400
>> WE CAN'T, CORRECT.

573
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:56,000
>> YET, WE'RE $50,000 IN DEBT.

574
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,166
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

575
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,833
>> John: YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE

576
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,066
CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BANKRUPT.

577
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,300
A TRUE SENTENCE THAT

578
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,566
FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T MAKE

579
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,500
SENSE, LIKE "SONIC DRIVE-INS

580
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,266
ADVERTISE IN CITIES WHERE THERE

581
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,600
ARE NO SONIC LOCATIONS" OR

582
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,300
THE SEQUEL TO "NOW YOU SEE ME"

583
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:12,366
WASN'T CALLED "NOW YOU DON'T,"

584
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,333
OR ELON MUSK DOESN'T FUCK HIS

585
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,933
CARS.

586
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,733
I MEAN, COME ON, THAT'S THE

587
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,666
FACE OF A MAN WHO'S AT THE VERY

588
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,500
LEAST MEASURED THE CIRCUMFERENCE

589
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:21,966
OF THE CHARGING POINT.

590
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,000
SO GIVEN ALL THAT, TONIGHT,

591
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:23,833
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT PERSONAL

592
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,433
BANKRUPTCY.

593
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,600
OUR MODERN BANKRUPTCY CODE

594
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,466
WAS ENACTED IN 1978 --

595
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,533
INTERESTINGLY, AROUND THE SAME

596
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,500
TIME THAT THE CREDIT CARD

597
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,733
INDUSTRY BEGAN TO ENJOY A PERIOD

598
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,700
OF STEADY DEREGULATION.

599
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,300
WHICH WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR

600
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,900
THEM, BECAUSE THEY MARKETED

601
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,600
THEMSELVES AGGRESSIVELY, AND

602
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,000
DURING THIS TIME, CONSUMER DEBT

603
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,400
BEGAN TO SHARPLY RISE.

604
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:45,533
AND WHAT THE INDUSTRY CLEARLY

605
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
WANTED WAS PEOPLE STUCK IN A

606
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,433
LUCRATIVE CYCLE OF MINIMUM

607
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,200
PAYMENTS, LATE FEES, AND

608
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,633
INTEREST HIKES.

609
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,100
WHAT THEY DIDN'T WANT SPOILING

610
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:54,666
THAT WAS PEOPLE CUTTING THAT

611
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:55,333
CYCLE SHORT THROUGH BANKRUPTCY.

612
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,500
SO BY THE LATE '90s,

613
00:15:58,566 --> 00:15:59,133
THEY WERE LOBBYING SENATORS LIKE

614
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,933
CHUCK GRASSLEY HARD TO CURB WHAT

615
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,100
THEY FRAMED AS "BANKRUPTCY

616
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,033
ABUSE."

617
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,400
BASICALLY ARGUING THAT PEOPLE

618
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:06,966
WHO CAN "AFFORD" TO PAY WERE

619
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:07,900
USING BANKRUPTCY AS AN EASY WAY

620
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
TO NOT PAY BILLS AND PASS THE

621
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:14,533
COSTS ON TO THE REST OF US.

622
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,466
AND GRASSLEY SEEMED MORE THAN

623
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,100
HAPPY TO REPEAT SOME OF THEIR

624
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:18,466
TALKING POINTS.

625
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,333
>> THERE'S NOT A SINGLE FAMILY

626
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
IN AMERICA -- LOW INCOME OR HIGH

627
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,733
INCOME -- THAT IS NOT PAYING

628
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,100
PART OF THE COST OF BANKRUPTCY.

629
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,266
$40 BILLION COST TO THE ECONOMY

630
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,633
EVERY YEAR.

631
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,233
$400 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR.

632
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,166
>> John: WOW.

633
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,600
THE AVERAGE FAMILY PAYS $400

634
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,800
A YEAR BECAUSE DEADBEATS

635
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,766
ABUSE THE SYSTEM.

636
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,333
GRASSLEY DROPPED THAT SHOCKING

637
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,866
"FACT" WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF

638
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,000
A MAN WHO'D LATER TWEET FROM HIS

639
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,300
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT,

640
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:44,633
"WINDSOR HEIGHTS DAIRY QUEEN IS

641
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,666
GOOD PLACE FOR U KNO WHAT."

642
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,933
THE THING IS, THAT $400 FIGURE

643
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
IS TOTAL NONSENSE.

644
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,033
NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN WHERE

645
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,800
IT CAME FROM, AND DESPITE IT

646
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,366
TURNING OUT TO BE DEMONSTRABLY

647
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,100
FALSE, THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY

648
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,400
PUSHED IT HARD, TO CREATE

649
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,533
A NARRATIVE OF WIDESPREAD

650
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,466
IRRESPONSIBILITY AND ABUSE

651
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,900
AROUND BANKRUPTCY.

652
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:05,000
BUT IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE

653
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,800
MORAL GRANDSTANDING FROM CREDIT

654
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:07,666
CARD COMPANIES, WHO WERE ALL

655
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,666
TOO HAPPY TO HELP PEOPLE GET

656
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,500
INTO SIGNIFICANT DEBT, EVEN IF

657
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:11,766
THEY HAD JUST DECLARED

658
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,133
BANKRUPTCY.

659
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
>> BARELY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

660
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,266
COURT, JOAN BURNETT OPENED HER

661
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,133
MAILBOX AND THERE IT WAS: THE

662
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,233
CHANCE FOR A SHINY NEW CREDIT

663
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,000
CARD, THE FIRST OF MANY.

664
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:27,400
>> IT LOOKED LIKE AN EASY $3,000

665
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:29,000
AND I THINK I HUNG ON TO IT FOR

666
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,100
A DAY, AND THEN I THOUGHT, "OH

667
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:30,300
NO.

668
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,033
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THAT

669
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,033
CRAZY."

670
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,233
>> THE BANKS ARE GIVING OUT

671
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,033
CREDIT WITH A RECKLESS DISREGARD

672
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,600
FOR CONSUMERS' ABILITY TO

673
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,500
REPAY.

674
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:39,633
>> John: YEAH, THAT MAX WEINBERG

675
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,900
IMPERSONATOR IS RIGHT.

676
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,233
AND SO, BY THE WAY, WAS JOAN,

677
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,366
WHOSE SELF-RESTRAINT I REALLY

678
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,200
ADMIRE.

679
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,900
IMAGINE THE EXPENDITURES I COULD

680
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,566
HAVE AVOIDED BY SIMPLY SAYING,

681
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,533
"NO, JOHN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

682
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,666
BE THAT CRAZY, ASK YOURSELF,

683
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,333
DO YOU REALLY NEED THIS ITEM?"

684
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
BUT YEARS OF LOBBYING BY THE

685
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,666
CREDIT CARD AND BANKING INDUSTRY

686
00:17:58,733 --> 00:17:59,433
ULTIMATELY RESULTED

687
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
IN A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT 2005

688
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:03,700
"BANKRUPTCY REFORM" BILL,

689
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,600
WHICH MADE IT FAR MORE

690
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,866
COMPLICATED TO FILE FOR

691
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,000
BANKRUPTCY THAN IT PREVIOUSLY

692
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,466
HAD BEEN -- WHICH IN TURN MADE

693
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,133
IT FAR MORE COSTLY, WHICH MEANT

694
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,333
MANY PEOPLE ENDED UP IN A

695
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,900
SITUATION WHERE THEY COULDN'T

696
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,266
AFFORD TO GO BANKRUPT.

697
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,066
AND TO UNDERSTAND OUR CURRENT

698
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,666
SYSTEM, A KEY THING TO KNOW IS

699
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,866
THERE IS NOT ONE MAIN KIND OF

700
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:23,500
PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY, THERE ARE

701
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:24,400
ACTUALLY TWO: CHAPTER 7 AND

702
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:26,333
CHAPTER 13.

703
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,966
CHAPTER 7 IS WHAT YOU COMMONLY

704
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:29,900
THINK OF AS BANKRUPTCY.

705
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,533
YOUR DEBTS ARE MOSTLY WIPED OUT.

706
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,366
AND WHILE YOU CAN HOLD ONTO A

707
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,200
FEW ESSENTIAL ASSETS BELOW A

708
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:37,166
CERTAIN THRESHOLD, THE REST CAN

709
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,600
THEN BE SOLD TO PAY OFF

710
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,366
YOUR CREDITORS.

711
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,866
IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS TO

712
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,366
COMPLETE, BUT THEN YOU GET YOUR

713
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,400
CHANCE AT A "FRESH START."

714
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,633
CHAPTER 13, HOWEVER, IS

715
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,866
DIFFERENT.

716
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,966
THAT IS MORE OF A REORGANIZATION

717
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:51,200
OF DEBT.

718
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:54,400
BASICALLY, YOUR FINANCES GET

719
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,033
EXAMINED TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH

720
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,800
YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY INTO A

721
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:56,533
REPAYMENT PLAN FOR THREE TO FIVE

722
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,433
YEARS.

723
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,766
AND IF YOU MAKE ALL THE PAYMENTS

724
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,133
IN THAT PLAN, AT THE END OF IT,

725
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,933
YOUR DEBTS DO GET DISCHARGED.

726
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,466
AND THIS HAS ITS BENEFITS -- YOU

727
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,500
DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP ASSETS

728
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:07,666
LIKE A HOUSE OR A CAR.

729
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:11,000
BUT -- AND THIS IS A HUGE "BUT"

730
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,533
-- IF YOU MISS EVEN ONE PAYMENT,

731
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,700
YOUR CASE COULD BE DISMISSED AND

732
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,400
THE WHOLE DEAL IS OFF.

733
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,633
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY BACK AT

734
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,466
SQUARE ONE.

735
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,533
AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE FACT IS,

736
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,766
THIS HAPPENS IN MOST CHAPTER 13

737
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,800
CASES, BECAUSE ONLY ABOUT A

738
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:25,100
THIRD ACTUALLY MAKE IT

739
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,400
ALL THE WAY TO DISCHARGE.

740
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,233
AND CHAPTER 13 IS ACTUALLY

741
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,866
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO FILE.

742
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:35,566
BECAUSE WHILE ATTORNEYS CHARGE,

743
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,066
ON AVERAGE, ABOUT $1300 TO FILE

744
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,133
CHAPTER 7, FOR CHAPTER 13, THEY

745
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,233
GENERALLY CHARGE ABOUT $3800.

746
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,133
SO YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, IF

747
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,866
CHAPTER 13 IS MORE COSTLY,

748
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,500
MORE DIFFICULT, AND LESS LIKELY

749
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,300
TO GET YOU A GENUINELY FRESH

750
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,100
START, WHY WOULD ANYONE

751
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,800
CHOOSE IT?

752
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,166
WELL, FOR SOME, IT MIGHT BE

753
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,500
THE RIGHT FIT -- REMEMBER, IT

754
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,900
GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO KEEP YOUR

755
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:55,500
HOUSE, WHICH YOU MIGHT NEED TO

756
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:56,566
LIVE IN, AND YOUR CAR, WHICH YOU

757
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,200
MIGHT NEED TO WORK.

758
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,033
BUT FOR MANY, MANY MORE, CHAPTER

759
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,133
13 -- DESPITE COSTING THREE

760
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,866
TIMES AS MUCH IN THE LONG TERM

761
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,366
-- CAN ACTUALLY SEEM LIKE THE

762
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,733
BETTER FINANCIAL OPTION WHEN

763
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,366
YOU FILE.

764
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,033
BECAUSE CHAPTER 7 GENERALLY

765
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
REQUIRES YOU TO PAY LAWYERS UP

766
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,166
FRONT.

767
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,433
WHEREAS CHAPTER 13 CAN BE

768
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
DIFFERENT, AS LAW FIRMS CAN BE

769
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,866
EAGER TO POINT OUT.

770
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,233
>> IS DEBT CONSTANTLY ON YOUR

771
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,366
MIND?

772
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:21,500
ARE YOU LOOKING TO GET A FRESH

773
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:22,900
START FINANCIALLY?

774
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,133
THEN CALL THE BANKRUPTCY

775
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,100
ATTORNEYS AT WOOTTON & WOOTTON.

776
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,700
WE EVEN OFFER A NO MONEY DOWN

777
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,800
CHAPTER 13 PLAN.

778
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,433
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, GET THE

779
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,900
FUCK OUT OF MY VOID, WOOTTON!

780
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,066
I KNOW I DON'T TECHNICALLY OWN

781
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:34,700
THE CONCEPT OF SAD, WHITE

782
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,566
EMPTINESS -- JARED LETO'S GOT

783
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,300
THE MARKET COVERED ON THAT ONE.

784
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,900
BUT I WILL BE DAMNED IF I LET

785
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:39,966
THIS ADULT WHO LOOKS LIKE HE

786
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,133
JUST MADE A WISH TO BE BIG STEAL

787
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,100
MY WHOLE VIBE.

788
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,533
BUT THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE

789
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,466
ALREADY IN A BAD SPOT WITH YOUR

790
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,700
FINANCES -- WHICH YOU PROBABLY

791
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,100
ARE, IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING

792
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,533
BANKRUPTCY -- "NO MONEY UP

793
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,766
FRONT" MIGHT NOT JUST SOUND

794
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,633
GOOD, IT MIGHT BE YOUR ONLY

795
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,166
OPTION.

796
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,000
THE WORRY IS THAT SOME LAWYERS

797
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,366
GUIDE THEIR CLIENTS TO

798
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,200
THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHAPTER 13,

799
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:02,633
WHEN THEY'D ACTUALLY BE FAR

800
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,100
BETTER SERVED WITH CHAPTER 7.

801
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,666
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

802
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:12,600
AMERICA, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU

803
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,000
THAT WOULD RESEARCHERS RAN AN

804
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:19,833
ACADEMIC STUDY, THEY FOUND THAT

805
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,433
ATTORNEYS WERE MORE LIKELY TO

806
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,166
OFFER A CHAPTER CHAPTER 13

807
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:25,700
BANKRUPTCY TO BLACK PEOPLE

808
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:27,300
RATHER THAN WHITE PEOPLE.

809
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:28,866
PUTTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF

810
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:31,033
WHETHER THE RESEARCHERS PLUCKED

811
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,666
REGGIE AND LETICIA FROM THE

812
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,766
HOPEFULLY NOT OFFENSIVELY SO

813
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,300
BLACK NAMES, THE FINDINGS

814
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:39,100
EXPLAINED THAT THE ODDS OF BLACK

815
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,500
DEBTORS CHOOSING CHAPTER 13

816
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,500
INSTEAD OF CHAPTER 7

817
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,566
WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS

818
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,100
WHITE DEBTORS WITH A SIMILAR

819
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:48,100
PROFILE.

820
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:48,833
SO EVEN BANKRUPTCY

821
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,433
DISCRIMINATES AGAINST

822
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,733
BLACK PEOPLE.

823
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,333
WHICH IS, COINCIDENTALLY, THE

824
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,900
COVER STORY ON THIS MONTH'S

825
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:52,766
ISSUE OF "YEAH, NO SHIT"

826
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,433
MAGAZINE.

827
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,566
AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

828
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:55,866
OFTEN PUSHED INTO THE FORM OF

829
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,433
BANKRUPTCY WITH FAR LESS

830
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,633
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES MEANS THAT

831
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,866
THEY CAN END UP HAVING TO FILE

832
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:02,533
BANKRUPTCY AGAIN DOWN THE LINE.

833
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,900
AND KNOWING THAT MAKES IT A

834
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,800
LITTLE HARD TO SEE FINANCIAL

835
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,266
EXPERTS LIKE SUZE ORMAN BROADLY

836
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,633
FRAME REPEATED FILING AS A MORAL

837
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,133
FAILING.

838
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,233
>> MOST PEOPLE WHO CLAIM

839
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,233
BANKRUPTCY ONCE CLAIM IT TWICE.

840
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,033
SO IF YOU ARE CLAIMING

841
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,700
BANKRUPTCY, YOU HAVE GOT TO

842
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:20,400
LEARN.

843
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:22,900
BECAUSE IF YOU GET YOURSELF INTO

844
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,233
THAT SITUATION AGAIN, IF YOU GO

845
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,966
OUT AND YOU RACK UP ALL THIS

846
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,666
CREDIT CARD DEBT AND ALL THIS

847
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,433
STUFF AGAIN, AND YOU HAVE TO

848
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,966
CLAIM BANKRUPTCY AGAIN, THEN I

849
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,833
SAY, SHAME ON YOU.

850
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,300
>> John: WOW.

851
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:39,033
SUZE IS OFFERING REPEAT

852
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,233
BANKRUPTCY FILERS THE

853
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,600
"SHAME ON YOU" NORMALLY RESERVED

854
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,366
FOR DOGS WHO PEED ON THE CARPET

855
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:44,366
AND NOSY PHARMACISTS IN

856
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:45,666
"MAGNOLIA" WHO'VE ASKED

857
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:46,400
JULIANNE MOORE ONE TOO MANY

858
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,166
QUESTIONS.

859
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,500
"I HAVE SICKNESS ALL AROUND ME

860
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,233
AND YOU FUCKING ASK ME MY LIFE?

861
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,400
HAVE YOU SEEN DEATH IN YOUR BED?

862
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,533
IN YOUR HOUSE?

863
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,033
WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING DECENCY?

864
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,866
AND THEN I'M ASKED FUCKING

865
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,300
QUESTIONS.

866
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:58,433
WHAT'S WRONG?

867
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,066
YOU SUCK MY DICK.

868
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,033
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

869
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,433
AND YOU, YOU FUCKING CALL ME

870
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:03,966
"LADY?"

871
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:06,566
SHAME ON YOU.

872
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:10,166
SHAME ON YOU!"

873
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,633
BUT A FEW THINGS.

874
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,766
FIRST, EXPERTS SAY ORMAN'S CLAIM

875
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,100
THAT MOST BANKRUPTCY FILERS FILE

876
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,166
TWICE IS JUST WRONG.

877
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,933
BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY,

878
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,466
EVEN THOSE WHO DO END UP FILING

879
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,233
A SECOND TIME, OFTEN DO SO

880
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,233
DUE TO FACTORS THAT HAVE NOTHING

881
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,200
TO DO WITH RECKLESSNESS -- LIKE,

882
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,500
FOR INSTANCE, GETTING A

883
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:28,800
CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY THAT

884
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,433
WASN'T RIGHT FOR THEM.

885
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,733
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT

886
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,333
CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE HELP

887
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
BANKRUPTCY CAN PROVIDE --

888
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE WHOLE

889
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,900
CATEGORIES OF "NON-DISCHARGEABLE

890
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,600
DEBTS" -- DEBTS THAT EVEN

891
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,566
BANKRUPTCY CAN'T GET RID OF.

892
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:42,900
YOU TYPICALLY CAN'T WIPE OUT

893
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,566
DEBT FROM CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

894
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,766
TAXES, OR CHILD SUPPORT THROUGH

895
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,300
BANKRUPTCY -- AND THERE'S

896
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:50,533
ANOTHER, MASSIVE CATEGORY, AS

897
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,000
THIS WOMAN LEARNED.

898
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,733
>> 31-YEAR-OLD RADMILLA

899
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,433
SULEYMANOVA GRADUATED WITH A

900
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,266
MASTERS FROM NEW YORK UNIVERSITY

901
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,333
IN 2008 DURING THE DEPTHS OF THE

902
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,733
GREAT RECESSION.

903
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,000
JOBLESS, SHE QUICKLY DEFAULTED

904
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:07,233
ON HER $80,000 STUDENT LOAN

905
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,866
BILL.

906
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:09,700
>> OH, WELL, I'LL JUST FILE FOR

907
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:10,533
BANKRUPTCY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS

908
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,066
DOING, HA-HA-HA.

909
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,166
AND THEN YOU REALIZE...

910
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,000
NO.

911
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,133
THE ONLY WAY TO GET AWAY FROM

912
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,800
YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS TO

913
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:15,500
DIE.

914
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:19,633
>> John: YEAH.

915
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,400
AND TO COMMUNICATE JUST HOW BAD

916
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,433
STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS AS A

917
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,000
GENERATIONAL DEAD WEIGHT ON

918
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,333
MILLENNIALS, I GUARANTEE YOU

919
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,366
ANYONE WITH STUDENT LOANS

920
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,266
WATCHING THIS HEARD "$80,000

921
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,800
AND THOUGHT "OH, I

922
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:30,966
DUNNO, I'VE HEARD WORSE."

923
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:31,900
BECAUSE, YEAH, SHE COULD HAVE

924
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:33,633
BOUGHT THIS ENTIRE THREE

925
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,200
BEDROOM, TWO BATHROOM HOUSE

926
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,500
IN INDIANAPOLIS, BUT WHO REALLY

927
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:38,233
NEEDS A PLACE TO LIVE WHEN YOU

928
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,566
HAVE A FRAMED 8.5 X 11 PIECE OF

929
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,600
PAPER WITH YOUR NAME ON IT?

930
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,800
THAT CAN, JUST LIKE A HOUSE,

931
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:45,133
KEEP YOU SAFE FROM THE RAIN.

932
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
AND IF ALL THAT WEREN'T BAD

933
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:47,833
ENOUGH, OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ADDS

934
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,666
INSULT TO INJURY THROUGH

935
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,966
MANDATORY CREDIT COUNSELING

936
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:51,966
COURSES.

937
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,266
WHICH CAN BE EXACTLY AS

938
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,066
PATRONIZING AS THEY SOUND.

939
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,933
EVEN BANKRUPTCY JUDGES HAVE

940
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
CALLED THEM "INANE" AND "A

941
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,400
PROCEDURAL HURDLE WITHOUT VALUE

942
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,500
OR CONSEQUENCE."

943
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:04,066
WITH ONE EVEN NOTING A COURSE

944
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,166
REFERRED PARTICIPANTS "TO THE

945
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,333
LOCAL LIBRARY FOR RESOURCES ON

946
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,133
BANKRUPTCY."

947
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,166
AND RECOMMENDED THEY "SEEK A JOB

948
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,666
MAKING HIGHER WAGES" AND I'M

949
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,533
SURE THEY'D NEVER THOUGHT OF

950
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,100
DOING THAT BEFORE IT WAS

951
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,000
VERY CLEVERLY POINTED OUT TO

952
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:17,533
THEM.

953
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,866
AND IF IT SEEMS THESE COURSES

954
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,566
MAY HAVE LIMITED VALUE,

955
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,833
ONE WE FOUND ONLINE EVEN SEEMED

956
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,466
TO RELUCTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

957
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:24,333
FACT.

958
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,666
>> YOUR ATTORNEY MAY HAVE GONE

959
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,200
OVER YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION

960
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:28,433
WITH YOU IN THEIR OFFICE

961
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,433
ALREADY.

962
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,366
PERHAPS THEY EXPLAINED WHY

963
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,633
CREDIT COUNSELING WILL NOT WORK

964
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,900
FOR YOU.

965
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:34,366
MANY DEBTORS THEREFORE BELIEVE

966
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,433
THAT THIS MANDATORY CREDIT

967
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,800
COUNSELING EXERCISE IS

968
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:39,066
POINTLESS.

969
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,500
WE HOPE INSTEAD YOU TAKE A MORE

970
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,466
POSITIVE VIEW OF THIS MANDATORY

971
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:42,766
COURSE.

972
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,333
>> John: OH, YOU HOPE SO,

973
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,366
DO YOU?

974
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:45,233
THAT'S BASICALLY AN ADMISSION

975
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,000
THAT IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

976
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:48,966
ALTHOUGH, QUICK QUESTION, WHY IS

977
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,566
THE ATTORNEY THERE CARTOON ME?

978
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,166
HE'S WEARING MY GLASSES.

979
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:52,266
HE HAS MY BANGS.

980
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,933
HE'S NEGGING AN UNWILLING

981
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,566
CIVILIAN WHILE WAVING AROUND

982
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:58,833
A BORING AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK.

983
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,666
THE GUY IS MORE ME THAN I AM.

984
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:00,366
BUT WHILE AT BEST, AN

985
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,500
OBJECTIVELY HUNKY CARTOON

986
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,233
LECTURING YOU ON YOUR FINANCES

987
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,833
IS ANNOYING -- AT WORST, IT CAN

988
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,300
BE ACTIVELY INSULTING.

989
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,733
BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION IN THESE

990
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,733
COURSES IS THAT YOU'RE IN THIS

991
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,266
POSITION DUE TO RECKLESS

992
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,833
PERSONAL BEHAVIOR.

993
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,433
BUT IMAGINE HOW THAT ARGUMENT

994
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,066
FEELS IF YOU -- LIKE THIS WOMAN

995
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:15,833
-- WENT BANKRUPT AFTER HAVING TO

996
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,366
LEAVE YOUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF

997
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:18,700
YOUR SON, WHO DIED FROM

998
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:20,866
CYSTIC FIBROSIS.

999
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,200
>> IN SEPTEMBER, WE SAT DOWN

1000
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:25,033
TO TAKE THE CREDIT COUNSELING

1001
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,800
COURSE AND IT WAS SORT OF A SLAP

1002
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,666
IN THE FACE, HONESTLY.

1003
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:28,366
AND WE HAVE NOT YET FINISHED

1004
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,033
THAT COURSE.

1005
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,833
WE LOGGED OFF AND NEEDED TO WALK

1006
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,833
AWAY FROM IT FOR A LITTLE

1007
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,633
WHILE.

1008
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,300
AND WE'LL

1009
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:41,066
NEED TO DO IT AGAIN AFTER WE

1010
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:41,666
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE FILING

1011
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,433
PROCESS AND MEET WITH THE JUDGE.

1012
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,133
IT'S A REQUIREMENT AFTER YOU

1013
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,133
FILE, AS WELL, SO THAT YOU CAN,

1014
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,733
I GUESS, GET AN IDEA OF HOW TO

1015
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,333
NOT DO THE SAME THING AGAIN IN

1016
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,133
THE FUTURE.

1017
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,633
SO.

1018
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,500
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY HURTFUL

1019
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,400
IDEA THAT I'M NOT LOOKING

1020
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:53,733
FORWARD TO.

1021
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,533
>> John: NO, OF COURSE YOU'RE

1022
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,566
NOT.

1023
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:57,000
BECAUSE HAVING A COURSE SUGGEST

1024
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,333
THERE'S A WAY NOT TO HAVE YOUR

1025
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,433
CHILD DIE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE IS

1026
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,533
A FUCKING INSULT.

1027
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,066
AND IT'S TERRIBLE THAT SHE NOT

1028
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:03,933
ONLY HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT,

1029
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,033
BUT THEN HAD TO REHASH IT IN THE

1030
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,400
SENATE IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THAT

1031
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:09,633
REQUIREMENT CHANGED -- WHICH, BY

1032
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,433
THE WAY, IT WASN'T.

1033
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,366
AND THE TRUTH IS, SO MUCH OF

1034
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:13,566
WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR CURRENT

1035
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,700
BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM STEMS FROM

1036
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,266
THAT 2005 LAW THAT I MENTIONED

1037
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:17,933
EARLIER.

1038
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,966
EXPANDING THE

1039
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:19,733
NON-DISCHARGEABILITY OF

1040
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,333
STUDENT LOAN DEBT?

1041
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,300
THAT WAS IN THERE.

1042
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,700
THE MANDATORY CREDIT COUNSELING

1043
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:23,933
CLASSES?

1044
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,966
THAT WAS IN THERE, TOO.

1045
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,533
THE LAW ALSO MADE BANKRUPTCY

1046
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,733
HARDER TO COMPLETE, ADDING OVER

1047
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
A DOZEN WAYS SOMEONE COULD MAKE

1048
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,733
A TECHNICAL ERROR AND BE

1049
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,000
DISMISSED.

1050
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:32,866
IT WAS A HUGE WIN FOR

1051
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,433
THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.

1052
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,466
AND FOR ALL THE ASSURANCES

1053
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,200
FROM GRASSLEY AND OTHERS THAT IT

1054
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,400
WOULD TARGET HIGH-INCOME PEOPLE

1055
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:42,166
ABUSING THE SYSTEM WITHOUT

1056
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:43,333
HURTING THOSE OF LESSER MEANS,

1057
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,933
AFTER IT PASSED, BANKRUPTCY

1058
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,200
FILINGS DROPPED

1059
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,500
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN POORER

1060
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:47,766
NEIGHBORHOODS, WITH FILINGS

1061
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,566
THERE DECREASING 32% MORE THAN

1062
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,600
IN RICH ONES.

1063
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,300
SHOWING THAT AS ALWAYS, WHEN

1064
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,866
THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BECOME

1065
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:55,466
HARDER FOR EVERYONE, FOR THE

1066
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:56,566
RICH, THEY JUST BECOME A BIT

1067
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,400
MORE EXPENSIVE, AND FOR THE

1068
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:58,266
POOR, THEY BECOME BASICALLY

1069
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,866
IMPOSSIBLE.

1070
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:01,600
SO WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?

1071
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,033
WELL, IDEALLY, THE PEOPLE

1072
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,633
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT 2005 LAW

1073
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,066
WOUL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR

1074
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,333
SYSTEM BADLY NEEDS FIXING.

1075
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,666
AND COINCIDENTALLY, ONE OF THE

1076
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:10,366
MOST PROMINENT BACKERS OF THAT

1077
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:11,900
LAW IS ACTUALLY THE FUCKING

1078
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:14,333
PRESIDENT NOW.

1079
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,566
JOE BIDEN IS FROM DELAWARE,

1080
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,933
HOME TO SOME OF THE BIGGEST

1081
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,500
CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.

1082
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:19,833
AND HIS SUPPORT WAS CRUCIAL

1083
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,133
IN GETTING THE 2005 LAW PASSED.

1084
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,400
AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE WASN'T

1085
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:25,233
WARNED IT COULD LEAD TO TROUBLE

1086
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,766
-- WHEN IT WAS BEING DEBATED,

1087
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:27,933
ELIZABETH WARREN -- THEN A

1088
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,133
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR STUDYING

1089
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,666
BANKRUPTCY -- TESTIFIED ABOUT

1090
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:31,600
HOW MEDICAL DEBT RUINS PEOPLE'S

1091
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,800
LIVES, AND THIS BILL COULD

1092
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:35,500
SIGNIFICANTLY HINDER THEIR ONE

1093
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:36,166
REMAINING CHANCE TO GET OUT FROM

1094
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,066
UNDERNEATH IT.

1095
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,700
AND JOE BIDEN KEPT SHIFTING

1096
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:41,000
FOCUS BACK TO THE POOR CREDITORS

1097
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,900
WHO WOULDN'T GET THEIR MONEY.

1098
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,833
>> UNTIL WE FIX THE BROKEN

1099
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,100
HEALTH CARE FINANCE SYSTEM --

1100
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,133
>> RIGHT.

1101
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,833
>> THOSE FAMILIES HAVE TO TURN

1102
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,033
SOMEWHERE AND THAT MEANS NOW

1103
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,166
THEY TURN AS A LAST-DITCH EFFORT

1104
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,433
TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS.

1105
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,466
>> RIGHT.

1106
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,600
AND THAT MEANS THEY TURN TO

1107
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:02,400
ASKING THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

1108
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,233
BORROWED MONEY FROM TO PAY FOR

1109
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,200
THEIR HEALTH CARE COSTS, RIGHT?

1110

RACKING UP DEBTS TO

1119
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:23,833
THE CORNER STORE FOR GROCERIES,

1120
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,433

1121

NO.

1125
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,766
WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE

1126
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,466
MEDICAL DEBT IS OUT OF CONTROL,

1127
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,833
AND PEOPLE HAVE ENVELOPES RAMMED

1128
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,133
THROUGH THEIR DOOR EVERY DAY,

1129
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,466
SCREAMING THEY'RE PRE-APPROVED

1130

OH, LOOK!

THIS ONE HAS SNOOPY ON IT!

1133
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,333
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS,

1134
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,866
ELIZABETH WARREN HAS PROPOSED

1135
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:43,933
THE "CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM

1136
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,733
ACT" WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY

1137
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,766
OVERHAUL OUR BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM,

1138
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,666
IT WOULD ELIMINATE EXCESSIVE

1139
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:50,800
PAPERWORK NEEDED FOR FILING,

1140
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,033
THEREBY LOWERING ATTORNEY COSTS.

1141
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,300
IT'D MAKE STUDENT LOAN DEBT

1142
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,433
DISCHARGEABLE, IT'D GET RID OF

1143
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,733
THE REQUIREMENT FOR A CREDIT

1144
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,566
COUNSELING COURSE, AND IT'D

1145
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,000
COMBINE CHAPTERS 7 AND 13 INTO A

1146
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,000
NEW, MORE FLEXIBLE CHAPTER 10.

1147
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,266
IT'S A COMBINATION THAT WOULD BE

1148
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,966
AN IMPROVEMENT -- SORT OF LIKE

1149
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,000

1152
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,633
LOOKS LIKE I ASKED MY KIDS TO

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,900
DRAW ME FROM MEMORY.

1154
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:12,300
