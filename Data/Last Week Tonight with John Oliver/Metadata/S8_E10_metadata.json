These laws which were introduced as a law and order measure to protect people forced to make difficult life or death decisions while defending themselves, have actually been used as an excuse to justify incidents which need not have turned deadly like the murders of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery. He explains the inherent racial bias in these laws which have been used against black people in the U.S. John Oliver also talks about the Israel - Palestine conflict that is raging and how unwavering U.S. support for Israel and Israel's apartheid policy against Palestinians have led to the present humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14616990", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 316, "number_of_episodes": 384}
