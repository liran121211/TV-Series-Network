Military tension between China and Taiwan are soaring as China's air-force regularly sends an increasing number of warplanes into the Taiwan Air defense zone. The Chinese government considers Taiwan an integral part of China and condemns any statement made referring to Taiwan as an independent country. Taiwan transitioned from a dictatorship to a vibrant democracy and is now the key manufacturer of computer chips which has made it into a developed and wealthy country. But due to stiff Chinese opposition, most countries and international organizations like the WHO, the IOC etc. either don't recognize it or prefer to keep Taiwan's status ambiguous. While China's warmongering has forced Taiwan to buy arms from the U.S. to bolster its defenses, polls show that a vast majority of Taiwanese want to preserve the status quo which John argues seems to be the best option at the moment. John also talks about the vaccine hesitancy shown by some police officers in the in some cities in the U.S. and how it is harming them and the people they are supposed to protect and serve.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "15654200", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 235, "number_of_episodes": 384}
