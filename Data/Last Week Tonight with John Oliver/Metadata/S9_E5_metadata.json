Millions of Americans use illegal drugs recreationally which has led to an sharp rise in overdose deaths primarily driven by the use of fentanyl. Past policies like mandatory minimums, criminalizing drug paraphernalia and forcing drug users into abstinence have not worked to alleviate the problem. On the other hand harm reduction methods like syringe services program, drug checking, naloxone use and overdose prevention centers have managed to prevent the spread of disease and overdose deaths. John says that measures like drug users having a say in drug use policy discussions, funding community based organizations giving services to drug users and removing barriers to addiction treatment in addition to harm reduction techniques could go a long way to mitigate the bad effects of drug use. John also talks about the ill-timed British royal visit to the Caribbean and the Nenana Ice classic betting competition."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "18689238", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 257, "number_of_episodes": 384}
