Previously China had a lay low international strategy which is known as 'hide your strength and bide your time'. But Xi Jinping is choosing a different path, he wants to let the world to know more about china and vice versa. And he is extremely popular among Chinese people because of their lasting economical growth and crackdown of corrupt government officials. As his influence is growing in the world with massive economy and infrastructure plans there is a growing concern also, as he is becoming more authoritarian and less accountable day by day. He is censoring anything or anyone who even tries to show some sort of dissent. As well as the government has a list of untrustworthy people which relies on a pretty weird rating system for its citizen, and they are targeting the people with different religious beliefs like: Christians, Muslims. Bottom line is Xi Jinping wants the world to know about China but only the good China, not the real China.\u2014Niaz Islam Arif"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8444500", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 297, "number_of_episodes": 384}
