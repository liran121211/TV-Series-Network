However, its residential program has huge problems. PACE administrators routinely push and promote PACE sales through individual contractors who are not qualified to explain the financial details. They also exaggerate the savings in energy cost without an independent energy audit. These practices have led to people losing their homes. John also talks about the public opposition to the Tokyo Olympics which are being held in the middle of a pandemic.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14845018", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 228, "number_of_episodes": 384}
