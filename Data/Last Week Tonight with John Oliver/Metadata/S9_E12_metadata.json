Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple and how they engage in anti-competitive practices. These companies which run various platforms and marketplaces on the Internet, promote their own products over other competitor's products and charge huge commissions from their competitors who use their platforms. John mentions the couple of bills viz. Open App markets bill and American choice and innovation online bill, which proposes to regulate some of the anti-competitive practices of these companies. Hence these tech companies are fighting this bill by running attack ads and lobbying hard. Also it doesn't help that many children of current U.S. politicians work for these companies. John also talks about the candidates from the Republican party running for the U.S. senate seat from Arizona.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "20865366", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 223, "number_of_episodes": 384}
