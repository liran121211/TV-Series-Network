(It's not.)", "This week John Oliver brings up the issue of Sponsored Content, the practice of local news stations in the U.S. where advertising is blended directly into the broadcast. Though, F.C.C. has rules requiring broadcast stations to announce when content has been sponsored or paid for, local news stations frequently break them or violate the spirit of these rules by setting up local shows built around sponsored content because it is financially lucrative making the practice widespread and harder to detect. John also talks about the recent efforts by some states in the U.S. to curtail abortion rights and also talks about some clowns running for public office next year in the U.S.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14662678", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 278, "number_of_episodes": 384}
