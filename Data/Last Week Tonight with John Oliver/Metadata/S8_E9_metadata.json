He brings up white people's lack of understanding and lack of interest in understanding about black hair and their attempts to erase this cultural heritage by reinforcing the idea that black hair was dirty and unkempt by marketing products like hair straighteners and skin lightener creams which has resulted in real life consequences for black people and has become yet another pretext for discrimination against black people. He also talks about the sham that is the Arizona election audit/recount and how it is only amplifying the conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 US election.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14570940", "rating": 6.6, "votes": 346, "number_of_episodes": 384}
