Belorussians have been angry with Lukashenko for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic along with his mismanagement of Belarus's economy and corruption scandals. Though Lukashenko won the country's first free and fair elections in 1994, his promises to combat corruption quickly fell apart. He banned all press coverage of the corruption scandals which was the beginning of his decades long assault of press and freedom of speech making Belarus the most dangerous country in Europe for media personnel. Lukashenko has used controversial referendums to remove term limits and weaken the legislature while rigging presidential elections in his favor. He has also clamped down on dissent with a heavy hand. Opposition leaders have disappeared with some suspected to have been killed. Many dissidents have been raided and sent to prison. The only hope is if somehow the people overthrow this dictator, reform their constitution and conduct a free and fair election. John also talks about the controversial Texas anti-abortion law."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "15281364", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 261, "number_of_episodes": 384}
