Though CRT is not taught in schools, critics argue that the ideas behind it are being taught in schools. By selectively picking out the worst examples from books, classroom lessons and teacher training manuals, anti-CRT activists have managed to create a panic among the American public regarding any conversation about race that one doesn't want to have. This manufactured fear has caused many states to restrict teaching about race and is likely to promote 'school choice', which conservative activists have been pushing since U.S. Supreme court decision of Brown vs. Board of Education. John argues that though the debate on CRT is dumb, it is important to engage with it to have honest discussions about race in public schools in the U.S. John also talks about the truckers' protest in Ottawa, Canada against vaccine mandates and COVID restrictions.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "16081888", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 357, "number_of_episodes": 384}
