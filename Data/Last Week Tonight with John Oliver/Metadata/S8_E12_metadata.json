He explains why the stereotype that Asian Americans are a model minority has been a persistent and problematic idea by exploring the genesis of the term 'Asian American' and the history of Asian American immigration. He talks about the dangers of treating the Asian American coalition as a monolith as it obscures the reality of what is happening to various sub-groups inside it. John Oliver also talks about how countries like the U.K. and Brazil bungled the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic due to a lack of planning and vision.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14707778", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 263, "number_of_episodes": 384}
