These policies and practices led to devastating effects on black communities, significantly expanding and locking in segregation, as well as leading to massive wealth gap between black and white communities and wide ranging consequences to quality of life such as access to better schools and teachers, cleaner streets, cleaner air and water. John strongly suggests that the solution to this issue is reparations, which is necessary, practical and the right thing to do. John also talks about the premature easing of COVID-19 restrictions in various countries and the Tokyo Olympics being conducted in the middle of a pandemic.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14940934", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 251, "number_of_episodes": 384}
