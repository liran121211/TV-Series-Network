Electric utilities in the U.S. charge exorbitant rates for providing electricity and are exceptionally prone to scandal. Most electric utilities operate as monopolies and their remuneration model incentivizes them to build excess and often unnecessary capacities. Electric utilities also stifle innovation like distributed solar-based electricity generation that could make power cheaper. Public utility commissions who are supposed to regulate utility companies don't do a good job because of various reasons like bad planning, corruption and politics. John advocates for making utility companies government owned or at least incentivize them to maintain existing infrastructure and promote renewables.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "20189952", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 236, "number_of_episodes": 384}
