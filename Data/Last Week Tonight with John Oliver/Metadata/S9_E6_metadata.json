He says how and why many innocent people get wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit. He further explains what needs to be done to punishing innocent people, where the main culprits are out in the open and probably doing more crime. So proper investigation is a must rather than forcing a false confession out of an innocent person to avoid due diligence.\u2014Niaz Islam Arif"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "19495020", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 256, "number_of_episodes": 384}
