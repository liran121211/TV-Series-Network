In some of the hottest areas of the U.S. like Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, half the prisons lack air conditioning in their inmate housing areas with heat index in some prisons hitting 150 deg F. With a growing population of older prisoners in the prison system, with many of them having a chronic condition like hypertension or diabetes, high temperatures makes them very susceptible to heat stroke. Prisons also house people with mental health concerns who require medication that can compromise with their body's ability to regulate temperature which makes them avoid taking their medications explaining the increase in suicides and self-harm incidents during summer months. However, whenever the issue is brought up, lawmakers and prison officials say that they cannot afford it or they really don't care about it. John also talks about the weird people running in the NYC mayoral election and weird local car dealership commercials."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14797738", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 231, "number_of_episodes": 384}
