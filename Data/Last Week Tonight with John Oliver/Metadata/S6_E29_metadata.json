The final segment of the show focuses on Murray's newly discovered sexual harassment scandals, and then the grand finale takes the form of a Broadway-style musical extravaganza, where John and his friends sing about Murray in a comically insulting fashion. Also, Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone is found guilty of lying to and obstructing Congress to protect Trump, and Conservatives keep repeating \"Winston Churchill's\" quote about young liberals and old conservatives, which isn't actually his."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "11110668", "rating": 9.5, "votes": 772, "number_of_episodes": 384}
