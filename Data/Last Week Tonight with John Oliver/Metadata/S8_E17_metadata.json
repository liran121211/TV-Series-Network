Lately they've been facing thousands of lawsuits and have been negotiating their way out of it with a proposed $8 billion settlement. However, John argues that this settlement will ensure that the Sacklers will escape any accountability, will face no criminal liability with a non-consensual third party release and will have preserved a majority of their ill-gotten wealth. John asks if the Sackler family has any right to keep their ill-gotten billions which came at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Americans addicted to Oxycontin. John also talks about the Russian participation at the Tokyo Olympics in the aftermath of the doping scandal.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "15156856", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 241, "number_of_episodes": 384}
