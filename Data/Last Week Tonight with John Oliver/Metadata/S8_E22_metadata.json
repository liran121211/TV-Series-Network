PFAS are chemicals that make surfaces which do not stick to other surfaces. But these chemicals have links to many health issues including cancer and decreased response to vaccines. These chemicals accumulate in humans and animals, don't degrade in the environment with lifetimes of thousands of years and cause birth defects; risks that were known to the manufacturers of these chemicals like 3M and DuPont. But they ignored the evidence, actively suppressed sale of less toxic alternative chemicals to protect their profits and didn't disclose the potential risks to regulators like the EPA. These policies of 3M and DuPont made these chemicals ubiquitous and are now present in the blood of almost every living human. John says that the only solution to this horrible problem is legislation which restricts the use of PFAS to certain applications and regulates the manufacturers of these chemicals. John also talks about the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act and how a couple of Democrats in the U.S. Senate along with their Republican counterparts are blocking it.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "15501576", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 235, "number_of_episodes": 384}
