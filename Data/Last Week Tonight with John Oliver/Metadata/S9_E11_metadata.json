Research has shown that the presence of a 'School resource officer (S.R.O)', as the school police are called, does nothing to prevent school shootings and may in fact cause more casualties. S.R.O.s are used to handle disciplinary problems at school and frequently arrest students for frivolous reasons. Often students with disabilities and students of color are arrested giving them a criminal record. John suggests that school police should be removed from schools or at least they should be given training on how to handle students. John also talks about Queen Elisabeth II's platinum jubilee celebrations and an Australian banana sculpture.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "20448022", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 242, "number_of_episodes": 384}
