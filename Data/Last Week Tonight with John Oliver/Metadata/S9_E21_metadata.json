Most of these antiquities, which are a historical record of the societal culture of their places of origin, were looted during the colonial period by European colonial powers. However, this practice continues to the present day with museums and auction houses dealing with shady art dealers and thieves who manage to surreptitiously ship these pieces of art out of their country of origin. John addresses the arguments put forward by museums who don't want to return these stolen art pieces and argues that museums must put more due diligence and research into the ownership of art items before acquiring them.\u2014cmpunk"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "21975580", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 231, "number_of_episodes": 384}
