But when that idea has an unexpected positive upside, Dwight still takes the credit and Michael becomes furious.", "Michael gets extremely carried away with a new, imaginative idea; placing promotional 'Golden Tickets' - giving the lucky finder 10% off next shipment - in the paper reams, which backfires spectacularly. Placing all five tickets in the same ream, which goes to their biggest client, means a 50% deduction. Corporate - not too pleased by this - is looking for someone to blame, and Michael looks to Dwight to take the fall. Meanwhile, Kevin receives three different kinds of romantic advice from Pam, Jim and Andy. The only problem is, all three of them seem to be letting their own past experiences cloud their judgment on the situation."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1248740", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 6216, "number_of_episodes": 188}
