1
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,078
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:11,263
Mooovie Monday!

3
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:16,478
The only cure I know
for the Monday blues is...

4
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:18,292
<i>Varsity Blues.</i>

5
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,295
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,131
Take a seat down there.
Second from the end.

7
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:24,030
All right,
everybody here?

8
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:25,030
Yes.

9
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:26,647
Popcorn, anyone?

10
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:28,190
Yes, please!

11
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:29,694
Thank you.

12
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,791
Anyone else?

13
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,937
No.

14
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,193
Movie Monday started
with training videos.

15
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,131
But we went through those
pretty fast.

16
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:42,891
Then we watched
a medical video.

17
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:45,472
Since then, it's been
half hour installments

18
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:46,960
of various movies.

19
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:49,433
<i>With the exception of
an episode of Entourage,</i>

20
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:51,551
which Michael made us watch
six times.

21
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:54,733
<i>Entourage!</i>

22
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:30,242
Kevin, would you like to do
the scenes from last week?

23
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:31,251
Yes.

24
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,222
Why him?

25
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:34,361
Don't whine.
Get the windows.

26
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>Previously on
Varsity Blues...</i>

27
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:40,241
<i>Okay, Billy Bob
got a head injury,</i>

28
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:41,871
but coach made him play.

29
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,060
<i>So then Lance,
he gets sacked.</i>

30
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,182
<i>And he's out for the year.</i>

31
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:52,711
Hello?

32
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,641
Not everyone approves
of movie Monday.

33
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,111
I won't say who.

34
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,872
<i>I don't approve.
I don't.</i>

35
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,583
Hello?

36
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:12,333
Let's go after
that title now.

37
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,981
<i>Let's go, let's go!
Let's go!</i>

38
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:18,712
Hi, Jan!

39
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:20,480
<i>Hope you brought
the Milk Duds.</i>

40
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:21,862
How would a movie

41
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:23,681
increase productivity,
Michael?

42
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,252
How, on earth,
would it do that?

43
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,413
People work faster after.

44
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:29,482
Magically.

45
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:30,220
No.

46
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:33,811
They have to,
to make up for the time...

47
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:34,813
watching the movie.

48
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,313
No.

49
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,043
<i>Do I need to hire
a babysitter for you...</i>

50
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,383
Kitchen.

51
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,131
<i>Some little 14-year-old girl</i>

52
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:41,653
<i>whose job it is...</i>

53
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,423
Michael is going to
get us all fired.

54
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,722
You sat back and let him
play that dumb movie

55
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,380
and now Jan is peeved off.

56
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,230
And we're all
going to lose our jobs.

57
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,883
That's not going to happen.

58
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,992
You know she has it
out for him now.

59
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,390
That's not his fault.

60
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:55,022
He had to
follow his heart.

61
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:57,642
Ever since Michael
dumped Jan for Carol,

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,543
Jan's been bitching out
on him.

63
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:02,343
Reject a woman and she will
never let it go.

64
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,542
One of the many defects
of their kind.

65
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:05,900
Also, weak arms.

66
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:09,703
Dwight, you should be
running this office.

67
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:14,530
Michael would never let me.

68
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:15,870
It's not
up to Michael.

69
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:17,820
It's Jan's call.
Talk to her.

70
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,070
I could never do that.

71
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,342
Fine, sit back
and do nothing

72
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,301
and let us all
get fired.

73
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,741
I know that patience
and loyalty are good

74
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:31,370
and virtuous traits.

75
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,642
But sometimes I just think
you need to grow a pair.

76
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:37,002
At  the Stanford branch,
they all play

77
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,800
<i>this World War II video game
called Call of Duty.</i>

78
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,353
And they're all
really into it.

79
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm told it started
as a team building exercise.

80
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,902
Unfortunately,
I really suck at it.

81
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,442
Oh.

82
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,303
We didn't play
many video games in Scranton.

83
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:54,641
Instead
we'd do stuff like...

84
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,301
Uh, Pam and I would sometimes
hum the same

85
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,672
high pitched note.

86
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,500
And try to get Dwight
to make an appointme

87
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:03,001
with an ear doctor.

88
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,370
And Pam called it...

89
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,170
Pretendonitis.

90
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:10,543
Hey, Kelly,
my stuff just got here.

91
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,270
Kelly really likes
to online shop.

92
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,583
So I felt like I wanted
some new clothes.

93
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:21,342
I mean, I just...

94
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,343
I wanted to...

95
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:27,670
I felt like it was time
to maybe, um...

96
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:29,243
just get new clothes.

97
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:32,471
Okay.

98
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:34,240
I love it.

99
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,872
Really?
I don't know.

100
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,343
Now, you haven't even
tried it on yet.

101
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,042
Try it on.

102
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,822
Not at work.
I'll try it on--

103
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,573
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

104
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,000
Fashion show at lunch!

105
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:45,663
No.

106
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,443
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

107
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:49,471
Fashion show at lunch!

108
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,841
<i>Fashion show!
Fashion show!</i>

109
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,240
Fashion show at lunch!

110
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:56,571
Why did you do that?

111
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,001
I'm just killing Germans
any way I can.

112
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:01,341
We're on the German team.

113
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:05,303
Shoot the British.

114
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,553
Wait, are we
playing teams?

115
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,973
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,301
Wah!

117
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,773
Gah!

118
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:23,893
<i>Hello?</i>

119
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,213
Is this Jan?

120
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,470
<i>Who is this?</i>

121
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:30,070
This is Dwight Schrute.

122
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,390
I am calling about
an extremely sensitive matter.

123
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:34,611
<i>You should talk to Michael
and he'll talk to me</i>

124
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,531
<i>and that way we don't have 
to speak to each other.</i>

125
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:38,162
It's about Michael.

126
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:39,761
<i>What about him?</i>

127
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:44,041
I can't talk here.
It's too sensitive.

128
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,343
<i>It's not about
a surprise party, is it?</i>

129
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,442
No, but we should discuss that
another time.

130
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,840
<i>Look, I'm already an hour
outside of Scranton, Dwight.</i>

131
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,813
<i>I am not coming back.</i>

132
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,740
Pull over at exit 40.

133
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:58,703
There is
a Liz Claiborne outlet.

134
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,501
I  know you
like that store.

135
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:03,702
Go inside and shop
until I can meet you.

136
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:05,700
<i>How do you know
I like that store?</i>

137
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,443
Many of your blouses
are Claibornes.

138
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>How do you know that?</i>

139
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,703
It's part of my job.

140
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:13,990
<i>No, it's not.
It's officially not.</i>

141
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:15,740
Noted.

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,502
* Mm mm mm *

143
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,670
I'm going to the dentist.

144
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,044
Okay.

145
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,111
I have to have
an emergency crown put in.

146
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,377
Ouchy.

147
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,443
Yes.

148
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:30,843
It's a new dentist.
He's far.

149
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:34,800
I might be gone
three hours.

150
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,970
Three hours, wow.

151
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:38,373
Have fun.

152
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,790
Did you get anything good?

153
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:47,380
Yeah.

154
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,141
New blouse?

155
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:54,673
Halter top?
Camisole?

156
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:55,873
Teddy?

157
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,592
I could save the branch.

158
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,100
Really.

159
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:00,703
If you let me run it.

160
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:01,900
Okay.

161
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:03,172
Okay, I can run it?

162
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,293
What would you do differently?

163
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:08,271
Mostly get rid of waste.

164
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:09,863
Which is half
the people there.

165
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:12,040
And clean house.

166
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,460
Right here.
It's all for me.

167
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:15,482
Thank you.

168
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:19,003
Dwight, you just feel strongly
to speak with me this way

169
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:20,531
behind Michael's back.

170
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,670
And turn on so many
of your co-workers.

171
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:26,531
The decision to turn on Michael
was difficult.

172
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:29,612
But once I did it,
I didn't look back.

173
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,181
And mostly I feel that
Michael would approve.

174
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:36,732
It's really what's best
for the branch.

175
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,202
And I could care less
about my co-workers.

176
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:42,732
So, here we are.

177
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:46,330
It's all on the table.

178
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:49,232
I want the branch.

179
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:53,901
And I await your decision.

180
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,631
Oh, by the way...

181
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,553
There's a new Ann Taylor
outlet store near here.

182
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,800
I know you like
their earrings.

183
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,141
Where is it?

184
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,530
<i>Michael.
Hi.</i>

185
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,301
<i>I've had a very interesting
conversation</i>

186
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,532
<i>with one of
your employees.</i>

187
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:14,532
Oh, that's nice.

188
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:15,580
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

189
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,740
<i>Dwight  just told me
that he thinks</i>

190
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,680
<i>he can run the branch
better than you.</i>

191
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,733
<i>What?
Mm-hmm.</i>

192
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,043
You were at the dentist?

193
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,703
<i>You can't have people
undermining you.</i>

194
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,300
<i>Get control of your branch
immediately.</i>

195
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:26,601
Okay.

196
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:27,830
What was Dwight thinking?

197
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,073
That he could turn Jan
against me?

198
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:32,830
She's my ex-lover...ishh.

199
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:37,191
<i>Wow.</i>

200
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:38,711
It's so sexy.

201
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:40,163
You look so hot.

202
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,640
<i>It's really something.</i> 

203
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:42,891
It's too much.

204
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,361
<i>What?
I'm gonna return it.</i>

205
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,801
No, you have to keep it today.

206
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:48,142
Just see how you feel.

207
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,533
Hey.

208
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,603
Hi.

209
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,320
You look nice.

210
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,852
Thanks.

211
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,130
Isn't  that, like,
your third soda today?

212
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,593
Yeah, I think we can be
a big help to your company.

213
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:06,170
Okay,  see you next week.
Bye.

214
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,533
Again?

215
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:09,590
Scared?

216
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:11,232
<i>Call of Duty!</i>

217
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:16,291
Andy, Jim, can I see you
in the conference room

218
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,572
<i>for a minute?
Now?</i>

219
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:18,323
Yes, now.

220
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,680
Put the game on hold,
everyone.

221
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,513
This is not working, okay?

222
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,460
We are getting slaughtered
out there.

223
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,833
It's the new guy.

224
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:26,703
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't know...

225
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:27,681
what we're talking about.

226
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:28,471
See what I mean?

227
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:29,952
We just need a strategy, okay?

228
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,761
We're gonna set up a trap
in the gun room.

229
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,531
<i>All right, Jim,
are you using the MP-40</i>

230
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,491
<i>or the 44?</i>

231
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:36,010
Um, sniper rifle?

232
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,503
Snipe--
What?

233
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,303
Are you playing for
the other team?

234
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,232
You don't snipe
in Carrington, okay?

235
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,070
Saboteur!

236
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,230
<i>Saboteur!</i>

237
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:45,952
I'm gonna kill you for real.

238
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:48,601
The game is over.

239
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,630
<i>I'm really
going to shoot you.</i>

240
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,063
<i>Hey, Dwight...
Hey.</i>

241
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,092
You want an m&m?

242
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,700
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.
No, seriously.

243
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,430
You should have an m&m.
They're really good.

244
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:14,800
Okay.

245
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:23,200
Good, huh?

246
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,801
So good.

247
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:34,182
Hey, I thought you weren't
supposed to eat anything

248
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,703
for a couple of hours
after you've had

249
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:37,432
a crown put in.

250
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:44,203
They have this new kind of
quick drying bonding.

251
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,301
So...

252
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,972
Sounds like a good dentist.

253
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:47,801
Oh, yeah.

254
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:50,531
What's his name?

255
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,003
Crentist.

256
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:02,102
Your dentist's name
is Crentist.

257
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:03,050
Yeah

258
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,302
Huh.

259
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,551
Sounds a lot like dentist.

260
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,060
Maybe that's why
he became a dentist.

261
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,070
Let me see your teeth.

262
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:19,800
Let me see 'em.

263
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:22,871
Let me see 'em.

264
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:28,402
Ohh.

265
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,570
You should floss.

266
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:38,103
I know.

267
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,971
Well then.

268
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:49,570
I'm glad you're okay.

269
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,403
Business is like
a jungle.

270
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:54,801
And I am like a tiger.

271
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:58,771
And Dwight is like
a monkey...

272
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:02,602
that stabs a tiger
in the back with a stick.

273
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:05,503
Does the tiger
fire the monkey?

274
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:08,573
Does the tiger
transfer the monkey

275
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,470
to another branch?

276
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,670
Pun.

277
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,672
There is no way
of knowing what goes on

278
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,472
inside the tiger's head.

279
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,470
We don't have
the technology.

280
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:28,000
Dwight, can I talk to you
for a second?

281
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:37,333
Wow, this is tough!

282
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,703
Brrrrr!

283
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,231
What?

284
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh.

285
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,143
Aaaarg!

286
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:46,373
What is it?

287
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:50,231
Well...

288
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,433
I just got off the phone
with Jan.

289
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,500
And, um...

290
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,003
She demoted me.

291
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:02,271
No.

292
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,501
Yeah.

293
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:04,993
You know what the craziest
part of this is?

294
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,931
She demoted me
to your job.

295
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:11,203
<i>And she said that you
should be expecting</i>

296
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:12,400
a call later from corporate.

297
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:15,283
And that, um...

298
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,431
<i>I guess that means
that you are going to be</i>

299
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,532
<i>acting manager
of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton.</i>

300
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,053
I can't believe this news.

301
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,330
That...wow.

302
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,973
Yeah.

303
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,332
I told her I didn't know
whether you'd wanna do it.

304
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,901
Because you've always been
so loyal to me.

305
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,873
<i>You've been my most
trusted ally.</i>

306
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:38,171
You said that?

307
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,900
Yep, I did.

308
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,430
I did.

309
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,931
But I think...

310
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,571
you should do it.

311
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:54,231
Well...

312
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:56,900
Gosh, if you think
I should.

313
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,401
Then I will.

314
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,933
Perfect.
Well, we're settled.

315
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,141
All right.
All right.

316
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:09,293
Well, then you are now
acting manager

317
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,871
of Dunder-Mifflin
Scranton branch.

318
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,823
And I am assistant
regional manager.

319
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:15,810
Assistant to
the regional manager.

320
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,772
Thank you, Michael,
for staying on.

321
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:18,803
I really appreciate it.

322
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:21,303
Hey, hey.

323
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:24,393
I can't imagine this place
without you.

324
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:26,972
Can you?

325
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:30,003
That's so nice.

326
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,773
Well, um...

327
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,401
I guess we should
go tell the troops.

328
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,331
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.

329
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:41,673
Okay, let's do it.

330
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:49,023
Hey. Hi, hello.

331
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,791
Everybody, I have
some good news.

332
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:53,522
And I have
some bad news.

333
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:58,121
I am being replaced
as your leader by Dwight.

334
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,183
You're kidding.

335
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:01,292
You might think
that I am kidding

336
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,061
and I understand that.

337
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,870
Congratulations, Dwight.

338
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:06,260
Thank you, Angela.

339
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,462
But why Dwight?

340
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:12,563
Because Dwight never lies.

341
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,680
How does that qualify him
to run a branch?

342
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,310
Because that's all it takes.

343
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,390
<i>Okay, Dwight,
would you like to</i>

344
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:21,880
say a few words
to everybody about loyalty?

345
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,292
Thank you, Michael.

346
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,351
I just wanna say
to the few of you

347
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:27,383
who will remain
under my employ,

348
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:30,202
<i>that I intend to lead you
into the black</i>

349
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,711
with ferocity.

350
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:33,960
Michael, what will you do?

351
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:34,580
Oh, I'll be fine.

352
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:36,141
<i>Do you have any savings?</i>

353
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:37,583
No, no, I don't.

354
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,512
Michael, you might
lose your condo.

355
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:40,941
<i>I won't.</i>

356
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:41,633
I won't.

357
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,512
I have this
little vacuum cleaner

358
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:44,410
that's broken.

359
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,000
If Dwight doesn't
work out,

360
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:47,520
maybe that could be manager.

361
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,611
Maybe I'll quit.

362
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,241
It's really happening.

363
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:55,042
Yes.

364
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,711
We can
make a difference here.

365
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:01,940
<i>I will make
a difference here.</i>

366
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,241
You alone?

367
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:04,843
'Cause I thought together...

368
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,412
Oh, please,
don't be naive.

369
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,772
You can be in charge
of the women.

370
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,343
Look how cute he is.

371
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,611
<i>And he's trying to shoot
with a smoke grenade.</i>

372
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm sorry, what are you
whispering back there?

373
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,933
Nothing, just concentrate
on turning around.

374
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:28,712
I'm trying.

375
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:29,571
I just...

376
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:31,190
<i>Just tap S then D.</i>

377
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:32,642
Oh.

378
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:35,583
Any last words? No?
What?

379
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,281
<i>Wow.</i> 

380
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:45,312
Psychopath.

381
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,432
What?

382
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,673
I'm just looking.

383
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,412
Please go back
to your desk.

384
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,510
In a minute.

385
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,071
Well, I remember why I dress
the way I do at work.

386
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,112
But I'm gonna
keep the clothes.

387
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,410
I  mean, it'll just be cool

388
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:10,870
to have some after work clothes
other than pajamas.

389
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,340
Well, I guess it's time...

390
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,042
that I turn over the keys

391
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,813
to the famous Sebring.

392
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,753
No, thank you.

393
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:27,770
It's a corporate lease,
Dwight.

394
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:28,912
You've earned it.

395
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:30,472
<i>No, thanks.
What?</i>

396
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,673
Not my style.

397
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,142
But you said
you liked it.

398
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,403
You've always admired it.

399
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:39,071
That was before.

400
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,242
I'm thinking about
getting something German.

401
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:41,742
Something with
decent gas mileage.

402
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:42,681
Plus the convertible

403
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,953
<i>is a ridiculous choice
for this climate.</i>

404
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,513
Take it back.

405
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,012
No.

406
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,443
That's my car.

407
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,680
<i>What did you--
That's my car!</i>

408
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:03,142
Yes.

409
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,832
I know, Dwight.
I know.

410
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,022
I know. I know.

411
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,180
You know what?

412
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,090
Jan called me
about your little meeting!

413
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:12,040
No.

414
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:14,840
I know what you did.

415
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,811
I made the whole thing up,
Dwight.

416
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,701
The Sebring's cool.
Oh, do you?

417
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:19,903
Do you like the Sebring?

418
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:20,673
How dare you!

419
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,743
<i>How dare you, Dwight?</i>

420
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:25,203
Don't fire me.
Please.

421
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,231
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you

422
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,073
right here on the spot.

423
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,872
I have excellent
sales numbers!

424
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,510
<i>Not good enough!</i>

425
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,890
I'll do anything!

426
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:33,921
Anything!

427
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,571
<i>I'll do your laundry
for a month!</i>

428
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:39,040
<i>For a year! Michael!
I have a laundry machine.</i>

429
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:42,143
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything.

430
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,871
<i>Please.</i>

431
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,870
<i>Please.</i>

432
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:48,922
<i>I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
You can't. You can't.</i>

433
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:50,982
<i>But I promise I'll never
betray you again.</i>

434
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:52,991
<i>What can I do, Michael?</i>

435
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:55,072
<i>What can I do?</i>

436
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,872
What can I do?

437
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:00,072
What can I do?

438
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:02,472
<i>What can I do?</i>

439
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,811
<i>You can get up.</i>

440
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,641
Get up.

441
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,143
And you can
hug it out, bitch.

442
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:25,871
Hug it out, bitch.

443
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,643
That is what men
say to each other

444
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:29,030
after a fight.

445
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:30,181
They hug it out.

446
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:32,083
And in doing so,

447
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,940
they just let it go.

448
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,810
And walk away.

449
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,640
Then they're done.

450
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:41,351
Not a good idea to say that
to a woman, however...

451
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:43,242
I have found.

452
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:46,070
Doesn't translate.

453
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:20,762
Yep, we huged it out.

454
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:24,363
But, it turns out I was a little hangry.

455
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:28,803
So I felt I needed to punish
him jusl a little bit more.

456
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:32,922
And I make him do my laundry for a year.
