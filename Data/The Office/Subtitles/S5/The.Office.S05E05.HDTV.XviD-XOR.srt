1
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:04,633
You guys look amazing.

2
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:07,328
Stanley, I thought
you hated halloween.

3
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:09,642
He wears it
so he can sleep at his desk.

4
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:13,266
- Who are you?
- Carrie Bradshaw from <i>Sex and the City</i>.

5
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:15,101
- I like your shoes.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:17,687
- Will you help walk me to the fax?
- Sure.

7
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:20,010
I got her, I got her,
I can help you.

8
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,691
- You look amazing.
- Inappropriate. Thank you.

9
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,806
- Who are you, Larry King?
- Gordon Gekko.

10
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:30,200
- From the insurance commercials.
- Yeah...

11
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:36,444
Awesome.

12
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:39,113
Let's put a smile on that face.

13
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,491
Damn it, Creed!

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,256
I've been up since 4:00!

15
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,735
Sweet'stume, dude.

16
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,952
Who are you supposed to be?

17
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,790
Cool.

18
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,636
You are...

19
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:03,851
a cat.

20
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,569
We were looking for kitten.

21
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,754
Give me one second.

22
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,439
Jim Halpert.

23
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:18,248
- Hey, New York. Happy Halloween.
- Thanks.

24
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,408
My costume's getting
a lot of attention.

25
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:25,130
So apparently no one
dresses up for Halloween here.

26
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:29,634
I wish I had known that before I used
grease paint for my moustache.

27
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:32,492
And I can't even take off my hat

28
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,597
because then I'm Hitler.

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,899
Wanna see a magic trick?

30
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:46,183
I'm gonna make a pencil disa...

31
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:50,129
Disappear.

35
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:14,687
OK, I think we are set.

36
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,321
We have puzzles,

37
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,933
string for cat's cradles.

38
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:20,607
Burned this last night.

39
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,482
A little road trip CD.

40
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:23,608
Puppets.

41
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,620
Look at all this stuff.
It's only 7 hours.

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,569
When corporate found out
that we were dating,

43
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,879
they decided
they were gonna transfer Holly

44
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,231
back to her old branch
in Nashua, New Hampshire.

45
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,604
Michael's taking a personal day
to move me up.

46
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,347
Road trip!
Right?

47
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,247
Breaker one-nine, copy...

48
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:45,953
Copy that, breaker.
Those Duke boys are at it again.

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,370
Do not... touch my radio.

50
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,134
- Kidding.
- We're not doing anything.

51
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:56,232
It's been a weird week
since we found out I had to transfer.

52
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,825
Michael wanted me to quit
and get some job here in Scranton,

53
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,171
I said "why don't you quit
and get some job in Nashua?"

54
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,250
He said "I asked you first."
I said "first"

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,647
at the same time he did.
And then I said "jinx."

56
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:07,598
And then we never...

57
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,539
talked about it again,

58
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,570
and haven't been back
to the conversation, so...

59
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,081
All right, everybody,
I am out of here.

60
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:17,283
- Jim, you are in charge.
- I'll walk you out.

61
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,953
You're quite a gentleman.

62
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,320
You can let people go
a couple of min early if you want.

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,429
All right, we'll see.
No.

64
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,296
I'm off to New York.

65
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,129
My brother Pete from Boston
and my brother Tom from New Jersey

66
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:34,258
are taking Pam and I out for lunch

67
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:36,599
to celebrate the engagement.

68
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,419
Or maybe to beat me up.

69
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,640
I can never tell with those two.

70
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,349
Good morning, temp.

71
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:49,981
Good morning.

72
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,248
Good morning, Dwight.

73
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,299
Thought I'd go casual today.

74
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,274
Good morning, everyone.

75
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,740
Good morning.

76
00:03:59,014 --> 00:03:59,905
Hello.

77
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,621
How are you, Phyllis?

78
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:06,928
That's funny.

79
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,061
Take that sweatshirt off!

80
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:19,080
- Hey, buddy.
- Andy.

81
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:23,232
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you
to take your sweatshirt off?

82
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,731
Totally joking.

83
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,616
But you should know
those colors are sacred.

84
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,230
Not that I care.

85
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,436
But if you're not a Cornell man.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,994
- You probably shouldn't wear them.
- No, I get it.

87
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:35,682
I totally understand.

88
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:39,431
And I just want to assure you
that I mean no disrespect.

89
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,729
You see, I'm applying.

90
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:44,887
Come on, you think
you could get into Cornell?

91
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:48,038
Well, if someone who barely
out-sells Phyllis can get in,

92
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:49,403
I should be fine.

93
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,407
- I'm sitting right here, Dwight.
- I meant that as a compliment to you.

94
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,505
As well as a slight to Andy.

95
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,022
Cornell is a good school.

96
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,647
And I want to better myself
through higher education.

97
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,517
If it makes Andy angry, so be it.

98
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,891
I have to unpack this weekend, but maybe
next weekend we go to the outlets!

99
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,744
Mike, you driving every weekend?

100
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,750
We're gonna switch
back and forth, the driving.

101
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,706
Sometimes we'll just meet
in the middle.

102
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,533
It'll be fun. Wait a sec.

103
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:19,272
I love this song.

104
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,947
<i>Life is a highway</i>

105
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,464
<i>I wanna ride it all night long</i>

106
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:33,170
<i>If you're going my way</i>

107
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,088
<i>I wanna drive you all night long</i>

108
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:42,432
<i>If you're going my way</i>

109
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:44,869
Hey there.

110
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:49,041
So, how do you think we're gonna do
against Penn this year?

111
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,164
Nathan Ford's arm
looks pretty strong.

112
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,524
Well, he's had
a pretty good season so far...

113
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,259
Stop saying "we."

114
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,743
You did not go to Cornell.

115
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:59,703
You're just doing this
to screw with me.

116
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,940
Not so.
Cornell is an excellent school.

117
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,131
Without its agricultural program,
we probably wouldn't have cabbage.

118
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,797
At least not modern cabbage.

119
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,041
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight.

120
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,414
I went there.

121
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,487
My blood runs big red.

122
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:16,564
Someday we'll both get together
in Comstock Hall

123
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:19,041
and just laugh about all of this.

124
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:26,895
Hey, future baby sis!

125
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,271
How are you, Tom?
Nice to see you.

126
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,038
I asked Tom and Pete to come early

127
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,521
so we could play
a prank on Jim at lunch.

128
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,131
Pretty awesome, right?

129
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,154
I think they're into the idea.

130
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:39,838
They're probably thinking,
"that Pam Beesly,"

131
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,810
"she's the coolest
sister-in-law on the planet."

132
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,622
"She's the best."

133
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,751
"The absolute best."

134
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,670
OK, so, here's what I'm thinking.

135
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,279
I'm gonna say that before ceramics class
I took off my ring.

136
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,389
And then when I changed
back out of my smock,

137
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,073
it wasn't in my pocket
anymore, and I lost it.

138
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,212
That's perfect.

139
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,297
You know what'd be
even more hilarious?

140
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:07,555
Remember that thing we did when Jim
was in high school with his girlfriend?

141
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,085
That would be hilarious.

142
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,614
We should totally dog her
about being an artist,

143
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,155
- never making any money.
- That's awesome.

144
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,691
Like she basically
has a hobby for a job.

145
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:23,404
So, not the ring, then?
Not doing the ring, then.

146
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:26,616
I think this is better.
This is nice. It's fun.

147
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,276
He hates it when
we pick on his girlfriends.

148
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,915
They came up
with that idea really fast.

149
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:40,882
- This trip is longer than I thought.
- Yeah, it did look shorter...

150
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:53,143
I was having a nightmare.

151
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,732
You were sleeping?

152
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:58,464
- You were talking before.
- Was I? Really?

153
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,943
- Was I saying anything interesting?
- Not really.

154
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,867
All right, what's the scoop?
How far?

155
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,469
Four hours.
Almost halfway there.

156
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,985
- We're only halfway?
- Halfway! You know what I want to do?

157
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:13,704
I want to pull over and
find a little bed and breakfast

158
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:17,439
for when we meet in the middle.
Emphasis on the bed.

159
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:19,306
And the breakfast.

160
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,981
Next exit isn't for five miles.

161
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,647
Let's check there.

162
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:26,941
- Hey, guys.
- How are ya?

163
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,300
Good to see you.

164
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,270
Nice to see you again, Pam.

165
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,216
Pam, I haven't seen you
in so, so long.

166
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,425
All right.
So now we can sit...

167
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,593
and get comfortable.

168
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,396
There's nothing out here, man.

169
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,993
I don't know. I just...

170
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,457
imagined a hotel right here.

171
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,377
A pool over here.

172
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,680
Little breakfast place...

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,916
With really good bacon. Just...

174
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,781
Here we go.
Fourth time's a charm.

175
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:14,974
<i>Life's like a road where you just...</i>

176
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:16,928
<i>One thing here and the next day back</i>

177
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:19,210
<i>Sometimes you deal with it
then you don't</i>

178
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,644
<i>Sometimes you do what you want</i>

179
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,488
<i>It's out there...</i>

180
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,638
- Are you crying?
- No.

181
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:34,327
- Allergies?
- No.

182
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,953
- Did Darryl touch you?
- What!

183
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:42,625
No, Darryl did not touch me.
Can we just keep going, please?

184
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,879
- What's the matter?
- It's not gonna work.

185
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,125
- Sure it is.
- There's too much distance.

186
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,854
It's gonna work.
It'll be fine.

187
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,231
We've only been dating
each other for a few weeks.

188
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,447
Listen to me.

189
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,620
- I like you so much.
- I like you too.

190
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,512
- And I've dated almost 4 women last...
- I've dated 4 guys last year too.

191
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,299
No. In like, the last 10 years.
I've dated almost 4 women.

192
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:13,830
And you are so far
above them it is stupid.

193
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,410
Michael, don't. Don't.

194
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,315
Don't make it harder
than it has to be.

195
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,062
That's what she said.

196
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,997
Holly thinks
that this relationship is over.

197
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:27,365
Well, you know what,
I am not gonna give up that easy.

198
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,299
I'm going to make this way harder
than it needs to be.

199
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,190
Take that down.

200
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,069
- Excuse me?
- Take...

201
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:40,803
that down!

202
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:43,019
I once dated a couple of guys
from Cornell.

203
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,064
They were really nice,
gave me a ride home.

204
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,191
I seriously doubt
anyone from Cornell dated you.

205
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:49,777
It's pronounced "colonel."
Highest rank in the military.

206
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,963
It's pronounced Cornell!

207
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,140
It's the highest rank
in the Ivy league.

208
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,826
Andy, let's just talk about this
man to man

209
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,912
- after work. What do you say?
- Fine. Good.

210
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,913
- Good.
- Can we...

211
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:08,958
That's big red bear!
That's a bobble big red bear!

212
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:09,902
God!

213
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:17,087
If you leave on friday by 5:00,

214
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:20,166
you'll be rolling in
at midnight at best.

215
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,901
And then sleep in saturday.

216
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:27,121
That only leaves us less than 24 hours
before you have to go back again.

217
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,923
I will talk to you
on the bluetooth the entire trip.

218
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:33,472
So we're talking constantly
all the way.

219
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,512
I'll tell you everything that I see.
Everything that I pass by.

220
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,673
Things that I witness on the road.

221
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:40,863
Maybe I'll see an accident
one weekend.

222
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,521
How long could we keep that up?

223
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:44,107
- Years.
- Years?

224
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,564
Years of just a few hours
every weekend?

225
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,987
Here's my wish.

226
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:53,035
I want you to meet a great guy,
and I want you to be happy.

227
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:57,584
- Thank you.
- My wish has come true, incidentally.

228
00:11:57,704 --> 00:12:00,908
Because you've met me
and you are happy.

229
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,175
Clever, Mike.

230
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:08,871
So Pam, how much money does an artist
make after they leave art school?

231
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,865
Not a lot of money
in the arts, right?

232
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:13,532
That's not really true.

233
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,653
There's a lot to do
with an art degree, actually.

234
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:17,864
Maybe Pam should pay the check by...

235
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:20,158
drawing a picture on this napkin.

236
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:24,332
That's... a little rude.
What's your deal?

237
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,787
- Just having fun, Jimmy.
- Right, Pam?

238
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:37,179
You know what,
I think we're a great couple.

239
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,809
I think we're a classic couple.
I think we're like Romeo and Juliet.

240
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,276
I think we....

241
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,268
go together so well.
We're like peanut butter and jelly.

242
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,128
- Don't you think?
- I do.

243
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:50,577
Then, don't do it.
Please don't do this.

244
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,129
Please don't do this.

245
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:54,661
What's up?
I just thought I'd try you.

246
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,489
I'm thinking about that story

247
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,948
where you ran into the girl
you used to babysit.

248
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,782
- I don't know what I'm gonna do!
- Please call me back.

249
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:03,703
- I'm not gonna be OK.
- You will.

250
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:05,959
No, I won't. I'm not strong.

251
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,848
I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan.

252
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:10,935
Oh, god!

253
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,499
- You might be interested...
- What?

254
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,073
Dwight

254
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,073
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you,

255
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,110
which a cappella group
should I join?

256
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,966
The Harmoniacs or the Do-Re-Migos?

257
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:31,386
Assuming you had the voice
to be in any of them,

258
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,901
it's irrelevant.

259
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:36,578
Because I called admissions,
and it looks like I...

260
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:39,349
will be conducting
your university interview.

261
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,571
- That's a conflict of interest.
- Yeah. Big one.

262
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:46,972
So should I not let you in now,
or do you want to do the interview,

263
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,241
and then I won't let you in?

264
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:53,045
- Interview.
- Excellent.

265
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:57,264
When the hourglass strikes 3:00,

266
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,718
then in the room
whence employees confer.

267
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:05,389
- What?
- The conference room.

268
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:11,061
Who are your role models?

269
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:13,076
If I had to put Dwight's chances
into a percentage,

270
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:15,858
I would say he has
none-percent chance.

271
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,047
So...

272
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:18,736
Dane Cook.

273
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,428
Jack...

274
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:21,645
Bauer.

275
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:23,946
And Eli Whitney.

276
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:28,662
You're doing great.

277
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,153
<i>Life is a highway</i>

278
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,472
<i>I wanna ride it all night...</i>

279
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,300
This is my niece, Vanessa.
She's a trumpeter.

280
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,155
- And... look at her.
- Cute.

281
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,748
It must be really fun
for you and Marcy.

282
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:50,154
She only knows how to play
<i>When the saints go marching in</i>.

283
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:51,924
- I love that one.
- Yeah, but...

284
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:55,202
She doesn't think she's gonna be,
like, a career musician, right?

285
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:57,024
Here we go again.
What's your deal today?

286
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:00,444
Just saying, how many famous trumpeters
can you name, besides Louis Armstrong?

287
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:01,737
- Miles Davis.
- One.

288
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:03,209
- Chet something.
- Half.

289
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,672
- The point is that there are jobs...
- Dizzy Gillespie.

290
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:06,775
Also good.

291
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:09,148
and hobbies. I love baseball
more than anything,

292
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,163
but you don't see me
trying to get on the Mets.

293
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:13,518
Pete, you couldn't make the Mets.
She's at Pratt.

294
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:16,252
You play JV baseball.
Will you lighten up a little bit?

295
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:17,779
Just calling it like I see it.

296
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,346
I don't know if I'm going
to make any money with art.

297
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,268
I mean,
it's a very competitive field.

298
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,590
But I've a professor who says
that I've a lot of promise.

299
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,134
And if I don't try now,
I never will, so...

300
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:29,926
Guys, what is going on?

301
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:35,343
We pranked you.

302
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,399
It was Pam's idea.
Pam was the mastermind.

303
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:41,101
Got you.

304
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:45,114
That was killer.
I was so close to blowing it.

305
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,982
Let's see how well you know
your big red history.

306
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:48,995
Bring it.

307
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,664
Who was Cornell's 8th president?

308
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,288
- Dale Raymond Corson.
- I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

309
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:56,373
Cornell's 7th president
was, in fact, James A. Perkins.

310
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,669
Comprehension skills sub-par.

311
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:02,143
Interviewing skills... sub-par.

312
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:06,573
What are you writing? You can't even
give Cornell your full attention.

313
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:10,308
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell
by evaluating their interviewers.

314
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,474
Nobody wants that... to happen.

315
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:16,195
Well, when they get my evaluation,
we'll see if they're interested.

316
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,860
Applicant is attempting
to blackmail interviewer,

317
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,744
showing low moral character.

318
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:25,471
Interviewer is threatening applicant
with an arbitrary review process.

319
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:29,783
Applicant is wasting everyone's time
with stupid and inane accusations.

320
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,910
Interviewer has suspect motives.

321
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,237
Applicant has a head
shaped like a trapezoid.

322
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,651
Interviewer has turned off
applicant's interest in Cornell,

323
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:43,028
and they are going to go
to the vastly superior Dartmouth.

324
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:44,208
Ever heard of it?

325
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,804
I think I have everything I need.
I think I have everything I need.

326
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,889
You will be hearing from
the Cornell Application Department.

327
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,432
And you will not be pleased
with the result.

328
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,244
And your affiliation with Cornell
will end completely!

329
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:57,925
... will end completely.

330
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,522
That is all, sir.
You may go.

331
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,304
There's another dolly
in the truck, Mike.

332
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:18,617
You could take more than a lamp.

333
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,398
For the record, I wanted
to go another direction.

334
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,974
Which was way better.

335
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:26,101
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

336
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,489
What do you got?

337
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:31,030
I lost my engagement ring
in ceramics class.

338
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,381
Left it in my smock.

339
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,138
I had this whole thing
where I go back to class,

340
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:37,112
wrongly accuse another girl.

341
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:39,743
Look, I even used makeup
to put a ring around my finger.

342
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:42,200
- You can hardly see, it's very subtle.
- That is good.

343
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,257
Thank you.

344
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:46,722
Truthfully, anything
would have been better than that prank.

345
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:52,102
Text message from my brother.
"Pam cool. Welcome to the family."

346
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:56,977
How about at Thanksgiving
we prank Tom about being bald?

347
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:59,984
- This is the last of it.
- That's mine, actually.

348
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,796
- Maybe put it back in the truck.
- You're not staying?

349
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,940
You know, I have some things
I need to do this weekend.

350
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,805
I just remembered, so...

351
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:10,970
I'll just ride back with you.

352
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:14,933
- But you want me to put it back.
- I'll be down in just a second.

353
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:20,310
So...

354
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,732
I think I'm gonna go back
with Darryl.

355
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:38,752
- Bye.
- OK, bye.

356
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,091
I know it's hard, Mike.

357
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,568
Break-ups hurt.

358
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,321
We didn't break up.

359
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,233
Looked like it.

360
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:21,551
Sometimes when I'm down like this,

361
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,111
it helps to sing the blues.

362
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:34,747
That's a really pretty song.

363
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:38,312
No, no, check it out. Look.

364
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,258
Wanna do that?

365
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:43,735
That's when you hit me
with what's getting you down.

366
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:53,654
No, wait, you...

367
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,915
You supposed to...

368
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,239
Never mind.

369
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,156
I thought I'd come in casual today.

370
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:26,588
Man, I'm hungry.

371
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:28,942
Anyone else feel like a beet?

372
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:32,190
- Where did you get those?
- What, these?

373
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:35,480
Bernard Farms.
Best beets in the state.

374
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,366
I see what you are doing.

375
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:39,701
But I do not know
where you are going with this.

376
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,092
You will.

377
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,281
As soon as you visit
my new beet farm.

378
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:53,195
You're supposed to cook these,
aren't you?

379
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:54,333
Cornell.
