1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,870
- Pam, line three.
- Okay, thanks.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,600
New York, as it turns
out, is very expensive.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,050
And I ran out of money.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,980
I thought about selling a kidney,

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,040
But Michael offered to get me
a part-time job at corporate.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,550
Paaaameeelaaaaaaaaaa

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,200
Of course, now Michael knows where
to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,920
Hey, Michael.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,830
Paaaameeelaaaaaaaaaa

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,780
Miss you kiddo. Miss you so much.

10
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,780
<font color=#00FFFF>The Office S05E04
Crime Aid</font>

11
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,660
- Hey.
- Hello.

12
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,660
- That was really fun last night.
- Yeah, it was nice.

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm actually thinking about getting
my own set of put-put golf clubs.

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,960
Oh, that would be great. You need that.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,440
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it would help.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,950
- Well, I, uh. I let her win.
- No, he didn't.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,440
So. When, um, can I see you again?

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,580
Um, tonight. I'm free tonight.

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,580
Is that too eager?

21
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,810
I don't care. I'm free tonight.

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,800
Okay.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,300
Oh, wait. Oh, tonight's no good.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,460
Because I am busy taking you out.

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,360
Oh, I just remembered. I can't tonight.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,020
- Why?
- I'm going out with you.

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,340
Oh, wait a second. Oh, I can't tonight.

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,980
- Tonight's so--
- No more.

29
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,580
- No more.
- All right. Too many times.

30
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,300
It's all good. Um, all right, so good.

31
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,700
So have a nice day.

32
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,450
- Thank you. You too.
- You're welcome.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,030
In my opinion, the third date
is traditionally the one where

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,400
you have sex.

35
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,390
Does Holly feel that way?

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,740
I don't know.

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,730
I will probably find out tonight.

38
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,220
If she starts having sex
with me, I'll know for sure.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,050
That's for you.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,440
And, uh, oh.

41
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,250
I am right in assuming that
Dwight is short for D-Money.

42
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,220
'Cause that's what i wrote
on your Save-The-Date.

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,330
You set a date?

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,860
J-Money. Or should it
be T-Money, for Tuna?

45
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,280
Receptionist-Money.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,330
K-Money.

47
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,710
- What are you making?
- A knife.

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,080
- You're making a knife with a knife?
- You got a better way?

49
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,940
You wanna talk about it?

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,470
About what?

51
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,590
You know I know.

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,430
You know they know.

53
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,590
I know none of that.

54
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,760
And if i did,you'd be the last to know.

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,970
- Oh, the mall could be fun.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,760
We could go to the food
court, get different foods.

57
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,250
You could get chicken
teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.

58
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,350
Some of what we order depends on
whether we're having sex after.

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,510
Oh, my!

60
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,450
Wow, elephant in the room.

61
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,940
Are we, do you think? Do you think
we're gonna have sex tonight?

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,920
Hell, yeah.

63
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,790
Okay, so we do the restaurant
thing, And then-- then-- then we can do--

64
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,030
- We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
- Yeah, that's good.

65
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,520
Probably get soup or something light.

66
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,380
Hi.

67
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,850
She introduced me to so many things.

68
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,900
Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism,

69
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,140
Presents on your
birthday, preventative medicine...

70
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,420
It's nice to learn new things.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,020
- I was talking to myself.
- Okay.

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,360
I just don't get it.

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,230
What don't you get?

74
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,140
Why is she marrying Andy?

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,150
Angela's not really a risk taker.

76
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,020
And Andy's not really a risk.

77
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,980
That's really fattening.

78
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,090
No, it's lettuce.

79
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,120
- It's time to go?
- No.

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,110
No.

81
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,220
Reservations are at 8:00, so
we've got, like, an hour 45 minutes.

82
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,660
I'm a crazy 8.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,970
- I'm crazy.
- You're crazy. Go crazy.

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,950
Oh, I forgot my keys.

85
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,520
Do you need 'em?

86
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,470
- Yeah, let's go grab them.
- All right.

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,050
- Oh, after vous.
- Thank vous.

88
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,130
What?

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,510
I didn't forget my keys.

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,460
I just didn't want to make out
with you In front of the cameras.

91
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,900
Do you think they can hear us?

92
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,530
Not if we turn these
dials all the way down.

93
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,990
Now they can't hear us at all.

94
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,440
- Oh, good.
- We're totally alone.

95
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,630
Yes, that's correct.

96
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,250
I need to cancel checks
from 10,001 to 90,000.

97
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,690
Great, they stole my laptop.

98
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,800
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,080
How does that even compare?

100
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,000
Oscar, I'm now going
to be prone to surges.

101
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,710
Oh, my god. What happened?

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,140
- We were robbed last night.
- Bravo, Watson.

103
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,130
Looks like a classic seven-man job.

104
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,640
Okay, security tapes were stolen.

105
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,280
Motives-- financial, or possibly
vintage HP computer collectors.

106
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,680
Hank down at security had clocked out.

107
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,370
And that is all we have.

108
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,620
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,420
That wasn't us, right? You
remembered to lock the doors?

110
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,670
No, did you?

111
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,340
Michael, I think this is our fault.

112
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,560
- Oh, no.
- No, no. Oh, my god! My god.

113
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,050
So much for sex without consequences.

114
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,830
You are such a dork! Shots!

115
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,230
So apparently Pam went out last night and accidentally
called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.

116
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,020
- So.
- I'm not drunk.

117
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,470
I'm on minute six of this message.

118
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,180
Okay, I do not sound like that.

119
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,370
- You can take the girl out of Philly.
- Scranton.

120
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,180
The future mother of my children.

121
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,320
I never felt safe here.

122
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,030
You're always safe with me.

123
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,650
I'm a very good screamer.

124
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,080
And one day, we're gonna move to Disney's celebration
village in Florida and leave all of this behind.

125
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,780
I would very much like that.

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,510
- CONSIDER YOURSELF AT HOME!
- Ugh. Ugh.

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,460
Get in.

129
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,280
Where are we going?

130
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,370
I know she loves
me, Phyllis. I am sure of it.

131
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,690
She practically told me so.

132
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,760
Then you need to give her an ultimatum.

133
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,120
Tell her she needs to make a choice.

134
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,410
You or Andy.

135
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,590
If she picks you, great.
If not, you can move on.

136
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,160
Are you sure that's gonna work?

137
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,120
It did when Bob said I had to stop
talking to my sister on the phone so much.

138
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,170
Wait-- this isn't
our floor, Dwight.

139
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,140
How's everyone doing?

140
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,570
My door is always open
If anyone wants to talk.

141
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,300
I don't want to talk.
I want my laptop back.

142
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,140
Nobody steals from Creed
Bratton and gets away with it.

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,810
The last person to do this disappeared.

144
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,850
His name? Creed Bratton.

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,150
We're gonna make everything all right.

146
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,620
All right?

147
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,750
Conference room, 15 minutes.

148
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,830
1/2 hour. All right?

149
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,870
To recoup their losses, I am
planning a little charity auction.

150
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,360
Where people from all over Scranton can
come and bid on our goods and services.

151
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,570
I'm calling it Crime-Aid.

152
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,180
It's like farm aid.

153
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,720
But instead of farms
fighting against aids,

154
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,340
It is us fighting
against our own poverty.

155
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,460
- I think it's a fun idea.
- Thank you.

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,130
We could auction off things that we do for
each other, like cleaning or tennis lessons.

157
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,500
My sorority did it all the time.

158
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,340
Okay, I'm gonna have to
stop you right there.

159
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:04,070
Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a
real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?

160
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,580
- Move on, Michael.
- Okay.

161
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,750
Okay, well,come on! Let's have
an auction. Let's do this.

162
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,180
We'll auction off
people, like in the olden days.

163
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,880
So in order to recoup the
value of items we liked,

164
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,540
we have to spend more money
on things we don't want.

165
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,250
Who would ever come to this?

166
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,780
I don't know. It could
be any number of people.

167
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,160
It could be a pedestrian.

168
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,320
It could be an old person.

169
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,440
It could be a Lookie-Loo.

170
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,360
Or it could be A Bruce
Springsteen fan-- What?

171
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,850
Who said that? I did.

172
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,180
Why did i say that?

173
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,890
Oh, I think you know why i said that.

174
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,690
I think it is very apparent.

175
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,080
I think it goes without saying.

176
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,250
Bear with me.

177
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,470
There's a point there.
But what is the point?

178
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,150
I don't understand what he's saying.

179
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,520
It seems a little shady.

180
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,120
It seems a little foggy.

181
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,680
Well, it's not a little foggy.

182
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,640
-There's really something going on
here-- Do you need us for any of this?

183
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,300
Do I?

184
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,930
Michael scored the big ticket item.

185
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
Springsteen tickets.

186
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,060
The boss scored the boss.

187
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,950
Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.

188
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,270
He knows how to get things. He got me.

189
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,600
Sorry.

190
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,030
Twice.

191
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,780
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,090
Listen to me close, 'Cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

193
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,750
You either break off your engagement with that
singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me.

194
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,610
Or you can say good-bye to this.

195
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,490
I think you have me
confused with another person.

196
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,530
I said I was only gonna say it once.

197
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,900
You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14.

198
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,840
I heard you.

199
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,600
Pump it up!

200
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,630
Yeah! Yeah!

201
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah!

202
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,500
Pump up the volume.

203
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,670
Thank you very much, everybody.

204
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,310
Thank you, Mr Springsteen.

205
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,250
And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.

206
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,700
Crime reduces innocence.

207
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,920
Makes everyone angry, I declare.

208
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:13,070
It is not known how many
office robberies occur

209
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,890
Every second, because there is no Wikipedia
entry for office robbery statistics.

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,320
However, tonight, its victims
are standing together,

211
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,570
and standing strong in the form of song.

212
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,380
Cooking lessons, and hugs.

213
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,580
Really, Phyllis?

214
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,920
You're auctioning a hug?

215
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,800
Okay, so with no further
ado! Lights! Camera! Auction!

216
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,690
Take it away, Bruce!

217
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,460
Mike gave me a list of his
top ten Springsteen songs.

218
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,670
Three of them were
Huey Lewis and the News.

219
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,080
One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car.

220
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,600
And my personal favorite, Short People.
(by Randy Newman)

221
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,640
Okay, this is the moment that
you have all been waiting for.

222
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,720
Our first item up for bids tonight

223
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,820
is something I consider
to be very boss indeed.

224
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,130
It is a yoga lesson from Holly Flax!

225
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,530
Yoga!

226
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,740
And I would like to start
the bidding off at $300.

227
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,670
$300, do I hear $300?

228
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,430
$300. Hey, batter, batter.

229
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,920
Hey, batter. Swing, batter,

230
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,530
$300, $300, $300.

231
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,750
Anybody, $300.

232
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
$400.

233
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,780
Do I see somebody in the back?
Is there somebody in the back?

234
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,640
Do I see somebody in the back?

235
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,270
$400-- $450.

236
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,640
Sold for $300 to me!

237
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,520
What the hell is that?

238
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,170
It's the only gavel I could find.

239
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,130
It squeaks when you bang it.

240
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,530
That's what she said.

241
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,190
Let's hear it for me!

242
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,950
Right?

243
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,190
A bargain at any price.

244
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,610
Hey, Mike, do my thing.

245
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,620
Oh, yes, great. Very good.

246
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,250
Um, so, Darryl and the boys
in the hood in the warehouse

247
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,480
have graciously donated to, uh,

248
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,570
go out for a beer with them right now.

249
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,170
You know what?

250
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm actually going to bid on this.

251
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm gonna start the bidding, because
this is something that I've dreamt of.

252
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,050
Mike, you can't do that.

253
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,320
It's conflict of interest.

254
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,430
$5.

255
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,710
- Sold to Jim!
- Okay, sold!

256
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,470
Have fun, you guys.

257
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:33,290
Well, this next item is sure to spring
steam from your ears if you don't win it.

258
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,280
It just says "Creed".

259
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,240
Yeah, that's all-inclusive.

260
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,580
She thought I was McNabb.

261
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,070
I can see that.

262
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,090
Yeah, well, whatcha gonna do?

263
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,850
Another round, boys?

264
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,560
Great.

265
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,910
Halpert?

266
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,190
What's up, Roy?

267
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,010
Hey, man.

268
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,190
Relax, man.

269
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,090
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.

270
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,810
- Oh, I wouldn't.
- You good?

271
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,640
I'm good. How you doing?

272
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,270
- I'm good, yeah.
- Okay.

273
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,120
Hey, Darryl, what's happening?

274
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,110
- Oh, what's up, Roy?
- Hey, what's up, guys?

275
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,690
How you been?

276
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,720
Hi, I'm Kevin.

277
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,410
And I'll do your taxes.

278
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,120
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody.

279
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,150
Who's first?

280
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,930
Kevin do your taxes.

281
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,160
He's the tax man.

282
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,800
Kevin, the tax man.

283
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,800
- Federal and state.
- Federal and state.

284
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,740
- Fine.
- Okay, all right.

285
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,850
Hey, you know what?

286
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,490
I would appreciate it if people
would stop storming off the stage.

287
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,950
Me and the Blues.

287
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,000
It's me and the Blues.

287
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,250
We are getting there, folks.

288
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,140
Slow and steady.

289
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,810
Well, well, have we been blessed today.

290
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,180
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr David Wallace!

291
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,480
Whoo!

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,620
Thank you, Michael.
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

293
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,050
I'd like to auction off a weekend
at my place in Martha's Vineyard.

294
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,680
Hey, hey!

295
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,810
- $100.
- $100! Great!

296
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,230
- $125.
- $125!

297
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,730
- $140.
- $140!

298
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,100
Hey, Phyllis. Someone let
the air out of your tires.

299
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,180
- Come quick.
- Oh, dear.

300
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,200
Keep it going. Hey, batter, batter !

301
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,720
- $160.
- $160!

302
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,470
I had to get your attention.

303
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,020
This is an emergency.

304
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,090
Why couldn't you have just said it?

305
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,380
Why did you actually do it?

306
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,780
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum.

307
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,760
Now what?

308
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,630
Now you move on.

309
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,360
Okay, fine. I've moved on.

310
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,850
Now how do I get her back?

311
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,870
Well, Dwight, I don't think you do.

312
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,460
I think you've got your answer.

313
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,510
Wait, that's it?

314
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,340
That's your advice?

315
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,070
I thought you had some
kind of big master plan.

316
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,630
Well, I just think we all deserve to be
with someone who wants to be with us.

317
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,430
I get it.

318
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,840
You're trying to secure your place as
head of the party-planning committee.

319
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,370
You're just being selfish.

320
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,210
And you slap like a girl.

321
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,240
What did Phyllis do wrong?

322
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,170
I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong.

323
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,460
She stuck her nose into my
business and tried to help me.

324
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,250
What's going on with Pam?

325
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,630
- Oh, she's good, actually.
- Yeah?

326
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,150
She's, um, she's in new york.

327
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,940
She's at art school.

328
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,360
- Really?
- Yeah, she's doing really well.

329
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:04,140
She's engaged, um. To me.

330
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,570
Congrats, man.

331
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,710
Oh, thanks, man.

332
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,080
Appreciate that.

333
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,960
So Pam's happy?

334
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,040
Yeah, I'd say she's happy.

335
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,870
I mean, she loves her classes.

336
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Loves the city.

337
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,640
Last night, she was out with
her friends till, like, 8:00 AM.

338
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,580
What?

339
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,310
I thought you were a friend.

340
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,420
I am going to see Pam,
because, I feel like I should.

341
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,940
When are you getting to Bruce?

342
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,460
Uh, just a few more items.

343
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,340
Bruce, bruce, bruce!

344
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,370
All right, all right, all right!

345
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,730
Here we go, here we go.

346
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,710
All right, big ticket item.

347
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,480
All right, in my pocket, I have

348
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,550
Two tickets.

349
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,810
To Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front.

350
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,750
Oh, where are those?

351
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,170
Has anyone seen an envelope
with Bruce Springsteen

352
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,700
Front row tickets and backstage passes?

353
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,060
Anybody seen something
like-- laying around?

354
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,350
Do you want us to look for 'em?

355
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,760
No.

356
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,760
I think they were stolen.

357
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,230
I think they were stolen,
and they're gone forever.

358
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,420
So.

359
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,150
Oh, that was the last good item.

360
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,810
So good job, everybody.

361
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,060
I have my hug.

362
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,810
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody...

363
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,260
...really wants a hug, so.

364
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,600
I'll bid on a hug.

365
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,060
She's your wife, you idiot.

366
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,500
- $100.
- $200.

367
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,330
Uh, what the hell is happening?

368
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,290
- $250!
- What are you doing?

369
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,720
I need a hug, unless
you're gonna give me one.

370
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,120
- Not here.
- $300!

371
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,220
$300!
We have $300!

372
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,900
$300, going once. $300, going twice.

373
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,310
$300 and one penny.

374
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,100
$300 and one penny! $300 and one penny!

375
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,210

376
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,530
- $350.

377
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,400
- $350 and one penny.
- $350 one penny!

378
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,130
- $400.
- $400, hey, batter, batter.

379
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,100
- $400 and one penny.
- $400 and one penny.

380
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,340
- $500.
- $500, $500, $500...

381
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,670
- $500 and one penny!
- $500 and one penny!

382
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
$1 million!

383
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,720
- $700!
- $700!

384
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,470
- $700 and one penny!
- Humuna! Humuna! Humuna! Humuna!

385
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,230
$1,000.

386
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,260
Eh, it's not worth it.

387
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,850
$1,000, going once.
$1,000, going twice.

388
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,940
Sold for $1,000!

389
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,210
Nicely done.

390
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,600
No.

391
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,460
You know what? No.

392
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,970
Because. I'm not that guy.

393
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,820
And we are not that couple.

394
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,180
Hey, that looks good.

395
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,230
Listen, about the tickets.

396
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,740
It's sort of a gray-- it's sort of--
kind of a gray area in terms of whether I had them--

397
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,240
The Springsteen tickets
seemed too good to be true.

398
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,300
But a lot of Michael
seems too good to be true.

399
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,450
So far it's all true.

400
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,090
But yeah, those tickets really
seemed too good to be true.

401
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,440
No, I did not know that
Michael was dating Holly.
