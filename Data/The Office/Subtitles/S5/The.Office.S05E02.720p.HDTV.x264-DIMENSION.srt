1
00:00:01,223 --> 00:00:03,229
- <i>Well, I should go.</i>
- All right,

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:05,104
I'll tell everybody here
that you say hi.

3
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:06,919
<i>No, don't. I'm mad at them.</i>

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,252
Why? What happened?

5
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:11,635
<i>Not one of them called
to congratulate me on our engagement.</i>

6
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:16,448
That they might be off the hook for,
because I didn't tell them.

7
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,122
What? Why not?

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,982
I just didn't, you know,
want to deal...

9
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:24,004
Come on, it won't be that bad.

10
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,753
You know what? Here we go.

11
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:31,582
Everybody, just wanted
to make an announcement.

12
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:33,424
Pam and I are engaged.

13
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:34,620
<i>Hi, everyone!</i>

14
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:37,374
- I thought you were already engaged.
- Nope.

15
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,872
That was Roy.
She was engaged to Roy.

16
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:43,142
- Thank you, Angela.
- I got a gift for Pam and Roy.

17
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,683
- Do I have to get another one?
- Yes.

18
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:47,761
A little close
to my engagement there, Tuna.

19
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,886
- What's your game here?
- To get married.

20
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:52,402
She's not a virgin, you know.

21
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:56,043
- What's going on?
- <i>No, nothing. Nothing, Michael.</i>

22
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:57,328
<i>Just saying hi.</i>

23
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,259
The tall guy got engaged.

24
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:01,575
- To be married?
- Yep.

25
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:06,366
<i>Sorry.</i>

Just kidding. Take your time.

31
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,182
Today is ethics day.

32
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:37,718
After they finish the quiz,
I'm gonna run my first meeting here.

33
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,775
It's gonna be in-sane!

34
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:44,398
No, it's not.
I have to read from the binder.

35
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,032
I got it. I got it.

36
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,853
<i>I took you to an intimate restaurant</i>

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,636
<i>Then to a suggestive movie</i>

38
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:00,399
<i>There's nothing left to talk about</i>

39
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,837
<i>Unless it's horizontally</i>

40
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,856
<i>Let's get ethical,</i>

41
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,180
<i>ethical</i>

42
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,381
<i>I wanna get ethical</i>

43
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:11,797
<i>Let's get into ethics</i>

44
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:15,015
<i>Let me hear Dunder Mifflin talk</i>

45
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:18,451
<i>Your body talk</i>
<i>Let me hear your body talk</i>

46
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,732
Why are you helping her?
You're not even dating.

47
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,831
She's my friend, and...

48
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,632
ultimately my strategy

49
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:28,207
is to sort of...

50
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,195
merge this into a relationship

51
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,533
without her even knowing.

52
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:37,285
OK, let's give it up for Miss...

53
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:38,674
Holly Flax!

54
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,845
Thanks, Michael.

55
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:44,748
Today we're gonna have
a business ethics seminar,

56
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,173
because recently,
without mentioning any names,

57
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,613
there has been
some misconduct at corporate.

58
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:52,466
And we have a very strict
ethics policy,

59
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:55,286
- and that employee has been fired.
- Come on!

60
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:56,756
He's right there.

61
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:58,428
He was hired.

62
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:01,163
- Check it out... Hired guy.
- Nice.

63
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,436
OK, elephant in the room.
Let's talk about it.

64
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,995
Do I regret what I did?

65
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:08,899
Of course I do.

66
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,751
Even though it was an amazing ride,
and I'll give you an example.

67
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:13,726
Anyone see Survivor, season 6?

68
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,917
Anyone know Joanna on that show?

69
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:18,096
In New York city,
I hooked up with a girl

70
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:20,204
who looked exactly like that...

71
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,374
Indistinguishable, so...

72
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:26,672
OK. Well done. Good speech, Ryan.
You're a good guy.

73
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,377
Let's start discussing

74
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,587
those questionnaires
that you filled in this morning.

75
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:33,693
"It is wrong to make personal calls
during work hours?"

76
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,662
Now some of you marked
that you very strongly agree.

77
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,179
But ideally you would've selected
"totally agree."

78
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,089
I thought "very strongly agree"

79
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,775
sounded stronger than "totally agree."

80
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,519
Corporate would like to emphasize

81
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,897
that ideally you would all
totally agree with that statement.

82
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,192
Well, I think
we can all totally agree

83
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,871
that Holly is totally fantastic.

84
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,556
Thank you.

85
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,705
"In fact, spending a half hour
at the watercooler

86
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,207
"during work hours
is a form of stealing."

87
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,530
- What?
- Yes, it's called time theft,

88
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,965
and it's the same as taking money
from the company.

89
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,168
Can anyone think
of examples of things

90
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,920
that are over-the-line
time-wasters?

91
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,393
This meeting.

92
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:14,577
Can't set them up like that.

93
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,296
Why is it OK for smokers
to take breaks all the time?

94
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,052
If I want to go outside
and hang out once an hour,

95
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,208
I'll just take up smoking.
I'll do it. Don't care.

96
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,808
I'll smoke with you.
I got a bag of cigars in my purse.

97
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,582
Stealing office supplies
is another big ethical area

98
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,170
that there seems to be
some confusion about.

99
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,940
Can we have a moment?

100
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,984
Can I talk to you for a second?

101
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:37,539
A lot of good stuff, and
you look... you look...

102
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,292
- fantastic.
- Michael.

103
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,651
What should we be working on
while you guys are talking?

104
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,400
Do some... do some work.

105
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,900
People expect a lot
from these meetings...

106
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:49,262
Laughter, sudden twists,

107
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:50,751
surprise endings.

108
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:54,922
You need to be Robin Williams
and M. Night Shyamalan.

109
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,829
You need to be Robin Shyamalan.

110
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,795
Well, I just have to get
through the binder.

111
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,025
- Just... you're kind of losing them.
- I am?

112
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:03,183
Don't think about the stakes.

113
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,228
- It'll freak you out.
- OK.

114
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:08,521
Well, Michael makes
a really good point. So...

115
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,729
let's just open this up
a little bit.

116
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,273
Say my name is Lauren, and...

117
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,695
here I am shopping
in a supermarket,

118
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,779
and I steal a pencil.
That's not right.

119
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,823
Lauren, enough with the pencils.

120
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:24,276
I have to go over pencils
and office supplies.

121
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:27,397
- It's part of the ethics thing.
- That isn't ethics.

122
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:31,044
Ethics is a real discussion
of competing conceptions of the good.

123
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:34,103
This is just the corporate
anti-shoplifting rules.

124
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:35,837
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.

125
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:39,219
Would you steal bread
to feed your family?

126
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,555
Exactly, Andy.

127
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,138
I took intro to philosophy...
twice, no big deal.

128
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,827
It's a trick question.
The bread is poisoned.

129
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,726
Also, it's not your real family.

130
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:52,384
You've been cuckolded
by a stronger, smarter male.

131
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:54,878
No, that's not how it works.

132
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,701
I would not...

133
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,406
steal the bread.

134
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,656
And I would not
let my family go hungry.

135
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,325
OK, but we should
get back to business.

136
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,294
Have any of you ever faced

137
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:09,746
any ethical dilemmas
in the workplace?

138
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,139
Anybody?

139
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:15,833
This is a chance for you to say
something without any repercussions.

140
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:16,970
Stanley?

141
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,880
- Oscar, come on.
- Pass.

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,996
I will go first.

143
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,697
When I discovered Youtube,
I didn't work for five days.

144
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,371
I did nothing.

145
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,836
I viewed Cookie Monster
sings <i>Chocolate Rain</i>

146
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,338
about 1,000 times.

147
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,206
What was the dilemma?

148
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,042
To tell you or not,
and I'm glad I did.

149
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,151
I feel very, very good
and "catharctic."

150
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:42,182
I promise you that you are not
going to get into trouble.

151
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,204
You can say anything you want
with total and complete immunity.

152
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:48,994
Come on. Anybody?

153
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,265
Let it fly.

154
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:52,832
Once in a while,
I'll take a long lunch.

155
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:55,896
- A siesta.
- Time thief. Time thief... Fire him.

156
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,755
You've really never stolen
any company time?

157
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,060
Never.

158
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,169
You are a thief of joy.

159
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:04,468
Anybody else?

160
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,180
Sometimes I download pirated music
onto my work computer.

161
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,140
Who hasn't? Good. Good!

162
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:12,566
- What else?
- No, I'd like to hear more about that.

163
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,482
I once reported oscar to the I.N.S.

164
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:18,857
Turns out he's clean,
but I'm glad I did it.

165
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,641
- Well, let's keep this party moving on.
- I'll go.

166
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,574
Have you guys ever met Bruce Myers,
the Scranton rep for Hammermill?

167
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:30,589
Well, for the past six years,
I've been sleeping with him

168
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,125
in exchange for discounts
on our supplies

169
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,999
and outback steakhouse
gift certificates.

170
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:36,655
Jackpot.

171
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:41,271
Meredith, that is serious.

172
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:45,004
I mean, not only is that
a conflict of interest,

173
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,094
but there's also
an exchange of goods.

174
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:48,945
Exchange of steak.

175
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,087
Have you ever had
sirloin steak, honey?

176
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:52,337
That's crazy.

177
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:54,225
That's crazy talk.

178
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,106
The "Merenator",
sleeping with suppliers.

179
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,764
What time we got?
You know what?

180
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,094
That's a good place
to end it, right there.

181
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:10,047
This, I think,
was a great ethics seminar.

182
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,473
She has given us a lot
of wonderful things to think about.

183
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,612
Right,

184
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:16,127
what is wrong...

185
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,812
Who's to say, really, in the end?

186
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,216
I mean, because it is unknowable,

187
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:24,892
but let's give her a round of applause.
Holly, everybody.

188
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:27,049
Get back to work.

189
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:29,299
Great job.

190
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,815
I am truly impressed.

191
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:35,810
That... You really pulled that one out.
Classic, classic meeting.

192
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,094
We should celebrate.

193
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:40,203
There are some serious
issues with Meredith.

194
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:43,003
I mean, all of you have done things
I wouldn't have done myself,

195
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,391
but Meredith's actions
are really over the line.

196
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,333
What you gonna do?

197
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,182
So, regarding the supplier,

198
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:59,966
approximately how many liaisons
have there been?

199
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,056
Liaisons? You mean meet-ups?

200
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,243
I don't know.

201
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:06,010
Once a month for six years,
something like that.

202
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,667
Meredith, why don't you tell Holly

203
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:10,458
it's not what she thinks,

204
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:12,525
nothing unethical happened,

205
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:16,065
and that you just
like to sleep around.

206
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,144
Am I in trouble here or something?

207
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:20,938
No. This is just
a stupid formality.

208
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:23,705
No, it's not a formality.

209
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,074
Now, were these...

210
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,412
meet-ups,

211
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,448
just personal,
unrelated to business?

212
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:33,732
No. I wouldn't have done it
if it wasn't for the discount paper.

213
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,822
There's not a lot of fruit
in those looms.

214
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,331
For the love of god, we're trying
to help you, you stupid bag.

215
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,715
What I don't understand is...

216
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,089
why the steak coupons,

217
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,089
I mean, if you were already
getting the discounted paper?

218
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,894
Well, it's funny.

219
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:50,927
Maybe it's a girl thing, but...

220
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:52,769
after we did it,

221
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,067
when he would give me
those coupons,

222
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,516
I just felt good about myself.

223
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,899
What's going on here?
I thought I had immunity.

224
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:08,071
Well, unfortunately, immunity,
or something being off the record

225
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,192
does not really exist
in the workplace.

226
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,656
I've never heard of anyone

227
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,027
who kept their job
after something like this.

228
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,172
Well, I'm not quitting.

229
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,508
Yawn... Four seconds.

230
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,785
What are you doing?

231
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:36,518
You had said that you don't do anything
personal during work time, so...

232
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,109
I'm just making sure.

233
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,279
Wait a minute. So you're gonna time me
every time I yawn?

234
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,654
That's absurd. Really?

235
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,900
Hey, look, monkey knows
how to use a stopwatch, everybody.

236
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:49,201
He's ti...

237
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:56,951
Personal conversation...
17 seconds.

238
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,456
There is no way that that was...

239
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:02,256
One second.

240
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,504
Holly-lujah.

241
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:11,382
It's a miracle.
You're at your desk.

242
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,379
It's mike-raculous.

243
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:15,970
Reaching!

244
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,215
You'll get there.

245
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,493
Anyway,
I was giving it some thought,

246
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,253
and there's no reason

247
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,305
that two attractive,
good-looking...

248
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,748
intelligent, funny,

249
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:29,709
attractive people can't,

250
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,031
you know, just sit down
and work this whole Meredith thing out.

251
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,390
Sounds good.

252
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:35,614
Good.

253
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,521
Would you care
to bang it out over lunch?

254
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,536
I already bought this.

255
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:43,597
Your food...

256
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,870
is no good here, my lady.

257
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,383
Sorry.

258
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,963
You know what? Let's go out,

259
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:53,049
Dunder Mifflin's treat.

260
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:58,139
Actually, you're not a client, so...

261
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,805
we'll just split it?

262
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,380
Ethical.

263
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,691
- So I've gone over corporate policy.
- What do you think?

264
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:11,017
What do you think of this place?

265
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:12,756
- It's very nice.
- Isn't it?

266
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,986
It's kind of business/romantic.

267
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:17,989
So you're from Des Moines?

268
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,831
That sounds so...

269
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:20,884
warm.

270
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:22,793
In summer.

271
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,498
Here too. You know
what my favorite season is?

272
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,784
Maybe we should talk
about Meredith first.

273
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,814
Yes. Get the boring stuff
out of the way.

274
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:33,898
Autumn was what I was gonna say.
When the leaves change.

275
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:38,176
It's just... I think it's the most
contemplative of seasons.

276
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,978
OK, so I've gone over this,
and I've thought about it,

277
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:45,067
and I just don't think
there's any way I can write a report

278
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:47,672
that doesn't end
with her being terminated.

279
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:50,180
Terminator.

280
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,650
I'm from the future.

281
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:57,780
Hey, Andy.

282
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:01,908
By any chance, did you see
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i> last night?

283
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:04,400
No, I did not.
Is that any good?

284
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,558
Actually not. It is really so-so.

285
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,396
I mean, I like
all the crazy monsters and stuff,

286
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,141
you know, like Klingons
and Wookies and...

287
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,240
all that, but...

288
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,576
Sorry, was there something
you wanted to add, Dwight?

289
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:25,577
Is that anything like
the original <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>?

290
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:26,975
You know, it's weird.

291
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,581
It's practically
a shot-for-shot remake.

292
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,867
Really?

293
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,036
That's cool.

294
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,587
Story's kind of bland.

295
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,875
It's about this guy
named Dumbledore Calrissian,

296
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:41,128
Who needs to return the ring
back to Mordor.

297
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:42,498
It's really...

298
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,285
That doesn't sound right.

299
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,599
I just don't want my employees

300
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:51,406
thinking that their jobs
depend on performance.

301
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,063
I mean...

302
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:56,634
What sort of place is that
to call home?

303
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:58,830
And Meredith needs this job.

304
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,717
This is her main source of money.

305
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,978
That's very sweet,
but we have to follow the protocol.

306
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:05,431
Those are the rules.

307
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,183
New idea. We don't report at all.
We just punish her.

308
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:09,601
We punish her?

309
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,875
Tell her, can't have sex
for 6 months.

310
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,272
I don't think
we could enforce that.

311
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:16,487
I don't know. I saw this thing...

312
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,027
- Like a belt with a key.
- A chastity belt.

313
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,891
Yeah, it's more of a...

314
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:24,119
Underwear garment
that has little spikes,

315
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,951
like, made of... I think sometimes
they're made of metal.

316
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:29,007
You know what I'm talking about.

317
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,552
You unlock a little door that...

318
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,135
Down...

319
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,248
Where you... Where you put...

320
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:38,172
Where you put the...

321
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:46,696
He has not stopped working

322
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,723
for a second.

323
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,242
At 12:45, he sneezed

324
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,355
while keeping his eyes open,

325
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,940
which I always thought
was impossible.

326
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,037
At 1:32, he peed,

327
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,739
and I know that because he did it

328
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,041
in an open soda bottle
under the desk

329
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,210
while filling out expense reports.

330
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,655
And on the flip side,
I've been so busy watching him

331
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,738
that I haven't even started work.

332
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,886
It's exhausting
being this vigilant.

333
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,959
I'll probably have
to go home early today.

334
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,427
I am just saying

335
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:21,548
that I don't think that
you understand what I am saying.

336
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:25,470
No, you are saying that
we should sweep it under the carpet,

337
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,067
accept the discount on supplies,
not fire Meredith,

338
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,831
and pretend like the whole thing
never happened.

339
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,024
Yes.

340
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,789
- What am I saying?
- Well...

341
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,648
Busted. I don't...

342
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,977
I'm saying that her behavior
is unethical and a little icky,

343
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,491
and I don't think I want to work
in an environment

344
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,656
where that sort of conduct
is tolerated.

345
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,161
You have to tolerate a lot
when you're part of a family.

346
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,953
It's not a family.
It's a workplace.

347
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:08,073
I will be honest with you,
that car ride

348
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:09,742
did not go well.

349
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,495
And that was not my fault.

350
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:14,797
The only reason I am standing
out here right now

351
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:18,432
is because I don't want to take
the elevator with her.

352
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,756
And I am holding on
to her leftovers.

353
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,987
19 minutes and 48 seconds.

354
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,252
What were we doing
for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?

355
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,093
None of your business.

356
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,129
So I guess I can assume that was...

357
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,325
personal.

358
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:55,217
Fine.

359
00:16:56,592 --> 00:17:00,365
So maybe you're not
completely ethical after all.

360
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,276
Yes...

361
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,493
Maybe I'm not.

362
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:25,515
It's been a little tense.

363
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,711
People are suspicious of me,

364
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,345
and my best friend in the office
won't even talk to me.

365
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,444
Turns out being the morality police
does not make you popular.

366
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:39,381
I should know, because in middle school,
I was the hall monitor,

367
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:42,251
and the kids used to stuff
egg salad in my locker.

368
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,506
I was just hoping
middle school was over.

369
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:54,242
Kendall from corporate H.R. is on line 1
and Holly's on her way too.

370
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:56,870
What's the only thing worse
than one H.R. Rep?

371
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,621
Two H.R. Reps.

372
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,832
You get me.

373
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,458
Can I sit?

374
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,236
I don't know. Can you?

375
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:08,104
Kendall, my main man.

376
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:10,104
<i>Listen, Holly, Michael,</i>

377
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:13,212
<i>I just got the report that your branch
submitted, and there's a lot of stuff</i>

378
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:15,284
<i>about a relationship
Meredith is having...</i>

379
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,453
Yes, that came out
during the ethics seminar.

380
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:21,199
And let the record show that it was
during the immunity part of the seminar.

381
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,188
<i>I'm not sure these circumstances
warrant any action.</i>

382
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:26,495
I think it's pretty clear
it was unethical.

383
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:29,014
<i>From what I can gather,
it seems like a gray area.</i>

384
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:31,352
<i>Look, to be honest,
the company's getting a discount</i>

385
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:33,169
<i>at a tough time in our balance sheet,</i>

386
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:35,401
<i>I don't know that the right
thing to do for the company</i>

387
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,139
<i>is to turn our noses up at that.</i>

388
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,643
Kendall, I understand that the discount
is good for the company,

389
00:18:40,763 --> 00:18:43,833
but I'm just not happy
about the way we're getting it.

390
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:47,242
<i>I thought it was
clear with you, Holly.</i>

391
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:49,785
<i>Your task was to get signatures
from the employees</i>

392
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,793
<i>showing that
they completed the training.</i>

393
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:52,977
I understand...

394
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:55,178
<i>Cause every other branch
has managed to get those.</i>

395
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:58,181
<i>If it's not something you can handle,
then that's a different discussion.</i>

396
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:00,348
- No, I can do it.
- <i>Good.</i>

397
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:10,285
How do you tell somebody
that you care about deeply,

398
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,429
"I told you so"?

399
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,351
Gently? With a rose?

400
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:18,981
In a funny way,

401
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,392
like it's a hilarious joke?

402
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,960
Or do you just let it go

403
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:29,244
because saying it
would just make things worse?

404
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,853
Probably the funny way.

405
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,094
Can I have everyone's attention?

406
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:40,886
Excuse me! May I have
everyone's attention, please?

407
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,392
We need to finish
the ethics seminar.

408
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:45,495
- No way, lady.
- It's a trap.

409
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,801
Everyone, please,
I just need your signatures

410
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,817
to show corporate
I gave you the training.

411
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:52,132
- Don't sign anything.
- OK, everybody listen up.

412
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:54,465
If you are not in that
conference room in 2 minutes,

413
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:55,927
I'm going to kill you.

414
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:58,992
It's a quarter to 5:00,
and I have started to gather my things.

415
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:02,705
Get in there right now,
or I'm gonna lose it!

416
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:17,284
- Am I getting fired?
- Now is really not the time, Meredith.

417
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,016
In this next section,
we examine the difference

418
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,712
between sick days
and personal days.

419
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,714
Sick days are only to be used

420
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,646
when an illness precludes you
from doing your job

421
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,253
or can spread to your coworkers.

422
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,861
Personal days, on the other hand,
are much more flexible.

423
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:39,458
Thank you, Meredith.
This was delicious.

424
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:41,133
Where's the steak sauce?

425
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,422
I think we're out.

426
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,168
I got some in my minivan somewhere.

427
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:48,917
Wait a second.

428
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:50,711
How does the steak factor in again?

429
00:20:50,871 --> 00:20:53,088
I think she got it as a tip,

430
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,507
but I don't know
why she didn't just take cash.

431
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:58,227
I don't care what she's doing.
I hope she just keeps doing it.

432
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:00,848
Amen, just keep the ribs coming.
