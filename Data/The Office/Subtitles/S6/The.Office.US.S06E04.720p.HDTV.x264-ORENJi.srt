1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,638
I'm sorry, you probably noticed

2
00:00:01,763 --> 00:00:04,057
my stomach's
a little more sensitive lately,

3
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:07,089
so if you wouldn't mind
wearing a little less perfume...

4
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:11,302
And if your lunch is especially pungent,
maybe have it in the break room.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,928
We would really appreciate it.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,890
Pam is constantly throwing up
because of the pregnancy.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,517
If she eats something
the fetus doesn't like,

8
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:19,765
she is screwed.

9
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:22,672
It's amazing.
A three-ounce fetus

10
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,347
is calling the shots.

11
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,351
It's so badass.

12
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,576
If you could switch to a different soap
just for a month or two...

13
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,325
yours is kind of perfumey.

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,824
This is getting ridiculous.

15
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:36,827
Gee, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:40,790
I guess I missed the meeting
where we voted for you to get pregnant.

17
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:45,961
I reserve the right to peel
my hardboiled eggs at my desk.

18
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:48,844
All morning I look forward
to my afternoon cigars,

19
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,169
and I am not stopping for anybody.

20
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:53,511
I don't think
I'm asking for too much.

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,929
I guess it's just the end
of courtesy in the workplace.

22
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,681
Watching people get sick

23
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:19,756
always makes me sick.
And...

24
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:23,853
Frankly,
so does talking about it, so...

What do you think?

00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,424
- Spent all morning doing it.
- It is really special.

35
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:16,176
But aren't you supposed
to do that to our...

36
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,551
No, it's great.

37
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,222
It's just
a really important day for me.

38
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:22,229
Congrats.

39
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:27,102
Dunder Mifflin Scranton
will be closed today and Friday

40
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,024
for a company wedding
in Niagara Falls,

41
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,334
so please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

42
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:34,689
Have a great day.

43
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:38,444
Believe it or not, Kevin,
firecrackers are in the "don't" column.

44
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,979
So you're gonna provide them, then?

45
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:42,779
This is a firecracker-free wedding.

46
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,961
- What the hell?
- You've got to be kidding me.

47
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:48,101
These things are important to remember,
but the most important thing

48
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,711
is that no one say anything
about my pregnancy at the wedding.

49
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,131
Absolutely, because not everyone knows,
and some people might be offended.

50
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,425
Decent people everywhere
will get offended.

51
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:58,217
We're thinking of my grandmother,

52
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:00,554
who we haven't told,
and who is very old-fashioned.

53
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,623
You're lucky
to have a grandmother.

54
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,725
Some of us have to be
our own grandmother.

55
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,937
You know, Angela,
you don't have to come to the wedding.

56
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,661
- Really, Pam?
- Yes, she does.

57
00:03:09,786 --> 00:03:11,939
We're all gonna go,
and we're gonna have a good time.

58
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,264
He pinched me.

59
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,237
Next time we're all in this room,
Jim and I will be married.

60
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,446
We'll see.

61
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:18,922
Thank you, Dwight.

62
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,247
See you later.

63
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:21,909
Hey, and don't

64
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:24,729
embarrass me
when we go to Niagara.

65
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:28,233
What happens in Niagara
stays in Niagara.

66
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:31,753
Don't, don't, don't.

67
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,796
You stole my joke.
Don't steal my joke.

68
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,492
- No, I didn't steal your joke.
- Yes, I said that yesterday.

69
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,102
You can say that about anything.

70
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:41,127
What happens in accounting
stays in accounting.

71
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,499
Please, please.
Dwight, that's my joke.

72
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,558
It's so easy.

73
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,976
That's what I'm saying.

74
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,887
This is what I am talking about.
When we leave here

75
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,382
and go up to Niagara Falls,

76
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:55,442
we are representing Dunder Mifflin,
everyone.

77
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,838
This is a very important wedding
for this branch.

78
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,681
The most important
until I get married,

79
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,786
so I want you all
on your best behavior.

80
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,173
Or so help me, God!

81
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,869
So I will see you up there

82
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,989
in "Viagra" Falls.

83
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:15,460
Pam and Jim's wedding will be
the single best pickup destination

84
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:18,299
in the history of the universe.

85
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,744
I stole the guest list
from Jim's desk,

86
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:24,722
and I search-engined every female
on both sides of the family.

87
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,176
Get out of here.

88
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:27,517
My God.

89
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,819
For instance, Pam's cousin

90
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:32,479
Jocelyn Webster.

91
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:33,897
There's a name.

92
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,528
Two years ago, she was selling

93
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,442
a mountain bike.

94
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,204
Tell me about Jocelyn.

95
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:41,850
What's she like?

96
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,531
She's really into mountain biking,
but not so much lately.

97
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,372
She had
a couple hundred dollars to spend.

98
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,790
I mean, if she was able
to sell her bike.

99
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:56,211
Is that all you have on her?

100
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,006
If this in fact her,
because it's a very common name.

101
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,132
You're an idiot.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,906
People don't think of me

103
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,831
as one of the sharper dressers
in the office,

104
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,196
but I'm going to turn that around
at this wedding.

105
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,483
I thought,

106
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,340
"how can I take it
to the next level?"

107
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:22,727
The hair.

108
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,506
It's the hair.

109
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,089
I'm going.

110
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,789
God.

111
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,678
Did one of you want to sit up front
so I have someone to talk to?

112
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,279
It's, like, a five-hour drive...

113
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,712
Ish. You know.

114
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,049
This is so much cooler.

115
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,701
We feel like we're in a limo
and you're our driver.

116
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,846
That wouldn't be fair
to leave Kelly alone in back.

117
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,282
Not only is Erin
really sweet and cute...

118
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,108
she smells like my mom.

119
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,577
My aunt told me something neat.

120
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:03,312
She said everything with the wedding
goes by so fast,

121
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:06,183
we should try to take
mental pictures of the high points.

122
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,204
That's cool.

123
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:12,191
You blinked.

124
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,251
Damn it.
Now that's in my brain forever.

125
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,626
What a lousy picture.

126
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,612
Should have hired a professional
to take the mental pictures.

127
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,167
- I was asleep.
- What? No way.

128
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,242
Those glasses are super dark.

129
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,199
All right.
We need some tunes, I think.

130
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:38,668
I made you a CD.

131
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,499
You did?
That was nice of you.

132
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:43,393
This is to play when you bring
a woman back to your hotel room.

133
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:46,249
Very thoughtful.
A little mix to set the mood.

134
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,101
Delightful. Pop that in.

135
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,742
You're gonna like this.

136
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,103
<i>Hello.
My name is Dwight Schrute.</i>

137
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:53,886
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

138
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:56,611
<i>you're a lucky woman
Michael has seduced.</i>

139
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:58,822
<i>To be in your shoes.</i>

140
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,323
<i>"What's next?"
you're probably wondering.</i>

141
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:04,259
<i>Don't be scared
of your night in heaven.</i>

142
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,800
Seriously? You want me to play that
for a woman coming to my room?

143
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,301
It's practical.

144
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:13,094
That's not how it works.

145
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:16,434
Niagara Falls used to be,
like, a spiritual experience to people.

146
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,911
They stayed in tents,
and it blew their minds.

147
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,386
But it's really kitschy now,
which is a lot of fun.

148
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,363
Halpert.

149
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,027
- Halpert.
- And Beesly.

150
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:30,491
Tonight we're in two separate rooms,
and tomorrow is the honeymoon suite.

151
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,151
- Great.
- I know, we're pretty excited too.

152
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,995
Can we take a look at the suite now?

153
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm sorry.
Somebody just checked in.

154
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,792
Is there another wedding
at the hotel this weekend?

155
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,086
Just an individual.
That man there.

156
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,370
I got the room
the night before you guys.

157
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:47,095
I'll break in the bed.

158
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:51,555
I don't like that.

159
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm gonna need
the name of the housekeeper

160
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,225
responsible
for changing the sheets, please.

161
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:01,102
- Reservation for Michael Scott.
- One moment while I check.

162
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,385
Their proximity to the Falls
makes everything smell like a basement.

163
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,317
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not seeing you in here.

164
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:10,551
- When did you make your reservation?
- I don't have a reservation,

165
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:13,976
but I want a room
in the Beesly-Halpert block of rooms.

166
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,298
Unfortunately, sir,
the block only applies to the rate.

167
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,054
I'm afraid we're all sold out.

168
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,796
I have a reservation.

169
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,381
Confirmation number:

170
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:24,934
Romeo, Tango,

171
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,685
G, 7, 7,

172
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,756
4, 5.

173
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,510
Yes. Schrute.

174
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,719
And I had spoken to Theresa
about a room with two safes.

175
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:34,636
Sure. No problem.

176
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:37,224
There's your key, Mr. Schrute.
Thank you.

177
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,134
- I need to stay in your room.
- What if I meet someone?

178
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,981
I'm staying in...
Come on, I would do the same for you.

179
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,466
You would? Really?

180
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,859
Let's just... Go.

181
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,160
Wait a second.

182
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,685
This must be some kind of mistake.

183
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,781
This reservation
is under an M. Scott.

184
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,450
- This must be yours.
- Thank God.

185
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,744
Now that I don't have a room,
can I stay with you?

186
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,860
You know what?
I would say yes,

187
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:05,711
but you can't,
and I'll tell you why.

188
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,380
If I have a woman up there

189
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:10,382
and things are getting amorous,
she's gonna get turned off

190
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,770
if she looks in the bathroom
and she sees you brushing your teeth

191
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:15,745
with butter and clay, okay?

192
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,861
That was a test, and you have failed,
for this is my room.

193
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,728
- You'd not share it.
- I don't have a room?

194
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,146
No, you do not.

195
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,366
You must pass
the dungeon wisdom test.

196
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:28,498
It worked.

197
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:31,123
When Mary was denied
a room at the inn,

198
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,258
Jesus was born.

199
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,909
When Michael was denied
a room at the inn,

200
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:41,114
we don't know what happens,
because that story hasn't been told yet.

201
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,728
Mr. And Mrs. Stanley Hudson.

202
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:49,713
Favor.
Could I stay in your room tonight?

203
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,090
Are you out of your mind?
I brought Cynthia with me.

204
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,980
Not in the same bed.
In the other bed.

205
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:55,886
I got one queen-size bed.

206
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:58,140
You are kidding me.

207
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,983
A queen-size bed is five-feet wide.
I am not five-feet wide, Michael.

208
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:05,292
I'm not a physics major, Stanley.
I'm just saying be careful.

209
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:08,467
Hey, guys.
Could I stay in your room tonight?

210
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,150
- Gross.
- Blow my brains out.

211
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,526
That's rude.

212
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,905
I have an extra twin bed,
if you want.

213
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,658
You are going to be sleeping by yourself
for the rest of your life,

214
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,534
so you should just get used to it.

215
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,834
So...

216
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,476
which one is Pam's grandma?

217
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,884
Meemaw?
She's the one in the teal suit.

218
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,597
She's the only 80-year-old
with no smile wrinkles.

219
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,199
Dad, remember.
No mention of the baby, right?

220
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,104
She's very conservative.

221
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:37,629
So mum's the word.

222
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,080
- Dad, this is Michael Scott.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

223
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,957
- Nice to meet you.
- Who's doing a toast?

224
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:45,749
I would like to go third,
sort of back clean up.

225
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,309
I thought we discussed

226
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:49,456
that we'd rather you not speak,
like, at all,

227
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,733
because
it's just gonna be blood relatives.

228
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,564
That is seriously going to impede

229
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:56,363
my ability to hook up
with your female relatives.

230
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,991
Pretty sure everybody heard that.

231
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,616
Didn't move my lips.

232
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,245
{\BEESLY - HALPRET
WEDDING REHEARSAL DINNER}

233
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:05,081
Hey, meemaw.

234
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,334
I wasn't sure
about your branch of the family.

235
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,739
After I heard
about your parents divorce.

236
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,970
But you and Jim are...

237
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:17,268
just perfect.

238
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,886
God bless you.

239
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,336
But nobody's perfect.

240
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,813
I wouldn't care to live
if I thought that.

241
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,797
- Mr. Beesly, how are you?
- I'd like you to meet Kristy Kelly.

242
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:35,410
This your niece?

243
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,823
She's my girlfriend.

244
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,491
Can you make room at that table?

245
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:44,883
From quarter three to quarter four,
up 17%.

246
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,493
While his sales, down 2%.

247
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,082
It's in the report.

248
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,044
Why they make the bad man your boss
if you're so much smarter?

249
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,342
Excellent question.

250
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,963
Because while I was busy

251
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,912
trying to improve the company
and make it a success,

252
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:59,454
Jim...

253
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:00,635
the bad man

254
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,221
was busy
kissing the boss man's butt.

255
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,305
That's right. It is ew.

256
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,229
It's very ew.

257
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,879
Oscar, Kevin,
this is my sister, Penny.

258
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,314
She's also my maid of honor.

259
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,983
Pleased to meet you.

260
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,526
I'm sorry. It's Kevin?
I thought it was Gill.

261
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:20,348
She thought I was your boyfriend.

262
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,161
You thought I was dating this?

263
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,202
What is wrong with you?

264
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,724
Oscar, it was an honest mistake.

265
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:28,983
Him?

266
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:32,171
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.

267
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,630
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,462
I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.

269
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,981
Nice to meet you.

270
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,711
- Owe me an apology.
- I'm so sorry.

271
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,093
Are you seeing anyone?

272
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,336
She has a boyfriend.
He's out of town.

273
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:46,681
I was the youngest VP
in company history.

274
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,022
More recently,
he worked in a bowling alley.

275
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:52,098
Tell 'em
one of your funny bowling alley stories.

276
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,535
How did Meredith get put
at the young people's table?

277
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,122
She probably switched cards
with someone.

278
00:12:58,437 --> 00:12:59,987
Like I did with Erin.

279
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:01,997
What?

280
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:04,544
That's...

281
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,168
Jim and Pam,

282
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:10,141
I can't tell you
how happy I am to be here.

283
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,331
Head table.

284
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
Where I belong.

285
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,869
- It's just for family.
- I know.

286
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,171
Who's that one?

287
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,510
Isabel Poreba.
I got stuff on her.

288
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,530
In 1996,

289
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,257
her 10th grade volleyball team
went 10 and 2.

290
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,518
What am I supposed to do with that?

291
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:34,771
That's a very good record.

292
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,489
Right, so I'll be like,
"you're so sweet and so kind."

293
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,638
- I'll do the face like...
- Like, "what?"

294
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:42,304
And then we'll just give 'em
a little punch to the back.

295
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,781
A noogie.
You know what? Never to married...

296
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:45,839
for a noogie.

297
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:49,644
They have hilarious material,
and they are going to deliver it wrong.

298
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,333
I would kill with the brother stuff.
It should be me...

299
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,358
up there.

300
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,559
Should be me and Pete.
Not Pete and Tom.

301
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,546
You've got the greatest smile,

302
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,852
- and your body is really fine.
- Smoking.

303
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,219
Hoping it'll make our wives
kick it up a notch.

304
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,971
A little mo' cardio.

305
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:10,909
That's not appropriate.

306
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:14,604
Hello. Hi, everybody.

307
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,022
I promise I wasn't gonna make a toast,
and I'm not going to.

308
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,316
Just going to do
a little freestanding comedy,

309
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,490
and if at the end, everybody wants
to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim,

310
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:23,914
then so be it.

311
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,918
What is the deal with the Smart car?

312
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,643
How smart is that?
Those things are tiny.

313
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:33,413
Can you even drive them in traffic?

314
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,917
"I'm so smart.
E equals MC...

315
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,460
squared. I drive a Smart car."

316
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,246
That's not smart in my book.

317
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:42,221
The real smart car is Kitt.

318
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,007
From <i>Knight Rider</i>.

319
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,760
That's a car that can talk.
Can a Smart car talk?

320
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,179
That's not smart.

321
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:51,401
And also <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>.

322
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,903
- Very smart.
- And...

323
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,374
Everybody can laugh.

324
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,873
It doesn't have
to just be the idiots.

325
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,234
Everybody can laugh.

326
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,360
Go ahead.

327
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:02,323
All right.
Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.

328
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,253
Douche.

329
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:04,877
Thanks, Pete. Really nice.

330
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:08,865
I just want to say how happy we are
that all of you are here tonight,

331
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,132
and I want to especially thank
those who have traveled from far away

332
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:14,107
to be here with us tonight,

333
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,693
especially the Florida cousins,

334
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,875
who obviously can't take a hint.

335
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,115
Four years ago, I was...

336
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,277
just a guy who had a crush on a girl

337
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:25,711
who had a boyfriend.

338
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:26,836
And...

339
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,164
I had to do the hardest thing
that I've ever had to do,

340
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,572
which was just to...

341
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,503
wait.

342
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,161
Don't get me wrong.
I flirted with her.

343
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:38,853
Pam, I can now admit
that I do know how to make a photocopy.

344
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,014
Didn't need your help
that many times.

345
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,107
And do you remember
how long it took you

346
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,803
- to teach me how to drive stick?
- Like, a year.

347
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:50,228
I've been driving stick
since high school, so...

348
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,823
For a really long time,
that's all I had.

349
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:57,531
Little moments
with a girl who saw me as a friend.

350
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:01,342
And a lot of people told me
I was crazy to wait this long

351
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,331
for a date
with a girl who I worked with,

352
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,756
but I think even then I knew that...

353
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:08,758
I was waiting for my wife.

354
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,472
I would like to propose a toast.

355
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,302
If you'd all raise your glasses...

356
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,882
Not Pam, for obvious reasons,

357
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,912
but everyone else, if you would...

358
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,287
What's obvious?

359
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,189
Why can't Pam drink?

360
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,567
Pam can't drink?
I didn't... I shouldn't have said that.

361
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:29,029
I don't know why I did.
She can do whatever she wants.

362
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,405
Though she shouldn't.

363
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,173
She shouldn't,
because she's an alcoholic.

364
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:34,784
Pam is an alcoholic.

365
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:36,578
That's not true.

366
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,646
What we wanted...

367
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,917
The real reason is that...

368
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:47,331
That Pam's pregnant.

369
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,260
What I think Jim

370
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,278
is trying to say is that...

371
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,265
they had an accident.

372
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:58,926
And you know what?

373
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,267
These two people,
they're living together.

374
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:05,081
They are having
lots of consensual sex.

375
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,485
- They were living together?
- Yes, they were living...

376
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,176
And you know what? You can't...

377
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:14,824
expect them
to be careful every time,

378
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:17,911
because, frankly,
it's just a different sensation.

379
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,206
When you come... Am I wrong?
They say it's not different,

380
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,166
but it's a different sensation...

381
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,835
- Don't. Please.
- When you use something

382
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,170
to block...

383
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:30,065
I think everybody knows
what I am talking about.

384
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,258
It's not necessarily different
for the woman,

385
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,427
but it is different...

386
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,844
My point is,
I said what I wanted to say,

387
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,228
and, meemaw,
I hope you heard every word.

388
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:49,824
To waiting.

389
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,701
I should have known.

390
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,676
The hotel's television set
had a movie on

391
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,540
called <i>Bruno</i> last night.

392
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,292
The remote control
had so darn many buttons on it,

393
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:07,653
I couldn't turn it off.

394
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:10,755
So I had to just sit there
while it happened to me.

395
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:11,973
I wondered,

396
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,550
"how could they pick such a hotel?"

397
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,722
Now I know.

398
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,127
Think it was a little touch and go,
but we saved it, I believe.

399
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,054
I can't believe it was me.

400
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:30,900
I can't believe it was you, either.

401
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,821
I actually think
it takes a lot of pressure off of me.

402
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,657
Is there something about being a manager
that makes you say stupid things?

403
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,356
I haven't found that to be the case.

404
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,870
- Smooth guys.
- I'm so sorry.

405
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,871
Can you believe it?
He screwed up, not me.

406
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,206
Meemaw's not coming to the wedding.
She's leaving.

407
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,848
Are you serious?

408
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:48,570
There's gonna be a free room?

409
00:18:58,356 --> 00:18:59,387
It's Michael.

410
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:03,265
You're that foul man
that kept talking about intercourse.

411
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,206
One and the same. May I?

412
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:09,397
I'm actually great with old women.

413
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,636
In fact, for the longest time,
my best friend was my grandmother.

414
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,875
And then she met Harriet,

415
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:19,137
and now she thinks
she's better than everybody.

416
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,659
I want to go to bed,

417
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:22,812
but I can't.

418
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,662
I can't turn that television off.

419
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,168
Hook you up there.

420
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:35,048
- You're welcome.
- It was that horrible Charlie Rose.

421
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:37,055
Isn't he terrible?

422
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
May I?

423
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,292
Here's the thing.

424
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,741
I think you just need to chill out

425
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,228
about this whole
Pam getting pregnant thing.

426
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,315
It's not 1890 anymore.
It's modern day.

427
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,108
And women have sex before marriage.

428
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,110
And I think
we need to celebrate that.

429
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,046
And I know in your day

430
00:19:58,171 --> 00:19:59,823
she would be considered a whore,

431
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,533
but now

432
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,389
women go out

433
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:06,746
and they have sex and they get wild
and they take their tops off

434
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,651
and they have
pictures taken of them.

435
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,897
We need to encourage that.
That's part of life.

436
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,504
People are like cats and dogs
these days.

437
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,576
Exactly.

438
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:17,972
This used to be
such a great country.

439
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,051
- I know.
- I don't know what happened.

440
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:22,726
They're gonna name
the baby after you, you know?

441
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:25,890
- They're gonna call it meemaw.
- You mean Sylvia.

442
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,599
And if it's a boy,
they will call it Sylvio.

443
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,666
Par-tay. Room 639.

444
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,943
Chicks are gonna be off the hook.

445
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:39,709
Guys too, Oscar.
Like Calvin Klein models.

446
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,184
That sounds epic.

447
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:43,032
Can we bring anything?

448
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,107
Nothing.

449
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:47,537
Except for $40 for beer
and any hot chicks you know.

450
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,815
'Cause that would help me deliver
on some promises I made.

451
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,580
No one from the office has been
to a real Bernard

452
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:56,755
throw-down.

453
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,422
If I was a girl,
I would seriously reconsider coming.

454
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:03,177
But don't tell them that I said that,
'cause I want them there.

455
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,395
And where do you think you're going?

456
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,439
I was gonna go down
to the hotel bar.

457
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:18,067
Why don't I just save you some time
and kick you in the stomach instead?

458
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,861
I wanted to get out of my room
for a little while.

459
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,823
I'll go with you.
Come on.

460
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,617
Never mind.

461
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:28,908
Are you sure? Could be fun.

462
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:31,133
What are you wearing?

463
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,124
Come on.
It's a casual, social outfit.

464
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,454
Looks
like you're going to a fish fry.

465
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,385
They're howling at the moon.
It's suggestive to women.

466
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,880
Because of howling during sex.

467
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,803
That's not appropriate.

468
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,595
Uncool, Dwight.

469
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,385
Come on. Let's go.

470
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,730
- It's good.
- It's not a good idea.

471
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:57,794
There's no such thing
as a good hairpiece.

472
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,206
But that's easy enough for you
to say, Oscar.

473
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:01,485
You've that thick,

474
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,355
beautiful Chicano hair.

475
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:05,692
So nice.

476
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:09,757
I'm just worried about the farm.

477
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:12,060
Mose hates to geld the horses
by himself.

478
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,836
Shut up about the farm.

479
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:15,758
It's not relatable.
Nobody owns a farm.

480
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:18,044
Wait,
you're worried about your horses?

481
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,255
That's cool.

482
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:21,672
How many horses do you have?

483
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,444
Nine and three quarters.

484
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,676
I invented a device
called "Burger on the go".

485
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,569
It allows you to obtain
six regular-sized hamburgers,

486
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:30,889
or 12 sliders,

487
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:32,114
from a horse

488
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,829
without killing the animal.

489
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,687
George Foreman
is still considering it.

490
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,759
Sharper Image is still considering it,
Skymall's still considering it,

491
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:41,079
Hammacher Schlemmer's
still considering it.

492
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,347
Sears said no.

493
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
<i>Toy Story</i>,

494
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:54,738
<i>Finding Nemo</i>, <i>Up</i>,

495
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:58,015
I balled the entire time.
I can not watch Pixar.

496
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,505
- Drop this one. Abort.
- Why?

497
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:02,328
I found twins.

498
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:05,436
Twins.

499
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,999
I'm sorry. You understand.

500
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,268
Nice to meet you.

501
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,474
Aren't they magnificent?

502
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,936
They're men, Dwight.

503
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:19,694
I love finding a good set of twins.

504
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,849
Something's wrong with you.

505
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:28,623
Nice moves!

506
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,035
You call that a robot?

507
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:36,705
Try being more robotic, okay?
Like this.

508
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,086
Lame.
What else you got, Andy?

509
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,776
How about a little bit of this?

510
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:48,501
What else you got?

511
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,532
What else you got?

512
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:53,389
Did someone change my name
to Baskin Robbins?

513
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,809
Because I feel like a banana split.

514
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:04,886
What else you got?

515
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:11,612
It's gonna be fine.
Pam's here.

516
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,620
I was dancing and I did a split,

517
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:22,042
and I landed
on my car keys in my pocket.

518
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:23,549
What?

519
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,548
I tore my scrotum.
I need you to take me to the hospital.

520
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,926
Andy,
I'm getting married in eight hours.

521
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,471
Everyone else is too drunk.

522
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,600
Just don't let me die here.

523
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:38,437
Where are you?
Can you take Andy to the hospital?

524
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,012
- <i>What?</i>
- He tore his scrotum dancing.

525
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:43,773
- <i>What?</i>
- He is in my room, icing his balls.

526
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,836
- <i>What?</i>
- Please stop saying "What?"

527
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,366
- Can you take him?
- <i>I would so take him</i>

528
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:50,742
<i>in any other circumstance,
but I'm pretty certain</i>

529
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:52,156
<i>I'm completely wasted.</i>

530
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,000
Your brothers took you out drinking?

531
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,998
<i>Is that Pam?
Have her come out.</i>

532
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,385
<i>Have her come out!
It'll be like</i> Coyote Ugly.

533
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:01,624
That's Michael.
You're out with Michael?

534
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:02,844
<i>And Dwight.</i>

535
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:05,533
- <i>Pam, it just happened.</i>
- Fine.

536
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:06,629
I'll take him.

537
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,434
<i>I love you. I got to go.</i>

538
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,609
<i>I love you!</i>

539
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,248
- Are you pushing me off the phone?
- <i>No. Let's talk for a long time.</i>

540
00:25:13,373 --> 00:25:14,373
Good-bye.

541
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:17,777
It's after midnight.

542
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:20,061
You're married.

543
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,569
He's married!

544
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,515
That's not how that works.

545
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:27,664
- You'll not be able to talk back.
- You'll have Pam to answer to.

546
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:30,997
She'll be sitting at home saying:
"Jim, take the baby to the zoo,

547
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:33,608
"cause I want to sit at home
and eat bonbons...

548
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:36,622
"and clip my toenails."

549
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:39,703
"Why don't you braid my hair?

550
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:42,248
- "I want to watch TV."
- Now you sound like Kermit.

551
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:44,192
Are you sure this is the right way?

552
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,840
I, like you,
have never been here before.

553
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:53,294
At least slow down a little bit,
because every little bump in the road

554
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,869
is major pain on...

555
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:56,872
my scrotum.

556
00:25:56,997 --> 00:25:58,934
I'm not the one
who asked you to do a split

557
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,809
when you'd never done one before.

558
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,144
I was trying to liven things up.
I was kind of doing your job, so...

559
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:05,372
My job?

560
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,497
My job is to get married
in the morning.

561
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:08,685
That's my job.

562
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,695
It's also to make sure we have
a great time at your stupid wedding,

563
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:12,665
so...

564
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:36,866
Just spent the night with the bride
the night before the wedding.

565
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,328
She stepped on my hand
on her way to the bathroom.

566
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:44,183
Andy, did I dream
that you were crying through the night?

567
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:47,253
That was real.

568
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:57,882
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

569
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,226
Can I get a little privacy?

570
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:12,060
Good morning.
How can I help you?

571
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:14,997
I left
a pair of dress shoes in a bag

572
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:17,926
outside my door last night
to be cleaned and polished,

573
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:20,186
but they haven't been returned yet.

574
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:23,372
You must be Mr. Malone.
One moment please.

575
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,541
Sir, this is the man with the shoes.

576
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,517
Mr. Malone, your shoes are gone.

577
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,734
They were stolen?

578
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,134
No, destroyed.

579
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,593
When the bag was opened
by our shoeshine,

580
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:40,368
the smell overcame him.

581
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,493
I, too, smelled them
and made the choice

582
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:44,787
that they must be thrown away.

583
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,581
Incinerated, actually.

584
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,917
But that was my only pair of shoes.

585
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:51,752
It became a safety issue, sir.

586
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,118
Damn it.

587
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:59,319
I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast.

588
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:04,703
You have everything?

589
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:05,878
Cell phone?

590
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,065
Charger?

591
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:11,230
So you sure you don't want breakfast?
It's the most important meal of the day.

592
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,285
It really is.
I'm not hungry.

593
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,902
I ate a bunch of sunflower seeds
after you went to sleep.

594
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,486
And besides,

595
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,486
I don't want to take you away from Pam
on the morning of her wedding.

596
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,157
She needs you, Isabel.

597
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,369
That's really sweet, Dwight.
So I'll see you at the wedding?

598
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,639
You know it.

599
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,008
Get out of here.

600
00:28:31,404 --> 00:28:32,554
Good morning.

601
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:36,680
It's about damn time, I haven't gone
to the bathroom in a day and a half.

602
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:41,122
- This room is a pit.
- Really? Hadn't noticed.

603
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,053
Too busy knockin' boots.

604
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:49,810
How can you eat like that?

605
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:52,489
I'm ravenous
after a night of lovemaking.

606
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:53,397
You?

607
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:55,930
I'm hungry, but I'm not gonna make
a pig out of myself.

608
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:57,236
What was she like?

609
00:28:58,152 --> 00:29:00,362
She was cute.
You know, she was hot.

610
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,200
She was very hot.

611
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:04,658
She made love like a tiger.

612
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,785
Bride side or groom side?
Or townie?

613
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,579
She was from Europe.

614
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:11,415
No kidding.
Bet she had hairy armpits.

615
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:13,438
Isabel was nice, but...

616
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,503
I hope she doesn't think
this is going anywhere.

617
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:19,631
Wait a second.
You're not into her?

618
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,114
Are you kidding me?

619
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,718
She's Pam's best friend.

620
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:24,713
You guys could double date.

621
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:26,013
Swap maybe?

622
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,681
Put a gun in my mouth.

623
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:28,892
You're crazy.

624
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,100
She's a dental hygienist
from Carbondale,

625
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:33,979
and she makes love like one.
She's a bumpkin. Pass.

626
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,857
You know how hard it is?

627
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:40,240
You have to take X-Rays.
You have to scrape the plaque of teeth.

628
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:41,966
You have to tell kids when to spit

629
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:45,237
and make sure that they're not scared
when the dentist comes in.

630
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:47,201
Ask her out.

631
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:51,298
I already have
a European girlfriend.

632
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,850
Are you in a lot of pain?

633
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:12,851
'Cause of last night?
No way.

634
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:15,147
Reports have been exaggerated.

635
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,705
Weddings make me very emotional.

636
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:19,900
I have that side.

637
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:22,667
People say you cry all the time.

638
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:24,239
That's...

639
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,364
not...

640
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:28,200
Crotch injuries are the worst.

641
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:30,202
You don't need to tell me.

642
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:32,538
I wasn't telling you.

643
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,082
- There's still something there?
- Excuse me?

644
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,209
It didn't get torn off?

645
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:39,541
They didn't...

646
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,838
Nothing got torn off.
Who told you that?

647
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:44,952
I may have told some people that.

648
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:47,849
I'm nervous.
I'm about to get married.

649
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,601
If you want to sit on this...

650
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,705
I was thinking the wood might be
too hard on your damaged penis.

651
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:56,874
Make it softer.

652
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:01,767
It's my scrotum.

653
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:03,921
And it was.

654
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:06,202
Sure.

655
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:14,830
Here we go.
They asked for cash, but,

656
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,915
you know,
I give 'em cash every week.

657
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,340
So how much cash does a person need?

658
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:23,147
I have taken it upon myself
to do something a little more special.

659
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,529
I have painted a portrait
of the two of them

660
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:26,754
from memory.

661
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,618
And I have
another one of them in the nude.

662
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,850
But that one is for me.

663
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:43,480
I got them
a set of turtle-boiling pots,

664
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:44,572
shell hammer,

665
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:45,697
and bibs.

666
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:50,784
Is it zipping over your belly?
Don't squish the baby.

667
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,200
Thank you, weirdo.

668
00:31:52,372 --> 00:31:55,272
Everybody see
Kristy's stupid, blond extensions?

669
00:31:55,604 --> 00:31:58,081
It's like they were made
from a plastic broom.

670
00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:59,334
Here I come.

671
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:04,322
Darling, you look beautiful.

672
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:05,381
Thanks, mom.

673
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:07,716
I hope he deserves you.

674
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,841
He does.

675
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:11,727
Are you sure?
Remember, you don't have to do this.

676
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:12,852
You don't.

677
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:14,899
You're totally projecting
and being a drag.

678
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:16,291
Thank you, mom.

679
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:19,104
I'm gonna go outside
and talk to Dwight.

680
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,360
Great.
I'll see you in a second.

681
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:23,107
Wait, what?

682
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,845
- <i>Can you come here please?
</i>- Is this allowed?

683
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:39,657
<i>But I'm allowing it.
Just come here.</i>

684
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,668
That was an intelligent comment.

685
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:44,322
Hello, stranger.

686
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:45,647
How do I look?

687
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,049
Fine.

688
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,917
Isabel, nice to see you.

689
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:51,718
What do you want?

690
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:54,823
Nothing...

691
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,620
anymore.

692
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:58,141
So...

693
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:02,020
tell me again the difference
between Filene's and Filene's basement.

694
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,828
He's not sitting with me, either.

695
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:09,326
Where are you sitting?
You need a seat, buddy?

696
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,331
I'm standing.
I'm a bridesmaid.

697
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,953
I wish I was a bridesmaid.

698
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:16,202
Where am I gonna go?

699
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:23,250
You look...

700
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
Terrible.

701
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:25,822
So beautiful.

702
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:31,656
My veil tore.

703
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:37,516
I knew when we were getting married
and I'm five months pregnant

704
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,772
that I'm not gonna be able
to wear the dress that I always wanted,

705
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,267
or high heels.

706
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,647
You look just as I imagined you.

707
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:48,365
Pam, you're so pretty.

708
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,068
And who cares?

709
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,620
It's a stupid veil, right?

710
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:00,871
No, this is the one thing
I was supposed to be able to control

711
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,241
was this veil.

712
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,309
There.

713
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,876
Now we're even.

714
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:23,426
Everyone's driving me crazy.

715
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,731
I know way too much
about Andy's scrotum,

716
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:29,274
and my mom won't stop

717
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,903
freaking out
about my dad's new girlfriend.

718
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,781
This is supposed
to be our wedding day.

719
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,931
Why did we invite all these people?

720
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,225
I think Pam ran away
because she knew deep down

721
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,721
she wouldn't be a good wife.

722
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:03,733
What are you doing?

723
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:05,952
I'm trying to decide
if I have time to pee.

724
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:08,826
- How long do you take to pee?
- The peeing is fast, Oscar.

725
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:11,167
It's getting my tie back on.

726
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,323
Would you have a snack
in your purse?

727
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,899
You're a mom.
I just figured you might have...

728
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:25,163
Apricot.

729
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,874
Do you have any of the Very Berry
or Ocean Splash, or...

730
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:31,672
Were you saving it?

731
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,140
That's okay. I just...

732
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:36,994
I've had a very rough...

733
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:38,596
weekend.

734
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:39,826
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:44,808
Apricot. Made of real apes.

736
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,228
They canceled the wedding?

737
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:50,699
Relax.
You'll get your shot at Jim.

738
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:54,025
Those two treat the whole office
like a 1970's key party.

739
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,029
My weekend's bad so far.

740
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,633
I came here hoping to meet somebody.

741
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:03,201
You know, as you do,

742
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:04,471
at weddings.

743
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,590
End up...

744
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,975
going to sleep
by the vending machine.

745
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:12,027
- It was loud, but it was warm.
- That sounds awful.

746
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:12,961
And...

747
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:16,339
the love of my life
is dating somebody else.

748
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:17,975
It's just...

749
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:21,016
It is a terrible year for love.

750
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:23,471
I guess.

751
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:26,099
Thinking
about having my sperm frozen.

752
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,722
Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?

753
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,242
Heard you might have
a whoopee cushion on you.

754
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:36,109
Our sister's in the can, and we want
to get her when she comes back.

755
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:40,322
That sounds hilarious.
I do, actually.

756
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:42,925
There you go.
Use it in good health.

757
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,616
Wait a minute, what is the etiquette
on taking the gifts?

758
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:49,338
Can you only take your own back,

759
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:51,655
or is it
a whatever-you-can-carry type of thing?

760
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,588
Anyone have anything
they want to trade for a toaster?

761
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,808
Does it have slots for hot dogs?

762
00:36:58,047 --> 00:36:59,443
Who would want it?

763
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,657
Guys, maybe we should wait
a little more time

764
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:03,470
before we start grabbing boxes.

765
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,519
I like to lodge a complaint against Jim
for making us wait for over an hour.

766
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:23,156
Get in there.

767
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:26,146
I guess this wedding
is not gonna happen.

768
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,692
Wonder if this is it for them.

769
00:37:32,076 --> 00:37:33,041
What happened?

770
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,418
Where were you?
Do you know I've been waiting here?

771
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:38,204
We are here now, so let's go.

772
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:42,968
I have so much joy in my heart

773
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,009
right now.

774
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:45,305
How do I look?

775
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:47,161
- You look great.
- You look great.

776
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:51,393
Wear a tie much?

777
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,349
I begged them not to.

778
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:32,809
I know you specifically put this song
on your do not play list.

779
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,812
I did.

780
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:35,005
I'm sorry.

781
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:38,315
Go ahead.
I think it's your turn.

782
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,358
What happened?
You're okay with this?

783
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,609
I'm okay.

784
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:42,940
Okay then.

785
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,073
Did you see this?
It was on YouTube.

786
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,056
Saw it.

787
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:29,367
I bought those boat tickets
the day I saw that YouTube video.

788
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:32,946
I knew we'd need a backup plan.
The boat was actually plan C,

789
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,671
the church was plan B,

790
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:36,833
and plan A was...

791
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:39,675
marrying her a long, long time ago.

792
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,632
Pretty much the day I met her.

793
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,332
What an awesome party.

794
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:56,879
The best wedding I've ever been to.

795
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:58,574
I got six numbers.

796
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,270
One more would have been
a complete telephone number.

797
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:05,291
This was epic.

798
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,243
My Kleenex shoes

799
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:09,838
were a huge conversation piece,

800
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:11,192
but man,

801
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,668
my dogs are barking.

802
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:24,095
My feet were so sweaty,
I can't even feel the cold.

803
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:27,696
What a lovely hotel.
