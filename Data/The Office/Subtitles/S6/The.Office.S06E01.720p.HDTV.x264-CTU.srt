Parkour!

2
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:10,271
Parkour!

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,611
Parkour!

4
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:13,763
- Extreme!
- Parkour!

5
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,709
This is parkour.

6
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,168
Internet sensation of 2004.

7
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:21,115
And it was in one of the Bond films.
It's pretty impressive.

8
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:24,575
The goal is to get from point A
to point B as creatively as possible.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,206
So technically they are doing parkour
as long as point A is delusion

10
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:30,208
and point B is the hospital.

11
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,103
Parkour!

12
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:42,194
- Okay, here we go!
- Andy, leapfrog!

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,469
Do me! Do me!

14
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,651
Parkour!

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,210
-Get off! Get off!
-Okay

16
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:52,772
Jump over it.
Jump over the camera.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,380
Jump over the camera.

18
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:58,486
Okay, we all go together
or we go one at a time.

19
00:00:58,655 --> 00:00:59,705
Here it is.

20
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,651
Truck to refrigerators,

21
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:03,116
to dumpster,

22
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:07,307
360 spin onto the pallets,
backflip gainer into the trash can.

23
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:08,751
Yeah gainer!

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,320
- Hardcore parkour!
- Hardcore parkour!

25
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:14,040
- I'm right behind you, Andy! Come on!
- Let's do it!

26
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:19,491
Parkour.

27
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:24,762

36
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:44,529
Good.

37
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:47,767
Excellent.

38
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:49,954
Thank you.

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,041
Here you go.
Is there anything else I can do?

40
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:01,675
Yes ehm.

41
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,136
See those files
behind Kevin's desk?

42
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,733
Go put them all
in random order.

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,764
Then come back here
for your next assignment

44
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,347
concerning their order.

45
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:15,172
This is the last day
of our summer interns.

46
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,361
It's been nice.
We haven't had interns in a while

47
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:20,777
ever since Michael's
Monica Lewinsky incident.

48
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,989
He didn't do anything sexual.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,324
He just made far, far too many
Monica Lewinsky jokes.

50
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:29,661
It was just easier for corporate
to shutdown the program.

51
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,284
- Think she did him?
- There's something there.

52
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,850
I was
in the kitchen yesterday

53
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:38,106
and they were too happy
to be cleaning the freezer.

54
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,713
If they get married before I do,
I'm gonna kill myself.

55
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:43,131
- Who's getting married?
- Nobody.

56
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,718
Somebody doesn't tell me,
I'm gonna start screaming.

57
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:46,886
Eric and Megan.

58
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,517
Oh hey
I hired them.

59
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:50,153
Matchmaker.

60
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,644
This place is like Spaniard fly.

61
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,727
They're not getting married.
It's just talk.

62
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,479
Did everybody knows about this but me?

63
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,523
There's nothing to know.
It's gossip.

64
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,163
Okey.

65
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,962
We haven't told anyone
that I'm pregnant.

66
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:08,187
What with her being unmarried.
Knocked up by some guy.

67
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:10,681
The yakkity-yaks in this office
would have a field day.

68
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,731
We don't want them
at the wedding thinking

69
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:16,038
Jim's being marched down the aisle
by my dad with a shotgun.

70
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:19,307
Wait,
there's not gonna be a shotgun?

71
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,482
No shotgun?

72
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:24,278
- 'Cause that changes everything.
- Can't back out now, Halpert.

73
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:27,803
What are you gonna do about it?
There's no shotgun, so...

74
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,791
Free at last. Free at last.

75
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:33,547
No, keep it up.

76
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,724
You'll never guess what I know.

77
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,271
Let me finish this thought.

78
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,897
Eric likes Megan.

79
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,525
He most definitely does.

80
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:45,862
He's been asking her out for weeks.
She finally said yes.

81
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,365
They went out the other night.
Apparently it went very well.

82
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,072
- How do you know this?
- People tell me things.

83
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,132
I guess I have a face you can trust.

84
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:56,936
I think
it's because of my low cheekbones.

85
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,230
And...

86
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,877
Okay, what is it?
What can't I guess?

87
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:04,170
I hate, hate, hate being left out.

88
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,483
Whether
it's not being picked for a team

89
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,141
or being picked for a team
and then showing up

90
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,866
and realizing
that the team doesn't exist

91
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,587
or that the sport doesn't exist.

92
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,202
I should have known. Poopball?

93
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,459
Man, I know how you feel.
Third wheel.

94
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:25,401
I have been the third wheel
so many times in my life.

95
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:29,536
My mom told me something once
that made me feel better. She said...

96
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:32,611
the third wheel
is what makes it a tricycle.

97
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:36,454
- What are you talking about?
- Your group date with Megan and Eric.

98
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,207
At Tink's?
How'd you know about that?

99
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,925
Did Stanley tell you?

100
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:43,711
Stanley was on your group date?

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,632
No, Stanley was with his wife.
I waved at him but he didn't wave back.

102
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:52,214
Does anybody else know about this?

103
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,049
There he goes.

104
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:02,843
So what is the scuttlebutt?
Anybody hear anything?

105
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:05,983
Nothing?

106
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,316
I got a little something-something.

107
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,221
- I don't know if I should say.
- So just keep it to yourself then.

108
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:13,574
Stanley is having a midlife crisis.

109
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:15,646
Stanley is way past
the middle of his life,

110
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,578
considering
his height to weight ratio.

111
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:20,122
Apparently he and his wife

112
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,917
were out dancing
at a club for young people.

113
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:24,585
Teri's out of town.

114
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:26,737
- Who?
- Stanley's wife, Teri.

115
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:29,549
She's at an interior decorating expo
in Philly.

116
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,545
And Stanley hates crowds,
kids, and music.

117
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:35,195
I think you should check your facts.

118
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:45,148
You stupid son of a bitch.
You set me up.

119
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,192
- What are you talking about?
- Stanley's wife is out of town.

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,381
- He was with somebody.
- Definitely.

121
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:52,761
Was he? Who, his sister?

122
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,241
I don't get it!

123
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,256
If that was his sister,
then what they were doing was illegal.

124
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:00,746
Drugs?

125
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,421
Making out.

126
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:17,019
No, it's okay.

127
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,056
Never mind. Carry on.

128
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:21,124
Stanley is having an affair.

129
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,393
- What?
- I know.

130
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,293
I am very happy right now,

131
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,918
thrilled perhaps,

132
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:29,275
to be a part of the office,
to be a part of the conversation.

133
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:32,854
When you have somebody's attention
and their eyes are lighting up

134
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,722
because they are very interested
in what you have to say,

135
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,331
that is a great feeling
and I experienced that firsthand today.

136
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:42,580
It is wonderful
to be the center of attention.

137
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,945
That and that are the same letter.

138
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,070
"Q".

139
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,667
No...no

140
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,498
Okey.
He's holding a pencil.

141
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,132
He could be doing a crossword puzzle
with that pencil.

142
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,720
What's that letter right there?
Same letter here and here.

143
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,638
- What haven't you guessed?
- "T".

144
00:06:58,806 --> 00:06:59,964
"T", yes!

145
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,582
Yes!

146
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,501
That is a "t"

147
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,926
and there's another one right there.

148
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,648
Just sound that out.
You're almost there.

149
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:10,404
Hey Stanley.

150
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,818
Where you going, big guy?
Up to no good?

151
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:14,987
I'm meeting a client.
Do you have a problem?

152
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:15,869
No no no

153
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,354
I just had a quick question for you.
I'm casting

154
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,234
a movie and I'm looking
for a woman who can dance.

155
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,414
Beautiful woman.
Do you know anybody?

156
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,456
Good-bye.

157
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,043
Pays $5 million.

158
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,741
Nudity required.

159
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:30,294
You have to stop this.

160
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:32,421
Did you hear?
Stanley's having an affair.

161
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,091
I did from you.
You got to stop telling people.

162
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,280
Okay, I get it.

163
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:38,681
You feel out of the loop
and sorry for yourself

164
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,138
and it's really sad,
everybody thinks you're a loser.

165
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,266
Do you even know if it's true?
Do you have any idea? Because...

166
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,185
you might be ruining his life.

167
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,470
Hold up! Hold up!

168
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,072
Time to stop being polite
and get real.

169
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,801
Stanley,
you having an affair?

170
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:05,547
That is ridiculous. Of course not.
Why would you think that?

171
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,022
So it's not true.

172
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:07,816
well

173
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,547
Those interns. They told me
they saw you at the club

174
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,865
and they all said it was you.
It was clearly just...

175
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,873
racial profiling gossip.

176
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:22,655
- The little...
- Damn!

177
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,059
- Told her it was a stupid idea.
- That's so stupid.

178
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:28,744
It's just that...

179
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:32,565
- Teri's been traveling a lot lately.
- I know.

180
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,967
- It's been lonely.
- I bet.

181
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,319
Cynthia's been keeping me company.

182
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,955
She was my nurse

183
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,030
when I was in rehabilitation.

184
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:44,493
We used to go on these long walks
on the treadmill.

185
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,206
I didn't intend...

186
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,681
Wait, wait, wait.

187
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:53,044
So it is true?

188
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:54,842
But I'm going to go break it off.

189
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,256
That's where I'm headed right now,
I swear.

190
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,724
Wait a second.
Do people often say they're going

191
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,117
on sales calls
and then go someplace else?

192
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,262
That's not cool.

193
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,373
I just need you to promise
not to say a word about this to anyone.

194
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,602
Michael, please.

195
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,813
- I'm not saying a damn thing.
- I'm counting on you, Michael.

196
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,886
Okay
You can count on me.

197
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,620
Oh that smells good.

198
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,818
I might have extra.
It just depends on how many I eat.

199
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,987
Did you hear about Angela?
That's pretty weird.

200
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:27,866
Yeah

201
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:30,574
What do you mean exactly?

202
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,362
Well, the fact
that she apparently is dating

203
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,507
an 81-year-old billionaire

204
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,831
who owns a Quiznos on the turnpike.

205
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,124
Really?

206
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,101
Right?

207
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,331
How do you untell something?

208
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:45,456
You can't.

209
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,466
You can't put words
back in your mouth.

210
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:49,841
What you can do

211
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:52,842
is spread false gossip

212
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:57,101
so that people think that everything
that's been said is untrue,

213
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:59,676
including
Stanley is having an affair.

214
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:05,292
It's like the end of <i>Spartacus</i>.
I've seen that movie half a dozen times

215
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:08,096
and I still don't know
who the real Spartacus is.

216
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,871
And that is what makes
that movie a classic whodunit.

217
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,660
Kelly has an eating disorder.
She always eats my lunch.

218
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,464
Anorexia. She's ana...

219
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:19,039
She's an "anorexitec."

220
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,487
- We should do something.
- Nothing can be done.

221
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:24,152
Just have to tell everybody
and hope for the best, I guess.

222
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,005
I'm worried about Erin

223
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,944
because she's not a very good worker.
I don't know how long she's gonna last.

224
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,069
Really?

225
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:34,033
So...

226
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:35,208
And Andy...

227
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:36,397
is gay.

228
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,101
Did you hear Pam is pregnant?

229
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,646
Really?

230
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,408
She's gonna hate being a mom.

231
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,449
What?

232
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:55,617
Tea.

233
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:57,826
- So?
- You would.

234
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,497
I like tea.

235
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:01,757
I bet you like it.

236
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,181
I like it a lot.

237
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,633
I love tea.

238
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:09,923
Do you like it as much
as you like men's butts?

239
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:10,892
What?

240
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:12,929
'Cause you're gay.

241
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,317
Who told you that?

242
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,431
Was it Broccoli Rob?

243
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:20,672
Someone from Chi Psi?

244
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,781
Did you run
in someone from my high school?

245
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,270
This is not the first time

246
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:26,938
rumors about me being gay
have come up.

247
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:28,959
Twice before, actually.

248
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,590
Just a weird coincidence.

249
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,619
It's a little too weird.

250
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:40,857
Almost makes you wonder
if it's not a coincidence at all.

251
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:43,021
Which it is, of course.

252
00:11:44,806 --> 00:11:46,222
But it makes you wonder.

253
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,040
Did you hear the rumor about me?

254
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,989
That I'm gay?

255
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,098
I did.

256
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:54,372
And?

257
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:55,935
What?

258
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:00,309
Do you think it's true?
Do you think that I'm...

259
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,516
gay?

260
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:03,143
Are you attracted to other men?

261
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,276
No...but

262
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,108
Let me kick you a scenario.

263
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:12,353
I'm at, like, a beach cabana

264
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,529
and Brad Pitt approaches,

265
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,647
tries to lean in and kiss me.

266
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:20,641
I would definitely resist,

267
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:21,908
like, at first.

268
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,280
But if he was persistent,

269
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:26,300
I might...

270
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:29,544
give in a little bit
to just really see what it felt like.

271
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:31,938
Would I push him away?

272
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,063
How hard?

273
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,051
Like, what if he's,
like, really aggressive?

274
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:38,849
If you resisted Brad Pitt
a little bit,

275
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,324
he would still...

276
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:43,619
- need to get to you?
- This is not real Brad Pitt.

277
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:46,330
This is, like, in my...
This is my fantasy.

278
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:49,113
Or it's, like, not fantasy.
It's, like, what I'm...

279
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,398
It's just a scenario.

280
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,370
I wish I could help you. I don't...

281
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,653
You might be gay.

282
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,408
You might be gay.

283
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:01,856
What exactly
is my responsibility here?

284
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,477
To comfort
insecure heterosexual men?

285
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:06,623
That can't possibly fall to me.

286
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,291
- How far is Pam?
- A few months.

287
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,758
That's why
they're rushing the wedding.

288
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,634
You can't believe
everything you hear.

289
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,759
Like Stanley having an affair.

290
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,235
That is crazy.

291
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,267
Just there's no stock in it.

292
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,403
It's a weird day for false facts.

293
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,387
Let it go.

294
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:23,028
OK, everybody.

295
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,975
Big day. Last day for our interns.

296
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:27,685
Lot of other stuff.

297
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,097
Who knows what to believe?

298
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:32,167
Dwight, the honors.

299
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:35,860
Present these
to the dean for credit.

300
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,257
And as a gift,
I've attached my card.

301
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,281
Call me anytime of the day or night.

302
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:42,370
Why would we call you at night?

303
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,501
Now you can't call me at all,
so problem solved.

304
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:48,804
You will regret when you find yourself
between a moose and her cubs.

305
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,084
Look to the intern on your left.

306
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:52,556
Now to your right.

307
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,768
One of you will do
exceedingly well in business.

308
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:56,590
Just unlimited potential.

309
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,978
One of you will make a living
and nothing more.

310
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,676
And one of you

311
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:03,802
will make a great mother.

312
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:08,542
It's up to you
to choose which you want to be.

313
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,725
I am so happy you're eating again.

314
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,850
Me too.

315
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,693
Dude, how come you never try
to set me up?

316
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:20,029
I don't really do that.
Pam might have some friends though.

317
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:21,397
Women friends?

318
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,152
Not guy friends?

319
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,827
Are you interested
in her guy friends?

320
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:29,102
For the record, I prefer women.

321
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,541
But off the record,
I'm kind of confused.

322
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,168
Really?

323
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,219
The evidence is stacked against me,

324
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:36,379
I feel like.

325
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,716
- You got to figure this out.
- Yeah, right? How?

326
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:41,592
You got to have sex with a woman.

327
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:45,054
- Right-o.
- And then a man and then compare.

328
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,251
All right.

329
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:50,380
well.. hey

330
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,581
- Congratulations to you.
- On what?

331
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,434
Come on.

332
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,265
Little baby tuna.

333
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:58,924
Little junior toro.

334
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,174
A baby conceived out of wedlock
is still a bastard.

335
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:06,618
What?

336
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:08,453
Want me to say it again?

337
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,872
- Why did that come into your brain?
- Can I talk to you?

338
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,667
So they know.

339
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:17,086
- Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anyone. And you?

340
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:18,241
Nobody.

341
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:22,033
Did one of you tell Stanley
that I have asthma, 'cause I don't.

342
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,636
If it gets out,
they won't let me scuba.

343
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,154
If I can't scuba,

344
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:29,724
then what's this all been about?
What am I working toward?

345
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:30,683
What?

346
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:33,491
You think I'm the voice
of the Taco Bell Dog?

347
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:35,563
What are you talking about?

348
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,171
I have a daughter.
How could I be a virgin?

349
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:41,569
Has everyone heard
a crazy rumor about themselves today?

350
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,168
You know what?
Let's discredit these rumors.

351
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,450
Sure, but who's been saying
all that stuff?

352
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:50,828
That's not important,
We shouldn't listen to this crap.

353
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,705
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this.

354
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,707
Let's pick a rumor
and trace it back to the beginning.

355
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,575
I need to do mine first.

356
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,518
Who's been saying that
there's another person inside of me

357
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,779
working me with controls?

358
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,926
I heard that from Andy.

359
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,972
I heard it from Erin.

360
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:09,611
I heard it from Michael.

361
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,130
Michael?

362
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:15,664
Michael?

363
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,189
He's over here!

364
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:20,113
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

365
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,592
Michael.

366
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,725
You told people
that I use store-bought manure

367
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,795
when I showed you
where my manure comes from.

368
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,799
- Don't get on it.
- Michael, don't.

369
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,377
Don't get on.

370
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:40,803
Do not.

371
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,596
- Stay, Michael.
- Step away.

372
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,018
Come on, boss.

373
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,293
Okay, I made it all up.

374
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,388
What?

375
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:52,438
Even the fact that I'm gay?

376
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,541
-Yes
-Yes

377
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:56,133
But, guys, I'm a victim here too.

378
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,075
Okay?

379
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:59,403
People have been saying
that I am a J. Crew model.

380
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,364
No, we heard that about Jim.

381
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:02,736
Jim? No no

382
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:05,337
I spread the rumor
that somebody was a J. Crew model

383
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,036
and I was referring to myself.

384
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:10,611
- How is that a bad rumor?
- 'Cause people think that models,

385
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,888
even though they're very attractive
are somewhat vapid.

386
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:15,711
It set our industry back
quite a bit.

387
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:18,214
Michael, why?
Why say all these things?

388
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,143
Why make up an eating disorder,
Stanley's affair,

389
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:22,717
me being a spokes dog?

390
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:25,096
You told everyone
I was having an affair?

391
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:26,683
Here's the thing.

392
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,757
There was one true rumor
out there today.

393
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,273
I didn't want everybody
to know what it was,

394
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,815
so all of you are off the hook
except for this one person.

395
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,958
Well, then
what's the one true rumor?

396
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,783
We have a right to know.

397
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:41,997
Am I gay?

398
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,863
The one true rumor...

399
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,488
This is gonna ruin
this person's life, is...

400
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,867
That Pam's pregnant.

401
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,792
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

402
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:53,624
Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger.

403
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,163
At first I thought,

404
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,496
she has a new bra with padding.

405
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:01,119
But then I thought,
Pam doesn't need padding.

406
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,609
It just didn't add up, Jim.

407
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,740
- Congratulations.
- That's really great.

408
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:08,598
- Don't vaccinate it.
- Who's the father?

409
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:11,256
- How far along?
- Four months.

410
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,951
- Who's the ob-gyn?
- Stop.

411
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:14,495
All right, you know...

412
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:16,387
This is not the truth

413
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,635
and you can't fall
on a sword this way.

414
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,027
The real thing
is that Stanley Hudson

415
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,366
had an affair.

416
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:27,477
Thank you to defend us, but actually,
Pam is pregnant and we can prove it.

417
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,652
If you would like to see proof.

418
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,789
- Just gonna wait for her?
- What's the "proof" mean?

419
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,836
- There it is!
- It's true!

420
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:41,932
Pam!
Look at that!

421
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:45,013
That is the inside of your vagina.

422
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,928
That's not how it works, but...

423
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:49,838
It's clear
why we were trying not to tell people.

424
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:51,351
That's clear now.

425
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,802
How long have you known
about the pregnancy?

426
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:01,934
A week? Month?

427
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:03,861
A year?

428
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,614
We only told our parents last week.

429
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:09,005
- Did you pee on a stick?
- I did.

430
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:10,743
But it was inconclusive.

431
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,620
You should have told me.

432
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:15,899
You're right.

433
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:19,001
We should have realized
that you are an equal part of this.

434
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:22,183
Yes

435
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:25,015
<i>Michael, Teri Hudson
returning your call.

436
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,218
You called Stanley's wife?

437
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,036
Yeah, a long time ago.
Just to make sure she was out of town.

438
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,766
- God.
- Don't take it.

439
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,698
I have to take it
or it'll seem suspicious.

440
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:38,084
If you talk to her,
you're gonna tell her about Stanley

441
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,773
- and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
- I can do this.

442
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,827
- You can't do this.
- I can. I am going to tell her

443
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:47,220
that I need to redecorate my condo
and I need her help.

444
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:50,149
We will haggle about money
and I will back down

445
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,494
and then I won't talk to her
until this Cynthia thing's blown over.

446
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,577
- Sounds terrible.
- Please don't.

447
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,514
What up, Cynthia?

448
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,595
Just hang on a second, Cynthia.

449
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,795
It turns out
that Teri was already suspicious

450
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,169
because she had caught Stanley

451
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,062
and Cynthia a few months ago.

452
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,813
So Stanley promised

453
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:27,319
that he would stop and he did.

454
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,994
End of story. Well...

455
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,775
not exactly.

456
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:33,743
Cynthia kept calling him.

457
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,496
She would not stop calling him
and she was in love with him.

458
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:37,538
And get this.

459
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:39,306
Cynthia? Also married.

460
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:40,690
So...

461
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:43,864
you can't stop love, I guess.

462
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,734
And quite frankly,

463
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,359
I don't think
you should ever even try.

464
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:54,329
I learned that a company
can describe an internship

465
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,604
 as full of exciting experiences,

466
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:58,696
even if that's a lie.

467
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,435
There's no regulation.

468
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,676
I learned that half
these people's email password

469
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,001
is "password."

470
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:07,451
I learned that a ream of paper
is 300 sheets.

471
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,126
I thought it was 500.

472
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,535
I guess I didn't learn anything.

473
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,413
I learned that if you look
even the tiniest bit like Jet Li

474
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:20,855
 Michael will call you
Jet Li all summer.

475
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:23,175
- Julia Stiles.
- Alan Thicke.
