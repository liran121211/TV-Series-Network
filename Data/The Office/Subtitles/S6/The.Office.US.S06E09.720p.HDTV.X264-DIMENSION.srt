1
00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:02,941
Got you! Broken arm!

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:05,201
Broken nose!

3
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,518
Broken nose!

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:07,954
Gonna flip you!

5
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,775
Once a year, Dwight holds a seminar,

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,303
updating us on the developments
in the world of karate,

7
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:13,833
because,

8
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:17,282
the one thing that thousand-year-old
martial arts do all the time

9
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:18,407
is change.

10
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:19,821
How can I

11
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:22,246
pose this to you in a relatable way?

12
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:25,048
You are all members of the Yakuza,

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,656
and you happen to be visiting
the Lackawanna trolley museum,

14
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:30,831
and you are attacked by Triads.

15
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,366
How can you hold them off

16
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,909
until your clan arrives?

17
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,535
You cannot go wrong

18
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,203
with a throat punch.

19
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,666
So there's no defense for that?
Good to know.

20
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,448
No, there is a defense for that.
Let me demonstrate.

21
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:45,962
Someone attack me. Kevin, go!

22
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,285
No way.

23
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,788
Last time, you pulled my pants down,

24
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:52,218
and then you tried to choke me
with my shoelace.

25
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,145
False. I did choke you
with your shoelace.

26
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,180
Come at me!

27
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,264
With all due respect to everyone here,
I think the most worthy opponent of you

28
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:01,268
is you.

29
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:02,693
That is correct,

30
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,720
unless there happen to be
measles present.

31
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:08,354
So let's just say that Dwight
has come at you with the throat punch.

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,568
Now, how would you, Dwight,
defend against it?

33
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,852
Easy. Allow me to demonstrate.

34
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:15,005
I am attacking myself
with a throat punch.

35
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,330
Here it comes.

36
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:17,290
Block.

37
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,652
Grasp wrist as such.

38
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,872
And with the other hand?
He does have two.

39
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,565
Good point.
Second throat punch.

40
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,215
Absorb the blow.

41
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:28,025
Groin punch.

42
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,529
Hit, block, elbow to the gut!

43
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,391
Up to the nose! No, you're not!

44
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:37,596
My God,
he's making you look like such a fool.

45
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,890
He really is, but not for long.

46
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:43,728
Instep!

47
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:45,229
Not again!

48
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,898
You let go!

49
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,859
You're right! I can't hold on!

50
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,029
You are so evenly matched,
who's gonna get the upper hand?

51
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,740
The important thing to remember,

52
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,158
we always have

53
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,408
what is called the element

54
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,633
of surprise.

But I would say my favorite art form

64
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,273
is a tie between sculpting
and stand-up comedy.

65
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,942
I did stand-up comedy once.
I killed.

66
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:34,528
- That sounds like it was hilarious.
- It was hilarious.

67
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,446
What is the meaning of this email
that everyone got?

68
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,907
You'll have to be more specific.
I get like eight emails a day.

69
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:44,406
This one. "From David Wallace,
to all Dunder Mifflin."

70
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:45,745
Shout-out.

71
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,875
"I'm sure you've seen
the item in the journal.

72
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,960
"Just want to stress
it's all conjecture.

73
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,880
"If there's any concrete news,
you will know A.S.A.P."

74
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,423
Do we have the journal?

75
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,675
Your journal? You told me
to put it in a time capsule.

76
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:57,843
Did you?

77
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,303
He means
the Wall Street Journal online.

78
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,559
The Wall.

79
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,140
I found the article.

80
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,940
"On a day marked by panicked
corporate board meetings,

81
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:10,332
"one that is relatively unsurprising
is Dunder Mifflin's.

82
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,650
"It is rumored
that they will recommend..."

83
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,568
and the article cuts off.

84
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,843
It's $1.99 to finish the article.

85
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,657
I wonder what it was gonna say.

86
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,260
Are you serious?

87
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,163
I got it.

88
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,830
Tuna beat me to it.

89
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,708
"It is rumored that they will
recommend declaring bankruptcy"?

90
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,294
That doesn't make any sense.

91
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,498
Lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.

92
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:36,721
Bankruptcy could mean
a lot of things.

93
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,000
Maybe they're just restructuring
to get out of debt.

94
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,210
That sounds awful.

95
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:42,588
Or it could mean
the end of Dunder Mifflin.

96
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,015
That's an interesting theory.

97
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,160
You know what?

98
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,150
You can all have jobs
at Schrute farms...

99
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,692
as human scarecrows.

100
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:52,106
It doesn't pay much
and you can't unionize.

101
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,066
<i>I'm sorry. David's in a meeting.</i>

102
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,989
Maybe you should spy on him.

103
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,889
My God!
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

104
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:05,128
<i>I'll just have him call you back.</i>

105
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,730
Good.
I'll catch you on the flippity-flip.

106
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:12,042
He's busy.
Call me back when he's free.

107
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:21,041
Michael, are you okay?
Did you throw up in there?

108
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,516
No, just poopin'.
You know how I be.

109
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,773
But it smells like throw-up in here.

110
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,725
Crazy world, lotta smells.

111
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,296
What if this is
our last day at work?

112
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:32,589
What if we never see
each other ever again?

113
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,237
I like Erin.

114
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:41,922
There, I said it.

115
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,556
I was hoping she would ask me out,
but things have not

116
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,554
panned out on that front, so...

117
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,544
It is time for the Nard-Dog

118
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,917
to take matters into his own paws.

119
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,941
We have to do something,
because people are losin' it out there.

120
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:20,484
We need some sort of distraction
for everybody.

121
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,363
Anything new in YouTube?

122
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,989
Doesn't even need to be good.

123
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:28,158
I can't think. I need more Mullins.

124
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,401
Wallace said
these were just rumors, right?

125
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:35,204
So we have no reason to think
at the company's anything but fine.

126
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:38,712
So if we just go on with our work,
you and me, they'll follow along.

127
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:40,547
Monkey see, monkey do.

128
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:43,379
- Monkey pee all over you.
- That rhymes.

129
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:46,099
So what have we on the docket today?

130
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,324
We have a...

131
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,427
a monthly staff meeting.

132
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:52,685
All right!
Let's conference room it up!

133
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,187
Here's the deal.
There is no new information as of yet,

134
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:56,981
so I suggest we keep working.

135
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,275
Sure, I'm a little nervous,
but work will make us feel better.

136
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,104
I only slack off
when things are good.

137
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,192
Customers have to use
the coupon code from the website.

138
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:10,202
There is no differentiation
between the letter "o"

139
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,596
and the zero,
but we are working on that.

140
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,682
- Stay tuned for that.
- He needs me.

141
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,042
- Seat-save infinity.
- Okay, great.

142
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,221
Also...

143
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,085
What?

144
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,717
- What?
- What happened?

145
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,136
- Is there news?
- There has been a murder!

146
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,109
What?

147
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,256
There's been a murder...

148
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:32,750
in Savannah.

149
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,264
Games have

150
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,880
the power to distract people
from stressful situations.

151
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,403
"Battleship" got me
through my parents' divorce.

152
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,901
"Operation" got me
through my vasectomy,

153
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,426
i.e. my operation.

154
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:49,928
I don't think

155
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,477
I would have been able
to endure my break-up with Holly

156
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,580
had it not been for "Toss Across."

157
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,459
"<i>Belles, Bourbon and Bullets.</i>
A murder mystery dinner party game."

158
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,011
It is so much fun.
Everybody plays a character,

159
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:04,465
we go around the room,
we try to figure out who did it.

160
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,583
I'm wondering if this is a...

161
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,290
- terrible idea.
- This is my call, Jim.

162
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,013
Big picture stuff.
It's about murder.

163
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,615
I thought we agreed
that we wouldn't do things like this.

164
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,225
Tube City. You owe me one.

165
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:21,408
Co-managing is a give and take.
You have to pick your battles.

166
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,239
One of the battles that I picked

167
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,618
was to stop Michael
from running plastic tubes

168
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:29,093
all over the office
and placing hamsters inside of them.

169
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,534
He was gonna call it Tube City.

170
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:33,886
So, yes...

171
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,361
I do owe him one.

172
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:40,611
<i>August 5th, 1955.</i>

173
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,170
<i>It's a sad day
down here in Savannah.</i>

174
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,548
<i>Local magnate Bill Bourbon
was killed last night,</i>

175
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:49,863
<i>and all y'all have congregated tonight
for a meal to celebrate Bill</i>

176
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:52,179
<i>as he passes on to his great reward.</i>

177
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,379
<i>But you're not just here
to pay your respects.</i>

178
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:57,785
<i>You have to figure out which of y'all
is the scoundrel who killed him.</i>

179
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,678
This is ridiculous.

180
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,356
You leave, you do not get food.

181
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,066
- What kind?
- Sandwich platters.

182
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,859
- I'm in.
- Baby carrots.

183
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,104
Here are your character cards.

184
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,879
Take one, pass it down.

185
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,900
Here is your prop box.
Some of your characters will have props.

186
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,715
Now, on your character card,

187
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,580
it tells you who you are

188
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:22,078
and what your alibi is.

189
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:24,419
Everything else
is up to your imagination.

190
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,297
So if you talk slowly in real life,

191
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,525
your character could, say,

192
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,510
have been kicked in the head
by a horse.

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,078
Cool. I'll try it.

194
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:35,305
Use your imaginations.

195
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:37,850
- Who did you get?
- "Naughty Nellie Nutmeg,

196
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,987
"a vivacious young socialite
with a penchant for scandal."

197
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,652
- Saucy.
- How about you?

198
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:47,295
"Nathaniel nutmeg,
the local bartender and...

199
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,656
Nellie's brother."

200
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:53,198
I don't like this game.
It's scary.

201
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:55,895
- It's not scary.
- I don't like my character.

202
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,999
Who are you?

203
00:08:57,124 --> 00:09:00,409
"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor
of the Savannah swamps."

204
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:03,079
- I'm not comfortable with this.
- How do you think I feel?

205
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:05,677
I mean,
I have to play Caleb Crawdad,

206
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:07,152
handsome playboy.

207
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:10,145
Every night, a different woman,

208
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,592
being oogled,

209
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,557
having to hug and kiss

210
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,483
and spoon.

211
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,562
I make them feel beautiful.

212
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:23,769
What is this contraption,
I do declare?

213
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,481
It's my Blackberry.
I'm trying to get updates.

214
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:30,152
Who's Michael?
I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.

215
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,409
You don't have to keep saying that.
You say something, you're declaring.

216
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,240
That is the way
southern people talk.

217
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:37,242
What designing woman
are you basing that on?

218
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,626
Delta Buck, I do declare.

219
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,122
Now, shall we get to the mystery?

220
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,190
I'll go.

221
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,831
"My name is Deborah Utante,

222
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:49,256
"Deb for short."

223
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,405
That's clever.

224
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:52,682
Debutante.

225
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,997
"Bill Bourbon was my uncle.

226
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:57,846
"I would have never hurt him

227
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,954
"any more than I'd hurt a june bug."

228
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,435
Nice accent.
You sound like Forrest Gump.

229
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:04,686
I do not.

230
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,188
You do, actually.

231
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:09,675
You got this kind of like
Florida Panhandle thing goin',

232
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,937
whereas what you really want
is more of a Savannah accent,

233
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,898
which is more like molasses,

234
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:17,324
just sort of spillin'
out of your mouth.

235
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,909
Now do the Swedish chef.

236
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,328
I'm not familiar.
What province is he from?

237
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,622
He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.

238
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,705
I think I'm supposed
to say something to Pam...

239
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,263
I mean, Deb.

240
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,554
"I overheard you askin' the butler
where the pistol was kept."

241
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,126
Wait a minute!

242
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,605
I'm the butler.
You were listening in on that?

243
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,903
You rich people. You think you can do
whatever you want to the servant class!

244
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:46,254
- It's not a political thing.
- I will poison your food.

245
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,773
I reckon I got somethin' to say
to Miss Beatrix Bourbon

246
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:51,541
if and she don't mind.

247
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,120
Doggy! We got a party now!

248
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,522
I do believe

249
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:57,353
that the game is a big hit.

250
00:10:57,478 --> 00:10:59,408
People are really divin'
into their characters.

251
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:00,974
Y'all...

252
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,919
- I made a mistake.
- Sorry I'm late. What's goin' on?

253
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:11,910
Sir,

254
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,689
there has been a murder,

255
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,591
and you are a suspect.

256
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:19,330
Hang on just a second.
Let me settle in, I'll be right back.

257
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:21,005
Very good! Very good!

258
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:24,641
No one was there in the wine cellar.

259
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,239
Hey, there, young lady.

260
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,350
I would be remiss if I did not ask

261
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:46,997
the pretty young lady
out on a date for this weekend.

262
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:49,708
Sounds like a plan, sugar.

263
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:51,381
All right!

264
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,453
A plan it is.

265
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,593
Voodoo Mama Juju,

266
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:02,262
explain your dalliance
with the dark arts.

267
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:05,474
It's not my fault.
I was exposed to Harry Potter.

268
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:07,017
I know you did it!

269
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,471
I know she didn't do it.

270
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,589
It's never the person
you most suspect.

271
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:13,440
It's also never
the person you least suspect,

272
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:17,327
since anyone with half a brain
would suspect them the most.

273
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:20,467
Therefore,
I know the killer to be...

274
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:21,592
Phyllis,

275
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,206
a.k.a.

276
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,291
Beatrix Bourbon,

277
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:28,557
the person I most medium suspect.

278
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:31,299
Do you want to go out on a date

279
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,414
with me? We can

280
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,942
make out by the horses.

281
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:40,597
You know old Nellie
is always up for a romp in the hay.

282
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:42,272
How'bout a threesome?

283
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,088
My boudoir's always open.

284
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:47,376
Nice.

285
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:51,633
I'm a worried I might have asked out
Naughty Nellie and not Erin.

286
00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:55,220
Which would be a lot less appealing,
because Nellie says yes to everyone,

287
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,415
and she might be a murderer.

288
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,327
Follow before...

289
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,697
I just got an email from corporate,

290
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:05,075
specifically for accounting
to stop all payments to our vendors.

291
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:06,493
What does that mean?

292
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,050
Maybe nothing,
but it could be a prob...

293
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:13,034
What's this strange yankee accent
comin' out of your mouth, son?

294
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,876
This here is Savannah.

295
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:19,419
This...

296
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:21,937
plan... planta...

297
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,722
This plantation,

298
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:26,680
we're runnin' low on greenbacks,

299
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:29,361
and we're havin' problems payin'

300
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:32,678
the people who give us
the seeds and the dirt.

301
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:33,801
We can't pay 'em.

302
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:36,196
I can't...

303
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:39,317
It could mean a lot of things,
but it is unprecedented,

304
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,944
so it's cause for concern.

305
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,388
I'm going back to work.

306
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:46,899
I'm gonna skip forward
to a really big clue. Here we go.

307
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:50,537
<i>Well, by now, you figured out
that old Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.</i>

308
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:51,643
What?

309
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,458
I was doing so well.

310
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,339
Are you goin' to believe that?

311
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:57,764
That is a mis...

312
00:13:58,289 --> 00:13:59,889
That's a misdirection.

313
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,341
We still don't know
who the murderer is.

314
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,762
Nellie Nutmeg, come back in heyah!

315
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,598
I can't do this myself.

316
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:11,539
Voodoo Mama Juju!

317
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:14,279
What am I gonna do?

318
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,607
Okay, so corporate
is still in their meeting.

319
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,005
That could be a good sign.

320
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:26,865
Kevin's gonna give us his take
on the situation. Let's listen up.

321
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,141
All right, guys, it's a workday,
and you guys work here,

322
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,578
so let's go do some work.

323
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,846
Now, Jim telling us all to work,

324
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:36,121
I think that is a very good sign.

325
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,084
Don't just say things.

326
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:42,478
Good, Michael.
I wrote up those sales targets...

327
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:45,356
I do believe you have me mistaken.

328
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,010
My name is Caleb Crawdad.

329
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,988
Y'all skedaddled way too soon.

330
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:51,890
We need to re-open this case.

331
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,142
You're not re-opening the case.
The case is closed.

332
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:55,268
No, it ain't.

333
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,562
Frankly, I'm not surprised.

334
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,265
A lot of the evidence
seemed to be based

335
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,560
on puns.

336
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,584
I was thinking
about <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>.

337
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,866
So funny.
The guy's dead the whole time.

338
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:11,268
I haven't seen it.

339
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,169
Speaking of weekends,

340
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:15,455
you excited
about our date this weekend?

341
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,290
Of course, Nathaniel.

342
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,044
Where are you takin' me?

343
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:25,715
The finest steakhouse
in all Savannah.

344
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:26,883
Savannah?

345
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:29,511
That's a far way from Scranton.

346
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,222
Did you mean a real date?

347
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,499
Did you?

348
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,506
Totally

349
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:38,397
not.

350
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:50,874
I thought it was for real.

351
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,462
So I was excited, but it was just...

352
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,937
part of the game.

353
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,719
You're sure it was water?
It couldn't have been acid?

354
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:02,674
I already declared you
it was too dark to tell!

355
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,256
- Stop playing games with me, crawdad!
- This is not a game! This is my life!

356
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,626
- You are out of order, sir!
- Answer me!

357
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,094
- You are out of order!
- You are out of order!

358
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:13,412
I think Michael may have snapped.

359
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,258
Or maybe he's stuck in character.

360
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,883
Well, which is worse?
Snapped or stuck?

361
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,183
Both.

362
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,033
They're both worse.

363
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,025
It's gonna be all right.
We're a good company.

364
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,378
We'll figure this out.

365
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,505
We're not going under.

366
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:31,766
What if we both lose our jobs?

367
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:35,354
I'm trying to think of a way
that this all ends up fine,

368
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,078
and I can't think of one.

369
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:41,166
Deb, what in the world?

370
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,542
Do you have the vapors?

371
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,085
- Not now.
- Can't wait.

372
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,963
We have to get you
to our witch doctor right now.

373
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,131
Come on.

374
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:50,306
- Come on!
- I should just go.

375
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,448
Where to now, Caleb?

376
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:53,504
To...

377
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:55,555
Mama Juju Boo-Boo.

378
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,224
Michael, can I...

379
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,771
I'm just gonna skip right past the what
and go with why?

380
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,455
Because this is
the re-creation of a crime scene.

381
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,708
I'm the dead body,
and these are my brain chunks.

382
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,176
Shut up. You're dead.

383
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,155
- Can I talk to you?
- No Michael here.

384
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:13,136
Caleb!

385
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,452
- Today, of all days...
- No! You shut up!

386
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:24,327
They need this game, Jim.

387
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:27,754
Let us have this stupid little game,
all right?

388
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,817
You startled me!

389
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:37,245
My stars,
my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.

390
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,682
What can I do you for?

391
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,267
Wallace is on the phone.
He's returning your call.

392
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,579
- Detective Wallace?
- I don't think so.

393
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,314
I think it's David Wallace
from Dunder Mifflin.

394
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:50,235
- Tell him I'm not heyah.
- You're not gonna answer the phone?

395
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,839
I only answer to detective Wallace,

396
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,198
'cause I got a warm body
in the other room.

397
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:57,681
I'll take it.

398
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,300
<i>Sorry to be gettin' back
to you guys so late.</i>

399
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:05,500
<i>Things are still a bit unclear.
We didn't officially decide anything.</i>

400
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,966
<i>But if I can be candid
with you here, Jim...</i>

401
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:13,239
<i>It's not good. We fully expect to be
out of money by the end of the year.</i>

402
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:14,364
<i>Insolvent.</i>

403
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,013
<i>So I think you know...</i>

404
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,041
<i>I'm sorry. I have to run.</i>

405
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,190
- <i>But we will talk soon?</i>
- Sure.

406
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:23,784
You know, while I have you,

407
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:26,464
today I was working on this pitch
for a supermarket chain...

408
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,874
And it would actually be
a big account.

409
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,525
<i>Okay, look, you know what?</i>

410
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,673
<i>I can't really get my head around that
but that's great.</i>

411
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:35,733
<i>Keep after it, but I gotta run.</i>

412
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:37,699
See ya.

413
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,579
What's the news?

414
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,275
Nothing yet.

415
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,218
I guess that's not...

416
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,013
There is some bad news.

417
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,349
There has been another murder.

418
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,563
A murder, you say?

419
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,843
I do declare.

420
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,930
Conference room, everyone.

421
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,719
Do we have to play?

422
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:17,834
Super.

423
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,643
This could be a juicy one.

424
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,868
- Get in there!
- I do declare.

425
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:26,034
I think today was a good day
to have two managers,

426
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:29,292
because if you're a family
stuck in the middle of the ocean,

427
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,170
one parent might want
to just keep rowing.

428
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:35,302
But if the other parent
wants to play a game,

429
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:37,087
it's not because they're crazy.

430
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,649
It's because
they're doing it for the kids.

431
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,224
And I get that now.

432
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:44,354
There has been a lot of murder

433
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,079
and a lot of intrigue.

434
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,688
My little heart
can barely take it no more.

435
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:55,598
Today is the hardest I have worked
in a long, long time.

436
00:19:58,611 --> 00:19:59,861
I didn't do it!

437
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,974
Everybody just calm down.

438
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:06,751
Count of three,
we're all gonna put down our guns.

439
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:08,226
I have crossbows.

440
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:12,018
We'll put down our weaponry
on the count of three.

441
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,210
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

442
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,335
One...

443
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,574
Two...

444
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:19,801
Three.

445
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,550
Andy revealed himself
to be a double agent,

446
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:26,533
at which point,
Dwight felt comfortable

447
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,587
revealing that he also
was a double agent,

448
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:31,507
and then, Michael announced
to everybody that,

449
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:32,632
get this,

450
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:34,774
he was a double agent.

451
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:36,793
And it is 6:00.

452
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Really?

453
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,317
It wasn't me!

454
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,660
I'm not goin' down for this!

455
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:53,428
I want to go home.

456
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:56,285
Get the keys out of my purse,
start the car.
