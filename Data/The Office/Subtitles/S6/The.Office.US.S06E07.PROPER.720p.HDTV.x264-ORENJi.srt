Welcome,

00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:06,922
children of the Scranton
industrial park communities!

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,594
Join your gangster pumpkin

4
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:14,930
on his pallet truck of doom.

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,266
Don't worry about a thing.

6
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:21,125
Rest assured you will see me later!

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,346
We are doing a haunted house
this Halloween,

8
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:29,362
which is actually kind of spooky,
because,

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,880
as legend has it,

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,940
on this very site, there used to be
a productive paper company.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,124
I am going to scare
these kids so bad.

12
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:43,423
This is the spookiest warehouse
in the world,

13
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:44,377
kids.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,059
You don't believe me?

15
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:47,704
Just take a look.

16
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,039
Scary, huh?

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,190
This is a surgery with...

18
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,014
an octopus and a burn victim.

19
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,435
- Black widow.
- Leeloo from <i>The Fifth Element</i>.

20
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,604
Look, nobody told me
what people were, all right?

21
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,509
So label yourselves
or take what you get.

22
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,737
I vant to sell your blood!

23
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,114
That's not
the trend in vampires now.

24
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:16,492
Here is an old man and a goth dude,

25
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,850
and then the old crone
from <i>Drag Me to Hell</i>.

26
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:20,913
I'm a hobo.

27
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,456
I asked for a list.

28
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:28,129
- And a clown.
- I'm Jigsaw, idiot.

29
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:30,464
You're not as scary
as Bookface over there.

30
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,636
I am the popular social networking site
known as Kookface.

31
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,198
Okay, kids,

32
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,433
you all have been so good

33
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,308
and unbelievably patient,

34
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,476
so I think you are gonna get

35
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,895
some candy!

36
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,099
Kids, just remember,

37
00:01:58,224 --> 00:01:59,224
suicide

38
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,958
is never the answer,

39
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:01,912
all right?

40
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:05,268
Why is Christmas the only holiday
that can have a message?

41
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,694
It is the easy way out.

42
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,408
You are not alone.

43
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,505
What the hell is wrong with you?

44
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:14,613
Who wants candy?

I think I'm going to go
to the Garlic Festival.

55
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:43,853
Sounds like fun.
You would love it.

56
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,673
They have a TCBY booth.

57
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,333
Same stuff you get downtown.

58
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,460
- Do you like TCBY?
- Who doesn't?

59
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,896
I can't believe it's...

60
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,713
I can't believe it's yogurt.

61
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,988
- It'll be fun.
- I confirmed with Raskin Design,

62
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:57,760
they're expecting the both of you.

63
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,303
It's just gonna be me.

64
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,180
They said the both of you.

65
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,431
That's a mistake.

66
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,183
Give 'em a call, check that out.

67
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,681
All right.

68
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,144
Just clear this up.

69
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,502
There's actually been
a few changes in the company,

70
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,357
and Michael and I
are at the same level.

71
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:13,286
So I get...

72
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,176
Why would that be a problem?

73
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,105
Jim is a good kid.
He can handle a lot,

74
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,761
but sometimes
you have to call in a master.

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,748
Why would you date an amateur
when you could date a professional?

76
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:30,104
Great. See ya then.

77
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,877
What?

78
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:35,297
They'd feel more comfortable
if you came along.

79
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,391
Why don't they just want you
to go by yourself?

80
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:40,010
Why do they want me to come, too?
I don't understand.

81
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,846
I don't understand, either.

82
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:44,765
I don't want you to feel
like I'm babysitting you.

83
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,226
All right.

84
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,248
All right.

85
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,207
Let me go get your stroller.

86
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:53,812
Sure,
Michael's a good teacher.

87
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:57,491
A teacher is someone
who stands next to you your whole life

88
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,524
and never lets you do anything.

89
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,407
That's what a teacher is, right?

90
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,283
- What are you gonna call him?
- Dave.

91
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:04,743
- What is his name?
- Dave.

92
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,537
Mr. Borchard.
They're very formal.

93
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,414
I've spoken to them on the phone.

94
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:10,955
This is not the phone.

95
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,741
This is real life, baby,

96
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,295
and you gotta own it.

97
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,873
- Is that what you are wearing?
- Yes, it is.

98
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:19,988
And that is the watch
that you are going to wear?

99
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,176
No, it is not.

100
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,298
You should wear this watch.

101
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,577
I will loan it to you.
It is a tankard.

102
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:27,675
- I highly recommend you wear that.
- No, thanks.

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,300
They are into style.

104
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:32,020
They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

105
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,739
- And paper.
- That's sort of secondary.

106
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,603
He's trying to micro-co-manage me.

107
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:41,241
Or...

108
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,507

It was... something else.

Okay, this is what it was.

160
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:05,299
It was these bunch of idiots
that had put a fish tank

161
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,167
in the ground
with no cover and no railing.

162
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:09,595
So you fell in.

163
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,973
Maybe I was trying
to save a child that had fallen in.

164
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:14,554
- So a child had fallen in?
- Not yet!

165
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,310
That is hilarious.

166
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,479
Don't! I'm not gonna bump!

167
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,146
And it was not hilarious.

168
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,358
It was very, very terrifying.

169
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,457
Truthfully,
it wasn't the way he fell in.

170
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:29,313
It was
how long it took him to get out.

00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:50,428

00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,933
Actually, it's...

182
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,308
kinda not okay.

183
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,802
I date models.

184
00:07:58,342 --> 00:07:59,437
Face models.

185
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,856
My girlfriend, on a scale of

186
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,981
one to Gisele,

187
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,402
a nine.

188
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,154
That's good for you.

189
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,426
Anyway,
we also have a special on envelopes.

190
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,490
Pam's carrying our surrogate,

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,560
because my girlfriend needed

192
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,489
to keep her figure for Fashion Week,

193
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:21,998
we put our baby in Pam.
It doesn't matter what Pam looks like.

194
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,457
You were way meaner to me.

195
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:27,732
No, I wasn't.

196
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:31,131
The very idea of us together
made you burst out laughing

197
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:34,388
like you just bit into
an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.

198
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,690
You blew the sale, you idiot!

199
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:40,628
Let me tell you something.
I was never gonna make that sale.

200
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,272
Do we have any of those clips
that hold paper together?

201
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:45,736
Staples?

202
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,405
David Wallace called.

203
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,947
What did he say?

204
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,574
He heard you made
a big splash at the meeting.

205
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,404
That was so mean, I didn't mean it.

206
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,637
It was Kevin and Meredith
put me up to it.

207
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,684
I'm gonna kill you.

208
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,917
Don't listen to them.

209
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,921
You just ignore their carping.

210
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,466
A carp is both a fish
and a term for complaining.

211
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,385
They're mocking you!

212
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,659
Boss, did you find Nemo?

213
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,809
I can name Pixar movies, too.

214
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:19,433
- <i>Toy Story</i>.
- Don't you mean <i>Koi Story</i>?

215
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,269
When you fell in, did you flounder?

216
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:28,192
- Flounder is both a kind of a fish...
- I know what a flounder is.

217
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,406
I'm not usually
the butt of the joke.

218
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,222
I'm usually the face of the joke.

219
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:37,486
I wish
Jim had fallen into that pond.

220
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,954
Then he'd have to put on my suit,
and it would be too short.

221
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,379
And he'd look...

222
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,251
Damn it, he'd still look good.

223
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,403
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

224
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,378
is that you cannot make fun

225
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,134
of a person for something
or some action

226
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,386
that they have done
that they regret.

227
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,179
Show of hands.
Who here has been

228
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,399
Koi-ponded?

229
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:03,519
Who here has been the butt
of a joke that has gone too far?

230
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,516
You make fun of us every day.

231
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,318
- Every single day.
- You never said anything.

232
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,069
We have, countless times.

233
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,424
It is hard to tell the difference

234
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:17,533
between you guys saying stop
because I want you to stop,

235
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,201
or stop as in, "Stop!
You're making me

236
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,327
"laugh so hard.
What you're doing is so funny.

237
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,489
"You're on a roll,
I am busting a gut.

238
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:26,512
"Stop!"

239
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,681
That's never been the case.

240
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,078
We are going to make

241
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:32,338
a "do...

242
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:33,999
"not...

243
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,271
mock"

244
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:37,927
list, okay?

245
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,098
Anything

246
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,640
that we think might be out of bounds,
we put on this list.

247
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,304
Anything you put on this list,
you cannot be teased about.

248
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,274
Got it?

249
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,839
I'm gonna kick it off.

250
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,231
Let's see

251
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,444
what I have to put

252
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,748
on the list.

253
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:54,873
Right?

254
00:10:56,241 --> 00:11:00,241
I also have fallen into the fountain
at the Steamtown Mall.

255
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,620
Okay, who else?
Dwight, come on.

256
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,830
I don't want people
making fun of my nose.

257
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,247
Your nose?

258
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:08,150
It's too small.

259
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:09,298
Right.

260
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:10,515
That is small.

261
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,046
Just write it down, please.

262
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,339
Can you breathe okay?

263
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,256
What keeps your glasses on?

264
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:18,719
- It's on the list, everybody.
- I haven't finished writing.

265
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,304
Did you sneeze it off?

266
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,347
That's it!

267
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:22,639
No more.

268
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,601
Who else?
Everybody's going to get their chance.

269
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,145
I don't want people
making fun of my weight.

270
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,631
That's too broad.
It's gotta be something else.

271
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,732
Your stomach?

272
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,781
I don't want to say it out loud.

273
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,658
Come on up here.
Write it yourself,

274
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,577
and don't sign your name to it,
and nobody look.

275
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,000
Everybody look away.

276
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,562
I really didn't want
to put it on the board,

277
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:53,204
but I thought maybe it was
gonna come out somehow...

278
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:55,296
What are you gonna do?

279
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:05,225
That is our sales pitch,
and we are stickin' to it.

280
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,570
You two are quite the salesmen,

281
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,144
and a very cute couple.

282
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,362
Some couples
don't seem like a good match,

283
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,369
but you two do.

284
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,640
You know.

285
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:23,784
Two peas in a pod.

286
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,078
We complete each other.

287
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,778
She loves to cook...

288
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,202
He loves to eat.

289
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,751
- I love to dance.
- I love to watch him dance.

290
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,600
Right, sometimes I'll just dance

291
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,006
- for hours in the living room.
- And I'll watch him.

292
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,973
And a baby on the way?
You must be so excited.

293
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:43,137
We are thrilled.

294
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,513
In fact, we spent the whole weekend

295
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:47,510
researching
various birthing coaches.

296
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,935
- Wasn't that fun, honey?
- It was, sweetie.

297
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,478
I know the best teacher.
Her name's Miss Janet.

298
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,406
On Clearview Avenue.

299
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,776
This sounds ridiculous, I know,

300
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,827
but some people say
that I eat like a squirrel.

301
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:05,082
So now you're comparing yourself
to a cute, tiny animal?

302
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:09,606
The custodian called again.

303
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,415
Apparently, a Koi has died.

304
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,786
It's a fish.

305
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:15,586
They want you to pay for it.

306
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,340
- It could have died of natural causes.
- They said you stepped on its head.

307
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,340
He did not suffer.

308
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:23,719
When is the funeral?

309
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,846
Do not mock, Oscar.
Do not mock.

310
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,314
- How much do they want?
- $300.

311
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,475
What? No.

312
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,086
I could get a fish
for a five-cent worm.

313
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,442
You're paying way too much
for worms, then.

314
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,606
Who's your guy?

315
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,692
Great meeting. That's it.

316
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,175
We are not done here.

317
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,300
The baby books suggests
the best posture

318
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:49,453
is on all fours like an animal.

319
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,773
I just wish
I had a special telephone

320
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,123
I could find out exactly
what the little soybean wants

321
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:55,376
Right?

322
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,187
Hey, li'l soybean, what do you want?

323
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,691
Right. How do...

324
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,677
- I felt a kick.
- That's great.

325
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,698
My gosh,
like a little magical foot

326
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:08,569
just high-fived me.

327
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:10,983
- That'll happen.
- My gosh.

328
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,262
It's like he's trying to say,
"I love you, too, daddy."

329
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,798
I love you, too.

330
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,272
Sometimes we're so excited,
we forget where we are...

331
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,092
Like at a business meeting.

332
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,321
Message received, lil'soybean.

333
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,572
I think you just gotta ride
this one out, man.

334
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,308
Jim, you don't understand.

335
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,619
Things like this just don't die.

336
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:33,789
Kids in high school
still call me Ponytail.

337
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,970
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do, Jim.

338
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,271
Because of the time
I got my ponytail

339
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:41,423
- stuck in the power drill.
- Maybe if you make fun of yourself,

340
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,091
- it'll all go away.
- I want to make fun of you right now.

341
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:45,363
Do it.

342
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,975
I am a big, stupid goofball.

343
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,967
Don't do that. You're not.
You're not stupid.

344
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:52,766
See?

345
00:14:57,628 --> 00:15:00,898
I just want to say
that I cannot believe

346
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,943
that I walked into a Koi pond.

347
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,706
I mean, seriously, walk much?

348
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:10,729
I should wear a snorkel
to the next meeting that I go to.

349
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,618
When you think about it,

350
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,768
it's not all your fault.
Who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?

351
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:18,182
You know what?
You're right,

352
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,377
but I've been there before.

353
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,754
I've seen that pond.

354
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,731
This is the thing,
I am a world-class moron.

355
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,468
Michael, please, stop it now.
You're embarrassing yourself.

356
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,719
 We're having fun.

357
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,809
It's actually not the first time
I've been embarrassed by a pond.

358
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:35,267
In high school,
the girl's volleyball team

359
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,441
always used to throw me
into the frozen lake.

360
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,931
Four years in a row.

361
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:42,509
It was freezing!

362
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,140
This is even worse.
Couple of weeks ago,

363
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:50,359
I went to get a new cell phone,
and I wanted one of those packages

364
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,534
where you've the five...
You know, the friends, and family thing?

365
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,754
The guy was like,
"who are your five friends?"

366
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,902
And I'm like,

367
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:00,249
I didn't even know!
I couldn't even think.

368
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,071
It was so embarrassing!

369
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,246
That was...

370
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,820
I don't even have
Jan's cell phone number,

371
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,118
and I hate her!

372
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,011
She won't give it to me.

373
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,528
It's like,
well, I guess I'm a loser.

374
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:17,407
A loser!

375
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,068
Too far!

376
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,949
Thanks a lot, man.

377
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:25,286
Thanks for the advice.

378
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:35,035
Enjoying your nut?

379
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:35,962
Why?

380
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,941
I'm not mocking.
I was just...

381
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,417
making an observation

382
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,833
about her nut.

383
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,878
I was.

384
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,920
Hey, who wants to watch
Michael's pond dive?

385
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,755
My roommate's friend
is the night janitor over there.

386
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,205
He swiped the security tape for me,

387
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,322
and he's bringing it over.

388
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,988
You know what?
Maybe we should go easy on Michael.

389
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,433
You're gonna have to stay late
for more sensitivity training, so...

390
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,872
We'll stay late.

391
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,082
- That went pretty well.
- I guess.

392
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,111
We got a maybe.
Was our first maybe.

393
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,989
Going by the Nard-Dog curve,
i'd say we nailed it.

394
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,825
I could have done
without the belly kiss.

395
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,658
You know what? I'm sorry,

396
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:19,872
'cause in that moment,
I knew I was kissing it too much.

397
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:21,123
Way too much.

398
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,417
I mean, what the hell was that?

399
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,002
What the heck was that?

400
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,336
- When you cried.
- Try "almost cried."

401
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,549
I just got caught up in the fantasy.

402
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,900
Your fantasy involves
comparison shopping birthing classes?

403
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:36,633
I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet.

404
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,180
I just...

405
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,474
I don't know,
it was fun to role-play, right?

406
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:44,605
I mean, it's fun for me,
having a wife and a little baby.

407
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,275
I'm so sick of being single.

408
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:50,484
Well, are you dating anyone?

409
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,821
What do you think of Erin?

410
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,740
She's kinda cool.

411
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,388
You think I can do better?

412
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,330
I gotta get my goin' out on.

413
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,498
Let's watch this thing!

414
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:08,368
- We're not watching this.
- How can we not watch this?

415
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:11,403
- What happened to "do not mock"?
- We're not mocking. We're watching.

416
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:14,851
- That will inevitably lead to mocking.
- We'll deal with it as it comes.

417
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:17,304
- Is this the tape of me falling?
- Put the DVD in.

418
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,341
- Open up Quicktime.
- It starts on the song.

419
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,683
- Trust me. I've done this.
- Michael can't handle this,

420
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,523
and as your boss,
I'm saying we're not watching it.

421
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:27,606
It's okay. Watch it.
He can't fire all of you.

422
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:30,275
- What are you doing?
- It's all right. I can handle it.

423
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,327
- I am a grown-up, Jim.
- It's on.

424
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,280
There they come.

425
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:39,331
- Did you see that?
- See what?

426
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:40,998
Wait, why'd you stop it?

427
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,561
You're right to stop it.
Thank you. Eject it.

428
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:46,166
- Jim, you let Michael fall in.
- Play it again.

429
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,683
He purposefully leaned away
and let you fall.

430
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,397
I think when I started
to see you go in,

431
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,322
- I think I just froze.
- I don't think you froze.

432
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,802
It's a killer new dance move.

433
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:12,327
Do you want to talk in your office?

434
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,528
I didn't ask you.

435
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,431
Would you like to talk?

436
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:21,827
Judas.
Jim is my enemy,

437
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,571
but it turns out
that Jim is also his own worst enemy.

438
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:27,244
And the enemy of my enemy
is my friend,

439
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,696
so Jim is actually my friend.

440
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,616
But because he is
his own worst enemy,

441
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,818
the enemy of my friend is my enemy,
so actually, Jim is my enemy.

442
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,345
But...

443
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,188
I should have grabbed you.

444
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:43,623
I'm sorry.

445
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,602
I thought I could have
done today's sales call alone.

446
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,039
I may never be
as good a salesman as you are,

447
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,358
but I at least need
the chance to do the job.

448
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:57,384
Jim is jealous of me?

449
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:02,536
Jim is jealous of me.

450
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,875
- What's up, lifeguard?
- I think I'm in your way.

451
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,775
Oscar's a douche.

452
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,869
No, he's all right.

453
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,514
Yeah, he's all right.

454
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:35,565
- Thanks, Michael.
- You're welcome.

455
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,903
Almost fell.

456
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,612
Hey, Erin, do you mind
faxing this for me?

457
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:45,872
Sure. Wait.

458
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:48,370
Hand them to me upside down,
so I don't accidentally read them.

459
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,085
How did today go by the way?
Did you make any sales?

460
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,671
No, it was a total waste of time.

461
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:02,284
It was fun, though,

462
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,728
because I got to spend
the day with Andy Bernard.

463
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,181
He's really cool.

464
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,516
Yeah, he is.

465
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,880
Yeah, he is.

466
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,185
He's like the coolest person
I've ever met.

467
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,063
That's... right.

468
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,941
He's like Marlon Brando.

469
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:20,982
Do you mean Marlon Wayans?

470
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,197
'Cause he is.

471
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:25,593
I actually do mean
Marlon Wayans, yeah.
