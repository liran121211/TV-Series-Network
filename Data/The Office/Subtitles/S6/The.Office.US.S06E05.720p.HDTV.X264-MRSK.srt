1
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:23,326
Andy,
I'm getting married in eight hours.

2
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,871
Everyone else is too drunk.

3
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,000
Just don't let me die here.

4
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:30,837
Where are you?
Can you take Andy to the hospital?

5
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:33,412
- <i>What?</i>
- He tore his scrotum dancing.

6
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:36,173
- <i>What?</i>
- He is in my room, icing his balls.

7
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,236
- <i>What?</i>
- Please stop saying "What?"

8
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,766
- Can you take him?
- <i>{\Look, }I would so take him</i>

9
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,142
<i>in any other circumstance,
but I'm pretty certain</i>

10
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:44,556
<i>I'm completely wasted.</i>

11
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:46,400
Your brothers took you out drinking?

12
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:49,398
<i>Is that Pam?
Have her come out.</i>

13
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:51,785
<i>Have her come out!
It'll be like</i> Coyote Ugly.

14
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:54,024
That's Michael.
You're out with Michael?

15
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:55,244
<i>And Dwight.</i>

16
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,933
- <i>Pam, it just happened.</i>
- Fine.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,029
I'll take him.

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,834
<i>I love you. I got to go.</i>

19
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,009
<i>I love you!</i>

20
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:05,648
- Are you pushing me off the phone?
- <i>No. Let's talk for a long time.</i>

21
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:06,773
Good-bye.

22
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,177
{\pos(192,240}It's after midnight.

23
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,461
{\pos(192,240}You're married.

24
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:13,969
{\pos(192,240}He's married!

25
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:15,915
{\pos(192,240}That's not how that works.

26
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:20,064
- {\pos(192,240}You'{\re not gonna}ll not be able to talk back.
- You'll have Pam to answer to.

27
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,397
{\pos(192,240}She'll be sitting at home saying:
"Jim, take the baby to the zoo,

28
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:26,008
"cause I want to sit at home
and eat bonbons...

29
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,022
"and clip my toenails."

30
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:32,103
"Why don't you braid my hair?

31
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:34,648
- "I want to watch TV."
- Now you sound like Kermit.

32
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,592
Are you sure this is the right way?

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,240
I, like you,
have never been here before.

34
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:45,694
At least slow down a little bit,
because every little bump in the road

35
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,269
is major pain on...

36
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,272
my scrotum.

37
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:51,334
{\Look, }I'm not the one
who asked you to do a split

38
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,209
when you'd never done one before.

39
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:56,544
I was trying to liven things up{\ a little bit}.
I was kind of doing your job, so...

40
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:57,772
My job?

41
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:59,897
My job is to get married
in the morning.

42
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,085
That's my job.

43
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,095
{\Well, }It's also to make sure {\that }we have
a great time at your stupid wedding,

44
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:05,065
so...

45
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,266
Just spent the night with the bride
the night before the wedding.

46
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,728
She stepped on my hand
on her way to the bathroom.

47
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,583
Andy, did I dream
that you were crying through the night?

48
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:39,653
That was real.

49
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:50,282
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

50
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,626
Can I get a little privacy?

51
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:04,460
Good morning.
How can I help you?

52
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,397
I left
a pair of dress shoes in a bag

53
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,326
outside my door last night
to be cleaned and polished,

54
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,586
but they haven't been returned yet.

55
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:15,772
You must be Mr. Malone.
One moment please.

56
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:18,941
Sir, this is the man with the shoes.

57
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,917
Mr. Malone, your shoes are gone.

58
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,134
They were stolen?

59
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,534
No, destroyed.

60
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,993
When the bag was opened
by our shoeshine,

61
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,768
the smell overcame him.

62
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,893
I, too, smelled them
and made the choice

63
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,187
that they must be thrown away.

64
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:39,981
Incinerated, actually.

65
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,317
But that was my only pair of shoes.

66
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,152
It became a safety issue, sir.

67
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,518
Damn it.

68
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,719
I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast.

69
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:57,103
You have everything?

70
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:58,278
Cell phone?

71
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,465
Charger?

72
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:03,630
So you sure you don't want breakfast?
It's the most important meal of the day.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,685
It really is.
I'm not hungry.

74
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,302
I ate a {\whole }bunch of sunflower seeds
after you went to sleep.

75
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,886
And besides,

76
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:12,886
I {\wouldn't}don't want to take you away from Pam
on the morning of her wedding.

77
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,557
She needs you, Isabel.

78
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,769
That's really sweet, Dwight.
So I'll see you at the wedding?

79
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,039
You know it.

80
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,408
Get out of here.

81
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:24,954
Good morning.

82
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:29,080
It's about damn time, I haven't gone
to the bathroom in a day and a half.

83
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,522
- This room is a pit.
- Really? Hadn't noticed.

84
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:35,453
Too busy knockin' boots.

85
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:42,210
How can you eat like that?

86
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:44,889
I'm ravenous
after a night of lovemaking.

87
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:45,797
You?

88
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:48,330
I'm hungry, but I'm not gonna make
a pig out of myself.

89
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,636
What was she like?

90
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,762
She was cute.
You know, she was hot.

91
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,600
She was very hot.

92
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:57,058
She made love like a tiger.

93
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,185
Bride side or groom side?
Or townie?

94
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:00,979
She was from Europe.

95
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,815
No kidding.
Bet she had hairy armpits.

96
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,838
Isabel was nice, but...

97
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,903
I hope she doesn't think
this is going anywhere.

98
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,031
Wait a second.
You're not into her?

99
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:13,514
Are you kidding me?

100
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,118
She's Pam's best friend.

101
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,113
You guys could double date.

102
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:18,413
Swap maybe?

103
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,081
{\Please.}Put a gun in my mouth.

104
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:21,292
You're crazy.

105
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,500
{\Look, }She's a dental hygienist
from Carbondale,

106
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,379
and she makes love like one.
She's a bumpkin. Pass.

107
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,257
{\Do }You know how hard it is{\to be a hygienist}?

108
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:32,640
You have to take X-Rays.
You have to scrape the plaque of {\people's }teeth.

109
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,366
You have to tell kids when to spit

110
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:37,637
and make sure that they're not scared
when the dentist comes in.

111
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,601
{\You should }Ask her out.

112
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,698
I already have
a European girlfriend.

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,250
{\pos(192,240}Are you in a lot of pain?

114
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,251
{\pos(192,240}'Cause of last night?
No way.

115
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:07,547
{\pos(192,240}Reports have been exaggerated.

116
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:10,105
{\pos(192,240}Weddings make me very emotional.

117
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,300
{\pos(192,240}I {\just }have that side{\ to me}.

118
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:15,067
{\pos(192,240}People say you cry all the time.

119
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:16,639
That's...

120
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:17,764
not...

121
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,600
Crotch injuries are the worst.

122
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,602
You don't need to tell me.

123
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:24,938
I wasn't telling you.

124
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,482
- There's still something there?
- Excuse me?

125
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,609
It didn't get torn off?

126
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:31,941
They didn't...

127
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,238
Nothing got torn off.
Who told you that?

128
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:37,352
I may have told some people that.

129
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,249
I'm nervous.
I'm about to get married.

130
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,001
If you want to sit on this...

131
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:47,105
I was thinking the wood might be
too hard on your damaged penis.

132
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,274
Make it softer.

133
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,167
It's my scrotum.

134
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,321
And it was.

135
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:58,602
Sure.

136
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,230
Here we go.
They asked for cash, but,

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,315
you know,
I give 'em cash every week.

138
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,740
So how much cash does a person need?

139
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:15,547
I have taken it upon myself
to do something a little more special.

140
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,929
I have painted a portrait
of the two of them

141
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,154
from memory.

142
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,018
And I have
another one of them in the nude.

143
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,250
But that one is for me.

144
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,880
I got them
a set of turtle-boiling pots,

145
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:36,972
shell hammer,

146
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:38,097
and bibs.

147
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:43,184
Is it zipping over your belly?
Don't squish the baby.

148
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,600
Thank you, weirdo.

149
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:47,672
Everybody see
Kristy's stupid, blond extensions?

150
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:50,481
It's like they were made
from a plastic broom.

151
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,734
Here I come.

152
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:56,722
Darling, you look beautiful.

153
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:57,781
Thanks, mom.

154
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,116
I hope he deserves you.

155
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,241
He does.

156
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,127
Are you sure?
Remember, you don't have to do this.

157
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:05,252
You don't.

158
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,299
You're totally projecting
and being a drag.

159
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,691
Thank you, mom.

160
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,504
I'm gonna go outside
and talk to Dwight.

161
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,760
Great.
I'll see you in a second.

162
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:15,507
Wait, what?

163
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,245
- <i>Can you come here please?
</i>- Is this allowed?

164
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,057
<i>But I'm allowing it.
Just come here.</i>

165
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,068
That was an intelligent comment.

166
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,722
Hello, stranger.

167
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,047
How do I look?

168
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,449
Fine.

169
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,317
Isabel, nice to see you.

170
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,118
What do you want?

171
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,223
Nothing...

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
anymore.

173
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,541
So...

174
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:54,420
tell me again the difference
between Filene's and Filene's basement.

175
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,228
He's not sitting with me, either.

176
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:01,726
Where are you sitting?
You need a seat, buddy?

177
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,731
I'm standing.
I'm a bridesmaid.

178
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,353
I wish I was a bridesmaid.

179
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:08,602
Where am I gonna go?

180
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:15,650
You look...

181
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Terrible.

182
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:18,222
So beautiful.

183
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,056
My veil tore.

184
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,916
I knew when we were getting married
and I'm five months pregnant

185
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,172
that I'm not gonna be able
to wear the dress that I always wanted,

186
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,667
or high heels.

187
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,047
You look just as I imagined you.

188
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:40,765
Pam, you're so pretty.

189
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,468
And who cares?

190
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,020
It's a stupid veil, right?

191
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,271
No, this is the one thing
I was supposed to be able to control

192
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,641
was this veil.

193
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,709
There.

194
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,276
Now we're even.

195
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,826
Everyone's driving me crazy.

196
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:20,131
I know way too much
about Andy's scrotum,

197
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:21,674
and my mom won't stop

198
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:24,303
freaking out
about my dad's new girlfriend.

199
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,181
This is supposed
to be our wedding day.

200
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:32,331
Why did we invite all these people?

201
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,625
I think Pam ran away
because she knew deep down

202
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,121
she wouldn't be a good wife.

203
00:10:55,006 --> 00:10:56,133
What are you doing?

204
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,352
I'm trying to decide
if I have time to pee.

205
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,226
- How long do you take to pee?
- The peeing is fast, Oscar.

206
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,567
It's getting my tie back on.

207
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,723
Would you have a snack
in your purse?

208
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,299
You're a mom.
I just figured you might have...

209
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:17,563
Apricot.

210
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:20,274
Do you have any of the Very Berry
or Ocean Splash, or...

211
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:24,072
Were you saving it?

212
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,540
{\pos(192,240)}That's okay. I just...

213
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:29,394
{\pos(192,240)}I've had a very rough...

214
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:30,996
{\pos(192,240)}weekend.

215
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,226
{\pos(192,240)}I'm sorry.

216
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,208
{\pos(192,240)}Apricot. Made of real apes.

217
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,628
{\pos(192,240)}{\Do you think}They canceled the wedding?

218
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,099
Relax.
You'll get your shot at Jim.

219
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:46,425
Those two treat the whole office
like a 1970's key party.

220
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:50,429
My weekend's bad so far.

221
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:54,033
I came here hoping to meet somebody.

222
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:55,601
You know, as you do,

223
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:56,871
at weddings.

224
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,990
End up...

225
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,375
going to sleep
by the vending machine.

226
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:04,427
- It was loud, but it was warm.
- That sounds awful.

227
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:05,361
And...

228
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:08,739
the love of my life
is dating somebody else.

229
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,375
It's just...

230
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:13,416
It is a terrible year for love.

231
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:15,871
I guess{\ it is}.

232
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,499
Thinking
about having my sperm frozen.

233
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,122
Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?

234
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,642
Heard you might have
a whoopee cushion on you.

235
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,509
Our sister's in the can, and we {\totally }want
to get her when she comes back.

236
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,722
That sounds hilarious.
I do, actually.

237
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,325
There you go.
Use it in good health.

238
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,016
Wait a minute, what is the etiquette
on taking the gifts?

239
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,738
Can you only take your own back,

240
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:44,055
or is it
a whatever-you-can-carry type of thing?

241
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,988
Anyone have anything
they want to trade for a toaster?

242
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:49,208
Does it have slots for hot dogs?

243
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:51,843
Who would want it?

244
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:54,057
Guys, maybe we should wait
a little more time

245
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:55,870
before we start grabbing boxes.

246
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,919
I like to lodge a {\formal }complaint against Jim
for making us wait for over an hour.

247
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:15,556
Get in there.

248
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,546
I guess this wedding
is not gonna happen.

249
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,092
Wonder if this is it for them.

250
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:25,441
What happened?

251
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:27,818
Where were you{\guys}?
Do you know {\how long }I've been waiting here?

252
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,604
We are here now, so let's go.

253
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:35,368
I have so much joy in my heart

254
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:36,409
right now.

255
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,705
How do I look?

256
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:39,561
- You look great.
- You look great.

257
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:43,793
Wear a tie much?

258
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,749
I begged them not to.

259
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:25,209
I know you specifically put this song
on your do not play list.

260
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,212
I did.

261
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,405
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,715
Go ahead.
I think it's your turn.

263
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:32,758
{\Wait, }What happened?
You're okay with this?

264
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,009
I'm okay.

265
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,340
Okay then.

266
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:39,473
Did you see this?
It was on YouTube.

267
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:40,456
Saw it.

268
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:21,767
I bought those boat tickets
the day I saw that YouTube video.

269
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:25,346
I knew we'd need a backup plan.
The boat was actually plan C,

270
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:27,071
the church was plan B,

271
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,233
and plan A was...

272
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,075
marrying her a long, long time ago.

273
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,032
Pretty much the day I met her.

274
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,732
What an awesome party.

275
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,279
The best wedding I've ever been to.

276
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:50,974
I got six numbers.

277
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,670
{\pos(242,210)}One more would have been
a complete telephone number.

278
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:57,691
{\pos(242,210)}This was epic.

279
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,643
{\pos(242,210)}My Kleenex shoes

280
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,238
{\pos(242,210)}were a huge conversation piece,

281
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:03,592
{\pos(242,210)}but man,

282
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:06,068
{\pos(242,210)}my dogs are barking.

283
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:16,495
{\pos(242,210)}My feet were so sweaty,
I can't even feel the cold.

284
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,096
{\pos(242,210)}What a lovely hotel.
