00:00:01,037 --> 00:00:02,737
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:05,562
Who would like
an authentic New York bagel?

3
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,325
I got a pumpernickel just for you.

4
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:13,454
H and H.

5
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:16,794
You went all the way to New York City
to get us bagels?

6
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:19,501
Why, is there a place closer
that sells them?

7
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:21,617
This was really nice, Dwight.
Thanks.

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,624
Don't mention it.

9
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:26,024
You owe me one.
You all owe me one.

10
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:28,639
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good morning, Dwight.

11
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:31,661
- Hungry?
- No. I had a fish stick sandwich.

12
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:33,199
Actually, I had two.

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,258
My girlfriend didn't want hers,

14
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,825
because I guess
I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,582
Fish sticks are not an ahrodisiac.
You're thinking of deer penis.

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,826
- It worked.
- Regardless, that was two hours ago,

17
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:47,571
and it is now a scientific fact
that you are hungry... Bagel?

18
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:50,657
- I don't mind if I do.
- I brought cheese too.

19
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,983
I'm taking one for my lady friend.

20
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:54,494
- Excellent.
- Brain food.

21
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,203
Thank you very much.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,021
You owe me.

23
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,444
Can't a guy just buy
some bagels for his friends

24
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,566
so they'll owe him a favor,
which he can use

25
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:07,521
to get someone fired who stole
a co-manager position from him anymore?

26
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,368
Jeez...

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,470

36
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:36,304
Pam, would you care for a bagel?

37
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:40,838
That's right, you're a woman,
and you need to refuse the first time.

38
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:41,893
I'll try again.

39
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,271
Please, Pam,
reconsider and have a bagel.

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,936
I have an early lunch.

41
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,249
Michael's been trying
to get Jim and me to hang out

42
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:51,945
since he started dating my mom.

43
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,255
I don't know, I really hoped
this thing would just die out.

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,351
But today he's planning
a birthday lunch for my mom,

45
00:01:58,476 --> 00:01:59,876
and we have to go.

46
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:01,917
No way out.

47
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,929
No way out.

48
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,177
These are amazing.
You took all these?

49
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,588
I've always found beauty
in uncommon places.

50
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,341
Homeless people.
Graffiti.

51
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,963
Photography lets me
capture all that.

52
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:17,637
Have you ever been photographed?

53
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,055
Just by, like, friends.

54
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,773
Here's what I've been doing
around here.

55
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,394
It's for a series
on exposure in the workplace.

56
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,192
Happy birthday.

57
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,570
Girls... There they are.

58
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,363
Birthday lunch...

59
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,689
There's no better medicine

60
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:41,637
than birthday lunch.
It'll cure all of your...

61
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,904
"Gee, I don't know if Michael
should be dating my mother."

62
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:47,817
and fixes all occurrences of,

63
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,359
"I don't really see them together."

64
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,024
so open wide, Pam,

65
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:55,229
and take a big ol'spoonful
of birthday lunch medicine.

66
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:56,531
Take with food.

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,179
Aren't you gonna introduce us
to Michael's girlfriend?

68
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,899
I think you guys all remember my mom
from the wedding.

69
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:06,102
I think everyone's met Helene.
Shall we?

70
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,259
Wait,
is that another present for me?

71
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,440
'Cause you already
gave me a necklace.

72
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:13,067
- I love it.
- Tell her how you gave it to me.

73
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,875
He put it around my neck
while I was still asleep this morning.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,740
What a nice way to wake up.

75
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,243
The rest of the story has been censored
due to inappropriosity.

76
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:24,258
Because of sex?

77
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,456
Please, Kevin...
You're fired.

78
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,626
Sorry.
Work with a bunch of idiots.

79
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,669
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

80
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,141
Wait. Swartz Lumber
is on the phone for you, Pam,

81
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,016
and they say it's urgent.

82
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:39,129
You guys, just one second.

83
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,138
My gosh!

84
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,432
Are you serious?

85
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:48,019
Shipping emergency.
I don't think I can go to lunch.

86
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:49,897
Man, that's crazy.

87
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,648
We were on our way out too.

88
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,775
I know.
Isn't that always how it goes?

89
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,243
Rarely, if ever.

90
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,251
I'll talk to him.

91
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,413
- I want to handle it. I feel like.
- It's my pleasure.

92
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:04,479
That's great.
Turns out the paper was there all along.

93
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,079
Thank god.

94
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:08,484
Something's up.

95
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,583
That paper
was never supposed to arrive.

96
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,466
So, Pammy,
are you still liking sales?

97
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:14,923
It's exciting.

98
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:18,901
You know, Michael and I were...

99
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,748
talking, and...

100
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:23,947
maybe if you put in a little more
face-to-face time with your clients,

101
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:26,099
you could improve your sales.

102
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,849
Pam's sales are fine, actually.

103
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,894
Just want you to succeed, Pammy.

104
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:33,349
We shouldn't even be talking
about business today.

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,981
Today's about family.

106
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,235
Why did I get in the car?

107
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,786
I could have struggled.

108
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,489
I have a whistle in my purse.
I didn't even blow it.

109
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,785
Dwight,
I have a little surprise for you.

110
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:48,870
Let me guess,
you ate the bagel and loved it.

111
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,827
And I wanted to return the favor.

112
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:55,245
I was polishing my loafers,
and I happened to look over

113
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,673
and notice that your briefcase
was a little worse for the wear.

114
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,463
So a little elbow grease,
and she's polished right up,

115
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,338
back to her former glory.

116
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,935
Feel it against your cheek.

117
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,996
I will.

118
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,934
You give me a gift...
Thank you note.

119
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,552
You invite me somewhere...
RSVP.

120
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,504
You do me a favor...

121
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:16,895
Favor returned.

122
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:19,914
Do not test my politeness.

123
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,521
Let me get that door for you.
There we go.

124
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:24,576
Thank you very much.
And I got it for you.

125
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,701
Goodness.

126
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,120
You know,
here's a healthy fitness tip.

127
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,874
If you clench
your buttocks together,

128
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,706
you can take the pressure
off your knees.

129
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,526
- Is that right?
- Observe.

130
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,254
That really works.

131
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,428
Feel free to use that anytime.

132
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:41,936
Hold on a second.

133
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:44,050
Do not walk around with your

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,670
jacket cattywampus.

135
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,847
And that needs to be
straight as an arrow.

136
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,477
Boy.
Thank you very much for that.

137
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,369
Have a seat. Allow me.

138
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,051
Have a seat yourself.

139
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:01,092
You know what, I am going
to preemptively change the batteries

140
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,529
- in your wireless mouse.
- Not necessary.

141
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,281
You don't have to do that.

142
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,533
Andy is complicating things.

143
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:10,411
But I'm not worried.
This will only up my game.

144
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,873
Hello. "Scott", table for four.

145
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:15,994
Welcome, Scott family.

146
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:17,774
It'll be just a moment.

147
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,432
I used to love coming here.

148
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:22,383
The chicken parm is good.
Big part of my childhood.

149
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,479
Maybe Michael
will start dating that too.

150
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,137
What table should we take?
So many to choose from.

151
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,495
What?
All I see are boring old tables

152
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,830
with no birthday decorations.

153
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:39,105
Wait a second!
You mean this one?

154
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:42,360
Michael, you did all this?

155
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:44,402
It's not about taking credit.
We all did it.

156
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:46,986
Thank you. All of you.

157
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,826
It was actually me alone, so...

158
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:51,668
Look at this place.

159
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:53,995
It really makes me
want to go to Italy someday.

160
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,508
You'll love it.
You can have my guide books.

161
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,990
I think I'm done
with those really long plane rides.

162
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,415
Thank you for...

163
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,128
lending me the book.

164
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:05,423
So, mom, which birthday
are we celebrating this year?

165
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,926
Sticking with 49.

166
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,095
49 again?

167
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,305
That's nine years in a row.
This is our longest family tradition.

168
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:12,619
That's funny.

169
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,893
As long as you're running numbers,
help me out with this one.

170
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,708
Let's see, honey,

171
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,891
you're six months pregnant,
but only been married for 30 days.

172
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,916
So what does that add up to?

173
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,517
Burn on you.

174
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,404
And a little bit on me too.

175
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,201
You're 54 years old.

176
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:30,518
I'm 58.

177
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,561
You're 58 years old?

178
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,400
Congratulations.

179
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:39,304
The only time you should care
about a woman's age

180
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:40,981
is if she is too young for you.

181
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,813
And I am not robbing the cradle.

182
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,324
If anything,

183
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:47,427
I am robbing the grave.

184
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,768
Have you decided
what you want to be called?

185
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,143
I like "nana."

186
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,632
But I also like
the classic "grandma."

187
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,642
- I want you to be grandma.
- Definitely.

188
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,868
Michael, what do you think?
Grandma?

189
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,307
Grandma.

190
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:09,685
Would you guys
ever do a triathlon, you think?

191
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:11,626
Maybe.

192
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,557
I don't think so.

193
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:16,535
I am.
I'm definitely gonna do it.

194
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,209
I've already got
the run and the bike thing down.

195
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:22,207
I just need to learn how to swim.
Come on, you in?

196
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,456
No, I think a triathlon
is pretty much something I can

197
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:26,581
rule out.

198
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:28,300
It doesn't interest me.

199
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,675
So it's a matter of interest. Good.

200
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,491
It's not anything
you would have ever done.

201
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:36,903
I might when I was younger,
but there are other things

202
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:39,172
that I'd rather be doing
than running and jumping.

203
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:41,497
There's no jumping in a triathlon.

204
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:44,438
You're thinking the broad jump.
Would you try...

205
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,343
- Bungee jumping?
- No.

206
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,775
- Snowboarding?
- You want to go snowboarding?

207
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:49,943
I might.

208
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:52,776
Michael, what are you talking about?

209
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:55,991
Nothing.
Just life and...

210
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:59,195
doing things...

211
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,632
Before you die.
I don't know.

212
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,535
Do I really want to go snowboarding?

213
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,644
But I would like to if I wanted to.

214
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,663
- What's going on in here?
- Andy bought lunch.

215
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:19,353
No, really?

216
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,934
Took a page right out
of the old Schrute book of niceness.

217
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,356
There is no book.
There's only a survival guide.

218
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,090
You bought breakfast for everyone,
so I got lunch for everyone.

219
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:32,152
Allow me.
You know what...

220
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,922
Gosh, these tacos
are awfully complicated to make.

221
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,149
I will make everyone's tacos.

222
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,912
- So we should get the check?
- What about your gift, Michael?

223
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,111
It's stupid.
You'd hate it. I hate it.

224
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,666
- I'm sure I won't.
- You will.

225
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,734
He locked himself in his office
all morning working on it.

226
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,760
Gimme!
Look at this wrapping paper.

227
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:54,132
It's got the word "love"
on it in every language!

228
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:58,004
I literally put no thought
into the wrapping at all.

229
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,021
Might as well
have been toilet paper.

230
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,224
Toilet paper...

231
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,787
"A scrapbook of our first memories"

232
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,771
by Michael Gary Scott.

233
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,082
"For my girlfriend Helene

234
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,759
"on your birthday."

235
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:14,653
That's just an arbitrary title.

236
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,155
- Here's a penny. What's that from?
- Penny for your thoughts.

237
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,217
It was from the wishing well
at the mall.

238
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:22,536
You threw it in, and I went back later,
waded in, and I found it.

239
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,152
- That's amazing!
- It's not amazing at all.

240
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,522
It's sort of weird
that I went and did that.

241
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,961
And now your wish won't come true,
so that blows.

242
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,253
- A poem.
- That I plagiarized, I think.

243
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,635
"I cannot go to school today
said little Peggy Ann McKay."

244
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:42,305
- Is that Shel Silverstein?
- "I have the measles and the mumps,

245
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,619
"a gash, a rash, and purple bumps,

246
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,323
"and my teacher's really mean...

247
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:49,062
Happy birthday,
I love you, Helene. "

248
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,773
That's really nice, Michael.

249
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:53,292
I think it sucks.

250
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,735
I think it's absolutely wonderful.

251
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,029
That's because you and I
have very different taste.

252
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,707
And you like lame things.

253
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:01,282
It's a generational

254
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:03,466
sort of gap between us.

255
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,328
God, a scrapbook.

256
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,248
- Home run, Michael.
- You set the bar so high.

257
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,708
That was a bunt.

258
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,554
Dwight, I'm gonna do this.

259
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,840
- Relax. I got it covered.
- No, I insist.

260
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,050
No, I insist.

261
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:22,220
This is ridiculous.

262
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,848
Don't worry about it.
You can just owe me.

263
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:29,019
- Where'd you go?
- Just went to the bathroom.

264
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,563
And then you stopped at the bar
on the way back?

265
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,832
Got thirsty.

266
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:34,530
Okay, weirdo.

267
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,555
Come on, it's time for cake.

268
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:40,887
Honestly, for a long time I thought
I was going to grow old with Holly.

269
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:43,603
And then I met Helene,

270
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,297
and she is great.

271
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,150
And she already knows
and has done everything

272
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,275
that I have ever wanted to do,

273
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:52,729
and...

274
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,688
can tell me about it.

275
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:56,442
But...

276
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:57,734
I think

277
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,674
I want to do those things myself.

278
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:01,427
The cake's really good.

279
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:04,014
I know. I love it
when they use butter-cream frosting.

280
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,263
Finish your cake.

281
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,851
I want you to enjoy that cake

282
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:11,144
because I have something terrible
I need to tell you,

283
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:12,638
and I want you

284
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,631
to enjoy your cake

285
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:16,566
before I tell you

286
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,068
this terrible thing.

287
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,130
I think you're a wonderful person...

288
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:27,663
God, I've enjoyed dating you
and being your boyfriend so much.

289
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,645
But I have to consider

290
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
Pam's feelings as a friend

291
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,659
and a co-worker,

292
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,790
I cannot in good conscience

293
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,415
continue to date you

294
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:40,299
when I know
what this is doing to her.

295
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,616
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

296
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:47,011
I know that it took me
a little while to come around,

297
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:49,435
and it's still a little weird
to get used to,

298
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,603
but...

299
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:53,230
you obviously make my mom
very happy.

300
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,601
And that makes me happy.

301
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,613
You've really grown.

302
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:02,364
Well...

303
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,983
Oh, thank you, Pam.

304
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,826
And I hope you're as gracious

305
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,412
during this next part.

306
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,426
Helene, once again,

307
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,805
you are a wonderful person,
and you have lived a great life.

308
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,404
And I envy it.
And I want it, someday.

309
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,179
But just in the future.

310
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,176
You need somebody
who understands your references.

311
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,351
Who is Kafkaesque?
I've never... I don't know him.

312
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,810
There's another woman,

313
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,520
and her name is Italy...

314
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:31,945
And skydiving...

315
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,146
- And bungee jumping.
- Okay, so...

316
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:35,618
And I want kids.

317
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,632
And you, unfortunately,

318
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,778
have already completed
that part of your journey down there.

319
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,765
It's not my decision.
It's mother nature.

320
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,640
And mother
has very strict rules about fer...

321
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,840
tility.

322
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:57,998
I got it.

323
00:13:58,556 --> 00:13:59,556
I'm 58.

324
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,116
What am I supposed to do now?

325
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:04,544
- Well, hobbies...
- Stop.

326
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:08,995
What?

327
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,558
Stupid thing wedged up there.
No one in this office will help me.

328
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,926
Yeah. Move it.

329
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,481
What if Dwight dies
and I still owe him something?

330
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,523
That is a recipe for a ghost.

331
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,636
- You're gonna owe me big time.
- It's like a little envel...

332
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,875
Yep. Got it.
"To Dwight"?

333
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,618
- A starbucks gift card.
- Surprise!

334
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,954
It's for everybody.

335
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,622
$15 value.

336
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:38,232
Damn it!
I am no closer to taking Jim down.

337
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,464
What a waste of the day.

338
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,677
I could have grown poison mushrooms
that'd be this high by now!

339
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,386
They're mushrooms.
They don't get that high.

340
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,387
- Pamela Beesly Halpert.
- What?

341
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:52,229
May I have a word with you
in my office?

342
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,871
- I am working.
- Well...

343
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,841
- This is a work-related matter.
- Really?

344
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:01,961
Join me, please, won't you?

345
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,866
- I'm going to give you a raise.
- Why?

346
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,743
Because of all the good work
you've done.

347
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,953
I have the lowest sales record
of anyone here.

348
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,623
It's not about numbers.
It's about attitude.

349
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,376
I have the worst attitude
of any person here.

350
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,790
Do you want the raise or what?

351
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:23,756
Yeah, I'll take it.

352
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:27,259
With this raise
there are strings attached.

353
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,079
And the string

354
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:33,684
is attached from my heart
to your mean attitude.

355
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,392
You're bribing me.

356
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,686
No, I am not.

357
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,147
Unless you want me to.
You want me to? 'cause I will.

358
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,828
I will bribe you.

359
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:46,872
Your face is saying... don't.

360
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,655
Unless I haven't offered you enough.

361
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:52,261
Your face isn't changing.

362
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:54,298
What is it?

363
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,039
Talk to me, face.
Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking.

364
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,168
Come on, what do you want?
What do you want?

365
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,720
Do you want a million dollars?
Do you want to hit me?

366
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,422
You want me to get down and beg you?

367
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,882
I want to hit you.

368
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,343
- What?
- I want to hit you. I'll do that.

369
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,473
What? I don't...
Are you kidding?

370
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,141
No. Are you kidding?

371
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,809
Ye... No. I don't...

372
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:19,180
All right, come on.

373
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:22,108
I take off my jacket, tense my stomach,
and you just...

374
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:25,363
I don't think I can hit you...

375
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:26,527
in the office.

376
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:29,822
So we'll do it after work.

377
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,115
In the parking lot.

378
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,790
In front of everyone.

379
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,555
I'm gonna hit you as hard as I can.

380
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,079
- See you then.
- See you.

381
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,839
Quick question.

382
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:48,841
Are you scared?

383
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:51,017
Never.

384
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,428
About what? A little.
What are you talking about?

385
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,452
- We heard about the punch.
- What punch?

386
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,433
Pam's gonna punch the crap
out of your face after work.

387
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,286
I'm pretty sure we said "slap."

388
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:01,486
No, it's a punch.

389
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,860
And Pam has that crazy
pregnancy strength now.

390
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:05,369
I'm getting concerned

391
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:08,068
that you don't seem to understand
what's going to happen.

392
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:09,544
Do you?

393
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:12,948
- I'm good.
- All right, see you there.

394
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,517
- Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
- Inappropriate.

395
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:19,455
I mean,

396
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,248
do you ever wrestle?

397
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:23,959
- All the time.
- Really? Is she strong?

398
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,128
- She wants it bad.
- Can you stop this?

399
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:27,297
I can.

400
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:30,299
And I don't support
her choice to hit you.

401
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,177
- I don't either.
- But at the same time, she goes crazy.

402
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,597
And I do understand her reasoning.

403
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:37,890
I know.

404
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,601
I just need some time
to think about it.

405
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,145
You gotta do something.
How much time do you need?

406
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:46,273
- No more than a week. Maybe two.
- Come on, man!

407
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:48,150
Can I talk to you for a second?

408
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:50,360
I heard about the hit.

409
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,237
It's off company property, right?

410
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,656
So, it's okay.

411
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,366
The power comes from the back foot.

412
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:06,135
So it's all one motion
through the body.

413
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,212
So there's...
You stay a little low.

414
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,882
There's a twist.
You keep your shoulder down.

415
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:14,092
You kind of throw out the arm.

416
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,969
Okay, wait. It's...

417
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,390
Yore saying it comes from the foot?

418
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,190
Hey, everybody,
he's not in the men's room,

419
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:30,984
although the seat was warm,
so we may have just missed him.

420
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:32,486
My money's on Pam.

421
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,155
It's not a fight.
What other outcome could there be?

422
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,158
- Michael could win.
- How? He can't hit back.

423
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,994
Why can't you just
agree with me sometimes?

424
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,854
Am I scared
of getting hit in the face? No.

425
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:46,801
Every day, weirdos pay dominatrices
hundreds of dollars

426
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,626
for that very privilege.

427
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,811
I'm scared I'm gonna love it.

428
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,673
Let's do this!

429
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:55,092
It's okay, guys, I can handle this.

430
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:58,303
- Everybody can go home.
- We're here for the show, Michael.

431
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,681
You're just a bunch of <i>voyeurs</i>.

432
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,227
- Are you eating popcorn?
- It has almost no calories.

433
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,351
You ready?

434
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:10,288
- You have to keep your hands down.
- I know.

435
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,157
- Keep your hands down.
- Put your hands in your pockets.

436
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:32,838
- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?

437
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,340
So many things.
I don't know, it's hard to choose.

438
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,718
- How'bout for dating my mom.
- Maybe that's...

439
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,591
And dumping her on her birthday.

440
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:50,061
Don't ever date
a member of my family again.

441
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:52,733
No problem.

442
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,737
For the record,
your mom came on to me.

443
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,121
Holy crap!

444
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,493
- Are you okay?
- No!

445
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:05,996
You're okay.

446
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,958
- Feel better?
- No. You were right.

447
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,799
- Wait, why are you limping?
- I don't know.

448
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,725
Let's get some raw meat
on that face.

449
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,722
I've got a chicken
in the freezer upstairs.

450
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:21,386
As I watched Pam's

451
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,263
big, strong hand
coming toward my face,

452
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:27,300
I saw my entire life flash
before my eyes.

453
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:28,901
And guess what.

454
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,495
I have four kids.

455
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,115
And I have a hover-car
and a hover-house.

456
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,988
And my wife is a runner,
and it shows.

457
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:42,703
And Pam and Jim are my best friends,
and our kids play together.

458
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:46,268
And I am happy,

459
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:47,854
I'm rich,

460
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:49,901
and I never die.

461
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:54,839
It doesn't sound like much,
but it's enough for me.

462
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,071
Good, just keep it
for another five minutes,

463
00:20:58,196 --> 00:20:59,809
let the swelling go down.

464
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:03,845
Thanks, I owe you one.

465
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,154
Fire Jim.

466
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,521
- I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.
- What are you talking about?

467
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,481
Promote me, try manager.

468
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,816
- Forget that.
- Can I have an office?

469
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,528
You can keep your stupid favor,
it's worthless.

470
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,322
And this is my dinner on your face.
I'm keeping it.

471
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:25,404
It feels better.
