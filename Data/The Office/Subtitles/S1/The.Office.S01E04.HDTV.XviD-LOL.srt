00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,866
1x04 : The Alliance
by belkiss, unfold & Oceane

2
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,458
- Michael !
- Oh god, Dwight come on !

3
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:39,944
I wanted to talk to you
about the downsizing.

4
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,429
There's no downsizing.

5
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:44,102
But if there were, I'd be protected
as assistant regional manager ?

6
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:47,130
- Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
- Yeah, so I don't have to worry ?

7
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,687
Look look look, I talked to corporate,

8
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:52,457
About protecting the sales staff and
they said they couldn't guarantee it

9
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:55,996
If there's downsizing. Ok ?
But, there's no downsizing.

10
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,688
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried ?

11
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:00,722
Maybe.

12
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,472
<i>It looks like there's
gonna be downsizing.</i>

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,352
That is part of my job, but...

14
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,121
I hate it

15
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,188
I think the main difference
between me and Donald Trump

16
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:15,747
Is that I get no pleasure out of
saying the words "you're fired"

17
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,568
"You're fired", "you're fired".

18
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:20,761
He just makes people sad.

19
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:22,947
And an office can't function that way.

20
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:24,924
No way. "You're fired".

21
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,401
I think that if I had a
catch phrase it would be,

22
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,716
"you're hired, and you can work
here as long as you want".

23
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:32,796
But that's unrealistic so...

24
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:37,970
<i>It's a real shame,</i>

25
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,723
<i>cause studies have shown that more
information get passed through,</i>

26
00:01:40,753 --> 00:01:42,798
<i>water cooler gossips than
through official memos,</i>

27
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:46,543
Which puts me in a disadvantage because

28
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,222
I bring my own water to work.

29
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,168
- Why did you do this ?
- I didn't do it.

30
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,582
What do you mean ?

31
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,036
The water cooler was
brought over here for...

32
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,772
Maintenance.

33
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,836
So why are you guys here ?

34
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,300
What's the schedule bud'?

35
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:08,441
Gets that, for operation
moral improvement,

36
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:10,511
Starring Michael Scott.

37
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,900
Now I think I had a
little stroke of genius,

38
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,672
in that I have had
my assistant Pam,

39
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:19,222
smile Pam, I have had her go out
and find out whose birthday,

40
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,523
is coming up, so we can
have a little celebration for it.

41
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,701
Not bad, not bad at all, all right.

42
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,524
And the birthday person is :
Drum roll please....

43
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,259
who is it ?
Whose the birthday ?

44
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,762
Actually we don't have any
staff birthdays coming up.

45
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:44,493
- Next person on the calendar.
- Ok.

46
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:47,109
- That would be Meredith.
- Yes all right.

47
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:51,780
- Come on down Meredith !
- But it's not until next month.

48
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,495
Ok.

49
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,389
Great ! you know, it will be a surprise.

50
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:01,071
- You still want to have a party ?
- Yeah why not, sure,

51
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:03,200
go ahead ! Lead a little.
Come on Pam.

52
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,785
Come on shake it up, shake it in.

53
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,714
Shake it up.

54
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:13,174
Spok, is there any signs
of life down there ?

55
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:14,997
Well, let me check captain.

56
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,241
No captain no signs of life down there.

57
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,290
Just a wet blanket, named Pam.

58
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:31,579
Star Trek.

59
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:34,888
Well for decorations maybe we could...

60
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:37,878
- Stupid forget it.
- What ?

61
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,339
I was just gonna say maybe
we could have streamers but,

62
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,232
that's dumb. Everybody have streamers.

63
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,435
- Never mind
- No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.

64
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,826
What color do you guys think ?

65
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:51,557
Well there's green.

66
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:53,838
Blue.

67
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:55,565
Yellow.

68
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:57,938
- Red.
- How about green ?

69
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,542
I think green is kind of whorish.

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,346
<i>This was tough.</i>

71
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,449
I suggested we flip a coin.

72
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,237
But Angela said she
doesn't like to gamble.

73
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:11,240
Of course by saying that she was
gambling that I wouldn't smack her.

74
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,253
These are my party
planning biatches,

75
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,742
Pulled off an amazing
eighties party last year.

76
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,584
"Off the hook" !

77
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,865
<i>So I was thinking, if you
haven't already got the cake...</i>

78
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:25,680
Maybe going for one of those ice
cream cakes from Baskin Robbins...

79
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:27,581
they're very good. Very delicious.

80
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,780
Meredith is allergic to dairy so...

81
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,920
She's not the only one
that's gonna be eating right ?

82
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,028
I think everybody likes ice cream cake.

83
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:38,105
It's not, not just about her so...

84
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,343
- It's her birthday.
- Milk chocolate chip !

85
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:41,741
Would be good.

86
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:50,056
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that
it might be a good idea...

87
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:52,766
if you and I formed an alliance.

88
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,644
Because of the downsizing.

89
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,563
I think an alliance
might be a good idea.

90
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,358
You know, help each other out.

91
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,104
Do you want to form an alliance ?

92
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,419
With me ?

93
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:11,687
- Absolutely I do.
- Good, good.

94
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,509
Excellent, ok, now we need
to figure out who's vulnerable...

95
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,138
who's protected the...

96
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,314
At that moment <i>I was just so happy.</i>

97
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:21,092
I mean everything Dwight does,
annoys me.

98
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,215
Did you get your tickets ?

99
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,835
To what ?

100
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,745
The gun show.

101
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,047
And I spend...

102
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:36,478
hours thinking of ways
to get back at him...

103
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:38,976
but only ways that would get me arrested.

104
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:43,336
Then here he comes and
he says "no, Jim, here's a way".

105
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,553
Just one other thing
and this is important.

106
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,666
Let's keep this alliance
totally a secret.

107
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:50,325
Yeah.

108
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,331
Don't tell anyone.

109
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,280
- An alliance ?
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:55,738
What does that even mean ?

111
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:58,476
I think it has something to do with
"survivor", but I'm not sure.

112
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:04,273
I know that it involves spying on
people and we may build a fort, Pam.

113
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,579
Jim ? Hey, Hi Pam.

114
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,650
Can I talk to you a second
about the paper products ?

115
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:13,418
- Did you tell Pam about the alliance ?
- No !

116
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,096
- Just now !
- Oh no, no, no !

117
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:17,315
Dwight no. I'm using her...

118
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:20,373
for the alliance, who knows the
most information about this office ?

119
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,502
- Pam ! Right.
- That's good, good, pursue this !

120
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,723
I'm trying to,.
Do you see what I'm doing ?

121
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,884
But listen, I'm gonna have
to talk to her a lot.

122
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,594
All right, there might
chatting, and giggling,

123
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:32,085
And you got to just pretend
to ignore it, wipe it away.

124
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,021
Done !
All right.

125
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,661
Can you get her, she's right there.
That is Meredith.

126
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,976
The birthday girl.

127
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:51,928
And this...

128
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:54,423
Is Meredith card. "Happy Bird-day."

129
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:59,189
Let's see... Jim.

130
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,954
Jim wrote : "Meredith I heard you're
turning forty-six but come on...

131
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,742
You're an accountant,
just fudge the numbers"

132
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,921
Not bad, pretty funny.

133
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:11,579
I don't appreciate condoning
corporate fraud though.

134
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:15,023
Here's the thing,
whatever I write here...

135
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,004
has to be really really funny.

136
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,367
Because people out
there are expecting it.

137
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,894
I've already set the bar really high.

138
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,286
<i>And they're all worried
about their jobs,</i>

139
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,221
<i>you know, it's kind of dark out there.</i>

140
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,887
<i>Can you imagine</i>
if I wrote something like :

141
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,993
"Meredith, happy birthday...

142
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:35,889
you're great, love Michael".

143
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,275
They seem awfully chummy.
Don't you think ?

144
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,619
Yeah, what do you think that's about ?

145
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,011
Only one way to find out.

146
00:07:50,474 --> 00:07:52,191
Come on.

147
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:57,275
- You are not going to believe this.
- What ? I believe it.

148
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,468
- Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
- I can tell from the body language.

149
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,410
- That looks good, what is it, turkey ?
- Italian.

150
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,449
Oh Italian ! Nice. Wow.

151
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:10,008
Get the works there.
Red onion, provolone...

152
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:10,924
Yeah.

153
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,442
<i>Toby and Kevin, they're trying
to get Angela kicked off.</i>

154
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,296
Good ! Let them,
That's fine it helps our cause.

155
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:18,082
Well I don't know.
Because if Kevin is in accounting...

156
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,121
and Toby is in human resources...
and they're talking ?

157
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:22,331
They're forming an alliance.

158
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,613
- I love their sandwich.
- I love their sandwich too.

159
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,675
- Their bread is really good.
- Their bread is very good.

160
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:29,913
Damn it ! God !

161
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:32,344
God !

162
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:36,791
Ok, listen.

163
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:40,281
We need to assume that everyone
in the office is forming an alliance.

164
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:42,145
And is therefore trying
to get us kicked out.

165
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,633
Damn it, why us ?

166
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,344
Because we're strong Dwight,
because we're strong.

167
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,651
Meredith, Meredith...

168
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,013
"Mary had a little lamb"...

169
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,477
Meredith had a little lamb,

170
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:57,058
don't bring that lamb to work
or it'll poop on the floor...

171
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,576
Hey ! Oscar ! Come on in. What's up ?

172
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:02,049
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No not at all come on in.

173
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:05,295
- What's going on ?
- My nephew is involved with...

174
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:08,304
With charity for Cerebral Palsy,

175
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:10,812
And I was wondering
if maybe you would like to.

176
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,304
- You know, if...
- What ?

177
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,040
A donate to the charity.

178
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:18,105
Oh God !'Course I would.

179
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,529
Get it over here ! Get that over here.

180
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,066
- Thank you.
- No I'm always good...

181
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:28,330
For some serious buckage.
Wow ! Two dollars, three dollars ?

182
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,706
People out here, do not care about...

183
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:33,770
diseases.

184
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,185
I'm going to give you
twenty five dollars.

185
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,422
That's...

186
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,162
- That's, that's very generous.
- Oh my gosh, well.

187
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,792
Listen Oscar, generosity and
togetherness, and community...

188
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,460
all convalescences into...

189
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,833
Moral.

190
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,215
That's what I say, so...

191
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:01,945
- Hey Jim, can I talk to you for second ?
- Sure, what's up ?

192
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:05,398
I don't know I'm just
going a little crazy...

193
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:08,118
cause I keep overhearing
all these conversations...

194
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:12,604
between Michael and
corporate about like staff issues.

195
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,574
- Oh no !
- Yeah. He's making me take notes

196
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,989
on his meetings, and I'm like,
these people are my friends.

197
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,513
- Right.
- But he's all like

198
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,146
this is confidential you
can't tell anybody but..."

199
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,838
I don't know I just
feel like I want to...

200
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,131
Just promise me you're
gonna say anything.

201
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,596
- I will not. I'm not gonna tell anybody
- Ok.

202
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,585
- It's between you and me.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,026
Jackpot.

204
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,447
<i>That was beautiful.</i>
All her idea, too.

205
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,536
Awesome.

206
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,716
She's so great.

207
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,471
Meredith bad-breath.
Meredith has bad breath.

208
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:52,134
- Hey
- Hey

209
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,466
- You wanted to see me ?
- Yeah. What do you know about Meredith ?

210
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,844
I don't think she'd be missed.

211
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,101
There's not going to be
downsizing Dwight, ok ?

212
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,754
I just, I need to know
a little bit more about...

213
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,108
My friend.

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,536
Name : Meredith Palmer.

215
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:09,227
Personal information :
divorced twice, two kids.

216
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,792
Employer : Dundler Mifflin
Paper Incorporated.

217
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,552
- Awards : multiple "Dundies".
- I know that, I know,

218
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,332
I just, I need something
kind of embarrassing, you know.

219
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:20,356
- Kind of fun, inside.
- She had a hysterectomy.

220
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,389
- Which one is that again ?
- That's when they remove the uterus.

221
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:25,990
Ho, God ! Dwight no !

222
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,593
I'm trying to write
something funny here ok ?

223
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:31,372
What am I gonna do with
a removed uterus ?

224
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:34,844
- It can be kind of funny.
- You know what, I'm on a deadline here,

225
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,502
And just, ok, thanks,
thanks for your help,

226
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll work it out, thank you Dwight.

227
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,342
That wasn't a waste of time.

228
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,129
Ok, here's the deal, all right.

229
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,618
Pam says that one of
the alliances is meeting...

230
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,290
- In the warehouse during Meredith birthday.
- Oh, my god we have to be there.

231
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,805
I know ! But it's going
to be a little tough

232
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,302
- Because there's no good place to hide.
- No no ! Yes there is.

233
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,637
- Behind the shells. Oh my god.
- What ? What ? What ?

234
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:01,685
- I know. I know exactly what to do.
- Great.

235
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,299
<i>I'm a deer hunter.</i>
I go all the time with my dad.

236
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,052
One thing about deer.
They have very good vision.

237
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,753
One thing about me...

238
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:14,688
I'm better at hiding
than they are at vision.

239
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,068
It's gonna be perfect, ok ?
Centrally located,

240
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,325
Perfect cover, I can hear
and see everything.

241
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,158
Good.

242
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:24,470
- Michael ?
- Just a sec.

243
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:25,396
- Are you done yet ?
- Almost there.

244
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,489
Ok. Just a second.
It is perfect.

245
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,325
Thank you, excellent, here we go.

246
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:33,865
It is time, thank you, ok come one !
Let's go ! Get the cake, let's go.

247
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,977
Here we go !
Come on come on come on !

248
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:37,907
Be quiet.

249
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,024
Wait this isn't gonna work.
The lid is open.

250
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,204
- So tape it down.
- I can't do that,

251
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,879
- then you won't be able to breathe.
- I can breathe just fine, ok ?

252
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:48,346
But if it makes you feel better,
I'll poke holes in the box.

253
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:51,001
- Thank you. Thank you,
- Ok.

254
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,960
Surprise !

255
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,738
- Surprise !
- No, it's...

256
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,689
It's surprise Meredith !
One, Two.

257
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:05,490
Happy birthday to you

258
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,632
- Find the key.
- Happy birthday.

259
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:11,519
So you want me to stay here,
and stand next to the box.

260
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:14,509
No, you need to go
upstairs to the party.

261
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,069
- So people don't notice we're both gone.
- Right. That's good.

262
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,480
Can I trust Jim ? I don't know.

263
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:23,316
<i>Do I have a choice ? No.</i>

264
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:25,891
<i>Frankly I don't. Will I trust Jim ?
Yes.</i>

265
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:28,960
<i>Should I trust Jim ?</i>

266
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:30,609
You tell me.

267
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:33,628
<i>Happy birthday to you, Meredith...</i>

268
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:40,014
<i>Happy birthday to you,
and many more</i>

269
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,485
- You were surprised weren't you ?
- Yes.

270
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,001
You looked freaked, man,
when we said surprise

271
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,589
You were like, "what ?
What the hell is going on here ?

272
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:58,236
- Ice cake. Why don't you have some ?
- I can't.

273
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,838
- Come on, a little bit, a little bit.
- No I can't eat dairy.

274
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,338
Oh right. Oh god too bad it's so good.

275
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,104
That makes me sick.

276
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,518
You know what if I were allergic
to dairy I think I'd kill myself.

277
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,078
This is way way too good.

278
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,454
<i>- He's in a box ?
- Pam, he's in a BOX.</i>

279
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,129
He's downstairs, in a box,
on the floor near the shells.

280
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:26,227
So you just go down there,
and work your magic.

281
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:34,062
Hey ! Where are you ?
Yeah, we were supposed to meet here !

282
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,828
What ?

283
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:39,714
Oh my Gosh !

284
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:44,412
That ties in perfectly with something
that Michael was telling me earlier !

285
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:49,120
I just don't know what some of the
people in like accounting are gonna do.

286
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:52,756
It's not specifically that...

287
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:57,714
Hey Jim, good party eh ?

288
00:14:57,821 --> 00:15:01,351
Just a little some’ wiped up you know
a little moral boost, no big deal.

289
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:04,062
Speaking of which I meant
to tell you, very impressive,

290
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:06,772
the donation you gave
to Oscar's charity.

291
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,948
- Was that twenty-five bucks ?
- Well no, yeah you know.

292
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:13,602
Money isn't everything Jim.
Not the key to happiness.

293
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:16,032
You know what is ?
Joy.

294
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:20,055
You should remember that, maybe give
more than three dollars next time.

295
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,507
Yeah well, three dollars a miles
will end up like fifty bucks.

296
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:29,077
So, god, can't even calculate
what you're gonna have to give.

297
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,629
Is Oscar around ?

298
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,711
I just thought it was
a kind of a flat, you know,

299
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:44,682
twenty-five dollars one time donation.

300
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:47,904
Didn't think it was a per-mile
kind of deal, you know so...

301
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,846
- Well, that's what a walk-athon is.
- I know.

302
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:52,534
It says here right on the sheet.

303
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:56,190
Look look at the sheet, it says
"it's however many dollars per-mile".

304
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:58,939
Got it, yes so it does.

305
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:02,122
I just think it's kind of cheap to
undonate money to a charity.

306
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:05,711
No, no no no.
I wasn't I wasn't, no no,

307
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:07,679
It's it's not about the money.

308
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:11,171
It's just it it...
It's the ethics of the thing,

309
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,563
Oscar.

310
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:17,710
How's your nephew ?
Is he in a good shape ?

311
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:19,813
- Yeah.
- How many miles did he do last year ?

312
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:22,562
- Last year he walked eighteen miles.
- Son of a bitch !

313
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,417
That is impressive, good for him.

314
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,214
- Happy birthday Meredith.
- Read it out loud !

315
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:52,349
Say who wrote everything.
So we know whose is the best.

316
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,771
Happy bird-day.

317
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:01,735
"Meredith, good news !
You're not actually a year older,

318
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:04,947
Because you work here,
where time stand still."

319
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:09,308
- Not bad.
- That was Stanley.

320
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,845
"Meredith, happy birthday

321
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:15,028
You're the best, love Pam."

322
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,890
Thanks darer.

323
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:21,848
This is from Michael :

324
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:26,015
"Meredith. Let's hope that the only
downsizing that happens to you...

325
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,986
Is that someone downsizes your age."

326
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,094
Because of the downsizing. Rumours.

327
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:36,776
And because you're getting old.

328
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,164
No, I, I get it.

329
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,000
- It's funny.
- You didn't get the joke.

330
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,286
That's cool, that's you
know what actually

331
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,862
I have a bunch of these,

332
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,775
good ones that I didn't use.

333
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,610
What was that ?
Oh ok ! Here's a good one.

334
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:58,623
"Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants
her age back and her divorces back".

335
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,146
Cause Meredith has been
divorced like, twice. Is that right ?

336
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:04,054
- You're right.
- Is that right ?

337
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:05,683
- Ok.
- You're right. Yes

338
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:07,391
Divorce...

339
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,925
Oh ok, "Meredith is so old..."

340
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:15,310
- "How old is she ?"
- Right everybody, you can do it ?

341
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,211
"Meredith is so old..."

342
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:19,854
- How old is she ?
- "She's so old...

343
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,381
She went into an antique
store and they kept her".

344
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:30,889
That wasn't even mine, I got
that off the internet. Website.

345
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,455
Don't get mad at me.

346
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:36,185
- Nice party Michael.
- This isn't my fault.

347
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:41,635
Ladies, not your best effort.
Streamers ?

348
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,857
You could have done better
than that don't you think ?

349
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:48,273
- Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
- Oh, boy.

350
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:52,237
Ok we, all right people
hold on hold on.

351
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:56,004
Just a second ok, I think we're losing
sight of what is really important here.

352
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:58,369
And that is that we are...

353
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,912
A group of people who work together.

354
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:06,277
I was, I really wasn't
gonna with on this.

355
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:11,690
I've made a very sizable donation
to Oscar's nephews

356
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,873
walk-athon.

357
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,426
Twenty-five dollars.

358
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,374
- Per mile.
- Per-mile, yes.

359
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:21,718
When I retire I...

360
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,612
I don't want to just disappear
to one island somewhere.

361
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:27,728
I want to be the guy who
gives everything back.

362
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:31,249
A check for the kids, and for the teen.

363
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,188
<i>I want it to be like :</i>

364
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:38,223
"Who donated that hospital wing
that is saving somebody's life ?

365
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:42,602
Well, I don't know that was anonymous.

366
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,406
Guess what ?

367
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:47,589
That was Michael Scott.

368
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:50,821
But it was anonymous, how do you know ?

369
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,461
Because I met him."

370
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:58,104
Thank you Michael.

371
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,480
Come here.

372
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,712
Don't cash that until Friday ok ?

373
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,094
- Really today ?
- Yeah.

374
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,821
- Happy birthday.
- Nice.

375
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:11,059
- I could say something...
- No don't do that.

376
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:17,445
Ok, ok, I have something
that totally tops the box.

377
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:18,921
Oh tell me, tell me.

378
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:22,963
I have just convinced Dwight
that he needs to go to Stanford

379
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,802
and spy on our other branch,
no no no,<i> but before he does so,</i>

380
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:30,474
<i>I told him that he should die
his hair, to go undercover.</i>

381
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:33,487
If we can get him to
drive to Connecticut

382
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,799
and put some bright side in his hair.

383
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:36,828
What the hell is this ?

384
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,342
What, are you trying to cop
a feel or something Halpert ?

385
00:20:38,564 --> 00:20:41,090
- No, Dude no. Dude no ! Just listen !
- Hey hey, come on !

386
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:44,072
God, I don't even know
how to explain this.

387
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,902
Dwight asked me to be in an alliance,

388
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,815
And then...

389
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:53,034
We've just been messing with him

390
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:55,677
because of the whole alliance thing...

391
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:59,333
- It's just office pranks.
- It's stupid, it's just office pranks.

392
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:01,561
Dwight, what the hell
is he talking about ?

393
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:05,449
I have absolutely no idea.

394
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,240
Come on.

395
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,963
<i>Do I feel bad about betraying Jim ?</i>

396
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:18,240
<i>Not at all.</i>

397
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:21,336
<i>That's the game. Convince him
we're on an alliance.</i>

398
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:24,304
<i>Gets him information,
throw him to the wolves.</i>

399
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,082
That's politics baby, get
what you can out of someone,

400
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,050
Then crush them.

401
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,866
I think Jim might have learned
a very valuable lesson.
