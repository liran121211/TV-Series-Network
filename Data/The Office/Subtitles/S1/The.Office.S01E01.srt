00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:32,139
1x01: Downsizing

2
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,704
All right Jim your quarterlies look very good.

3
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:37,985
How are things going at the library?

4
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:40,168
Oh I told you couldn't close it.

5
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:43,613
So you've come to the master for guidance?

6
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,931
Is this what you'e saying "grasshopper"?

7
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,650
Actually you called me in here, but yeah.

8
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,581
All right, well let me show you how it's done.

9
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:54,402
Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager please?

10
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:57,998
Yes hello this is Michael Scott, I am the regional manager

11
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,903
of Dundler Mifflin paper products.

12
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,085
Just wanted to talk to you manager on manager.

13
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,915
All right done deal, thank you very much sir.

14
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:10,699
You're a gentleman and a scholar.

15
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:16,618
Oh I'm sorry, ok, sorry, my mistake.

16
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,820
That was a woman I was talking to...
she had a very low voice.

17
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:25,914
Probably a smoker.

18
00:01:29,884 --> 00:01:31,229
So that's the way it's done.

19
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:34,645
I've been in Dundler Mifflin for twelve years,

20
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:37,073
the last four as regional manager..

21
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,615
If you want to come through here..

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,682
We have the entire floor.

23
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,973
So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see.

24
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:47,947
Ah, this is our receptionist Pam.

25
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,888
Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly.

26
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,282
Pam has been with us for?

27
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:55,423
Forever, right Pam?

28
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:56,727
Well, I don't know..

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,022
If you think she's cute now

30
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:00,628
you should have seen her a couple of years ago!

31
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:01,230
What?

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,517
Any messages?

33
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:06,233
Yeah, just a fax

34
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:09,598
Pam this is from Corporate.

35
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,254
How many times have I told you that there's

36
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,461
a special filing cabinet for things from Corporate.

37
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:14,099
You haven't told me!

38
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:16,002
It's called the wastepaper basket.

39
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:19,545
Look at that !

40
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,441
Look at that face!

41
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,248
People say I'm the best boss.

42
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,621
They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before,

43
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:31,765
you're hilarious, and you get the best out of us."

44
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:37,464
I think that pretty much sums it up.

45
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,891
I found it at Spencer Gifts.

46
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:02,689
My job is to speak to clients

47
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:07,209
on the phone about quantities

48
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:11,970
and type of copier paper.

49
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,462
You know, whether we can supply to them

50
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:21,100
whether they can pay for it and...

51
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,606
I'm boring myself just talking about this.

52
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,551
He still loves that after seven years!

53
00:03:59,345 --> 00:03:59,665
What?

54
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,369
Nothing

55
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:04,773
Ok, all right. See you later

56
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,923
All right, take care.

57
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,905
Back to work.

58
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:23,024
Corporate really doesn't interfere with me at all, Jan Levinson-Gould

59
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,374
Jan, hello!

60
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,991
I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton, right?

61
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:29,736
Not to her face because,

62
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:33,996
not because I'm scared of her, because I'm not

63
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:35,257
but...

64
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:36,347
yeah.

65
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,184
All right, was it anything you wanted to add to the agenda?

66
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:43,101
Me no get an agenda.

67
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,159
I'm sorry, what?

68
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,339
I didn't get any agenda.

69
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,524
Well I faxed one over to you this morning.

70
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:52,581
Really? Cause I didn't.. Uh, did we get a fax this morning?

71
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,584
Yeah, the one?

72
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:58,449
Why isn't it in my hand?

73
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:01,238
Because a company runs on efficiency of communication, right?

74
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:05,790
So what's the problem Pam, why I didn't I get it?

75
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,569
You put it in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.

76
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,446
Yeah, that was a joke, that was actually my brother's,

77
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:23,561
it was supposed to be with bills and doesn't work great with faxes.

78
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:24,225
Do you want to look at mine?

79
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:26,458
Yeah. Thank you.

80
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:30,179
Ok since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided

81
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,890
that we can't justify Scranton branch and the Stafford branch

82
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,245
Oh ok?

83
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,453
No, Michael don't panic

84
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,788
No no no no this is good, this is fine

85
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,336
Michael listen, don't panic

86
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,339
We haven't made any decisions yet,

87
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,116
I've spoken to Joshua in Stanford, I've told him the same as you

88
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,412
and it's up to either you or him to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other

89
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:49,173
Ok no problem

90
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,243
This does however mean that there is going to be downsizing

91
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,277
Me no wanna hear that Jan,

92
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:56,114
because downsizing is a bitch,

93
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,080
it is a real bitch,

94
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,275
and I wouldn't wish that on Joshua's men,

95
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:03,611
I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men,

96
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:06,298
or women. Present company excluded...sorry.

97
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,716
is Josh concerned about downsizing himself?

98
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,512
Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?

99
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,615
Question: how long do we have to ?

100
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,843
Oh, Todd Packer, terrific rep, do you mind if I take it?

101
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,533
No, go ahead.

102
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:28,398
Pac man!

103
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:29,965
Hey, you big queen.

104
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,864
Oh, that's not appropriate..

105
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,312
Hey, <?is old gut zumee ?>coming in today?

106
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,796
I don't know what you mean

107
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:38,792
Look, I've been meaning to ask you one question

108
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,804
Does the curtain match the drapes?

109
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:41,932
Oh my god!

110
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:49,198
That's so horrifying! Horrible

111
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,774
Horrible person!

112
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,523
So do you think we can keep a lid on this for now I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.

113
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:02,150
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.

114
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,744
So what does downsizing actually mean?

115
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:06,534
Well

116
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:09,649
You guys gotta update your resume, just like I'm doing.

117
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:13,226
I bet it's gonna be me, probably.

118
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:14,946
Yeah, it'll be you

119
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:16,382
I have an important question for you.

120
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:17,003
Yes

121
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,335
Are you going to Angela's keg party on Sunday?

122
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:23,139
Yeah, stop. That's ridiculous.

123
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:26,387
Am I gonna tell them? No I'm not going to tell them, I don't see the point of that.

124
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,783
As a doctor you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.

125
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,016
This is Mister Scott.

126
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:36,903
Ryan Howard from the temp agency.

127
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,983
Ted Nickels sent me down to start today

128
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,456
Howard, like Moe Howard, Three Stooges?

129
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:51,944
Right here, my vibe. Oh Pam, that's a guy thing Pam.

130
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,246
I'm sort of a student of comedy

131
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:07,037
I'm Hitler, Adolph Hitler

132
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,294
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go.

133
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,895
Because then I might

134
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,841
It's just, I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist.

135
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,513
I like to do illustrations,

136
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,710
mostly water color, a few oil pencil.

137
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,999
Jim thinks they're good.

138
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,674
Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.

139
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,577
Sure, Mr. Davis, let me call you right back.

140
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:37,935
Yeah, some just came up, two minutes. Thank you very much.

141
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,723
Dwight, what are you doing?

142
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,148
- What?

143
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:41,227
- What are you doing?

144
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:43,405
Just clearing my desk, I can’t concentrate

145
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:44,515
- It's not on your desk.

146
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:45,288
- It's overlapping.

147
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:46,913
It's all coming over the edge.

148
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:50,282
One word, two syllables : demarcation.

149
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,927
- You can't do that.

150
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,273
- Why not?

151
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:06,075
Safety violation, I could fall and pierce, and organ.

152
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,307
We'll see

153
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,262
This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.

154
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,747
Downsizing?

155
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:22,208
I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since Halpert got here

156
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:24,642
even brought it up on my interview.

157
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,577
I say, bring it on!

158
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:32,483
You just still have messages for yesterday. Relax everything is under control

159
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:36,355
Yeah, yeah, yeah oh that's important, right.

160
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:40,059
Oh, this is so important, I should run to answer it.

161
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:00,807
What?

162
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:05,117
Come on. Six million dollars man, Steve Austin,

163
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,790
actually that would be a good salary for me don't you think? Six million dollars?

164
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:12,197
Memo to Jan: I deserve a raise

165
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,087
Don't we all?

166
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:15,589
I'm sorry?

167
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,720
There's nothing!

168
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:22,952
If you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR,

169
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,437
ok? Not today, ok? Pam just, be professional.

170
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,153
I think I'm a role model here, I think I garner other people's respect.

171
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:42,710
Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP

172
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:47,649
People I respect, heros of mine, would be Bob Hope,

173
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:54,389
Abraham Lincoln, definitely,

174
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,921
Bono,

175
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:03,707
and probably God be the fourth one.

176
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:12,573
And I just think all those people really helped the world, in so many ways,

177
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:18,640
that it's, it's really beyond words.

178
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,548
It's really uncalculable.

179
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:26,191
Now, I know there's some rumors out there, and 
I just kind want to see?

180
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,001
I'm the assistant regional manager, I should know first.

181
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,405
Assistant to the regional manager.

182
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,660
Ok. Can you just tell me please?

183
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,581
Just a whisper in my ear.

184
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,581
I’m about to tell everybody.

185
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,698
I'm just about to tell exeryone

186
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,853
Please, ok.

187
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:37,819
Do you want me to tell them?

188
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,668
You don't know what it is!

189
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:41,930
Can you tell them, with my permission?

190
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,001
I don't need your...

191
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,565
Permission granted. Go ahead

192
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:49,296
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

193
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:55,232
and Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stanford branch or this branch.

194
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:57,609
I heard they might be closing this branch down,

195
00:11:57,806 --> 00:11:58,801
That's just...

196
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,851
That's just the rumor going around 
this is my first day I don't really know.

197
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,901
Yeah, but Michael what if they downsize here?

198
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,176
Not gonna happen

199
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,518
It could be out of your hands, Michael

200
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:10,553
It won't be out of my hands, Stanley, ok?

201
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:11,425
I promise you that.

202
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,641
Can you promise that?

203
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:13,989
On his mother's grave.

204
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:22,707
Well yeah it is a promise, and frankly I'm a little bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

205
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:24,587
It's just that we need to know

206
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:29,188
Hold on a second, I think Pam wanted to say something, Pam?

207
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,816
You had a look that you wanted to ask a question, just then?

208
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:41,261
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

209
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:42,949
Are you sure about that?

210
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:49,893
Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.

211
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:52,326
Pam, information is power.

212
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,430
So you can't say for sure whether it's gotta to be us or them.

213
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:59,677
No no, no Stanley, no you did not see me in there with her.

214
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:07,608
I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and interfere
then they're gonna have to go through me, right?

215
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,875
You know, you can go a mess with Josh's people,

216
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,697
but I'm the head of this family,

217
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,386
and you ain't gonna be messing with my children.

218
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:27,933
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head?

219
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:31,878
You know, tonnage price of minal folders?

220
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,377
Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mix berry.

221
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,953
Jim said mix berries?

222
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:46,886
Yeah he's under me

223
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,034
Watch out for this guy Dwight Schrute in the building!

224
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:54,104
This is Ryan, the new temp.

225
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:55,375
Nice to meet you.

226
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:56,934
Introduce yourself, be polite

227
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,931
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.

228
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:00,924
Assistant to the Regional Manager.

229
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:05,656
So Dwight tell him about the kung fu, and the car and everything.

230
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:10,797
Yeah, I got a '78 28Z, I bought her for 1200, fixed it up, now worth three grand.

231
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:11,917
That is his profit!

232
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,302
New engine, suspension.. I've got some photos

233
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:18,490
Damn it!

234
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:20,611
Ok, hold on,

235
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:23,056
Judge is in cession. What is the problem here?

236
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:25,126
He put my stuff in jello again.

237
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,769
That's rough professional, thanks

238
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:32,096
That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first time.

239
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:37,102
It's ok here, but people somehow are taking advantage because it's so relaxed.

240
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:41,031
I'm a volunteer sheriff's deputy on the weekends,

241
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,679
and you cannot screw around there.

242
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,131
It's one of the rules.

243
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:46,741
What is that?

244
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,745
That's my stapler.

245
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,016
No no no, do not take it out!

246
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:51,323
You have to eat it out there,

247
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,417
because there are starving people in the world,

248
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:56,565
and which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.

249
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:57,610
Ok, you know what? You can be a witness.

250
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,042
Can you reprimand him please?

251
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,070
- How do you know it was me?

252
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,146
- It's always you.

253
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:04,423
- Are you gonna discipline him or not?

254
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,790
Ooh discipline, kinky!

255
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:09,512
All right, here's the deal you guys

256
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:13,956
the thing about practical jokes, is that you have to know when to start, as well as when to stop!

257
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:21,912
And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into jello.

258
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,741
Ok, Dwight I'm sorry because, I've always been your biggest "flan"

259
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,548
Nice, that's the way it is around here

260
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:38,163
You should have put him in custard-y!

261
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,987
Yes, new guy!

262
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,866
He scores !

263
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,523
Ok that's great, I guess,

264
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,317
what I'm most concerned with is...

265
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:48,216
damage to company property.

266
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,842
That's all.

267
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,727
Pudding?

268
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,379
I’m trying to think, another desert to do.

269
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,761
Do you like to going out at the end of a week for a drink?

270
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:06,187
Yeah!

271
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:09,664
Oh, that's why we all going out, so we can have an end of the week drink!

272
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:10,789
well then when are we going out?

273
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:12,151
I don’t know, tonight, hopefully.

274
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,817
Ok, yeah.

275
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:17,204
Hey man!

276
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:17,748
Hey!

277
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,577
What's going on?

278
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,295
Hey baby!

279
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,754
Roy is my fianc? we’ve been engaged about...

280
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,590
about 3 years, and we were supposed to get married in September,

281
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,662
but I think we’ll gonna get married in next spring

282
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,434
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?

283
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,668
No, come on. Let's get out of here and go home.

284
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:43,248
Ok, I will be out in a few minutes so it’s lame

285
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:47,171
twenty past five I’ve still to do my faxes.

286
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,052
You know you should come with us,

287
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:56,247
because you know we are going out and it could be a good chance for you to

288
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:59,761
see what people are like outside the office, I think it could be fun

289
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:03,565
No, it sounds good but seriously we gotta get going

290
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:04,164
Yeah

291
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:18,088
What's in the bag?

292
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,386
Just tell her i'll talk to her then

293
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:23,645
No definitely all right dude awesome, we’ll do

294
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:31,939
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?

295
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,941
So, have you felt the vibe yet?

296
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,666
We work hard, we play hard.

297
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,425
Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard, right?

298
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:52,515
I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I am a friend first,

299
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,066
and a boss second.

300
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:57,002
Probably an entertainer third.

301
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:57,781
Just a second

302
00:17:58,374 --> 00:17:59,085
Right?

303
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:04,476
Oh, hey, do you like the Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

304
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:04,783
Yeah.

305
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:06,463
"Punk'd", and all that kind of stuff?

306
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:10,043
You are going to be my accomplice, just go along with that ok?

307
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:10,358
All right

308
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:12,771
Just follow my lead, don't pimp me all right?

309
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,685
Come in!

310
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,865
So corporate just said that I don want to..

311
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,202
You got a fax

312
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:18,255
Oh, thank you Pam.

313
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:20,376
Pam? Can you come in here for a sec?

314
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:25,180
Just have a seat, I was gonna call
you in anyway, you know Ryan?

315
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:30,110
As you know, there is going to be downsizing

316
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:34,702
and you have made my life so much easier,

317
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:39,174
in that I'm going to have to let you go first

318
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,037
What? Why?

319
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,577
Why? Well, theft, and stealing

320
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:45,817
Stealing?

321
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:49,638
What am I suppose to have stolen?

322
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,319
Post-It notes.

323
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:52,597
Post-It notes...?

324
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,686
What are those worth, like 50 cents?

325
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:58,425
You steal a thousand Post-It notes at 50 cents a piece,

326
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,969
then you know you’ve made a profit margin.

327
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,865
Gonna run us out of business, Pam.

328
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,232
- Are you serious?

329
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:08,576
- Yeah.

330
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,612
I can't believe this, I mean,

331
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,891
I have never even stolen as much as a paper clip and you're firing me.

332
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,808
And the best thing about it is that

333
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,977
we are not gonna have to give you any severance pay,

334
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,456
because that is gross misconduct, and..

335
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:30,681
just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.

336
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,423
You're been just "Punk'd"!

337
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:54,513
Surprise it's a joke, we were joking around, you see?

338
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:58,767
Ok, he was in on he was my accomplice and

339
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:01,510
it was just kind of a morale booster thing, and

340
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:07,807
we were showing the new guy around kind of, to give him the feel for the place, so?..
341
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,059
God, you were.. we totally got you?

342
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:12,433
You're a jerk!

343
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,974
Well, I don't  know about that

344
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:34,196
What is the most important thing for a company?

345
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:38,295
Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory?

346
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:42,370
No it's the people.

347
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:44,595
The "people".

348
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:49,529
My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17%,

349
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:53,836
or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee.

350
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,214
No, no, no, no.

351
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:58,261
It was a young Guatemalan guy,

00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:01,412
First job in the country, barely spoke English

353
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,657
came to me and said

354
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:05,350
"Mr Scott,

355
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:11,208
would you be the Godfather to my child?"

356
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:23,467
Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.

357
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,767
Hey

358
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,858
Hey how are you?

359
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:35,593
Good I thought you were going out for a drink with?

360
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:36,990
Oh no

361
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:40,940
How's your headache?

362
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:42,666
Better, thanks.

363
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:43,225
Good

364
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:48,193

365
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:49,960
Walking out?

366
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:50,792

367
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,952
Yes do you wanna?

368
