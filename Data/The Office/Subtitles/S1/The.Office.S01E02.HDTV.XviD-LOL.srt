1x02: Diversity Day
by belkiss & unfold

2
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:39,288
- Hey ya, may I help you on here?
- I'm all set thank you.

3
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,542
Good, I *go with the rows*.
That's a good idea.

4
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,296
Today is diversity day,

5
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:46,554
and someone is going to come in
and talk to us about diversity,

6
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:48,795
something that I've been pushing,

7
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:53,021
that I've been wanting to push for a
long time, and corporate mandated it,

8
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:55,853
I never actually talked
to corporate about it,

9
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:58,001
they kind of beat me with the punch,

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,416
those bastards!

11
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:05,975
But I was going to, and I think it's
very important that we have this,

12
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:08,755
I'm very very excited.

13
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,447
That's the thing,
it's a very sturdy paper,

14
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:14,916
and on the back it says:
100% post customer contempt.

15
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:21,428
What? Hello, haha, wait what?

16
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:25,665
I'm sorry mister Decker,
I think I'm losing you.

17
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:32,465
Hello? Hello? Yeah, hold on
one sec, hold on one second.

18
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:35,418
- Do you really have to do that right now?
- Yes I do.

19
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,151
I should have done this
weeks ago actually.

20
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:41,915
Mister Decker, I'm sorry about that,
would you wait one second?

21
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:45,938
Yeah, just one second. Thanks.

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,819
Hello? That's it, perfect.
So what I was saying was... hello?

23
00:01:57,475 --> 00:02:01,539
- Thanks Dwight.
- "Retaliation". Tit for tit.

24
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:05,682
- That is not the expression.
- Well that should be.

25
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,611
This is my bigger sale of the year.

26
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:17,572
They love me over there, for some
reason, I知 not really sure why,

27
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:20,991
but you know I make one call over there,
every year, just to renew their account.

28
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:25,637
And that one call ends up being 25%
of my commission, for the whole year.

29
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:29,815
So you know, I buy a mini bottle
of champagne, and celebrate.

30
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:35,076
And this year, I'm pushing recycle
paper on them, for one percent more.

31
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:40,969
I know, getting cocky right.

32
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,114
- Solitaire?
- Yeah, free cell.

33
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:52,109
- A 6 on 7.
- I know, I saw that.

34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,119
- So then why didn't you do it?
- I'm saving that,

35
00:02:55,278 --> 00:03:02,236
- cause I like it when the cards go...
- Who doesn't love that?

36
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:14,601
- Hey! Oscar, how you doing man?
- All right.

37
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,601
A good week end going there?

38
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:20,659
- It was fun.
- Oh yeah bet it was fun

39
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:25,297
- Oh hey! This is Oscar.
- Martinez.

40
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:28,848
- See, I didn't even know, first thing basis.
- We're all set.

41
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:32,041
Oh hey, diversity everybody let's do it.

42
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,407
Oscar works in here.

43
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,686
- Jim can you rapid up please?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:40,325
It's diversity day Jim,

45
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,231
wish everyday was diversity day.

46
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,576
You know what, I'm actually
gonna have to call you back.

47
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:50,179
Thank you, sorry about that.

48
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,708
- Thank you
- Get in the cars! Get in the car!

49
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:56,792
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

50
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,610
Ok thanks for filling these,
I promise this will be quick.

51
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:05,583
At diversity today our philosophy is about
honesty and positive expectations,

52
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:11,271
we believe that 99% of the problems in the
workplace arise simply out of ignorance.

53
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:14,165
You know what? This is
a color free zone here.

54
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,811
Stanley, I don't look
at you as another race.

55
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:21,739
See, this is what I'm talking about, we
don't have to pretend that we're colorblind.

56
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,674
- Exactly. We're not colorblinds.
- That's fighting ignorance with
- With intolerance.

57
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:30,962
No, with more ignorance. Right exactly.
Instead we need to celebrate our diversity.

58
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:32,671
Let's celebrate.

59
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:36,981
"Celebrate good times. Come on!"
Let's celebrate diversity right?

60
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:41,732
Yes, exactly. Now, here's what
we're gonna do, I致e noticed that uh...

61
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:43,683
You know what, here's
what we're gonna do.

62
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:47,838
What if we go around and
everybody, everybody,

63
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:53,292
say a race that you are attracted to
sexually, I will go last. Go.

64
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,888
I have two.
White and Indian.

65
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:58,509
Actually I prefer not to start that way.

66
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:03,345
Michael I would love to have your permission
to run this session, can I have your permission?

67
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:05,166
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

68
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:07,608
And it would also help me
if you were seated.

69
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,969
Thank you. Ok.

70
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,781
Now, at the start of the session
I had you write down an incident

71
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:16,522
that you found offensive
in the workplace.

72
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,686
- Now what I'm gonna do is choose
one and we're gonna act like...
- A few other ground rules?

73
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:22,224
Why don't you run it by
me and I run it by him?

74
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,279
OK. Can we steer away from gay people?

75
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:28,544
I'm sorry it's an orientation,
it's not a race.

76
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:32,282
Plus a lot of other racists
are also intolerant at gays so,

77
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,486
paradox.

78
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,950
Well we only have an hour.

79
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,482
- Why don't we just refer to Mr. uh?
- Mr. brown.

80
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:42,535
Oh all right! ok!

81
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,638
First test, I will not call you that!

82
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,755
Well it's my name it's not a test, ok?

83
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,401
So. Looking few cards I've noticed that
many of you wrote down the same incident,

84
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,150
which is ironic,

85
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:55,773
because it's the exact incident
I was brought in here to respond to.

86
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:59,796
Now how many of you are familiar
with the Chris Rock routine?

87
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,687
Very good, ok.

88
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,116
<i>How come Chris rock can do a routine,</i>

89
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:10,640
and everybody finds it hilarious,
and ground breaking,

90
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:14,394
and I go into the exact same
routine, same comedy timing,

91
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,409
and people file a
complaint to corporate?

92
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,746
Is it because I知 white,
and Chris is black?

93
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:25,566
So we're gonna reenact this
with a more positive outcome.

94
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:27,535
I will play the Chris rock guy!

95
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,803
I would like to see
someone else pull this off.

96
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,495
Oh let's have someone who wasn't
involve in the reenactment?

97
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:35,446
Ok, I will play guy listening.

98
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:36,965
Great, guy listening.

99
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,670
- Ok anyone else remember?
- I remember.

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,096
Great you're the Chris rock guy
and you're the guy listening.

101
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:45,486
Kevin is a great guy,

102
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,738
he's a great accountant, he is
not much of an entertainer.

103
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:52,122
Basically, there are
two types of black people.

104
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:55,392
And black people are
actually more racists,

105
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:58,165
because they hate the
other type of black people.

106
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,063
Every time the one type
wants to have a good time,

107
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,565
then the other type comes in
and makes a real mess.

108
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,383
Ok I知 sorry, I知 sorry he's ruining,
he's butchering it, could you just let me...

109
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:15,951
Every time, every time black people
want to have a good time,

110
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:20,394
some biiiip ass biiiip,
I take care of my kids!

111
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:24,219
... always want credit for
something they're supposed to do!

112
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,323
Stop it!

113
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,248
What do you want? Cookie?

114
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:40,806
Now this is a simple acronym, H.E.R.O.

115
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,302
At diversity today we believe
it's very easy to be a hero.

116
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,898
All you need are Honesty, Empathy,
Respect and Open mindedness.

117
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:54,164
- Excuse me? I'm sorry but
that's not all it takes to be a hero.
- Oh great, what is a hero to you?

118
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,223
A hero kills people.
People that wish him harm.

119
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:57,729
Ok.

120
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,638
A hero is part human, part supernatural,

121
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:05,592
a hero is born out of a child with
trauma, or out of a disaster,

122
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:08,699
that must be avenged.

123
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:15,230
- Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
- We all have a hero in our heart.

124
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:18,826
Now I need you to take these forms,

125
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,379
this is the kind of expresses the
joint experience we had today.

126
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,620
and I want you to look them over and
sign them, as a kind of a group pledge.

127
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:32,911
I don't think I can sign this.

128
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,289
I can't leave until you do.

129
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,941
It says here that I've learned something,

130
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:40,430
and I knew all this stuff already so...

131
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:43,610
You know I could sign something
that says that I taught something

132
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:47,843
or that I helped you teach something
so, Pam, where's she?

133
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:53,716
- Pam could we change something on this?
- Michael can I talk to you candidly?

134
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:57,906
- Sure.
- We both know that I知 here because
of the comments that you've made.

135
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:01,663
Here's the thing, this office,
I think it's very advanced,

136
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:06,700
in terms of racial awareness.

137
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:09,385
And it's probably more advanced
than you're used to.

138
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:13,039
- That's probably throwing you off.
- It's not throwing me, I need your signature.

139
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:17,639
- Ok I know you told me that, several times.
- Yes, but you're not listening to me,

140
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,321
- yours is the only signature I need.
- Oh ok.

141
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,473
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices

142
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:26,252
is to put your through this seminar,
for the comments that you made,

143
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:32,556
and the only reason why I made copies for
everyone was that you wouldn稚 be embarrassed.

144
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:42,284
Well here I am thinking that you
actually cared about diversity training,

145
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:44,457
and you don't.

146
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,525
- Don't worry about dating.
- I won't.

147
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:53,751
- Ok thank you.
- Yep.

148
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:01,608
I regret my actions, I regret
offending my co-workers.

149
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:07,235
I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty,
empathy, respect and open-mindedness,

150
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,326
openmindedness is that a word?

151
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:13,606
Into the workplace, in this
way I can truly be a hero.

152
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:16,914
Signed, daffy duck.

153
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,679
He's gonna lose it when he reads that.

154
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,791
Hi, is Mr. Decker around?

155
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:32,817
Oh well could you just have him
call me after lunch? Thank you.

156
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:45,222
I pledge to always keep an open
mind and an open heart.

157
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:54,592
I do believe in that part of
the pledge that I just read,

158
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:58,805
but a pledge, come on, who are we?
The girls scouts? No.

159
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:05,400
Look, the, the guy Mister brown, he got
us half way there, he got us talking.

160
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,654
Well no, I got us talking.
It got us nothing,

161
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,039
he insulted us and he abandoned us.

162
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:14,188
You call that diversity training?
I don't.

163
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,912
Were there any connections
between any of us?

164
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:21,837
Did anyone look each other in the eye,
were there any emotion going on?

165
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,463
No! Where was the heart,
I didn't see any heart,

166
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,216
where was my Oprah moment?

167
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:34,231
Ok, get as much done as you can
before lunch, because afterward,

168
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:37,881
I知 gonna have you all in tears.

169
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:55,533
All right everybody pretty, come on,
here we go, it's time. Let's do some good.

170
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,446
Hey we are not all gonna seat
in circle in it so are we?

171
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,357
- Get out!
- I'm sorry.

172
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:05,943
No this not a joke, ok?

173
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:09,570
It was offensive, and lame,
so double offensive.

174
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:17,422
This is an environment of welcoming and
you should just get the hell out of here.

175
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:21,447
Ok let's go, let's do it come on
let's have some fun everybody.

176
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:30,369
Here we go, take a seat, cop a squat,
and thank you for coming in.

177
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:39,023
Diversity... is the cornerstone of
progress, as I致e always said.

178
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:43,773
But don't take my word for it.
Let's take a look at the tape.

179
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:51,700
Hi I知 Michael Scott, I知 in charge
of Dundler Mifflin paper products

180
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,500
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

181
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,700
But I'm also the founder
of diversity tomorrow,

182
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,150
because today is almost over.

183
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:05,990
Abraham Lincoln once
said that if you're a racist

184
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:09,300
I will attack you with the north.

185
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:14,334
And those are the principles that
I carry with me in the workplace.

186
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,960
Ok, questions? Comments?
Anybody, Jim?

187
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,860
- Uhh, is that it?
- Yes I only had an hour to put it together,

188
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,387
- but I知 gonna add onto it later on.
- It was kind of hard to hear.

189
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:34,177
Uh yes that probably has something to do
with the camera work. Anybody else?

190
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:38,857
- I have a customer meeting.
- Yeah well if you leave we'll only have to...

191
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:43,063
Yes, enjoy, absolutely.
"Namaste".

192
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,397
Ok, well, since I am leading this

193
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:52,208
let's get down to business, and why
don't I, just kind of introduce myself, ok?

194
00:13:52,795 --> 00:14:00,741
I am Michael, and I am part
English, Irish, German, and Scottish,

195
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:03,990
sort of a virtual United Nations.

196
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:09,643
But what some of you might not know,
is that I am also part native American Indian.

197
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,948
What part, native American?

198
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:15,231
- 2/15th
- That fraction doesn't make any sense.

199
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:19,375
Well, you know what it's kinda hard
for me to talk about it. It's suffering

200
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,296
So who else? Let's get it popping,
come on. Whose gone?

201
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:27,199
Let's go here, Oscar,
right here, you're on!

202
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,220
Ok Michael, both my parents
were born in Mexico

203
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,903
and they moved to the united-states
a year before I was born,

204
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:43,060
so I grew up in the united states and
my parents were Mexicans.

205
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:47,019
That is a great story, that's the
American dream right there, right?

206
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,077
Thank you, yeah

207
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:55,159
Let me ask you is there a term
besides Mexican, that you prefer?

208
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,372
Something less offensive?

209
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,969
- Mexican isn't offensive!
- Well it has certain connotations.

210
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:05,673
- Like what?
- Like... I don't know

211
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:07,373
- What connotations Michael?
- No...

212
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,740
- It must have been something
- No, remember

213
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:14,753
- I'm just curious
- Honesty, Empathy, Respect,

214
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,411
Jim?

215
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:19,526
Hello?

216
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,850
I have something here,
I want you to take a card

217
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,650
put it on you fore...
don't look at the card!

218
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:30,392
I want you to take the card, I want
you to put it on you forehead and

219
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:33,631
take a card, any card

220
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:38,298
and I want you to treat other
people like the race

221
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:42,897
that is on their forehead.
So everybody has a different race

222
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:47,021
nobody knows what
their race is, so

223
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,258
I want you to really go for it,
cause this is real

224
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,820
you know this isn't just an
exercise this is real life and

225
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:59,411
I have a dream that you
all really let this spark fly

226
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,234
get it done!

227
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,665
Why? Because Martin Luther
King is a hero of mine

228
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:09,750
There's this great Chris Rock bit about
how streets named after Martin Luther King,

229
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,400
tend to be more violent.

230
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,314
I'm not gonna do it but it's

231
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,226
oh this is a good one

232
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:20,704
- Hum, hi how are you?
- Fine, how are you?

233
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,385
- Push it
- Great

234
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,400
I admire your culture success in America.

235
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you.

236
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:35,304
Come on! Olympics of sufferings right here
Slavery versus Holocaust, come on!

237
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,491
- Whom am I supposed to be?
- It's called role play

238
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:41,020
well, that was an invert,
we didn't actually plan that

239
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,152
Lot's of cultures eat rice,
That doesn't help me

240
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:50,439
- Shalom, I'd like to apply for a loan.
- That's nice, Dwight.

241
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:53,040
OK, do me. Something stereotypical
so I can get it really quick.

242
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,600
OK, I like your food.

243
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:57,855
Uh, Outback Steakhouse,
I'm Australian, mate!

244
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,885
- No...
- Pam..."I like your food"?

245
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,692
No come on, stir the pot.
Stir the melting pot, Pam!

246
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,906
Let's do it, let's get ugly,
let's get real.

247
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,700
OK, if I have to do this,

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,600
based on stereotypes that are totally
untrue, that I do not agree with,

249
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,800
you would maybe not be
a very good driver.

250
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,600
Aw man, am I a woman?

251
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:22,796
You'll notice, I didn't
have anybody being Arab.

252
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:27,191
I thought that would be too
explosive, uh, no pun intended.

253
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:30,300
But I just thought, "too soon" for Arabs.

254
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:35,607
Maybe next year.
You know, the ball's in their court.

255
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,365
- What's you're watching?
- Supershow

256
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,803
- really?
- Yeah, I downloaded it on her computer

257
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:44,925
- I hope she doesn't mind,
she has a lot of extra space.
- No way! I think she really likes this stuff

258
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:49,683
- she's cute hein?
- Yeah, she's engaged but

259
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:56,645
- oh, no, the girl on the... sketch
- oh, yeah, she's hot

260
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,472
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:03,438
- You wanna go to the beach?
- Sure.

262
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:06,888
- You wanna get high?
- No.

263
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:09,869
- I think you do, mon.
- Stop it

264
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:15,943
you need to push it, you know
you could go a little bit further

265
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:23,366
- Kelly, how are you?
- I've had one of the longest meeting I've ever...

266
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:27,227
Welcome to my convenient store.
Would you like some gookie cookie?

267
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:31,800
I have some very delicious gookie
cookie, only 99 cents plus taxes

268
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:36,594
try my gookie cookie

269
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:51,738
all right, yes

270
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:54,899
that was great, she gets it

271
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,424
now she knows what
it's like to be a minority.

272
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:07,707
Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your
sell day do we? Excellent, ok

273
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:12,181
Let me just get your... what's that?

274
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:15,058
No we didn't close last time...

275
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,967
I just need your...

276
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:22,703
oh, what code were you given

277
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:25,110
oh ok

278
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:29,877
yeah, no that's actually another sells-man here,
yeah, I can re-do it if you want to do that

279
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:32,872
oh he gave you discount?
No, I don't blame you

280
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,473
I just hated it when that guy was in here,

281
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:39,232
Mr. brown? If that was his real name!?

282
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:44,291
I mean, he had never met any of us before,
and here he was telling us how to do our things

283
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:49,803
I just wanted to do it our way, you know?

284
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,114
On our own

285
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,602
man I should have gotten some food

286
00:19:55,713 --> 00:20:01,148
- maybe some spaghetti
- ok, Kevin you can take off that thing, ok?

287
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:06,892
That would have really
showed him up, wouldn't it?

288
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:14,657
I've brought some burritos, some color
greens, some pad thai, love pad thai

289
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:19,135
it's colored greens

290
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:22,705
doesn't really make sense, cause
you don't call it colored people

291
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:24,864
that's offensive

292
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:33,494
ok, it's after five, so
thank you very much

293
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:37,069
Buena vista Oscar
thank you

294
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,182
good job
oh my man!

295
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:46,879
Thank you brazil
nice

296
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,703
hey, we can go

297
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:16,551
not a bad day!
