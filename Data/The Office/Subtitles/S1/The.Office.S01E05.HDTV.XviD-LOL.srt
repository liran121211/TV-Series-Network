00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,448
1x05 : Basketball
by belkiss, unfold & Occeane

2
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,601
Hey you're ready ?

3
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,887
All right, all right, secret sign.

4
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:45,100
Hey, Ryan ? very good,

5
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,949
excellent, excellent.

6
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:48,148
Michael !

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:01,454
<i>Today at lunchtime we’re going to
be playing the warehouse staff in a</i>

8
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:03,609
friendly little game of basketball.

9
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,572
My idea. The last time I was down there
I noticed they put up a couple of hoops.

10
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:10,820
And I play basketball every week-end,

11
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,676
so I thought "This might be kind of fun".
And so I started messing around,

12
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,360
and, I'm sinking a few,
you know swish swish swish,

13
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:24,636
nothing but net !
And their jaws just drop to the floor.

14
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,910
African Americans !

15
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:31,382
You know it's really
just a good friendly game,

16
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,652
a reason for everybody to get together.

17
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,922
Pam Pam thank you Ma'am.
Messages please there you go.

18
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,480
Michael can I talk to you
for a second please ?

19
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,550
Privately, in your office ?

20
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,040
- I think I should be on the team.
- No.

21
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,361
And that's not me being mean Dwight,

22
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:50,112
- that is based on your past behavior.
- Oh please.

23
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:53,310
- When I let him come to my pick up game...
- I apologized for that.

24
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:57,672
I vouched for you, I vouched
for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.

25
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:10,581
Here's what I’m going to do.
The hand strikes and gives a flower.

26
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:13,161
You are not going to play basketball,

27
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,313
but I need somebody to come in,

28
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,603
and take over the holiday
and weekend work calendar.

29
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,421
- I can handle that.
- Good.

30
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,771
- Excellent, it'll be fun,
- Yeah.

31
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:27,603
because corporate wants somebody
to be here on Saturday,

32
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,221
so we're going to have to have a couple
of people coming in on the weekends,

33
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:34,841
and I know nobody's going to want to do it,
everybody’s going to complain and bitch and,

34
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:36,182
I don't want to have to deal with that.

35
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,060
That's why you have an
assistant regional manager.

36
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,981
Yes it is.

37
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,452
- Assistant to the regional manager.
- Same thing.

38
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:45,670
- No it's not. It's lower so.
- It's close.

39
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:53,911
So we need someone to work this Saturday,
and I think that that should be...

40
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:56,040
Jim.

41
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,282
God this is so sad, this is
the smallest amount of power

42
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:02,183
I've ever seen go to someone's head.

43
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,913
- Phyllis, can you believe this ?
- Keep me out of it.

44
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,262
My fiancé has plans for us this Saturday

45
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,440
so I really hope
Dwight doesn't make me work.

46
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,463
Maybe I should sleep with him.

47
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:19,073
I'm kidding. Kidding. Totally kidding.

48
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:24,173
All right, managing by walking around !

49
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:30,723
This is our warehouse,
or as I like to call it, the whorehouse.

50
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:31,832
But don't you call it that,

51
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:34,310
- I've earned the right.
- Fine, don't worry about that.

52
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:38,763
And here we have
"Miter’ Roger’s neighborhood".

53
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,263
Come on over here, hey,

54
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:43,900
- This is Ryan he's temping upstairs.
- What's up ?

55
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:47,132
- And this is the foreman, "Miter’ Rogers".
- It's not my real name.

56
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:50,843
No, it's Darryl,
Darryl is "Miter’ Rogers".

57
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:53,063
- Darryl Rogers.
- Darryl Filben,

58
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:58,703
then Bridges, then Rige,
then Roger, then Miter’ Rogers.

59
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:03,380
That is Lonny and this is Roy,
Roy dates Pam,

60
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,791
- you know the best looking one upstairs.
- Yeah yeah.

61
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,200
You're still getting it regular man ?

62
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:11,003
I mean I can tell her
it's part of the job.

63
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:14,412
Repel her.

64
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,853
No no I know that
the warrantee is expired,

65
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:21,301
but isn't it supposed to last longer
than two years, if it isn't effective ?

66
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:23,733
Ok fine three years.

67
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:26,722
Pam gets a little down.
Her toaster having broke,

68
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,390
which she got at her engagement shower,

69
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:36,450
for a wedding that
still has yet to be set.

70
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,413
And that was three years ago.

71
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:43,560
So, one o clock sharp,
and we've got a game on.

72
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:44,610
Well none at one !

73
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,791
Oh I see, you're chickening out,
you're bailing on me.

74
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:51,563
No  we got a truck going out
at one fifteen so, that's a busy time.

75
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:55,803
Well, I'm glad that sometime is a busy
time because whenever I'm down here,

76
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:58,662
It doesn't seem too busy to me.

77
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:08,163
You can dish it out
but you can't take it.

78
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,720
Ok, fine, have it your way.

79
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,050
All right fine, you know what ?

80
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:24,213
- One o clock.
- All right, see you at one.

81
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:32,072
Are we ready for the game ?

82
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:35,493
I know, grumble grumble,

83
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:38,770
but you would follow me to the ends
of the earth grumbling all the way.

84
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:42,351
Like that dwarf,
from "Lord of the Rings".

85
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,230
- Gimli.
- Nerd.

86
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,433
- That is why you're not on the team.
- Just trying to be helpful.

87
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:50,901
Oh ul, I'll ul. Dragon Slayer.
Ten point power sword.

88
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,440
That's him.

89
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:55,862
Ok, so let's put together
the starting lineup shall we ?

90
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:59,091
- Stanley, of course.
- I'm sorry ?

91
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,960
- What do you play, center ?
- Why of course ?

92
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,071
What's that supposed to mean ?

93
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:07,492
I don't know,
I don't remember saying that.

94
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,353
- I heard it.
- People hear a lot of things, man.

95
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:17,003
Other starters... me of course.
I heard it that time.

96
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:21,771
I'd like to play, if it's just for fun.
I played basketball in school.

97
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,521
Uh, yeah, who else ?

98
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,332
We have Jim, we have Ryan,
the new guy, right untested,

99
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:32,900
willing to prove himself right now,
lot of passion, lot of heart...

100
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,923
But I'm getting paid
to skip lunch right ?

101
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:35,873
Yes.

102
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:42,611
Yes, this is business. The business
of team building and moral boosting.

103
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:46,610
- Uh, who else ?
- I can help out if you need me.

104
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:51,003
I will use your talents come baseball
season my friend, or if we box.

105
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,771
- I have a hoop in my drive way.
- No.

106
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,483
I have sport's bra.
No, no ! Ridiculous.

107
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,210
Michael look !

108
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:09,243
Close all right. Me, Stan the man,
Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Sorry fellows.

109
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,190
- Can I be team captain ?
- No I'm team captain.

110
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,072
-  Can I be team manager ?
- No I am the team manager,

111
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,720
- you can be assistant to the team manager.
- Assistant team manager ?

112
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:15,721
No.

113
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:18,451
Ok we'll see who is working
this weekend then.

114
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,580
Jim, you're in charge of
the vacation's schedule now.

115
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,153
Oh my god...

116
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:24,752
Threat neutralized.

117
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,412
Off the backboard !

118
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,613
- Please don't throw a garbage at me.
- Oh Pam with this anger.

119
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:53,460
Hey Pam, how would you like
to be our cheerleader today ?

120
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,790
You know, some pink tails,

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,571
little halter top you can tie that up,

122
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:02,802
and you know something a little...
just useful for a change, just this once.

123
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,372
I don't think so Michael.

124
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,812
Besides I can't cheer against my fiancé.

125
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:07,822
I'll do it.

126
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:10,722
Wear a little fancy skirt if you want. 

127
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,760
Yeah I bet you would, just
try not to be too gay on the court.

128
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:19,432
And by gay I mean, you know,
not in a homosexual way at all,

129
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:22,080
I mean, you know,
like the bad at sports way.

130
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:23,901
I think that goes without saying.

131
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:26,320
- Maybe Angela would cheerlead ?
- Yeah right.

132
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:29,872
- I'll do it.
- That's worse than you playing.

133
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:36,151
Cause you know what ? We need you as
an alternate in case somebody gets hurt.

134
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:38,353
That's where we need you.

135
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,241
Bless would be those who sit and wait.

136
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,623
You  made it !
Suit up you're on the team !

137
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:52,580
All right. Cool ! Very good.

138
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:57,552
A spy from the warehouse, trying
to figure out our players eh man ?

139
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,821
Just getting a tea-bag.

140
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:03,791
He's running, but he can't hide,
because you know what ?

141
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,030
one o clock
you'd better bring your A game,

142
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:10,283
because me and my posse guys,
we're going to be in your face.

143
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,560
Right in your face.

144
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:15,866
Why don't we make it more interesting ?
Loser buys dinner at Farley's.

145
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:20,460
I like the way you think. You know
what I'll take that one step further :

146
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:24,016
Loser works on Saturday.

147
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,150
No, that's not of much fun.

148
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:33,501
- You know what ?
- Oh what ?

149
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,420
- You're on.
- Ok.

150
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:38,810
Cool. You're on.

151
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,082
Don't screw this up !

152
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:54,253
Classic beginners mistaken,
eating before game.

153
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:12,672
Has anyone seen the first aid kit ?

154
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:18,810
How many times have I told you ?
I'm the safety officer, not you.

155
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,751
Basketball, was kind of my thing,
in high school,

156
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,680
and yeah, I'm looking forward to play.

157
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,432
You know I think I'm going
to impress a few people in here.

158
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:49,081
- You're coming down ?
- Yeah I'm just forwarding the phones.

159
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,491
- Will you wish me luck ?
- Yeah you're going to need it.

160
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:55,142
Wow ! Is that trash talk from Pam ?

161
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,570
I'm just saying Roy is very competitive,

162
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:01,452
and he wants to take the wave runners
to the lake this Saturday, so...

163
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:05,362
Well I'm going to
the outlet mall on Saturday, so

164
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:10,072
if you want to save big on brand names,
and Roy has to work, which he will,

165
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:14,741
because I'm also competitive,
you should feel free to come along.

166
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:19,241
I think I'm going to be up at the lake.

167
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:23,823
I think I'll see you at the mall...
yeah.

168
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:33,300
There he is. Secret weapon !

169
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:43,662
All right guys, come on !
Let's bring it in. Here we go.

170
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:50,201
OK. Listen, this is just going to be
a friendly game, right ?

171
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:54,862
We're all on the same team here,
the Dundler Mifflin team.

172
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:58,291
Of course if you beat us, you're fired.

173
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,400
That's a joke !

174
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,301
Ok. Let's do it !

175
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,920
- Have a good game man !
- Yeah, you too, should be fun.

176
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:12,772
All right everybody stretch out a little
bit. Stretch, stretch it, full stretch.

177
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,952
- Ryan you want to stretch ?
- I stretched before I came.

178
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,970
Ok Ryan you have Darryl. I have Roy.

179
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,821
Really ? I thought I'd take Roy.

180
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:25,940
No actually, I think Roy
is their best player, not lying.

181
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:29,611
So Dwight you have the east German girl.

182
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,411
- Ok we'll be skins !
- No.

183
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:43,802
Come on Dwight.

184
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:47,040
- What ? Shirts on or off ?
- On ! Put it on !

185
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,142
- You're sure ?
- Yes.

186
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,792
Pam, you kind of have
your foots on both camps here,

187
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,770
why don't you do the jump ball ?

188
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,580
Don't listen to him Pam, trust me.

189
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:57,640
Tip it my way or
you'll sleep in the car !

190
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:00,863
Stanley !

191
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:06,330
What ? You got to be kidding me !

192
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:12,980
Here we go, who's at him who's at him ?
Somebody get him !

193
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:22,082
Over here ! Three !

194
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,342
Let's go to zone,
let's go on a zone !

195
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:25,512
Defense !

196
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:26,550
Defense !

197
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,800
Defense !

198
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,343
Defense !

199
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:33,520
Who's got Roy ?

200
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:50,371
Oh come on, what is wrong
with me today ? Usually hit those.

201
00:13:56,905 --> 00:14:00,593
Dwight I was open.
All right, let's go.

202
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,381
Aw ! Ok, foul, charging,

203
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:13,732
That's foul. Ok I'll take it.

204
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,143
When I'm playing hoops,

205
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:42,022
all of the stress and responsibility
of my job here just melts away.

206
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:45,190
It's gone, in the zone.

207
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:46,182
Three ! What's with me today ?-

208
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,373
Who am I ? Am I Michael Scott ?

209
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:52,533
I don't know.
I might just be a basketball machine.

210
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,192
What's Dundler Mifflin ?
I've never heard of it.

211
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:59,383
Filing, paper works, who cares ?
Possible downsizing ?

212
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:03,700
That's probably going to happen actually.

213
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:09,090
Jim right here, give me the ball,
Ryan cut !

214
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:10,793
My bad.

215
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:18,581
Where you're at.

216
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,363
Where you're at.

217
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:26,453
Is that like the robot ?

218
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:29,491
Nice !

219
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,333
Just do one, that's cool, that's fine.

220
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:36,593
All right let's go.

221
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,292
Back off !

222
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:42,730
Come on ! Hey Dwight !

223
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:49,353
Yeah, in your face !

224
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:50,503
Dwight !

225
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:53,761
Football, is like rock'n'roll,
it's just...

226
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:57,992
And basketball is like Jazz,
you know you kind of...

227
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:03,541
downbeat, it's in the pocket,
it's like you...

228
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,201
Time out !

229
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,523
Come on, sellers, over here.
Bring it in ! Come on !

230
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:33,123
What's going on ? You guys
are playing like a bunch of girls.

231
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,281
- You know what ? Let me take Roy.
- All right we'll switch,

232
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,302
Take it up a notch. Come on !

233
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:59,131
Foul ! Naked aggression !

234
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:03,110
Oh  that is, you're all right Jim ?
Suck it up.

235
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:12,603
Ouch ! How much does it hurt ?

236
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:26,893
Yes !

237
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:28,760
What the hell man ?

238
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,912
- Take it easy.
- No you take it easy !

239
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,172
Same team Dwight.

240
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:44,502
Yes !

241
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,221
Yeah !

242
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,140
Yeah !

243
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:51,370
Yeah !

244
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:54,060
In your face !

245
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:57,151
- Angela, what's the score ?
- You're ahead.

246
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,583
Yeah baby, here we go !

247
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,773
Jim, Jim right here !
Ouch ! Hold it !

248
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:06,552
I'm sorry. Are you all right ?

249
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:05,203
Foul !

250
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:06,542
God !

251
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,192
- That hurts,
- I'm sorry.

252
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,952
- What's your problem man ?
- I didn't mean to do this.

253
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,013
Just clack at me for no reason ?

254
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,872
- Take you shot man !
- NO no no !

255
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,022
That was a flagrant
personal intentional foul.

256
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,700
- No way it wasn't.
- Yes it was.

257
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:23,943
- I'm just being fair.
- Oh really, I just moved my arm.

258
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,443
Game over ! That is it.
I'm sorry you know.

259
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,652
I hate to do it this way,
but you know that's just,

260
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:33,333
we're having a friendly game,
it's a shame !

261
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,930
This is a damn shame !

262
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,050
We're like a family here,
and that's just, that won't fly.

263
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,492
- This is a cold pack.
- Give me that.

264
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:42,121
You have to break into your bag.

265
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:44,303
Thanks Dwight.

266
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,731
What does that mean ?
What is it, a tie ? What's going on ?

267
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:51,213
- Let's just say, whoever was ahead won.
- That was you...

268
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:54,442
It was us really ? I didn't know.

269
00:18:55,315 --> 00:19:00,040
Great. Now you see
who was work on Saturday, your face.

270
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,851
- No, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
- Yeah this isn't happening.

271
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,131
Guys, you know, I'm the boss so...

272
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:16,103
Yeah, so what's that,
we're coming on Monday right ?

273
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,250
Monday ?

274
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:28,053
You guys believed me ? Come on...

275
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,751
dogs you know,
you should know me better than that.

276
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,520
No, do you think that
would have been good for moral ? No.

277
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:43,160
Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed with
even that close so. Now of course,

278
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,520
We're coming in Saturday.

279
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:50,450
Good game. Word.

280
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:27,010
So I talked to this accountant, it
looks good. I haven't signed anything.

281
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:28,500
- Hey baby ! 
- Hey !

282
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:32,071
Larry bird, Larry legend.

283
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:35,332
Yeah he's pretty good uh ?

284
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:42,933
- Let's get you into a tub.
- Yeah ? And you in a tub.

285
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:50,710
Hey. What a game, what a game !

286
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:52,870
What time do we have to come in ?

287
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:59,220
Come on, lets not be gloomy here man,
we're on this together, we're a team.

288
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:05,420
You know what ?

289
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,823
Screw corporate !

290
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:10,350
Nobody's  coming in tomorrow,
you have the day off.

291
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:14,191
Like how even an extra day is going
to prevent us from being downsized ?

292
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,393
Have a good weekend.

293
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:22,713
The great thing about sports is
that it is all about character.

294
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:29,142
And you can learn lessons about life
even if you don't win.

295
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:32,232
But we did, because we were ahead.
