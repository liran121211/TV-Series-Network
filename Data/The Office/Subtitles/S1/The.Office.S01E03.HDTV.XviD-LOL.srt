1x03 : Health Care
by belkiss, unfold & Oceane

2
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:34,484
Pam ! Pamela,

3
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,329
Pamelamela Ding Dong !
Making copies.

4
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:40,378
- I'm not making any copies.
- Let's go !

5
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,862
Messages, date, lots to do lots to do...

6
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,250
Information superhighway !

7
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,844
- Nothing new...
- Let them unw...

8
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:49,163
- There's nothing new.
- That's not what you said earlier.

9
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,635
Oh do you want me to repeat
the messages that I gave you before ?

10
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:53,715
For the...

11
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:02,922
The most sacred thing I do is care,
and provide for my workers, my family.

12
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:04,658
I give them money.

13
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,173
I give them food.

14
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,208
Not directly, but through the money...

15
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,238
I heal them.

16
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:17,542
Today I am in charge, of picking
a great new healthcare plan.

17
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:20,130
Right ? That's what this is all about !

18
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,887
Does that make me their doctor ?

19
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,681
Yes... In a way...

20
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,323
Yeah, like a specialist.

21
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,296
So which health plan
have you decided on ?

22
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,668
I am going to go with best, Jan.

23
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:42,864
I am going to go with the one with

24
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:46,034
the acupuncture, therapeutic massage...

25
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,312
- You know, the works...
- Wait acupuncture ?

26
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,779
None of the plans have acupuncture.

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,968
Have you looked at
them closely Michael ?

28
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:56,736
I think it was you who didn't look
closely enough at the "gold plan".

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,845
- The gold plan ?
- Yep.

30
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm not even on that plan.

31
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:02,660
Well I recommend it, it's very good.

32
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,566
- You have to crack this things open.
- You know the whole reason we're doing

33
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,503
this, is to save money.

34
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,300
So,

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,947
you just need to pick a provider,
and then choose the cheapest plan.

36
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,923
Well that is...

37
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,514
kind of a tough assignment.

38
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:26,657
- It's not gonna be a popular
decision around the old orifice.
- It's your job... so

39
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:28,620
It's a suicide mission, you know...

40
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,427
- Michael,
- I, I Know

41
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:33,282
- Maybe, I, I mean...
- There... there

42
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:34,888
You know sometimes a manager...

43
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:36,387
like yourself,

44
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:39,605
has to deliver the bad news to
the employees, I do it all the time.

45
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,716
- Yeah, when have you ever done that ?
- I'm doing it, right now.

46
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,141
To you.

47
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:48,740
Last night on "Trading spouses"...

48
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,427
- There's... have you seen it ?
- No, I have a life.

49
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,587
- Interesting, what's that like ?
- You should try it sometime.

50
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,955
Wow

51
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,010
- But then who would watch my TV ?

52
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:58,949
So I like that

53
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,522
Ding Dong !

54
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:07,265
There's a decision
that needs to be made.

55
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,625
And I'm having a unbelievably busy day.

56
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:13,381
So, I'm going to let you pick

57
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,671
a healthcare plan for our office,

58
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,731
and then explain it

59
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,598
to your co-workers.

60
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,289
- Gosh !
- Yeah !

61
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:25,932
That is a great offer. Thank you.

62
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,939
I really think I should be
concentrating on sales.

63
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,540
- Really ?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:35,781
I just don't thing that this is
the kind of task, that

65
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:39,152
I am going to do...

66
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:41,139
You know who would be great for this ?

67
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:45,085
Anytime Michael asks me to do anything
I just tell me that Dwight should do it.

68
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,731
Yes ! I can do it ! I'm your man.

69
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:50,885
Right now this is just a job.

70
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,777
If I advance any higher in this company,
then this would be my career.

71
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:56,641
And a...

72
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:59,168
Well if this were my career,

73
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,869
I'd have to throw myself
in front of a train.

74
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:05,467
Ok first, let's go over some parameters,

75
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,625
how many people can I fire ?

76
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,580
None, you're picking
a healthcare plan.

77
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,975
Ok we'll table that for the time being.
Two, I'm gonna need an office.

78
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,457
I think the conference
room should be fine.

79
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,413
You can use the conference
room as a temporary workspace.

80
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I have an office.

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,787
- Bigger than his !
- No, you cannot use it.

82
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:27,919
- Ok I take it back it's a workspace.
- Temporary workspace, you can use it.

83
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:30,166
Thank you.

84
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,561
If Dwight fails and that is
strike too and good for me,

85
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:37,214
for giving him a second chance.

86
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:40,262
And if he succeeds, then, you know,

87
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:42,794
no one would be prouder than
I am. I've groomed him.

88
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,863
I made him what he is today.

89
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,560
Unless he fails and,

90
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,423
talked about that already.

91
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,832
<i>What did I do ? I did my job. </i>

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,474
<i>I slashed benefits to the bone.
I saved this company money. </i>

93
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:05,866
<i>Was I too harsh ? Maybe.
I don't believe in coddling people. </i>

94
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,442
In the wild, there is no healthcare.

95
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,032
In the wild healthcare is
"How, I hurt my leg...

96
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:16,071
I can't run, a lion eats me,
and I'm dead. "

97
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,766
Well, I'm not dead.

98
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,293
I'm the lion.

99
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:25,033
You're dead !

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,187
There's no dental, there's no vision,

101
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:33,541
there is a 1200 dollars deductible.

102
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,229
Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.

103
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:40,621
<i>Pam, Michael Scott, how's tricks ? </i>

104
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,602
Where are you ?

105
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,805
<i>Oh, I'm in my office, I am swamped. </i>

106
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,409
I have work up to my ears

107
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:53,557
and busy busy busy, can't step away,
I just wanted to check in and

108
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:56,682
see how everybody's dealing.
Everybody cool out there ?

109
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,209
Actually, people are really unhappy

110
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,640
Dwight send around this memo

111
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:04,467
- And people are freaking out cause...
<i>- Pam, you, I'm sorry I'm sorry</i>

112
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,878
<i>I, I, I got to go I'm getting a call. </i>

113
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,377
No you're not.

114
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,553
I have to make a call
after I finish, my work

115
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,341
You know what ?
Don't let anybody in my office

116
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:20,721
Under any conditions today I'm just
too busy, too swamped, you know ?

117
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,994
I'm unreachable.
I'm incommunicado capisce ?

118
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,315
- Ok
<i>- Thank you,</i>

119
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,106
God here we go again, got to go,
I have to take this.

120
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,843
<i>Still no one calling. </i>

121
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:38,576
- Dwight, what is this...
- Uh, knock, please.

122
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:41,666
- Please knock, this is an office.
- It says workspace.

123
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,302
- Same thing.
- If it's the same thing,

124
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,689
then why'd you write "work space".

125
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,819
Just knock, please, as a sign of
respect for your superior.

126
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,703
- You are not my superior.
- Gee, then why do I have an office ?

127
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:55,413
- Thought it was a workspace, Dwight.
- Ok, Dwight.

128
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,298
Are you really in charge of
picking an healthcare plan ?

129
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,899
Yes. And my decision is final.

130
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,243
This is a ridiculously awful plan.

131
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,568
Because you cut everything.

132
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,890
- Times are tough, Pam, deal with it.
- You cut more than you had to, didn't you ?

133
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,380
Sure.

134
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:11,166
Then why did you do that ? You work
here, don't you want good insurance ?

135
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,750
Don't need it, never been sick,
perfect immune system.

136
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:17,079
Ok well if you've never been sick,
then you don't have any antibodies.

137
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,645
I don't need them, superior genes.

138
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:22,529
I'm a Schrute...
And superior brain power.

139
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:26,118
Through concentration I can raise

140
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,899
Why would you want to
raise your cholesterol ?

141
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,002
So I can lower it.

142
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,000
He literally won't
come out of his office.

143
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:38,793
He's got to come out sometime.

144
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,272
- To go to the bathroom.
- Kevin, that's inappropriate !

145
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,262
Michael can I talk to you ?

146
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,349
I would like to, but I'm
really busy, rain check ?

147
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,282
Michael, Michael please

148
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:58,693
Can we talk about this memo ?

149
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:01,491
- What ? Which memo ?
- Dwight's healthcare memo

150
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,150
- I told you about it.
- Is it a good plan ?

151
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:05,436
It's a great plan !
It saves the company a fortune.

152
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,504
- It's like a paid decrease.
- Michael, he made huge cuts.

153
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,668
Cuts ? what ?
Dwight did you make cuts ?

154
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:14,832
- Yeah you said go in the...
- No no no no no. You know what ?

155
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:17,677
I said nothing specific
because I was so busy.

156
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,137
Why don't you go in there Dwight ?

157
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:23,562
and find these people a
plan that will work for them. Ok ?

158
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:26,523
- I can handle it.
- Ok. All right.

159
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,189
We feel good ? All right, good !

160
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:34,906
Plus,

161
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,353
There's some other good news.

162
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,883
Today at the end of the day,

163
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,613
I will have for all of you

164
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,365
a big surprise. Ok ?

165
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,500
So hang in there, and I will
see you at the end of the day.

166
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,288
Right ?

167
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,127
- This is not good.
- It's ridiculous.

168
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,799
Did you talk to him ?

169
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:05,967
What was that ?

170
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:08,310
You let him off all over
you it's just pathetic.

171
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,124
- What are you guys talking about ?
- Nothing Kevin.

172
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:14,224
Do I know what the surprise is ?
Hell no !

173
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:17,475
Doesn't matter, the point is,
they're not unhappy anymore.

174
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:20,629
They're out there thinking "Wow !
My boss really cares about me.

175
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,484
He has a surprise, he's cool.

176
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,706
What a great guy, I love him.

177
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,381
I love him. "

178
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,089
Ok everyone, gather’ round.

179
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,700
Step forward.

180
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,600
It has been brought to my attention that
some of you are unhappy with my plan,

181
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,066
so what I'd like you to do,

182
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:48,719
is to fill this out and write
down any diseases that you have,

183
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:51,391
That you might want covered
and I'll see what I can do.

184
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,252
Okay you know what Dwight ? We can't
write our diseases down for you,

185
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:56,041
- because that's confidential.
- Ok,

186
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,549
well I didn't say to write
your name down, did I ?

187
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:00,516
Fill that out, leave it anonymous.

188
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:03,092
Or don't write any disease down at
all, and they won't be covered.

189
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,311
Sound fair ? Good. All right,
I'll be in my office.

190
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,414
Workspace.

191
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,549
You know what ? Come with me.

192
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:12,623
We are going on a little mission.

193
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,745
"Operation surprise. "

194
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,439
Where are you going ?

195
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,188
Headed out. Part of my busy day.

196
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:23,563
You know, meetings.

197
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,700
Couldn't find the knock.

198
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,507
So basically, I want to do
something nice for my employees.

199
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:36,179
Atlantic City. Ok ?

200
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:39,015
They have this thing
where they send a bus,

201
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,992
Right for free, picks everybody up,

202
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,012
and head down there, get to
the hotel, the room is count.

203
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,587
They give you a big pile
of chips, and your food.

204
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:51,000
Everything just kind of a all
inclusive free kind of weekend.

205
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,896
I don't know of anything like that.

206
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:56,754
But, you know what you might want to
do is just call the casino directly,

207
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,127
- Maybe.
- Yep yep, yep.

208
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,282
I did, so.

209
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,671
Wait what are you writing ?

210
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,082
Don't write Ebola, or mad cow disease.

211
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,407
All right ?

212
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:22,741
Cause I'm suffering from both of them.

213
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,732
- I'm inventing new diseases.
- Oh great.

214
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,857
So let's say that my
teeth turn to liquid

215
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,462
And then, they drip down
the back of my throat.

216
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:32,754
What would you call that ?

217
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,549
I thought you said you
were inventing diseases ?

218
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:37,134
That's spontaneous
"dentohydroplosion"

219
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,835
- Nice.
- Thank you.

220
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:42,314
Calling to ask you a little
favor Rooney my friend.

221
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,031
I'm trying to give the troops
around here a little bit of a boost

222
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:48,844
And I was thinking that

223
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,568
maybe we could take them down
to take a spin on your big ride.

224
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:56,986
<i>You mean the elevator that
takes you down in the mine shaft ? </i>

225
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:58,732
<i>It's not really a ride. </i>

226
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,491
It says here that it's a...

227
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,873
300 foot drop.

228
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:07,327
<i>Well that goes 300 feet in the
earth but it moves really slowly. </i>

229
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:10,857
So it's not a free fall ?

230
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:13,375
<i>It's a industrial coal elevator. </i>

231
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,889
All right. Once you get
down into the mine,

232
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:21,719
what, you got laser tag or something ?

233
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,047
OK ok so I don't know what
the surprise is, am I worried ?

234
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,815
Nooo. No way.
You see I thrive on this.

235
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:31,491
This is my world, this is improv,
this it "whose line is it anyway".

236
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:37,543
<i>Damn it ! damn it ! Jim ! </i>

237
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:40,125
All right, who did this ?

238
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,487
I'm not mad, I just want to know
who did it, so I can punish them.

239
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:43,838
What are you talking about ?

240
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:47,754
"Someone", forged medical
information, and that is felony.

241
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:51,150
Ok "wow", cause that is
a pretty intense accusation.

242
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,687
How do you know that they're fake ?

243
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,944
Uh, Leprosy ?

244
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,925
Flesh eating bacteria.

245
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:01,944
Hot dog fingers.

246
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,188
Government created
killer nano robot infection

247
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:09,468
- You did this didn't you ?
- Absolutely not.

248
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:10,529
- Yes you did.
- No I didn't.

249
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,401
I know it was you.
Ok fine, you know what ?

250
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,436
I'm gonna have to interview
each and everyone of you

251
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,330
Until the perpetrator
makes him or herself known.

252
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:21,188
And until that time, there will be
no healthcare coverage for anyone.

253
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:29,330
- Killer Nano Robots ?
- It's an epidemic.

254
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:35,677
The problem Jim, is that people
who are really suffering

255
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:38,981
from a medical condition,
won't receive the care they need,

256
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,575
because someone in this office has
coming up with all those ridiculous stuff

257
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:48,121
- "Count Choculitis. ".
- Sounds tough.

258
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,641
Why did you write that down Jim ?

259
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,041
- Is it because you know I love Count Chocula ?
- Do you ?

260
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:57,320
I think you need to confess the fact.

261
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,925
- Yeah.
- What are you doing ?

262
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:00,661
- What ?
- Those are my keys.

263
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:03,061
- Good luck.
- Jim ! Damn it !

264
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:07,028
No ! Jim let me out. Jim, let...

265
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,227
The light green is a green.

266
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:17,945
- Jim Halpert.
<i>- Let me out. </i>

267
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,932
- Who is this ?
<i>- Let me out or you're fired. </i>

268
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,028
- No, you can't fire me.
<i>- Yes I can, I'm manager for the day. </i>

269
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,437
<i>Clean out your desk. </i>

270
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:27,003
Ok, can you hold on one
second, I'm getting a bip.

271
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,932
- Jim Halpert.
<i>- Hey Jim, it's Pam. </i>

272
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,411
Hey Pam !
How are you ?

273
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,829
- Jim open the door !
- Good. How are you ?

274
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,160
- I'm doing ok,
- Busy ?

275
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:39,099
- Getting excited for the week end now.
- Yeah.

276
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,665
- Yeah, what are you up to ?
- I'm not bothering you am I ?

277
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,679
- No not all.
- You don't have anything you're doing.

278
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,222
- I have nothing to do.
- Oh great.

279
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,097
Yeah no, this week end nothing
I'm not really doing anything.

280
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,422
- Might go to the mall.
- The mall ?

281
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:53,674
- I need new shoes.
- How interesting, what kind of shoes ?

282
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>- Hello ? </i>
- Hello.

283
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,576
This is Dwight Schrute
calling for Jan Levinson-Gould.

284
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,727
<i>This is Jan. </i>

285
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:05,132
Hi, Dwight Schrute calling,
acting manager Scranton branch,

286
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:08,267
Listen I need your permission
to fire Jim Halpert.

287
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,036
<i>- Who is this ? </i>
- Dwight Schrute.

288
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,795
<i>- From sales ? </i>
- Well.

289
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:17,431
<i>- Where is Michael Scott ? </i>
- He is not here right now.

290
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,190
He put me in charge of the office.

291
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:24,048
<i>Dwight, listen to me very carefully,
you are not a manager of anything. </i>

292
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:27,502
<i>- Understand ? </i>
- That's not entirely true,

293
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:30,627
Because he put me in charge
of picking a healthcare plan.

294
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:32,672
<i>- Really ? </i>
- Yeah.

295
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:33,502
<i>Ok. </i>

296
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,865
<i>when Michael gets back, you tell
him to call me immediately. </i>

297
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,216
- Call you immediately, good.
<i>- Yes. </i>

298
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:40,032
Listen, since I have you on the phone,

299
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:43,737
- Can I fire Jim ?
<i>- No. </i>

300
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:46,013
<i>Please don't use my
cell phone ever again. </i>

301
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,749
This is your cell, I thought
this was your off...

302
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,428
Everybody ice cream sandwiches.

303
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:02,016
There you go take one
take one it's all good.

304
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:04,080
Phyllis, safe pass.

305
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,186
I see Angela right, Angela !

306
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,315
Hey, temp, why don't you take two.

307
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,106
Because you don't get healthcare,
and faster metabolism.

308
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:18,029
Did you get the kind with
the cookies, instead of the ?

309
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,479
Why don't you just eat it ?
Ok.

310
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:23,431
Here you go Stanley the "manly" !

311
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:24,974
- Thanks.
- There you go.

312
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:26,691
This isn't the big surprise is it ?

313
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,199
Because we've been having
a pretty horrible day.

314
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:31,592
Nope, nope.

315
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,145
This isn't the surprise.

316
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:36,309
It's surprising, because
you didn't expect it.

317
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,665
But you'll, you'll know
it when you see it.

318
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,601
Michael, Michael !

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,316
I tried being rational.
Ok, and what happened ?

320
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,194
The employees went crazy,
I got no hope from corporate,

321
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,168
so that leaves me with no options.

322
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,670
I'm now gonna read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

323
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:10,182
When you hear yours read, please raise
your hand, indicate that it is real

324
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:13,317
If you do not raise your hand,
it will not be covered.

325
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:15,970
- What about confidentiality ?
- You know what ?

326
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:20,309
You have forfeited that privilege.
I have tried to treat you all as adults.

327
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,354
But obviously, I'm the only adult here.

328
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:27,272
Number one, inverted penis.

329
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:36,315
Could you mean vagina ?
Because if you do I want that covered.

330
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,268
I thought your vagina was removed
during you hysterectomy.

331
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,031
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

332
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:02,521
Ok great. "Germatitus".
Thank you Angela,

333
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:08,511
I'll make sure that's covered. Ok now,
who wrote this, this hysterical one ?

334
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:11,564
- Anal fissures.
- That's a real thing.

335
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,936
Yeah but no one here has it.

336
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:19,208
Someone has it.

337
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,952
- Do you think we should go.
- I don't know, Kevin this is important.

338
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:34,245
I don't want futileness.

339
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,744
- What is he doing ?
- I don't know.

340
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,613
Well ?

341
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:50,292
Well, what ?

342
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,157
- You could be referring to anything.
- Ok,

343
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:54,642
The healthcare plan.

344
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,256
Why did you put Dwight in charge
of that, he did an horrible job.

345
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:59,465
Dwight ?

346
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,022
- Did you raise benefits ?
- I most certainly did not.

347
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,877
come on ! That's horrible !

348
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,707
Thanks Dwight for a crappy plan.

349
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,205
Damn.

350
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:15,266
I wish I had time to change it, but...

351
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:18,874
Jan needs it by five and...
What time is it ? What time is it ?

352
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,874
It's after five.

353
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,642
It's awful.

354
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,141
So well, ok.

355
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:29,977
See you guys on Monday.

356
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,832
What about the surprise ?

357
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:35,330
Yes exactly.

358
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:38,398
Thank you Angela
for reminding me.

359
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:40,887
Terrific.

360
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,144
Before I tell everybody
what the big surprise is,

361
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,954
would you like to tell me,
what you think the big surprise is ?

362
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,282
We all think you don't have a surprise.

363
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,967
All right, I have some news for you.
There is a big surprise.

364
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:58,182
And... here it is, here we go...

365
00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:00,044
And

366
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,034
the big surprise is...

367
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,941
Drum roll.

368
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,777
<i>When I am backed into a corner,
that is when I come alive. </i>

369
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:34,404
See I learned improv
from the greats, like...

370
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:37,317
Drew Carey and Ryan Styles.

371
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,118
Robin Williams, oh man, would
I love to go head to head with him.

372
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,189
That would be exciting !
"Hi, I'm Mork from Ork. "

373
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,996
"Well I'm Bork for Smork".

374
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,915
"anounanouzoubliblublu"

375
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:32,869
Jan wants you to call her.
