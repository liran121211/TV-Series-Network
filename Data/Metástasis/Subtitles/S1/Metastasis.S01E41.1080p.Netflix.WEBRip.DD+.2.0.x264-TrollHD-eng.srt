00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,515
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The attack on my brother-in-law,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't get what it means.</font></i>

2
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,019
- I fear for my family.
- Don't worry about your family,
Walter.

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,272
I am told the assassin that
survived is gravely injured.

4
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:24,042
I doubt he'll live.

5
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,778
I was told he's
recovering.

6
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,363
Now thank me
and shake my hand.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,620
Mr. Gustavo,
thanks again
for everything you're doing.

8
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,455
Thank you
and Pollos Hermanos.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,165
Our pleasure, Walter.
Good night.

10
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:42,768
Good night.

11
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,987
One, two, three.

12
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,907
One, two, three.

13
00:00:55,932 --> 00:01:00,478
He's gone.
9:44.

14
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,240
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The Police and other authorities</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">are working together</font></i>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to identify</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">the dead suspects.</font></i>

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,880
I can give you highlights.
Your nephews grew impatient.

17
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:32,468
They wanted my permission
to kill Walter Blanco,

18
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,986
but since I didn't grant it,

19
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,973
they settled instead
for Henry Navarro.

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,325
Right before the attack,

21
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,103
Agent Navarro
got a call

22
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,956
and that gave him leverage.

23
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,902
Oscar Luis
was shot in the face

24
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:52,046
and died instantly.

25
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,576
Luis Oscar
lingered for several hours more.

26
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,514
About who made the call...

27
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,643
That doesn't matter.

28
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,339
I have information
about Juan Bolsa.

29
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:15,594
The Federals went to his place
and in the confusion

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,114
he was shot dead.

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,184
It might have been an accident
or a mistake from his own men.

32
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,913
We may never know.

33
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,194
I thought you should hear this
from me.

34
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,992
That is what comes
of blood for blood, Héctor.

35
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:43,831
An eye for an eye,
blood for blood.

36
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,716
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I can't talk now.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave a message.</font></i>

37
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,218
I'm waiting to hear a report
on what we discussed.

38
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,071
Call me back, please.

39
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,479
I mean, one minute
I'm starting a new
business.

40
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,065
My wife and I are thinking
about having kids.

41
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,610
Walk into a doctor's office
and everything changed.

42
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,071
It was like an alert
for me.

43
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,258
It was a wake-up call.

44
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,914
I learned I had
to give up control.

45
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,708
It's like they say,
you know?

46
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,877
Man plans and God
laughs.

47
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,923
You definitely cannot plan
anything in life.

48
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,067
That's bullshit!

49
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,720
- Excuse?
- You can never give up control.

50
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:26,242
Live up on your own terms.

51
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,477
I get what you're saying,
but cancer is cancer.

52
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,040
To hell with cancer!

53
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:37,486
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

54
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,406
It's a death sentence.
That's what they
keep telling me.

55
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,077
Every life comes with
a death sentence.

56
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,955
So every few months,
I come here for my regular scan

57
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,667
knowing that in any moment
than can give me the worse news.

58
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,797
So fuck it all!
May be today, may be not.

59
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,842
But until then,
who's in charge?

60
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,193
Me!

61
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,780
That's how I live my life.

62
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,597
Those potatoes were frying
for more than seven minutes.

63
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,225
We have to deliver food in time
to the clients.

64
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,519
Besides, the potato loses its
flavor and texture.
Understood?

65
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,962
Pollos Hermanos delivery.

66
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,132
Yes,detective.

67
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,208
- Shall we?
- Take a seat, Gustavo.

68
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,476
Thanks.

69
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:21,423
I'd like to record
this conversation,
if that's okay.

70
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,552
- No problem.
- Shall we start?

71
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,722
Yes, please. I'm anxious to know
what this is about.

72
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,476
We found your fingerprints
in a crime scene.

73
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,786
Really?

74
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,372
That's surprising.

75
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,250
A drug-related homicide.

76
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,920
At Guido Bermúdez's apartment.

77
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,093
So you knew the victim.

78
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:53,372
About 12 years ago,
I started a scholarship

79
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,000
at the University of Science
of Colombia.

80
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,878
I called it
Maximiliano Arciniegas

81
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,856
for a friend who died young.

82
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,176
Mr. Bermúdez
got a scholarship.

83
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,179
- He graduated in...
- 2004.

84
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,821
That's it.

85
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,433
So you've been in touch
with him since then?

86
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,895
No, no, no. I lost his trace
for a couple of years

87
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,315
until I ran into him
a couple of weeks ago.

88
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,484
Where did you run
into him?

89
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,920
At my restaurant.

90
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:29,449
But "run into"
is not the right word.

91
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:34,663
He had intentions of getting
back in touch with me.

92
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,168
He invited me to dinner
and I accepted.

93
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,797
About a week later,
I heard about his death.

94
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,733
You said it was drug-related?

95
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,235
There's a great chance.

96
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:54,474
The paper didn't say
any of that.
I thought it was some robbery.

97
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,162
Let's see if I get this.

98
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,064
You hadn't seen each other
in a while, right?

99
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,650
So he showed up at your
restaurant our of the blue,

100
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,447
you talked, got up to date
and he invited you to dine
at his place.

101
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:12,910
- AM I following you so far?
- Yes. He needed money.

102
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,997
Excuse me, Mr Gustavo,
he asked you for money?

103
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,891
He didn't say it openly.

104
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:25,630
He talked vaguely
about some business opportunity.

105
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,484
To clear out your doubts,

106
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,220
I was surprised
by his invitation.

107
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,198
Guido was a talented chemist,

108
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:38,477
but for some reason I don't get,
he was more interested
in taking some shortcuts

109
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,745
that in what would have been

110
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,873
a very promising career.

111
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,360
But personal shortcomings
notwithstanding,

112
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,254
he was a warm,

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,175
gentle person,

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,635
and I thought a lot of him.

115
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,681
I declined his business offer.

116
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,143
We just had dinner and I left.

117
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,520
Mr. Gustavo,

118
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,422
can you tell us
were you were

119
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,008
on Wednesday 23rd
at about 8 PM?

120
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,928
It's not an accusation,
just a question.

121
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,433
Don't worry.
Let me check.

122
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,144
- 23rd?
- Yes.

123
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,165
It was quite an important event.

124
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,488
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.
Children with cancer.

125
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,758
We were there from 7 to 10 PM.

126
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,290
- Anything else?
- Yes, just a question.

127
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,379
Is Gustavo Cortés
your real name?

128
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:51,049
- My real name?
- Yes.

129
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,094
You're just related
to Pollos Hermanos.

130
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,238
Nothing else.

131
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,265
- Really?
- Yes.

132
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,741
I've been checking the records

133
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,455
and there's no Gustavo Cortés.

134
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,609
And when trying to access
the information,
it says "Access denied".

135
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,612
it's as though you didn't exist,
do you get me?

136
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,548
Don't you think that's strange?

137
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,716
No, I don't think so.

138
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,286
During a long time in my life
I worked for the government

139
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,957
trying to achieve peace
with the guerilla.

140
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:28,587
I helped making contact
and provided
some relevant information.

141
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,882
They decided they had to protect
my identity

142
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,610
for national security matters.

143
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,654
I guess they did it so well

144
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,823
you can't find the records now.

145
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,284
I shouldn't be telling you this,

146
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,811
but since it's necessary,
there's no problem.

147
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,606
After all,
we're in the same team.

148
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:57,299
I think that's enough.

149
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,950
Gustavo, thank you
very much.

150
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,496
My pleasure. I hope I was
of some small help.

151
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,499
- You were, absolutely.
- Fine.

152
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,126
- Thanks for coming. Goodbye.
- My pleasure.

153
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,088
- Say hi to Catalina, please.
- Thanks.

154
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,131
Goodbye.
No, it's not necessary.

155
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,136
I'll wait for you
at the restaurant.

156
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,806
Goodbye.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

157
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,565
- So what do you think?
- Of what?

158
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,709
This thing with the name.

159
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,086
If it happens to be true

160
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,697
that he made a deal
with the government

161
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,050
to negotiate with the guerilla,

162
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,537
we'll never get
this guy's real identity.

163
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,664
Much less anything
about his past,

164
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,141
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">that's totally erased.</font></i>

165
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,688
Let's analyze the case.

166
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,259
He was in a witness protection
program

167
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,180
because his life was in danger.
That gives him a status:

168
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,657
Victim.

169
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,327
Perhaps, perhaps not.

170
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,649
Don't forget these witnesses
are generally snitches.

171
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,402
They choose this option
just to save their lives.

172
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,406
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">what to think about this guy.</font></i>

173
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,049
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He could be a Messiah,</font></i>

174
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,620
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">a drug dealer,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">from the guerilla,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">from the military.</font></i>

175
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,097
All we know for sure

176
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,500
is that he's a ghost.
That's all.

177
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,503
- He's clean for me.
- Come on, Gómez.

178
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,547
No, he's not related
with this case.

179
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,299
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I just had a doubt</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">about why his fingerprints</font></i>

180
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,111
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">were in Bermúdez's house.</font></i>

181
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,639
He explained that
and the scholarship.

182
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,351
I'll admit to a certain degree
of bias.

183
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,746
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's a friend of the Department.</font></i>

184
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,357
He's one of our best
business relationships

185
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,584
and his story sounded credible.

186
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,362
No, we're not doubting
about this man's ability

187
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,505
to tell stories.

188
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,591
What do you mean?

189
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,802
Isn't it strange to you

190
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,330
that we're hearing this story
just now?

191
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,916
Didn't you just say
he's a good guy

192
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,685
who helps the community

193
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,504
and is a friend of the
Department?

194
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,589
Why didn't he call you
and tell you:

195
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,634
"Hey, I have a connection
with Guido Bermúdez"?

196
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,277
If he didn't want to ask you,

197
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,264
why not call
one of his friends here

198
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,227
and ask him
about the investigation?
But he didn't!

199
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,270
Why?
Why didn't he call?

200
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,399
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation

201
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,735
on a person
not making phone calls.

202
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,989
- Gómez?
- No, no. He's clean for me.

203
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,133
God! Ramón?

204
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,162
I'll investigate
about the scholarship
and the Presbyterian Hospital,

205
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:53,542
but regarding the story,
I believe him.

206
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,466
Ha!

207
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,676
Hi.

208
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,776
Good morning.

209
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,528
Is everything all right?

210
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,114
Thanks.

211
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,224
This is for this
month.

212
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,184
Plus a little extra
in case there's...

213
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,854
- Who's this?
- Byron.

214
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,818
Hey, champ!
How are you?

215
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,737
Buddy!

216
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,154
- How are you?
- Fine.

217
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,131
How's the new school?

218
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,491
- Fine.
- Really?

219
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,036
When I was your age,
I loved studying.

220
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,997
I liked reading, playing with
marbles and chasing girls
with sticks.

221
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,166
That was the best!
Old good times.

222
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:40,589
Don't you ever left him
go to Law School, please.

223
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,190
I'm just kidding!

224
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,886
All right!
He's definitely a champ.

225
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,906
Hope you'll be fine.

226
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,100
So can you thank José
for both?

227
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,436
Of course I will.
Sure.

228
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,955
How is he doing?

229
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,858
He's fine.
Perfect.

230
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,710
Very busy.

231
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,420
Bye.

232
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,546
My pleasure.

233
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,031
- Enjoy it. It's very nice.
- Thanks.

234
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,473
Mission accomplished!

235
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,852
So? What is it like?

236
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:23,340
Very nice.
It's a big house
with lots of light.

237
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,008
It's all right.
I saw the kitchen

238
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,512
and she's got a little
garden out there.

239
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,989
How's Byron?

240
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,932
José Miguel, I don't mind
dropping checks off

241
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,435
every moth for her.
For real.

242
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,979
I'm your friend,
your lawyer,

243
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,357
but if you really want to know
how they're doing,

244
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,652
why don't you go
see for yourself?

245
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,590
See you later.

246
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,950
That's it!
Do I wait for you?

247
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,303
No, it's okay.

248
00:15:54,454 --> 00:16:00,144
Okay.

249
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm the perfect bodyguard.
Ha!

250
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,828
Son of a bitch!

251
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,333
So how was your scan?

252
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,002
Did you get the results?

253
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,949
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm still in remission.

254
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,952
So you're all going to have to
be stuck with me
for a while longer.

255
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,328
Cheers, buddy!
Cheers!

256
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,624
Cheers. Thanks.
Cheers.

257
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,584
And how are you
feeling?

258
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,355
Fine. I'm getting better.

259
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,590
The other day he
had a big pow-wow

260
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,675
with all the anti-narcotics
muckity-mucks.

261
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,238
What was that about?

262
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,391
Nothing in particular.
Just a dead end.

263
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,078
He won't tell me either.

264
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,818
Walter, can you do me a favor
tomorrow?

265
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:52,238
María is working tomorrow
and there's a minerals show
I'd like to go.

266
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,091
Can you give me a ride?

267
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,300
Sure, of course!

268
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,219
Walter, thank you.

269
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,554
You spared me that one.

270
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,266
You're so mean.

271
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,715
I had a collection of my own
back in high school.

272
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,678
Just entry-level beryls
and garnets,

273
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,806
one passable black
tourmaline.

274
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,391
- I should turn here, right?
- No, no, no. Stay on this one.

275
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,645
- Are you sure?
- Yes, stay on this one. Do it.

276
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,941
But I did have one piece of
morganite that was very special.

277
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,834
It had been heat treated,

278
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,696
so it had that classic cast to
it, that rose,

279
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,033
- almost salmon hue.
- Listen, Walter.

280
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,619
There's no rock show
today, okay?

281
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,205
I just told that to María
so that she wouldn't freak.

282
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,291
So that she wouldn't freak?
Why? Where are we going?

283
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,810
You'll see.

284
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,562
Stay on this one.

285
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,057
What are we doing here?
Are you hungry?

286
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,643
- No, no, no,
We're not here for the chicken.
- So?

287
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,286
Park here.

288
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,123
And turn the car off.

289
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,752
Buddy, are you ready?

290
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:16,573
You ready for your mind
to be blown?

291
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,882
Are you ready?

292
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,450
Yes, yes.
Come on.

293
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,719
Remember Gustavo Cortés?

294
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,831
The guy who went to hospital
after the attack,

295
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,208
the one who offered a reward,
he's a friend of the Police,

296
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,335
the one who sponsors
these police races...

297
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,395
Yes, those marathons.

298
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:34,607
Well, I suspect,

299
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,467
because I still have
no evidence,

300
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,779
that he's a drug dealer.

301
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,739
For me, this man

302
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,035
is the meth Pablo Escobar.

303
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,230
He controls the business
in the U.S., Central America,
South America.

304
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,582
You remember Guido Bermúdez?

305
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,317
This gay guy
from "Maldita Primavera",

306
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,904
- that karaoke I showed you?
- Yes, sure.

307
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,965
Remember you told me

308
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,551
this guy was no genius

309
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,621
and there should be
someone much tougher above him?

310
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,291
- Remember that?
- Henry, I had been drinking.

311
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,210
- It was just a speculation.
- No, I don't care, buddy.

312
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,105
Thanks to what you told me

313
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,883
I kept on investigating
And you know what I found?

314
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:21,029
Gustavo Cortés' fingerprints

315
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:25,100
appeared in the crime scene
of Guido Bermúdez.

316
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,328
So...

317
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,649
You think Gustavo
killed Guido?

318
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:36,653
No, no, no.
These guys use a dunce

319
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:42,241
to pull the trigger,
but those fingerprints

320
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,203
was enough for us
to bring Gustavo Cortés in.

321
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:49,248
You brought him in
to anti-narcotics?

322
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,961
Right.
He sat down to talk to us.

323
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,964
He was totally calm,
like nothing had happened.

324
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,507
And what did you ask
him?

325
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,926
Did he say anything in
concrete?

326
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,638
Will you let me
finish my story?

327
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,265
- Will you?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

328
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,267
It's just that this is
so exciting.

329
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,979
I'm just anxious
to get to the end.

330
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,247
Listen.

331
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,582
We began asking him questions.

332
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,860
We told him that his
fingerprints had appeared and...

333
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,404
The guy had an explanation
for everything.

334
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,406
We asked him
about Guido Bermúdez' murder

335
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,968
and he had the perfect alibi.

336
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,428
He'd been with the Presbyterians

337
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,080
and I don't know what else.
Whatever.

338
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,057
You should have seen him.

339
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,392
"How can I help you?"

340
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,270
He was so calm.

341
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,649
He left us all speechless.

342
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,219
So you think
he's not guilty?

343
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,762
For Homicides and
Anti-narcotics, he's not.

344
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:49,017
He's officially not a suspect,
but for me...

345
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,855
For me, this is the guy
I'm after.

346
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,859
The thing
is I still have no evidence.

347
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,297
And...

348
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,949
Henry, why are you
telling me this?

349
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,204
- You see that silver van?
- Yes.

350
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,139
That's Gustavo Cortés' car.

351
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,100
I need you to help me with this.

352
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:18,396
You have to stick this on it.

353
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,398
You know what this is?

354
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,651
A GPS tracker.

355
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,945
This is what wives use

356
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,598
when they think their husbands
are crewing around.

357
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,116
It's a magnet,

358
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,019
so they stick it
under the car

359
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,189
and see where
their husbands were.

360
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,167
You get it?

361
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:43,404
Unfortunately,
it's not live use,

362
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,448
so we got to come back later
and take it off

363
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,134
and stick it in the computer

364
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,205
- to see where he was.
- Listen.

365
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,850
Isn't that illegal?

366
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,002
- Isn't it forbidden?
- Don't worry, buddy.

367
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,064
This is called "extralegal".

368
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,550
It'll cause no problem,
believe me.

369
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,944
Trust me.

370
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,989
It's out little secret.

371
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,659
This is what I need you to do.

372
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,413
You untie your shoelaces,

373
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,857
get off the car
and walk normally.

374
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,653
When you walk
by Gustavo Cortés' car,

375
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:26,781
you look down, see your shoelace
is untied,

376
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:31,202
so you bend, tie it,
stick this, get up,

377
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:36,374
get in there
and order whatever. That's all.

378
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,142
Henry, you know me.

379
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,503
I don't feel good
about this at all.

380
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,965
- I get nervous.
- I know.

381
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,676
I know you're not used
to doing these things.

382
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,888
But you need to get some action
in your life.

383
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,641
You have to get out
of your comfort zone.

384
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,519
- Right?
- I think this is a mistake.

385
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:00,706
- Come on, buddy. Help me.

386
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:04,110
This is very important
to me, Walter.

387
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,379
Do I have to beg you?

388
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,448
Just give me a hand.
Don't make a mess out of it.

389
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,161
Just go, stick it
and that's all.

390
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,639
Come on!

391
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,225
It's not a big deal.

392
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,004
Just act normal.
¡Do it!

393
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,340
Fine.
Untie your shoelace.

394
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,735
That's it.

395
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,237
- Next.
- I'll do it.

396
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,326
- Can I help you?
- I need to explain this to you.

397
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,955
I want you to know
that I didn't...

398
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,582
- How can I help you?
- I didn't do it.

399
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,769
I won't do it.

400
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,482
Do it.

401
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,528
Do it.

402
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,556
Can I help you
take your order, sir?

403
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,528
What was that?

404
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:41,767
I was just checking it was
in place and working.

405
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,369
And the nuggets?

406
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,503
Just kidding. Let's go.

407
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,041
I swear it!

408
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,278
I swear I thought
we were going to a rock show,

409
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,880
a display...

410
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:41,160
All of a sudden, he had me
pulling to Pollos Hermanos.

411
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,622
That's when he told me
he's investigating you.

412
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:47,833
He's operating
on pure conjectures.

413
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,422
And no one, not one person
that he works with him

414
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,357
thinks that you are anyone other

415
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,260
than an owner
of a fast food chain.

416
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,112
But if something

417
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,573
were to happen to Henry,

418
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,768
then that would only draw
their attention to you and me

419
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,036
and...

420
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,206
So we have a mutual interest

421
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,401
in resolving this
without violence.

422
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,087
I'll make sure

423
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,757
that he discovers nothing.

424
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,176
I promise.

425
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,311
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">José Miguel!</font></i>

426
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,678
- What?
- Hi.

427
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,974
Sure, get in.
Don't wit to be invited.

428
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,951
Are we alone?

429
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,271
No. Can't you see
all the people here?

430
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,751
Where do we stand on what?

431
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,206
stand?

432
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:59,697
Where do we stand with the thing
you were supposed to do?
Have you done it?

433
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,950
You still have the poison
for Gustavo?

434
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,511
Have you lost it?

435
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,455
You'd tell me if you
lost it, right?

436
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,332
Why don't you check it
yourself?

437
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,083
You can't stop
fucking me around.

438
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,269
Go do it yourself!

439
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,607
Maybe he saw me coming here.

440
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,762
No, no. It's okay.
You do it.

441
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,683
José, you have to make
this meeting happen.

442
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,578
This week.

443
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:31,954
Tomorrow.

444
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,108
- Tonight if possible.
It'd be ideal.
- Yes, tonight.

445
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,235
- Yes, yes!
- Tonight, okay..

446
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,296
What? Are you high?

447
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,157
My brother-in-law
from narcotics

448
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,218
is on to Gustavo.

449
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,828
Did you hear
what I just said?

450
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,139
My brother-in-law is on Gustavo!

451
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:53,042
Fine, fine. I got it.
Let me think!

452
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,898
So what if this

453
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,735
is like Math or Algebra?

454
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,305
You add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag
and you get zero douche bags.

455
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,476
I've got some Math
for you.

456
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:16,399
Henry catching Gustavo
equals Henry catching us.

457
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,943
He's relentless.
He won't quit!

458
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,700
- He's got nothing.
- How do you know that?

459
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,094
Because he's still alive!

460
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,805
You think a dude like Gustavo

461
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,791
would let your boy
anywhere near him?

462
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,210
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

463
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,879
You haven't seen him again
since that time at the diner?

464
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,016
He's got to be figuring
that we've talked.

465
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,660
That's it.

466
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,581
You need to tell Mario

467
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:59,817
that you're worried
about Henry's investigation.

468
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,460
Why?

469
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,296
Because he knows you.

470
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,340
Henry knows who you are.

471
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,677
Besides, you did kill Guido.

472
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,287
This is perfect
for you to ask

473
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,247
to meet with Gustavo
so you can discuss

474
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,542
what you'd say
in case Henry

475
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,352
brings you in for questioning.

476
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,838
You get that?
So in that moment,

477
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,257
when you're near him,
you poison him.

478
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,262
Mario will tell me
to shut my mouth
if I get busted.

479
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,347
He won't set up
any meeting.

480
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,533
Then insist on!

481
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,826
Do something!

482
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,829
Act panicked!

483
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,122
Gustavo's ass is at stake.

484
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,837
He'll meet you

485
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,905
if he thinks
you're a liability.

486
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,761
No, Walter.

487
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,638
He'll waste me

488
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,248
if he thinks
I'm a liability.

489
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:01,838
Whatever.
I'm going to take a piss.

490
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,647
You got a phone call.

491
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,325
Anything important?

492
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,512
Come in.

493
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,551
- I did some digging.
- And?

494
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,680
Neither Anti-narcotics
nor Homicides consider
you a person of interest.

495
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,015
What about
Walter's brother-in-law?

496
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,310
Henry Navarro
is looking into you on his own.

497
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:43,898
- A voice in the wildness.
- Does he have resources?

498
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,859
Just him,
his credit card

499
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,420
and his chauffeur Walter.

500
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:53,090
That means

501
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,493
- nobody ordered him
to track me.
- No.

502
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,345
He's on his own.

503
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,682
Let's watch our backs,

504
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,018
don't thrown them any bones.

505
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,603
He'll never get any evidence.

506
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,313
What about my past?

507
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,192
If they couldn't trace you,

508
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,136
I seriously doubt Navarro
can do it on his own.

509
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,725
Seems to me
the biggest problem
is the cartel.

510
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,228
We can handle them
if that's all we have
on our plate.

511
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,623
But dealing with both Navarro

512
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,152
and the Mexicans...
Do you get me?

513
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:36,158
If Henry Navarro
happens to be watching us
when they make a move,

514
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:39,077
they could be
the perfect storm.

515
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,835
Thanks.
I'll be in touch.

516
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,987
Hi, Héctor.

517
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,515
The cartel gave me
its ultimatum,

518
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,993
to which I've said no.

519
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,312
Agent Henry Navarro
from anti-narcotics

520
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,374
is a concern.

521
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,795
He's looking into my past.

522
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,556
Is today the day, Héctor?

523
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,284
Gustavo.

524
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,687
Calm down.
You're making me
nervous.

525
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,983
Stick to the plan.
It'll all be okay.

526
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,694
I know it'll be okay.
But I'm nervous.

527
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:22,258
They're coming.

528
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,271
Hello.

529
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,339
Mr. Héctor!

530
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:06,202
If the boss sees you,
he'll cut your balls!

531
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,971
Not if you don't tell him.

532
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:14,084
And they won't say a word
because they like what they see.

533
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,961
Mr. Juan, it's a pleasure
to see you again.

534
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,630
- Gustavo.
- How are you?

535
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,551
So Mr. Héctor?
You're not giving
anything to our guests?

536
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:28,182
Who said they're guests?
If the boss
wants them to drink something,

537
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,617
it's up to him, not me.

538
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:37,357
Pollos Hermanos is really good.
Mr. Héctor, the chicken is good.

539
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,610
I tried it in Colombia.
It's really good!

540
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:48,493
One is black
the other is white.

541
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,040
You don't look
like brothers to me.

542
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,417
The great Colombian chefs
are here!

543
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,127
- Mr. Eladio.
- How are you?

544
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,879
- Mr. Eladio, how are you?
- Hi. Take a sit.

545
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,147
Thanks.

546
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:01,673
I hope you're taking care
of my guests.

547
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:02,899
Yes, sir.

548
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:05,177
It's all good, Mr. Eladio.
Thanks.

549
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,778
Good.

550
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,181
- I've just tried
some great chicken.
- You liked it?

551
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,892
I swear for my mother
I'd never tried
anything like that.

552
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,438
That's good. You should tell
that to Maximiliano.
He's the chef.

553
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,524
Gustavo is so kind.
He's the reason
we're on business.

554
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,127
You should continue that way.

555
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,529
It has something
I haven't figured out yet.

556
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,657
- My men love it, right?
- Yes, there's none of that
in Mexico.

557
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:31,203
It's a rural recipe.
I adapted it.

558
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,013
And they bought it!

559
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,250
If you're the cook,
what the hell do you do?

560
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,627
Don't tell me you
just try the chicken.

561
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,672
No. I manage
Mr. Eladio's business.

562
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,884
- Gustavo is very good
at doing business.
- The businessman.

563
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,265
Offer me something else
you have on the menu.
Something special.

564
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,491
We have some side dishes.

565
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,312
Potatoes, fried yucca,
ribs...

566
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,771
- Ribs?
- Yes.

567
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,317
Juan loves ribs.

568
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,694
Anything else?
Any dessert?

569
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,464
Be honest, dudes.

570
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,158
I'm just asking
because when my men

571
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,160
went to Colombia
to make a deal over cocaine,

572
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,703
they didn't just talk
about the chicken.

573
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,724
So let me ask you,

574
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,709
are you producing
and distributing meth?

575
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,520
No, Mr. Eladio.

576
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,756
Excuse me,
but we didn't sell.

577
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,983
We sent samples.

578
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,094
- Samples?
- Yes.

579
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,407
What a businessman!

580
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,617
What we did with your men

581
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,287
was giving them some samples

582
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:42,874
so that you met our product.

583
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,627
Good.

584
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,821
Mr. Eladio, we didn't want
to bother you.

585
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,698
We just wanted to call
your attention

586
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,700
so that we work together
on this new product.

587
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:54,552
Don't worry.

588
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,764
We know meth here already.

589
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,749
We're producing it,
but not in bulk.

590
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,168
The business
just doesn't grow here.

591
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,337
They love it
but there's no business.

592
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,216
Excuse me Mr. Eladio,
I'm a biochemist.

593
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:11,261
I lived in the U.S. and
I've seen how this business
is growing.

594
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:13,613
The meth you sell

595
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,351
is not as good
as the one we produce.

596
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,479
It's not know in Colombia so we
have free access to inputs.

597
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,083
Besides, with our process,

598
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,027
we guarantee
it's crystal meth.

599
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:30,906
It's like glass.
It's pure.

600
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:34,910
The same molecule is different
and that makes
the structure different.

601
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:38,080
Therefore, the narcotic
effect is stronger.

602
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:42,459
Mr Eladio,
what we want to tell you

603
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,961
is this is the drug
of the future.

604
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,672
You could double or triple
your incomes

605
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:51,234
if you sold our meth.

606
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,970
The business has no owner
in Latin America.

607
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,723
This would be a big business
opportunity for you.

608
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,185
We could offer you
to build a lab in Colombia

609
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,121
so that you could produce it.

610
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,373
We think that's the way

611
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,525
for you to separate
from the Colombian cartels

612
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,503
and control the region.

613
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,781
You're not just good
cooks.

614
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,242
You're really good
at talking bullshit.

615
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,261
Héctor, they're my guests!

616
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,846
Go on.

617
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,874
Mr. Eladio, right now
you just do business

618
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,963
with Colombia
for the cocaine.

619
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,315
Mexico doesn't produce cocaine,

620
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,635
so that makes you
intermediaries.

621
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,805
We're offering you
a great opportunity

622
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,740
for you to gain independence.

623
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,517
The Colombians give you
money

624
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,728
so that you cross the drugs
through the border.

625
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,415
You're risking it all

626
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,900
and the Colombians
take the money.

627
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:53,155
Think about this.
Meth is more powerful,

628
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,617
more addictive and it can
be moved in bulk.

629
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,554
Best of all, it's artificial.

630
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,332
We can set up a plant
here in Mexico

631
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,916
or in Colombia.
As you wish.

632
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,518
You'd keep all the profit.

633
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,979
My men love the product, right?

634
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,773
Yes, it's really good.

635
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,842
Héctor, serve some tequilas
to my guests.

636
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,194
Come on.

637
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,726
Where did you get
this chemist stuff from?

638
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,412
I studied.

639
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:27,372
Gustavo paid for two careers.

640
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:31,609
I'm a biochemist
and chemical engineer. I studied
in Colombia and in the U.S.

641
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,612
With a minimum
investment,

642
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,823
you could set up a plant
here.

643
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,592
We could teach your people

644
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,871
how to make a better-quality
meth and in bulk.

645
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:47,142
So if I wanted a businessman,

646
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,545
someone to take care of business
over there,

647
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,563
what for would I want a cook?

648
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,718
And if I wanted a cook,
someone who cooked meth here,

649
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:00,196
what for would I want you?

650
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,892
Mr. Eladio...
Shut up, idiot.

651
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,353
What for do I want
any of you?

652
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,731
Coming to my own house
to do business

653
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,025
in front of my men
and disrespect me.
What, asshole?

654
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,069
- Please,Mr. Eladio...
- Please what?

655
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:17,614
We didn't intend
to offend you.

656
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:22,494
We just wanted
to have this meeting

657
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,206
in a friendly way.
We're sorry if we bothered you.

658
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:30,627
We just wanted you
to know our product.

659
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,770
Mr. Eladio,

660
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:37,426
Gustavo is the most loyal
and honorable person I know.

661
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:40,762
He got me out of poverty,
the place I was in.

662
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,266
He helped me become
who I am.

663
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:48,437
He's a genius!
He could make you earn millions!

664
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:49,979
Mr. Eladio,
please take into account--

665
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,601
Look at him.

666
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,528
Listen to me, bitch.

667
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,905
You know why you're still alive?

668
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,157
Because I want to.

669
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:11,227
I know you.
You're the fucking chemist.

670
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:16,232
From now on, you belong to me.
You work for me.

671
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,252
For the Tapatio cartel.

672
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,864
You'll sell us
all the inputs needed
to produce meth.

673
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:29,120
Don't be sad, dude!
Welcome to the family!

674
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:38,796
You want some advice?
Don't forget about the chicken.

675
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:05,407
Look at me,
Héctor.

676
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,469
Look at me, Héctor!

677
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,542
I should kill you
before the cartel kills me.

678
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,255
That would be
a great satisfaction.

679
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,094
But it won't be today.
Maybe next time.

680
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,389
I don't want to do you
that favor yet.

681
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,827
Expect no mercy from me.
