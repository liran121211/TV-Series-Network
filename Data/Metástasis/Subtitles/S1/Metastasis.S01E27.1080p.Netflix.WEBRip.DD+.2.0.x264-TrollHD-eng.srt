00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,070
NORTH OF MEXICO
15 YEARS AGO...

2
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:34,118
Why is this still
under discussion?

3
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:38,915
Yes, I know
they've recommended him

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,599
but don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:46,046
I'd never trust him
out product.

6
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,717
He might be a great cook,
whatever, but not for me.

7
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,319
he's just as asshole to me.

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:59,118
- Don't trust them.

9
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,896
We've already seen
what they're capable of.

10
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,195
Your brother
was just having fun.

11
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,631
You'll get over it.

12
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:15,634
I wish he was dead!

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,850
Oscar Luis!

14
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,939
Grab your old uncle

15
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,982
a beer.

16
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,804
No, no.
A cold one.

17
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,865
Grab one from the bottom.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,248
This is what you wanted, right?

19
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,567
- No, let him go!
- Your brother dead.

20
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,737
You're going to have
to try harder than that.

21
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:54,323
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

22
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,867
- One minute?
-No, no, let him go!

23
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,552
Maybe more? Maybe less?

24
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:08,020
Are you okay?

25
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:10,106
Calm down.

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,718
Don't you ever forget

27
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,403
Family is all.

28
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,159
Calm down.

29
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,580
- The ER?
- Through the corridor,
on the right.

30
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:25,873
Over
there?

31
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,631
- Where's the ER?
- At the back on the right.

32
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,078
Mrs. María de Navarro?

33
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,626
Hello?

34
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,028
[María talking on the
phone]
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">-Hi, honey.</font></i>

35
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,489
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've just got home.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do I prepare dinner for</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">both?</font></i>

36
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,883
How are you, babe?

37
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,076
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry, what's</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">happening?</font></i>

38
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,136
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry?</font></i>

39
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,596
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Babe!</font></i>

40
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,854
You want me to take you?

41
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,674
No, no, the old man
called me a cab.

42
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,196
Well...

43
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,618
See you.

44
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,359
- Where's the RV?
- I don't get you.

45
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,819
- What RV?
- Don't fool me!

46
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,379
Where's the RV?

47
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,989
No, sir.
There's no RV here.

48
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,532
Go search it
somewhere else.

49
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,827
You've just got
in real fucking trouble,
you heard me?

50
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,637
Say whatever you want!

51
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,097
My kids are lawyers.

52
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,267
Are they?

53
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,270
Yes, lawyers.

54
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,452
Move!

55
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,017
What's up, bitch?

56
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,378
Hey, you got
nothing on me,

57
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,796
You can call my
lawyer,
Saúl Bueno.

58
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,132
You know him, don't you?
Talk to him.

59
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,608
What are you doing?

60
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,237
Son of a bitch!

61
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,891
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name!
How did you do it?

62
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,270
Who are you working with,
fucker?

63
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,640
If you're ready to talk,
they want to get a statement.

64
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,910
Your side of what happened here.

65
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,122
Or we can wait for a while.

66
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,458
Whenever you feel ready to talk,

67
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,962
just call me and let me know.

68
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:12,576
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

69
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,620
Maybe you want to talk
to a lawyer.

70
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,825
Umm...

71
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,604
Let's
see...

72
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,147
There it
is.

73
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,733
Look, I know this is
not the moment,

74
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,568
but if I don't tell
you this now

75
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,128
I won't hold myself.

76
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,782
You look like Sofia Vergara
but from the back.

77
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,369
Easy, don't
worry.

78
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,079
I'm just trying
to cheer you up.

79
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,499
I'm your lawyer,
your friend.

80
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,085
Can you see this
picture?

81
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,378
You're not totally blind,

82
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,979
Are you?

83
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,481
I've got good news.

84
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,608
You see that?

85
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,595
It's your get-out-of-jail-free
card.

86
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,975
Just blink once
if you're following.

87
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,535
Good!

88
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,078
We won the lottery!

89
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,913
The lottery!

90
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,898
Can you imagine this face
out in public?

91
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,376
No, we won!

92
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,403
The anti narcotics
agency is shit scared

93
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,879
waiting for the lawsuit.

94
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,297
And that's not all.

95
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,049
If we wanted to...

96
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,967
we could make the press

97
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,469
fall on them

98
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,164
like a poop storm
raining down on them.

99
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,666
It'd be worse than the rain
of punches you got.

100
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,185
This beating

101
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,104
is the best thing for you.

102
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,273
Congrats!

103
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,316
You're home free.

104
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,901
What do you think?

105
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,278
Good, right?

106
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,626
Come in.

107
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,335
I've got good news.

108
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,071
You're now the cute one
of the group,

109
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,133
or at least the best looking.

110
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,349
José, I'm sorry.

111
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,709
Believe me,
I'm so sorry.

112
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,044
This shouldn't have
happened.

113
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,480
But it did.

114
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:33,108
Thanks to you.

115
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,152
But the plan did work.

116
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,637
We would've been
locked up right now

117
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,850
if we didn't lure
him away.

118
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,286
I'm not justifying it.

119
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,231
What he did
is totally unacceptable.

120
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,649
I never imagined
Henry would...

121
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,693
I mean, I didn't see it
coming.

122
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,805
What happens now?

123
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,875
I'll tell you
what happens now.

124
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,086
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished.

125
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,480
Do you get me?

126
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,384
I will own him
when this is over.

127
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,320
Every cent he earns,

128
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:23,434
every cent his wife earns
is mine.

129
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,495
I'll take everything from them!

130
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,830
I'll take his job,

131
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,458
I'll take his car,

132
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:35,462
I'll take his home.

133
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,740
I'll be like a shadow,
laughing my ass out,

134
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:44,955
and taking
dollar by dollar from him.

135
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,166
I will haunt
his crusty ass forever

136
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,043
until the day he sticks a gun up
his mouth

137
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,563
and pulls the trigger

138
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,649
just to get me out of his head.

139
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,652
Do you get me?

140
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,655
That's what happens now!

141
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,994
My advice?

142
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,997
That's probably

143
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,417
not a good idea

144
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,419
That strategy won't work

145
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,836
and I'll tell you why.

146
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,799
They're scared of you right now.

147
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,826
They want nothing to do
with you.

148
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,178
But if you hit them,

149
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,472
they're forced to hit back hard.

150
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,207
They will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon

151
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,726
until someone

152
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,853
spills the beans on you

153
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,856
and anyone associated with you

154
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,068
present company included.

155
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,970
- With all respect.
- Yes!

156
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,805
José, I think
what Saúl is saying

157
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,116
makes total sense.

158
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,395
Move on with your life.
Live it behind, all of it.

159
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:55,375
Nothing changes.

160
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,877
Once I get out of here,

161
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,615
I get myself a new place
and go start cooking again.

162
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,451
How exactly do you think you're
going to get away with that?

163
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,011
José, they'll catch you.

164
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,889
So what?

165
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,709
- So what?
- Yes, so what?

166
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,255
Don't you remember
I have
a get-out-of-jail-free-card?

167
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,857
Well...

168
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,217
I may have
overstated

169
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,260
the power of your
picture.

170
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,639
I'm not talking
about the picture.

171
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,784
If the cops catch me,

172
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,562
I'll give them
what they want the most.

173
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,082
You!

174
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,755
They nab me,

175
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,258
I make a deal to give up

176
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,136
the great Heisenberg

177
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,580
and his million-dollar
drug ring.

178
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:53,350
Do you get me?

179
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:58,689
You're my free pass, bitch.

180
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,940
Asshole!

181
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,452
Are you sure?

182
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,871
Id he didn't give up my name

183
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,997
while Henry was beating him,

184
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,416
he's never going to talk.

185
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,528
What do you think
that was,
a bluff?

186
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,197
He wants your
brother-in-law.

187
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,799
He's coming for him.

188
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,951
And there's going to be
lawyers

189
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,704
creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

190
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,706
I'd take it myself
if it wouldn't...

191
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,041
cause so much collateral
damage.

192
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,601
And him cooking again?

193
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,211
Let me tell you
this...

194
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,005
If he gets caught and
he's facing 20 years,

195
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,691
what will he do then?

196
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,427
He'll talk.
It's as easy as that.

197
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,306
There's no honor
among thieves.

198
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,726
Except for us, of
course.

199
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,855
- José will come around.
- And if he doesn't??

200
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,483
There may come a time
to talk options.

201
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,626
Options?

202
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,333
I'm convinced
Mr. José Miguel Rosas

203
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,668
is involved in the manufacture
and distribution

204
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,978
of the blue meth

205
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,522
we're looking for.

206
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,148
I tracked him

207
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:28,261
to a scrap yard
where he stored an RV,

208
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,765
which I'm sure he adapted
as a mobile lab

209
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,492
to cook meth.

210
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,911
The owner of the yard

211
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,454
asked me for a warrant

212
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,249
to check the RV.

213
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,502
I called, asked for the warrant.

214
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,531
While waiting
for the warrant to arrive,

215
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,758
I got a phone call

216
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,551
telling me my wife María

217
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:57,223
had been in an accident.

218
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,123
María, my wife,

219
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,936
Upon hearing the news,

220
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,187
I got on my car

221
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,175
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I left Mr. Rosas</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">in the RV and...</font></i>

222
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,693
I went to the hospital.

223
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,779
I got to the hospital.

224
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,072
I realized that...

225
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,452
that the call was a hoax.

226
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,078
My wife, fortunately,

227
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,332
was unharmed.

228
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,708
So I immediately went back

229
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:28,046
to the salvage yard,

230
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,299
but the RV was gone.

231
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,678
I'm completely sure...

232
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:38,582
that they destroyed it
on the site.

233
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,294
There's no trace left
of that RV.

234
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,480
What did you do after that?

235
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,632
Did you go
to José Miguel Rosas's house?

236
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,108
Don't say anything else.

237
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,568
Gentlemen, I think

238
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,236
we're done for today.

239
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,515
Agent Navarro
must go home and rest.

240
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,116
That's fine.

241
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,560
Just to give you all
a heads up,

242
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,729
Mr. Rosas is pressing charges
in this matter.

243
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,330
Right now

244
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,123
he's giving his testimony

245
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,834
to clarify what happened.

246
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,110
We're talking about
the testimony

247
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,862
of a meth dealer,
gentlemen.

248
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,238
Let me remind
you that.

249
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,798
We've read the files,

250
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,634
we know his background.

251
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,328
No drug traces
were found in his blood.

252
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,080
What's more,
this young man

253
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,975
refused to take pain meds.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,920
That's good ground
for the lawyers.

255
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,297
Right now,
everything is against this man.

256
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,633
Besides, he has
no police record.

257
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,735
He's clean.

258
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,948
So what?

259
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,242
Where do we go from here?

260
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,311
Some men from the OPR
are coming tomorrow

261
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,814
to carry out
the disciplinary investigation.

262
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,331
Vicky will give us

263
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,500
an exact time.

264
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,127
And you, gentlemen...

265
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,570
will be continuing
your internal investigation,

266
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,214
Thanks for your time.

267
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,133
But before leaving,

268
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,619
we need one more thing
for the record.

269
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,137
We must take some pictures

270
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,724
of agent Navarro's hands.

271
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:08,105
Bandage off, please.

272
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,841
On the table, please.
That's the procedure.

273
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,607
Hi.

274
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,361
Can we talk?

275
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,263
Yes, sure. Come
in.

276
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,545
I guess crime does pay.

277
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,822
I don't suppose
you just came by

278
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,049
to insult me, did you?

279
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,676
No.

280
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,721
We need to talk.

281
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,015
You heard about Henry?

282
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,584
About what happened
with this Rosas?

283
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,144
Yes, I know.

284
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,231
Henry was investigating

285
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,568
or searching for an RV.

286
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,722
You have anything to do
with that?

287
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,392
Is there any danger
that could lead back to you?

288
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,746
No. Why would it?

289
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,649
Is this why
you're here?

290
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,529
No, I'm here
to talk about Henry.

291
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:23,925
You know...?

292
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,660
You know what's going to happen
to Henry

293
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,972
if Rosas presses charges?

294
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,166
He could lose everything,
Walter.

295
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,603
His house, his car, his job.

296
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,315
I think maybe there's a way...

297
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,690
for you to help him.

298
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,192
Me?

299
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,693
How?

300
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,362
Talk to Rosas.

301
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:49,659
Get him to drop the charges.

302
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,728
I don't know
what kind of relationship

303
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,648
you picture me
having with this person.

304
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,941
Walter,
I'm not asking

305
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,668
but...

306
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,904
There must be
something you can do

307
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,614
or tell him,
don't you think?

308
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,343
Look, he was...

309
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,885
We're not friends,

310
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,428
we're not even close.

311
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,141
I'm not asking, but...

312
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,710
I do think
you can do something.

313
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,603
It's family, Walter!

314
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,982
Not in this moment.

315
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,818
What?

316
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,279
I said not in this moment.

317
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,058
Henry and I
are no longer family.

318
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,519
I'm sorry
but I'm late.

319
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,621
I have to go.

320
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,131
Good morning,
prof...
Walter.

321
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,757
I was starting to get
worried.

322
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,051
I had some trouble
with the bus.

323
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,386
It gets worse all
the time.

324
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,946
Whenever you need it,

325
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,640
just call me
and I'll pick you up.

326
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,158
Thanks.

327
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,868
What's that?

328
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,728
What happened today
with your floral shirts?

329
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:21,318
I just thought a bit
more professional.

330
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,860
Well, everything is
on track.

331
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,613
We've got our
distillate.

332
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,715
Let's get our trays ready.

333
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,743
I want them clean and dry.
No moisture.

334
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,205
- Done.
- Done?

335
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,334
It's done
already.

336
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,543
Have you filtered
the solvent?

337
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,188
Yes.

338
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,647
The catalyst?

339
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,508
Done.
It's all set.

340
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,444
That's good.

341
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:51,973
Every day
a new life begins.

342
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,558
Your coffee is
ready.

343
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,617
Come in,
gentlemen!

344
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,786
You have good
references.

345
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,789
Here's everything you
need.

346
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,666
Stop, stop there,
gentlemen.

347
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,168
What do you
need?

348
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:24,047
Rifles, A-K, M16,
mortar, rocket,

349
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,731
ammunition, lens.

350
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,275
Just look!

351
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,010
The boss called me
just in time.

352
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,861
I was about to leave

353
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,530
and get on the highway.

354
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,640
Gentlemen, you've got
good references,

355
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,184
so let's get down to
business.

356
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,102
Are you buying in
bulk?
For retail.

357
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,954
We can help you.

358
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,580
Whatever you need.

359
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,235
Look, this is the latest
we've got.

360
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,919
Take it!

361
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,196
This is for you,
gentlemen.

362
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,797
A gift from us.

363
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,158
You know what that's
called?

364
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,969
The black death.

365
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,038
As soon as that bullet
gets in,

366
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,498
Bum!
It opens like a
mushroom.

367
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,668
It destroys you inside.
It crashes your head.

368
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,503
I've already talked
enough.

369
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,063
You tell me.

370
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,482
What do you need?

371
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,883
- Vests.
- Vests?

372
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,593
We should have started
with that.

373
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,195
Vests.

374
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,514
When talking about vests,
this is the latest.

375
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,100
It's thermally
bonded.

376
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,143
It's ideal for this weather.
It's excellent.

377
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,329
It's like a condom.

378
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,065
It's soft.
You don't even feel it.

379
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,169
Try it!

380
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,297
- Do they work?

381
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,575
I wear one every day
to protect myself.

382
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,794
You broke my freaking
rib!

383
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,522
You maniac!

384
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,424
Son of a
bitch!

385
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,072
Guido, come here, please.

386
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,851
What temperature
did you set here?

387
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,454
In station five?

388
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,956
167 °F.

389
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,791
Why?

390
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,044
I told you 185.

391
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,238
I wrote 167 here.
That's what you told me.

392
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,006
You wrote it wrong!

393
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,342
I didn't say 167 or 200.

394
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,387
I said 185!

395
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,139
Guido, this is chemistry.

396
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,518
Each degree matters!

397
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,977
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,479
While you're sorry,

399
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,798
prepare 50 gallons
of sterile sludge.

400
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,718
Congratulations!
You've fucked it all up!

401
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,573
This batch is ruined!

402
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,977
You look nice.

403
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:12,340
If you like book-sellers...
That's fine.

404
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,525
You want some coffee?

405
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,260
- No, thanks.
- Some orange juice?

406
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,820
I'll have it in a minute.

407
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,474
No, I'm fine, babe.
Thanks.

408
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,827
What will you tell them?

409
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,688
Here's what you'll tell
them.

410
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,832
He attacked you.

411
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,442
- He attacked me?
- Yes, he attacked you..

412
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,278
He swang at you with
something,
with a pipe.

413
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,197
- With a pipe?
- Yes, he swang a pipe,

414
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,615
so your muscle memory
kicked in

415
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,742
because he was going
to beat you,

416
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,118
- so you just--
- Muscle memory.

417
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,679
- Yes, babe.

418
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,180
Years of training,

419
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,998
your body acted faster
than your brain

420
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,585
He was armed
and you had to disarm him

421
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,878
because he was going to beat
you, so you beat him first.

422
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,380
- María.
- So he didn't beat you.

423
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,090
- María!
- You just defended yourself!

424
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,050
- María, María!
- You defended yourself!

425
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,653
I'm not going to lie.

426
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,347
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you, henry.

427
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,724
Why should you be the one
who pays for doing
the right thing?

428
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,451
You did the right thing!

429
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,311
What I did is
wrong.

430
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:08,912
That's not my job.

431
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,274
I'm a cop, I can't
follow my muscle.

432
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,402
I have to be better
than this, María.

433
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,629
It was just a mistake, Henry.

434
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,214
No, no.

435
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,659
You and I know it was
not just a mistake.

436
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,161
María, I fucked it up.
I have to accept it

437
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:27,206
and face the consequences.
End of story.

438
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,225
María, I'm not okay.

439
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,604
I don't feel well.

440
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,591
I think all the time about
everything that's happening

441
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,718
and I don't sleep.
I don't sleep, María.

442
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,556
I wake up paralyzed.
I can't move my hands,

443
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,366
my body.

444
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:51,272
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

445
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,334
I panic.

446
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,379
I'm scared!

447
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:08,998
How long has this
been happening to you?

448
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,084
Since that Salamanca
thing.

449
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:18,716
Since I had to kill that
fucking Tuco Salamanca.

450
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,528
That changed me, María.

451
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,530
I don't know, I...

452
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:28,976
I try to get up every day
and be positive,

453
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,728
not think about that,
you get me?

454
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:35,082
But...

455
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,085
But then Mexico!

456
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:46,661
María,
how could I do

457
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,372
what I did to
that guy?

458
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,849
To Rosas.

459
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,394
You know me, babe.

460
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,380
- You know that's not
who I'm supposed to be.

461
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,797
- Yes.
- Am I like that?

462
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,567
No, you're not like that.

463
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,137
And with everything
that's happened,

464
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:09,450
I swear to God

465
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:13,145
I think this might be
a signal,

466
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,524
they might be sending me a
message or something because...

467
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:21,170
Or God or the universe.

468
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,865
The other day I told
myself

469
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,662
I'm finally ready to
listen.

470
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,497
Because I don't know
what else to do, María.

471
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:35,459
I really have no idea.
I...

472
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,421
- You know what?
- What?

473
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,468
María, I'm not the man
I thought I was.

474
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:47,263
And I think
that...

475
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:50,433
I think I'm done as a
cop.

476
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,126
This is not an easy decision,

477
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:05,531
but it's the one
that I have to make.

478
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:08,258
Look, I'm really sorry.

479
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,720
This whole Guido situation.

480
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:14,832
Things are simply
not working out,

481
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,476
sir.

482
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:22,481
Yes, now.

483
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,902
It may sound unorthodox,

484
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,804
but I think our first best
option is...

485
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,363
I mean,

486
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,825
our best option

487
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,786
is José Miguel Rosas.

488
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:42,459
Hello?

489
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,403
No, no sir.
Not at all.

490
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,046
On the contrary,

491
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,784
there's history,
there's experience,

492
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,763
we share a long trajectory.

493
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:56,540
I'm never going to reach that
with Guido.

494
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,147
Sir, when I accepted your offer,

495
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,358
I told you the lab was mine.

496
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,737
And I know best how to run it,

497
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:13,532
what's best for it.

498
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,332
Yes, sir.

499
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,794
Thank you.

500
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:29,381
Yes, I will.

501
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,384
Okay. Bye.

502
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,476
Will I have to see you here

503
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,936
every day or what?

504
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,938
José, I want to talk to you.

505
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,799
I need to tell you
something.

506
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,318
Do I have a choice?

507
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:00,897
José, something's
come up.

508
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,316
I think it's a good
opportunity.

509
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,276
There's been a
job opening.

510
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:10,464
I need a new lab assistant.

511
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,842
I already did my time.

512
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,912
Why don't you just get yourself
a monkey?

513
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,330
I don't want a monkey.
I want you.

514
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,433
You're so good.

515
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,353
I've got my own things going on

516
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,129
and that's more than enough
for me.

517
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,983
Besides, I'm no fool.

518
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,344
Nice try, saving
your ass-head brother-in-law.

519
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,139
That's not why
I'm here.

520
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:39,159
José, there's more.

521
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:42,939
It's more than an
assistant.

522
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,957
Partners.

523
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:50,905
We'll be partners
again.

524
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,283
One point five million
dollars each.

525
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,010
No.

526
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,057
I don't think you heard.

527
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,642
I heard you fine.

528
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,270
I said no.

529
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,815
Let me understand this.

530
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,592
You're turning down one
and a half million dollars?

531
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm not turning
down the money!

532
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:21,284
I'm turning down you!

533
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,912
You get it?

534
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:27,875
I want nothing to do with you.

535
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,713
Ever since I met you,

536
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,240
everything I've ever cared about
is gone.

537
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,927
You get me?

538
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,012
Look at me!

539
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,681
Look how I am!

540
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,976
I'm nothing, bitch!

541
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,228
I'm ruined!

542
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,899
I'm dead, you get me?

543
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,552
I died the day I met
the great Heisenberg!

544
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,366
I've never in my life

545
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:05,370
felt more alone.

546
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,749
I have nothing!

547
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:12,711
No one!

548
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,572
It's all gone, get it?
All!

549
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,553
Why would you get it?

550
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:25,557
You know why you don't get it?

551
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:26,976
because you don't give a shit

552
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,978
about people

553
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:32,006
as long as you get
what you want.

554
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,844
First you, second you,
third you!

555
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,573
You don't give a shit about me.

556
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,951
You said I was no good.

557
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,410
That I was useless.

558
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,287
What changed then if you told me

559
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,332
my meth was inferior?

560
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,610
You said that yourself,
remember?

561
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,338
Screw you!

562
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,324
Screw you, bitch!
Don't come back here.

563
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,493
And just
disappear

564
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:06,331
because I don't want to have
anything to do with you
again in my life.

565
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,893
Your meth is good.

566
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,855
It's as good as mine.

567
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,577
Hello.
What happened?

568
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,346
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Fifty-fifty.</font></i>

569
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,516
Yes, fifty-fifty.

570
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,727
Done.

571
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,146
Partners.

572
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,190
Perfect!

573
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,617
Is this the statement
that you want to give?

574
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,261
Yes, sir.

575
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,496
Henry, you don't have
to do this.

576
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,765
Yes, I do.

577
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,350
I accept it.

578
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,061
So we understand

579
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,521
if we write it up like that,

580
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,566
you'll sign it.

581
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,905
That's the way it happened.

582
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,866
I accept the consequences.

583
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,773
In the light of these facts as
of this moment,

584
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,986
you're suspended
without pay, agent Navarro.

585
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,587
I have to ask you

586
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,782
to hand over
your badge and your gun.

587
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:50,204
Henry, Henry,
hold up.

588
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,707
I just wanted to tell you
something

589
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,268
and you didn't hear it from me.

590
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,004
Don't want you to get
your hopes up

591
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:03,133
but the word in the pipeline
is Rosas isn't pressing charges.

592
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,235
Why not?

593
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,280
Who the hell knows?

594
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,241
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

595
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,010
Fine, babe.

596
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,804
Yes, it went fine.

597
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,958
That means
it went fine.

598
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,878
I'll tell you about it
when I get home.

599
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,023
You know what?

600
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,509
I think we may be okay,
you know?

601
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,405
Yes.

602
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,073
Okay.

603
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:54,951
I love you too.

604
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:57,954
Kisses, babe.

605
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,124
No, you hang.

606
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,585
I'm on my way there.

607
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,629
Bye, babe.

608
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,159
Hello?

609
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,728
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need you to listen</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">very carefully.</font></i>

610
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,439
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Two men are coming</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to kill you.</font></i>

611
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,941
Come
again?

612
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,001
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They're approaching your car.</font></i>

613
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,336
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You have one minute.</font></i>

614
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:49,756
Who's this?

615
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,717
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They're coming.</font></i>

616
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,970
Hello?

617
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,074
Hello?

618
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,575
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mail box.</font></i>

619
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,269
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after the tone.</font></i>

620
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:22,772
Gómez, why are you leaving me
those messages?

621
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't get the gag.

622
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,819
Call me back
when you get this.

623
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:07,352
Kill him.

624
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,832
Too easy.
