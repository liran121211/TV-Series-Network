1
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,808
Operation Icebreaker.

2
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:19,729
We never used that
before. How do you like it?

3
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,899
Well, I don't know, it...

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,320
It means nothing to me. It
doesn't suggest anything to me.

5
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:31,950
You know why, Gómez? Because
your imagination is very limited.

6
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:36,078
It's hard for you to think of a large ship,
right?

7
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,664
A ship that breaks ice crystals.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,542
You lack brains for that.

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,421
If I try to think about it,
let's say I see a ship.

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,758
I see the ice and everything.
But in the North Pole, buddy.

11
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:49,968
But in these lands?

12
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,552
Okay, okay, okay.

13
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:55,890
No, no,
no. Wait. What do the rest think?

14
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,099
"Icebreaker".

15
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,393
- What do you think?
- Come on.

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,355
You don't like it? It's easy to criticize,
right?

17
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,524
I haven't seen you
coming up with a name.

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,612
Have you come up with a
name? Nothing! But I warn you

19
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,949
you'd better not begin with
those mythological names.

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:19,163
Like Operation Orion or Phoenix.
No. All those names were already used.

21
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,374
- Who can think of a name?
- Operation Poet, my Major.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,876
Sorry?

23
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,522
- Operation Poet.
- Wait for me on the taxi, will you?

24
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,426
- Let's see. What do you say?
- Operation Laser.

25
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,718
Laser. Gosh,
no. I have an idea. Look.

26
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:33,812
- Operation...

27
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:36,764
[Henry writes BALL
BREAKER on board] - No.

28
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,224
It's perfect! Isn't
it? You don't like it.

29
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,436
Well,
you know what you will like? This one.

30
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,439
This one. Operation...

31
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,195
- IBH. Right on.
- IBH?

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,701
Do you know what that means? "I'm
the boss here". So that's the name.

33
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:02,540
Let's move on. Here we
have Mr. Domingo Molina.

34
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,167
Aka "El Loco".

35
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,671
Way smarter than your
average cheese-eaters.

36
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,507
No wonder he worked for us.

37
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,886
I've been on his trail
since he began selling E.

38
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,304
Now he's moved on
up on the business

39
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:22,518
and has a complete
catalog of designer drugs.

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,979
Mr. Molina, aka "El Loco"

41
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,566
became famous because
he squealed on dealers

42
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,110
and ended up snaking
their customers.

43
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,613
Let's give Gómez a
big round of applause.

44
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,782
- Bravo, bravo!
- Bravo!

45
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,036
What an intervention!
It's a great contribution.

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,580
Shall I go on, Gómez?

47
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:46,417
El Loco, one of our snitches

48
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,169
now turns out to be missing.

49
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,505
We think he was cut down.

50
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,800
Found his car
out in the boonies.

51
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,137
What do you want now, Gómez?

52
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:03,142
Everything suggests they
killed him for being a snitch.

53
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,310
That's true. Let's see.

54
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:10,274
Here we have Emilio Molina.

55
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:14,987
He's missing too. There's a
relationship there. Bear that in mind.

56
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:19,117
What matters here is that,
in El Loco's car

57
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,202
we found two grams... Well,
not "we".

58
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:28,250
"I" found two grams
of methamphetamine

59
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,671
which was totally transparent.

60
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:35,133
Take a look at it, please.

61
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,720
The lab guys had the
same reaction as you.

62
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:45,559
They tell us it is the
purest they have ever seen.

63
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,939
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

64
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:54,026
This is something different. It isn't
the crap with which we usually deal.

65
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:58,656
No, these aren't colored
candies they give to rich kids

66
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,700
to get them horny so they
stick it up some other kid's ass.

67
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,786
No way,
gentlemen. This is something big.

68
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:09,125
We believe this methamphetamine
was cooked here in Colombia.

69
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,877
Why? Who asked why? Was it you?

70
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,671
Be careful.

71
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,257
Because of this!

72
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,469
Come on, Gómez, try it on.

73
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:25,016
Try it on, buddy. It'll look good
on you. It has the same eyebrows.

74
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:31,730
We found this gas mask in
the same area as the drug.

75
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:36,610
What's more,
our guys swabbed the filter element

76
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,906
and found the same 99.1 meth.

77
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:45,327
And this means what,
gentlemen? It's crystal clear.

78
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,832
Now we've got a new cook

79
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:54,086
who's making his debut
with his first product.

80
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:57,048
We don't know if
it's one guy or more

81
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,967
if it's a kitchen full
of people cooking

82
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,761
if the guy's breath
smells of tequila

83
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,931
or if, when he goes to the bathroom,
he shits coffee beans.

84
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:09,434
We have no idea if the guy is Colombian,
Mexican or gringo.

85
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,437
Gentlemen,
the only thing we know for sure

86
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:18,527
is that we're entering the big
leagues of methamphetamine.

87
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,781
Such purity can only come
from a high-skilled specialist.

88
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,576
Me, personally,
I believe we're facing up

89
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,162
to a new kingpin,
who's producing

90
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:33,251
something we'd never
had here: crystal meth.

91
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,325
You're eating chicken
with hormones.

92
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,703
Jesus, Walt,
you're burning the shit out of them.

93
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,914
Honey! Order some pizza!

94
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,540
- He burned the meat.
- Okay, okay.

95
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,626
No, I'm not eating that.

96
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,836
- The coleslaw has mayonnaise?
- Yes.

97
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,881
Is it low-fat or
regular mayonnaise?

98
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,051
I don't know, it's store-bought.
It's in the fridge, go check it out.

99
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,428
All right, looking good.

100
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,976
- Henry, you need another beer?
- At last, buddy.

101
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,061
I have to be almost dehydrated

102
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,687
for you to bring me something?

103
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,982
Can't you go get it,
or you lost your hands?

104
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,191
Never mind. María?

105
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,777
Yes, please.

106
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,531
- Hey, I want a beer too.
- Yeah, sure.

107
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,410
And I want Shania
Twain to give me a tuggy.

108
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,579
The poor deluded creature!

109
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,872
How about some more soda?

110
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,417
Honey, do you need anything?

111
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,295
Okay. Be right back

112
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,815
Will you bring me my
jacket? It's getting cold.

113
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,841
- Sure.
- Why didn't we eat inside?

114
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,527
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, no, no.</font></i>

115
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,988
What, are you kidding me?

116
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,825
Girls gotta be lining
up left and right.

117
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,994
You look like a damn movie star,
man.

118
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,079
Despite your... you
do have something!

119
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,540
Seriously. You tell him. Tell
him how good-looking he is.

120
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,709
- You're adorable, my dear.
- Adorable? No, no, no.

121
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,212
Please,
don't buy that crap of being adorable.

122
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:44,215
You'll be pulling down
panties from every girl...

123
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,549
Henry!

124
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,843
in Colombia.

125
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,887
You don't wanna be adorable,
you want to be hot.

126
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,890
That's women's perspective.

127
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,268
They only want us to
become their gay friend.

128
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,645
And, before you know it,
you'll end up saying

129
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,482
"Did you have your hair
done? You look gorgeous!".

130
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,487
I'll give you some
advice for you to get a girl.

131
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:09,573
First of all you gotta be
constant and persistent.

132
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,075
You just gotta have confidence.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,493
That was what I
liked most from María.

134
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:19,208
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

135
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,254
Liar! You should've seen
everything he did to get to me.

136
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,673
It's true. Your uncle
here is a sick obsessive.

137
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,177
Yeah, I wouldn't like to be one
of those thugs he chases down.

138
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:34,473
Do you want a good
example of a real ladykiller?

139
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,849
- No.
- Good old Walter.

140
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,518
Yes,
sir. Do you know how they met?

141
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,939
Mom was a waitress in a restaurant,
right?

142
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,441
No,
your mother wasn't a waitress.

143
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,045
- Yes.
- She worked the cash register.

144
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,985
And it wasn't
really a restaurant.

145
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:50,822
It was a very nice café
in the Industrial Area

146
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,284
close to the lab
where I used to work.

147
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,871
One day, I got out from work,
went to this café

148
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,874
and suddenly saw your mom,
this beautiful woman

149
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,626
sitting at the cash register.

150
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,796
I got totally smitten with her.

151
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,925
Since then, every day, I got out from
work and made straight for the café.

152
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,011
And I watched her for hours.

153
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,643
Of course, she never deigned
to raise her head to look at me.

154
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,688
Sometimes,
people don't notice you're there, Walter.

155
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,983
Shut up.

156
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,944
- I'm just joking.
- The thing is

157
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,239
when I noticed this woman,
then I started going every day.

158
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,993
I rushed from work to the café

159
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:40,080
sat at the same table,
and she was there

160
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,082
just staring at the counter.

161
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:46,545
Until I discovered what she was doing
she was doing crossword puzzles. Right?

162
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,797
Pretending that
she was still working

163
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,176
she was only absorbed in
her crossword puzzles, so--

164
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,760
I hate crossword puzzles

165
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:58,265
but once I caught on to that,
I'd do crossword puzzles too.

166
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,600
Eventually,
I caught her looking over at me.

167
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,397
I took my chance and
began saying: "Excuse me.

168
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:10,194
I need help with 14 across.
It's a really tough one.

169
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:15,615
Four letters,
you can run it without legs.

170
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,242
- Risk.
- Risk."

171
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,538
What a lucky bastard!

172
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,498
How did she came
up with that word?

173
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,585
- That's persistence, you see?
- Cielo, are you all right?

174
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,547
- What's the matter?
- Mom, what is it?

175
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,512
Ask him.

176
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,891
What's she talking about,
Walter? What did you do to her?

177
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,198
I have cancer.

178
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,036
Lung cancer.

179
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,454
No way!

180
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,842
Ask him how long he's known.

181
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,844
How long, Walter?

182
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,805
I guess a month, maybe.

183
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,077
For God sakes, Walt. We're just
sitting out there like nothing's going on.

184
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,229
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

185
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,024
But Christ, these last 48 hours

186
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,778
have been the
worst of my entire life.

187
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:40,451
Buddy, why? I mean,
why wouldn't you wanna tell anybody?

188
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,701
Walt, don't you see?

189
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,038
Everybody just
wants to help you.

190
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,084
We're family. We get
through these things together.

191
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,962
And I don't get it.

192
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,882
You know,
lung cancer? How can that happen?

193
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,010
- You don't even smoke.
- I guess it goes back

194
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,263
to the time when he worked
in the applications lab.

195
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:05,476
All those chemicals they had
you working around. They're lethal.

196
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,144
They're shit.

197
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,104
Honey, that was 15 years ago.

198
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,816
And we always took
the proper precautions.

199
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,901
We should hire a lawyer

200
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,862
and sue that fucking
lab! This is their fault--!

201
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,197
Okay, Cielo. Let's focus here.

202
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,032
Because we kept our mouth--

203
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,742
Okay, so,
what's the next step for Walt?

204
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,912
Certainly a second opinion,
right?

205
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,833
- What do you think?
- Right. Right, absolutely.

206
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,627
Tomorrow I can talk to my boss.

207
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,920
He knows every doctor in town.

208
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,090
We'll find you the best,
the oncology dream team. I promise.

209
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,051
Thanks.

210
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,975
I'm gonna go check on Junior. I really
didn't mean for him to find out that way.

211
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,023
I'll go with you.

212
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,491
Oof...

213
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:12,292
Walt, buddy,
I want you to know that

214
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:19,216
whatever happens,
I'll always take care of your family.

215
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:25,013
You can count on
me. As long as I live

216
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,267
your family will have
everything they need.

217
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,154
Jose!

218
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,283
Jose. Jose, didn't you hear?

219
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,786
- Shit!
- Hey, Jose.

220
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,711
Hey, yo, what happened to your hallway,
man? Did the ceiling fall down?

221
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,669
Yeah, no,
bro. I think the house is just settling.

222
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,421
A piece fell down.

223
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:01,717
Jose, my uncle could fix you up,
he's a contractor.

224
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,677
He could fill the hole.

225
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,011
What?

226
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,097
That I have an uncle
who could fill the hole.

227
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,392
Which one? The basuco smoker?

228
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,643
No, the boozer.

229
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,106
Yeah? Yeah, right on,
I should grab that number.

230
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,274
Say, Jose

231
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,195
you still cook a little crystal?

232
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,072
Yeah, Gordito.

233
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,868
Could be, yeah. You know,
from time to time.

234
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,583
I heard you lost your
partner. Is it true?

235
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,003
Tell me, Gordo,
what's the word out there?

236
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,213
No, man, he's out.

237
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,132
Really?

238
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,594
He got lucky. They let him out
because of the judicial strike.

239
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,138
What a lucky bastard, bro!

240
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:52,768
I think he skipped
town or something.

241
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,063
I have no idea.

242
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,943
Hey, Jose,
maybe you have anything to have a trip?

243
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,406
Acid, E, coke,
sour mulberry juice--

244
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:11,453
Hell, yeah! It's Saturday night
and we're here doing nothing.

245
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,956
I want to get high, bro.

246
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,041
Didn't I tell you, bitches?

247
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,628
What is it?

248
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,213
Well, the last batch I cooked

249
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,425
was the best batch
I've ever cooked.

250
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,552
See, these are

251
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,350
transparent, no color.

252
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,895
It's like seeing the
future through a window.

253
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,230
So you learned to cook real crystal,
man?

254
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,441
Real crystal, Tripa.

255
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,487
But you know what, bro?

256
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,407
Lately it's been kind
of making me paranoid

257
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,951
and I didn't like it.

258
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,288
You know, Gordito,
health-wise, I'll just lay off.

259
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,791
Yo, if you're not into sharing,
man

260
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,126
- Tell us to piss off.
- We don't need no soap opera.

261
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,045
Yo, no! Soap opera? No way!

262
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,547
Look, what I have it's the bomb.

263
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,674
We could make three
joints and blow our heads off.

264
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,468
- Hell, yeah!
- Yeah? Three joints.

265
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,221
Five, if you want.

266
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,014
I'm off, bro.

267
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,309
No, Gordo. Gordo. No,
no. Tripa! Hey!

268
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,435
Yeah, I'm off too.

269
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,229
Hey, buddies, no. Don't go!

270
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,940
Hey, bitches! What's up?

271
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,568
Look. Look at this beauty.

272
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,612
Look what I've got here.

273
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,283
When have I let you
down? Let me introduce you

274
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,746
to the new collection
of José Miguel Rosas.

275
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:43,002
Crystal! All that you
want. There you are.

276
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,132
- Easy, Gordo, easy!
- Jose!

277
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,930
- When...?
- Brother! I love you!

278
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,266
Okay,
grab the pipe and light it.

279
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,852
The pipe. All right,
wait, careful.

280
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,365
Yo!

281
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,660
Tripa, don't go, bro. I--

282
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,290
Yo, there's more there, buddy.

283
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,167
No, no. Gordo, Gordo,
come here. Don't go.

284
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,628
Buddy.

285
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,713
Tripa!

286
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,092
Yo, don't leave. There's more here,
bro.

287
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:58,703
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">These are crystals.</font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif">They
weren't cooked in Colombia.</font></i>

288
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,874
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Oat cream! Oat
cream!</font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cold oat cream!</font></i>

289

291
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,970
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cold oat cream!</font></i>

292
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,343
Just drop it and let's go.

293
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,762
Do you say so?

294
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,806
Yes,
we've got a lot of work to do.

295
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,892
You're right.

296
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,354
Honey, are you okay?

297
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,190
Yeah, I'm fine.

298
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:23,116
Are you sure? I'm right
outside if you need me.

299
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,868
Yes, I'm coming.

300
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,839
Yeah, any time on Friday is absolutely
fine. How much is the appointment?

301
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,136
Okay. And in case he
does treatment with you

302
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,680
how much would it be?

303
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:53,604
Okay,
so Friday 10:45. Thank you so much.

304
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,652
Honey,
I've just called an excellent oncologist

305
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,588
one of the best in the entire
nation. Doctor Sánchez.

306
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,908
He founded the Cancer,
Science and Health Institute.

307
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,995
He's a busy man. He had all
covered for another five months.

308
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,391
But he worked us in and gave
us an appointment for Friday.

309
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:16,211
I mean,
María really came through for us.

310
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,129
How much is it?

311
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,175
Two hundred the
first appointment.

312
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,136
The treatment is expensive,
but never mind, honey.

313
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:30,225
We'll put it on the
credit card or whatever.

314
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,937
Our health plan doesn't
cover something like that.

315
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,940
What do you think Doctor
Sánchez's gonna say?

316
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:43,863
We already know what happens
with me. What difference does it make?

317
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,578
The difference is our
health plan won't pay for this.

318
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,874
Also, he'll be seeing you soon

319
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,629
and it's a quality
service. What can I say?

320
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,340
It's a private place so,
yes, it's more expensive.

321
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,051
But Doctor Sánchez is one
of the best in the country.

322
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,263
Patients come from all
over the world to see him.

323
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,809
Honey, in your condition, I won't
want you to deal with State bureaucracy.

324
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,811
Just imagine how
long could it take

325
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:18,397
for you to be referred
to a specialist? Months!

326
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,525
The doctor who saw you
didn't even return my call.

327
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,861
Is that the treatment
we'll receive from now on?

328
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,491
Do you know how much
does a private treatment cost?

329
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,953
One hundred and fifty,
one hundred and eighty million?

330
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,289
Not including medicines.

331
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,791
Where will we get
the money from?

332
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,339
What if we mortgage the house?

333
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,341
Don't even think about it!

334
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,093
We haven't finished
paying this house yet.

335
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,638
It's our only asset.

336
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,766
Well,
María and Henry have some savings--

337
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,352
- No, no, no!
- They could--

338
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,645
Sorry.

339
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:02,400
We're not gonna do that.

340
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,322
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

341
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,242
Have you even called her yet?

342
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,539
Walt, regardless,
you're gonna have to tell her about this.

343
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,167
She has every right to know
what's happening to you.

344
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:23,421
And if she wants to pray,
don't judge her, leave her.

345
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:27,258
She might even do us
a favor with her prayers.

346
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,764
This is the right moment for
you to come closer together.

347
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,143
If you don't want to,
I'm willing to do it.

348
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:41,231
No, no, no. I'll call her.

349
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,252
I don't even want us thinking about
money. Money is not the issue here.

350
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,571
It's your health what
matters. Nothing else.

351
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,075
No matter how expensive it is,
no matter how much we have to pay.

352
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,327
I only want you
to get over this.

353
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,789
That's why I want you to see
the best doctor in the country.

354
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,792
It really would feel better if I
know you're in good hands.

355
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,961
Don't you see it?

356
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,590
Okay.

357
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,220
All right, we'll go on Friday.

358
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:19,727
But on one condition: I'm paying for this,
okay? I'll figure it out.

359
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,065
All right? Thanks.

360
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,669
Hey,
why don't you knock before entering?

361
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,756
The latch was off.
What happened?

362
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,302
Nothing, the rubber of the
valve was damaged. I fixed it.

363
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,431
- So, what's up?
- What do you mean?

364
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,975
I don't know.
You're acting weird.

365
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,644
- Junior.
- You're acting like...

366
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,314
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

367
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,909
Hey,
asshole! I was waiting for that spot!

368
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,246
Great! What I really liked most

369
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:47,041
were those butts I saw over there. No,
Carolina.

370
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,010
We look like two grannies.
We drank almost nothing.

371
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,348
I think I ended up paying
like a million two hundred.

372
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,059
Nothing,
buddy. We drank nothing.

373
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,397
No, come on,
tell me what Carolina said to you.

374
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,898
That I want to know.

375
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,067
Sir, would you please hang up?

376
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,445
You can't use cellphones here.

377
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,696
Which cellphone? No,
no, this is--

378
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,241
Sir,
I don't care. You can't use it here.

379
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,247
No,
I did see him. He's such an asshole.

380
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:30,460
I've seen him at
the club many times.

381
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,753
He's one of those morons
who pretends to be rich

382
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,047
but doesn't have a cent.

383
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,383
- Sir.
- Sure.

384
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,510
Sir,
I'll have to ask you to leave the place.

385
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:40,719
I hung up already.

386
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,639
Next customer.

387
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,181
Sir.

388
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,808
He doesn't have a cent.

389
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,727
- Sir, your turn.
- He pretends to be--

390
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,104
What can I do for you today?

391
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,398
Thanks,
I'd like to make a deposit.

392
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,732
Sure.

393
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,571
I can assure you they're real!

394
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,448
What do you bet?
Anything you want!

395
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:04,661
What do you want to lose? Half
a bottle. No, a bottle at the club.

396
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,996
- Thanks.
- Are you afraid or what?

397
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:12,209
Sure! I'll take her...

398
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:18,343
I don't see why they force you to
choose between the cello and the piano.

399
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,593
You show so much
promise with both.

400
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,137
They say they can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

401
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,099
Because no matter how they divide it up,
someone would be left out.

402
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,559
Rules are rules, I guess.

403
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,523
And rules are to be kept,
my dear.

404
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,485
If so,
it's much better that you play the piano.

405
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,654
It's an instrument
of a higher level.

406
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,283
With cello, you might go unnoticed
among the rest of the orchestra.

407
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,244
And you have to train at
the best schools in the world.

408
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,664
For example, in Jiulliard,
New York, right?

409
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,082
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

410
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,002
Was that in our backyard?

411
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,512
Who's there?

412
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,016
Who's there?

413
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,185
We have security cameras!

414
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,730
Sofía, set the alarm off.

415
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:21,278
God, José Miguel,
you scared the hell out of me!

416
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,781
Why can't you go in
like a decent person

417
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,586
instead of freaking
us out like a criminal?

418
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,580
Mom, dad, little bro, what's up?

419
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,999
Got new patio
furniture. Right on.

420
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,757
Sorry about the
flowerpot. I'll fix it.

421
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,344
- What do you think it could be?
- I don't know.

422
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,305
Your guess is as good as mine.

423
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,850
Guillermo, I think...

424
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,019
- we should check his arms.
- Heroin?

425
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:37,938
No.

426
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,124
So much computer will do you no good,
bro.

427
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,546
Good old Sebas,
when did you get this?

428
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,634
Last year.

429
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:11,138
"Outstanding Student". Congratulations,
bro!

430
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,810
What's this? "Environmental
Consciousness Award".

431
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,978
What, you, like,
recycle cans and shit?

432
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,982
No,
it's an article I wrote to complain

433
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,943
about the paper used by
companies for their advertising.

434
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,531
It was in the newspaper.
I thought you'd read it.

435
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,912
Right on, little bro.

436
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,291
Right on.

437
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,836
Now, hey, remember

438
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,463
not all learning
comes out of books.

439
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,966
There's another
intelligence out there.

440
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,346
We should hang out more often,
so you get away from...

441
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:58,018
You know,
just... Just kick back and chill.

442
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,103
Maybe your elder brother
gives you some advice

443
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,523
that can come in
handy. Don't you think?

444
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,318
So what, little bro?

445
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,363
Are you already an
expert with the bass?

446
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,757
I'm getting better in hip-hop,
you know?

447
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,199
We could even make a duo.

448
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,035
- Yes or no?
- It's a cello.

449
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:20,207
Yeah, no. Cello,
I find it boring.

450
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,961
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?

451
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,713
We're good.

452
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:30,551
- Sebas?
- Yeah. Fine, Mom.

453
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,679
If you need something,
just let me know.

454
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,065
You see this?

455
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:49,612
What am I,
some criminal or something?

456
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,530
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

457
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,490
Now they must be like:

458
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:56,243
"No, Guillermo. We can't
let them spend time together.

459
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,120
He'll corrupt our kid."

460
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,202
They think I'll warp the
mind of their favorite son.

461
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,083
I'm the favorite?

462
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,295
Yeah, right. You're practically
all they ever talk about.

463
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,098
What a homo!

464
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,712
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"Why does professor Blanco</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">love Chemistry so much?".</font></i>

465
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:49,880

- Yeah?
- Yo, man, it's me.

468
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,576
Hey, listen.

469
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,244
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know that... product?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You got any more of that?</font></i>

470
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,791
No, Gordo,
you homo. I'm done doing charity.

471
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,793
No, no charity. No.

472
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,546
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

473
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:34,591
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

474
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,760
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What they had</font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif">didn't

475
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,220
So, I was thinking

476
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,848
that your stuff is,
like, so sweet.

477
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,100
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We can do business together.</font></i>

478
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,687
So, what do you say?

479
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,744
What the hell are
you doing here?

480
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,495
I said I didn't want
to see you again.

481
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,540
Yo, I waited till the ball
buster and your kid left.

482
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,086
Why are you here? You
wearing a wire? Who sent you?

483
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,712
Homo.
- You setting me up?

484
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,757
- What's wrong with you?
- Where's the wire?

485
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,383
Let me see it! Where is it?

486
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,010
You want a wire? I got a wire.

487
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,887
Speak into the mike, bitch.

488
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:23,515
A wire! Cut the crap
and all that paranoia.

489
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,683
So who did you tell about?

490
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,351
Nobody. What, are you nuts?

491
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,854
Then why are you here?

492
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:33,358
I don't know. I thought that,
after what we did and how we did it

493
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,778
maybe we needed
to talk about it.

494
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,029
Talk about what?

495
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,907
Everybody digs
the meth we cooked.

496
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,952
I got dudes that
would give their left nut

497
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:45,370
- for a little more.
- So?

498
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:50,250
I'm just saying,
if you ever saw your way clear

499
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,086
to you and I cooking
a little more...

500
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,546
- Get off my property.
- What? Why?

501
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:59,384
Go! And don't you ever
come back to this house!

502
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,345
Get out! Now!

503
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,561
All right, you know what?

504
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:14,274
Eight million.

505
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:20,322
Your share from selling that
batch. That's why I'm here.

506
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:25,410
Yeah,
I didn't smoke it all. I'm here to pay you.

507
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,830
Ungrateful bastard.

508
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,151
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

509
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,903
Stage 3A.

510
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:04,324
It's spread from the
lung to the lymph nodes.

511
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,368
There's no denying
it's very serious.

512
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,205
But it's curable.

513
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,749
I prefer the word "treatable."

514
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,460
The current treatments
can be very effective.

515
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:20,298
Through chemo and radiotherapy,
in some cases...

516
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,427
I can't make any promises,
but in certain cases

517
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,724
it's prolonged a patient's life and,
in some other cases...

518
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,018
Again,
I'm not making any promises

519
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,980
but it even resulted in remission. That is,
the patient recovers.

520
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,525
What about the side effects?

521
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,069
Well, in fact, there are.

522
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,156
They can be mild
or pretty darn awful.

523
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,159
I'll be totally honest with you.

524
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,327
Some people don't feel a thing.

525
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,832
For some other patients,
it's like torture.

526
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:58,128
Typically, there's hair loss.

527
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,463
During chemotherapy

528
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,634
you may find yourself unusually fatigued,
not much energy.

529
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,014
You won't want to get out
of bed. You may lose weight

530
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:12,935
due to reduced appetite.

531
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,396
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

532
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,524
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

533
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,585
What is this?

534
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:44,174
- You know nothing about it?
- Nothing.

535
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,678
How many times have we had the
same conversation over and over again?

536
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:54,268
Where you look us in the
eye and you plead ignorance?

537
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:59,022
And it makes us feel like fools

538
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:02,776
because our elder son
manipulates us as he pleases.

539
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,778
Enough, José Miguel.

540
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,073
What kind of example
is it for your brother?

541
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,326
We are not going to
have this in our house.

542
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:17,833
We need you to
leave once and for all.

543
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,876
Unbelievable.

544
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:58,456
Thanks for not telling on me.

545
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,543
Do you think I
could have it back?

546
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,258
What are you doing?

547
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,143
You've got to be more careful,
little bro, okay?

548
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,855
It's skunk-weed anyway.

549
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,076
This is awesome,
honey. You've got to read it.

550
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:35,994
Here.

551
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:41,624
Look. There are
a lot of testimonies

552
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,752
given by patients that
are actually very hopeful.

553
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:47,381
So can I call them?

554
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,926
And tell them you'll
start next week?

555
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,805
Don't you think that we
need to discuss it a little more?

556
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,724
Later?

557
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,351
What is there to discuss?

558
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:03,105
They're the best doctors.
We don't have time.

559
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,984
Well, for example,
there's the money discussion.

560
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,529
It costs 250 million
including surgery. It's crazy!

561
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,240
There's financing.

562
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,034
There's installment plans.
I could quit selling brownies

563
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,287
and go back to work
in some company.

564
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,998
Let's say that there is a way. And
we spend all that money. And then?

565
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,167
What do you mean?

566
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:26,836
Your health is priceless,
Walter. Don't you get it?

567
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,714
What if it doesn't work?

568
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,260
Honey,
am I supposed to leave you

569
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,804
with a 250 million debt?

570
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:41,226
Then why don't you just fucking die,
already?

571
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,937
Just give up and die.

572
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,538
An old woman's crossing
as if she owned the street.

573
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:46,875
Hey,
everything's all right. Today's my day.

574
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,463
Great, hole in one. Yeah,
perfect.

575
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:54,466
And you know who was
there? Paola Gutiérrez.

576
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:51,565
Son of a bitch! My car,
you bastard, son of a bitch!

577
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,442
What happened? My car!

578
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:55,902
Somebody! Somebody help me!

579
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,906
Help! My car! Call
the fire department!

580
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,117
Hey, man, what happened?

581
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,827
You were here! What
happened to my car?

582
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:09,207
Help! Put it out!
Bring some water!

583
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,000
Help, help! Somebody help me!
