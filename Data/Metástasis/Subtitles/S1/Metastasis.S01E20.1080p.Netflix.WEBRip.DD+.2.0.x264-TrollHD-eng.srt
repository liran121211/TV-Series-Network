1
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,092
Come on, cutie pie!

2
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,845
Come on, beautiful!

3
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,700
Come on, please!

4
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,834
Hi, Jose.

5
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,420
What?

6
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,714
No, I don't get a word.

7
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,133
Jose, hey, come on.

8
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,594
Just take a deep breath.

9
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,722
And now tell me what happened.

10
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,767
Mmh.

11
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,591
No, no, no, no,
calm dow, please,

12
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,693
now, calm down.

13
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,195
Listen to me.

14
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,139
Jose, Jose,
are you listening?

15
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,976
Look, calm down,
everything will be just fine.

16
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:08,998
I promise.

17
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,316
No, no, no, no,
you stay right there!

18
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,460
Don't you move!

19
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,796
I'm making a call right now.

20
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,381
Jose.

21
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,035
Easy, please.
Trust me. I'll deal with it.

22
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,419
Saúl Bueno sent me.

23
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,697
Come on
in.

24
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,532
Where is she?

25
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,345
Here's your story:

26
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,456
I woke up, I
found her.

27
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,517
That's all I know.

28
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,605
Come on, say it, say it!

29
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,977
it.

30
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,857
- I woke up...

31
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,901
- I found her...

32
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,528
- That's all I know.

33
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,697
Say it again.

34
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,700
I woke up...

35
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,869
I found her...

36
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,163
- And that's all I know.

37
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,458
All over again.

38
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,835
I woke up...

39
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,504
I found her...

40
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,466
And that's all I know.

41
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,719
I woke up...

42
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,497
I found her,
and that's all I know.

43
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,960
Once you make the
call,
the police will come
up

44
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,337
with the
Forensic
Department.

45
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,756
You have to talk to
them.

46
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,217
There's nothing
incriminating you
here,

47
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,552
so I don't think
you'll be
arrested.

48
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,429
They'll piss you off a
little,

49
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,806
since you're the last
person
to have seen her
alive.

50
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,451
Easy now.

51
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,562
If they take you,
don't say a word.

52
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,872
You have a lawyer.

53
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,375
Call Saúl Bueno.

54
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,194
And do I need
to state the obvious?

55
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,381
I was never here.

56
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,450
You put on a long-sleeved
shirt
or a sweater,

57
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,204
and cover those track
marks
on your arms.

58
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,248
Make
that
call.

59
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,209
But first count down
from 20.

60
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,149
Come on, cheer up,

61
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,818
it'll soon be finished.

62
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,679
You're in the home
stretch.

63
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,345
Junior!

64
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,430
Junior, it's served!

65
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,848
Morgan.

66
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,392
What?

67
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,335
Remember he likes
to be called Morgan now.

68
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:06,355
Morgan!

69
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,316
Coming!

70
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,696
Are you okay?

71
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,556
- Humph.
- Humph?

72
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,701
Yeah, fine.

73
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,854
Dad, mom, come
here!

74
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,540
You have to see this!

75
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,443
You won't believe
it!

76
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,054
What is it, honey?

77
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,472
Look!

78
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,752
Are those donations?
- Yeah.

79
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,438
All this is for your dad?

80
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,523
Yes, mommy, look.

81
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,343
They've already given us
750,000.

82
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,238
No!

83
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,390
Look, and they've written
from all over the country:

84
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:01,243
Cali, Medellín...

85
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,937
Even a couple of letters
from America.

86
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,082
Look, there's a message here.

87
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:12,279
"Hang in there, Walter,
you can do it,
you've a friend in me".

88
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,740
"Walter, I went through
the same thing,
have faith".

89
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,717
Isn't this awesome?

90
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,579
Yes, it's
unbelievable.

91
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,624
Junior, really,
thank you very much

92
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,268
for your help.

93
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,229
This is a big, big help.

94
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,739
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi, this is Juana,</font></i>

95
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,017
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">right now I can't</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">or I don't want to talk to</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you.</font></i>

96
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,228
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave me a</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I'll decide</font></i>

97
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,355
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">if I want or can</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">talk to you. Bye.</font></i>

98
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,608
Juana, it's your dad,
I knew you wouldn't
be answering.

99
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,027
Look, I need you
to have your bag packed,

100
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,738
wait by the porch,
'cause I'm on my way.

101
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,491
You're going to rehab today,
Juana María, please, okay?

102
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,425
I just woke up, and I found her.
That's all I know.

103
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,819
What's your date of birth?

104
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,321
It's July, 4th.

105
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,365
July 4th, 1988.

106
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,662
I need the mother's maiden name

107
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,248
and her address, please.

108
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,901
- My mother's?
- No, sir,
your daughter's mother.

109
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,170
Cecilia López.

110
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:21,216
Where's she from?

111
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,785
She was born here,
but...

112
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,580
she's been long living
in America.

113
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,415
We need to take the body
to the Forensic Department

114
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,226
to perform the autopsy.

115
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,645
Look, here's the address.

116
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,755
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

117
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,299
Yes, I have a car,
no worries.

118
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,900
Well, we'll be completing

119
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,595
the intake
and taking samples there.

120
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,614
You're also coming with us.

121
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,658
Come on.

122
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,190
Look, mom, another 30,000!

123
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,692
Walter!

124
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,654
Jose, it's me.

125
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,364
Er...

126
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,992
Well, no, I just...

127
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,354
wanted to know
how you're doing.

128
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,939
Our friend says
they've let you go

129
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,375
and everything went well.

130
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,336
That's good.

131
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,421
Er...

132
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,423
Okay, I don't know...

133
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,924
Just call me when you can.

134
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,138
I'd like to talk to you.

135
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,750
he's a good man,
a good person.

136
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,919
Thing is, right now
he has a disease.

137
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,796
I've been talking
to the doctor,

138
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,023
he says...

139
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,800
this operation
is a real chance for
him.

140
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,177
But this thing
will cost him

141
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,696
an arm and a leg.

142
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,947
So I need you all

143
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,768
to stick your hands
into your considerings
and think.

144
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,936
No, wait,
into your pockets.

145
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,021
Take out a big note
and make a donation.

146
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,981
It's for a good
cause, okay?

147
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,983
One last
thing...

148
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:23,029
The biggest
donation...

149
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:27,367
gets our last
Henry Special,

150
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,427
limited edition.

151
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,555
I've a question.

152
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,014
That also comes

153
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,974
with the purgative formula

154
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,560
you gave us last time?

155
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:40,046
Or does this one come
with the cane and all?

156
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,840
You're the ones missing
it,
no, they don't have...

157
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,177
Well, well,
that's for you, bro.

158
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,638
People really
appreciate

159
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,807
a high-quality
product, bro.

160
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,851
Alright, let's see,
what's in for today?

161
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:57,773
Juan Carlos
Ortega,
aka Gordo.

162
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,899
A month ago,
this chubby guy

163
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,418
was shot dead.

164
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,920
So today,

165
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,156
he's part
of our death bowl.

166
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,325
You may wonder
why this fat ass

167
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,427
wasn't in our radar.

168
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,970
You know why?

169
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,748
He was making his first
steps
as a dealer.

170
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,433
So no record,

171
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,003
no criminal history,
no nothing.

172
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,340
The only thing I found
was that the guy
stole a chocolate

173
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,176
from the cafeteria
of the kindergarten
he attended.

174
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,015
Why do I tell you
this, Gómez?
Let's see.

175
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,853
He was dealing meth,
Blue Sky.

176
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,354
I've a question, let's
see...

177
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,358
What do you think?
The fat ass was shot

178
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,027
and meth vanished from
Bogotá.

179
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,154
Not a speck to be found
in the streets.

180
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,281
Tell me, why is
that?

181
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,034
The answer's here,
gentlemen.

182
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,012
Because this man,

183
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,748
Heisenberg, Jaisenberg,
whatever he may be called,

184
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,349
is in jail.

185
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,685
Whether we like it or not.

186
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,186
So, Gómez.

187
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,839
Then you believe the
story

188
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,484
that this plain man

189
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,902
is Heisenberg?

190
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,487
He confessed, sir.

191
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,806
So, man, if you
give me

192
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:16,309
three chicks
in a delicious suite,
with three boxes of
whiskey.

193
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,496
I'd confess anything!

194
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,399
This stuff
has gotten me thinking.

195
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,917
Pay attention, look.

196
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,627
What do you think?

197
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,029
We've no more meth
in Bogotá,

198
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,989
not a speck to be
found,

199
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,076
why am I getting calls
from Venezuela, Brazil,

200
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,761
Peru and Ecuador

201
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:39,708
to say they're having
blue stuff in the
streets?

202
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:44,212
Blue meth
crystals.

203
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,925
Gentlemen..

204
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,261
Top-shelf product like
this,

205
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,222
it doesn't fall
off
the face of the
earth.

206
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,350
This guy
Heisenberg,
the real one,

207
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,979
is here in Bogotá,
and we have to track him
down.

208
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,981
This banana
plantation,
as you call it,

209
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,500
might be inhabitable,

210
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,169
but get out of here.

211
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,321
Four million?
Yes, please!

212
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,923
We've reached four million!

213
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,825
Another fifteen thousand,
and we'll have it!

214
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,343
Wait, wait!

215
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,887
Come on!

216
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,246
Look, another
thirty thousand!

217
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,497
Thirty! Four million,
fifteen thousand!

218
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,140
Yes, yes!

219
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,793
- My love, we did it!
- Good!

220
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,586
Four million, 15 thousand pesos,
for daddy?

221
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,104
Can you believe it?

222
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,564
Yes, yes!

223
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,592
Aw, no, honey,
don't you cry!

224
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,070
Don't cry, my love, don't.

225
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,529
We're happy.

226
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,389
We're happy,
yes, four million...

227
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,926
Come on, come on!

228
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,929
Move, you bastard!

229
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,132
I don't recommend it,
don't you turn up.

230
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,801
The police
are watching the place.

231
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,219
They keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

232
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,350
Where are
they?

233
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,436
Well, that's the point,
not to be seen.

234
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,856
But that's not
our biggest problem.

235
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,941
You could just get stabbed
or shot here

236
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,044
just for your shows.

237
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,589
Why don't you leave?

238
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,550
Go home, I'll handle this.

239
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,915
José Miguel!

240
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:02,135
Jose!

241
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,970
Jose, wake up!

242
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:08,432
It's me, Walter. Look at me.

243
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,710
Jose, I'm getting you
out of here, okay?

244
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,587
No, I'm fine, I'm
fine.

245
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,714
No, no, no,
you're not fine here!

246
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,734
Come on, hang on to me, come--

247
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,486
Come!

248
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,281
Trust me, come on!

249
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,699
Come on!

250
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,525
It's
alright...

251
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,627
Calm down...

252
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:40,090
I'm here with you.

253
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:44,786
- I killed her.
- What? What?

254
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,804
I killed her, it was me!

255
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,890
No!

256
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,268
You didn't kill anybody.

257
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,769
Jose!

258
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,147
Look at me, you didn't kill her!

259
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,775
I loved her, teach!

260
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,723
Hush,
it's
alright.

261
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,351
Alright
now.

262
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,229
Everything will be
just fine,
calm down.

263
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,234
Let's get out of
here.

264
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,792
Hello?

265
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,505
Yeah, I'm already here.

266
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,324
No, I haven't thought
about that yet.

267
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,100
No.

268
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,477
I don't see any yellow dress.

269
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,564
When was the last time

270
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,526
you saw her wearing yellow?

271
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,323
There's a blue one here.

272
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,059
It's the only different one,
they're all black and gray.

273
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:42,153
It's aquamarine,
no, no, it's not blue...

274
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,824
It has a pattern
of swallows flying.

275
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,594
Yes.

276
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,764
Yes, long sleeves.

277
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,809
No cleavage.

278
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,398
I don't know.

279
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:06,636
I don't know, look, you do what
you feel like, okay?

280
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,989
Yes, that's fine.

281
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,950
She'll look really pretty.

282
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,914
Bye.

283
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,919
Alright.

284
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,529
You'll feel much better
with this one.

285
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,632
Yes, warmer.

286
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,302
Mmh, that's it.

287
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,845
Do you like this one?

288
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,850
We'll be finished soon.

289
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,048
Let's go check out the noises
your brother's making.

290
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,860
Yes.

291
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:51,181
Would you mind turning
that thing down?

292
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,990
Junior!

293
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,618
Really, stop that dinging!

294
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,021
Dad, it's the messages
from the donations!

295
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,898
It's disturbing the
baby.
Can't you see it?

296
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,918
María, slow down, mmh.

297
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,280
Wow, I can't believe it!
Really?

298
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,215
Yes, no, yes, we can.

299
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,050
But after school.

300
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,094
Okay, I'll call you.

301
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,954
I'll tell him and call you back.
Bye.

302
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,040
- Guess what, honey?
- What?

303
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,641
They want to interview you!

304
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,459
- No!
- Yes, yes!

305
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,004
One of María's patients
at the lab

306
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,563
works at Las Horas.

307
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,274
María told him about the blog,

308
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,343
the donations,
the success you're having,

309
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,678
and he wants to do
a story about you.

310
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,155
With your picture!

311
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,697
Awesome!

312
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,976
- Humph!
- I mean, that's cool, mom!

313
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,120
Now, that means publicizing!

314
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,663
Sure.

315
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,067
- And more money!
- Yeah, mommy, nice!

316
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,252
Wow!

317
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:51,699
So you're saying,
San José de Guaviare,
all covered.

318
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,369
Montería, covered too;
well done.

319
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,622
Hey, what happened
with Cartagena?

320
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,391
Mmh...

321
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,335
Henry, Henry,
come here for a
sec.

322
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,853
Yeah, I'm coming.

323
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,355
Fine, okay.

324
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,590
Well, keep me posted
on Cartagena.

325
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,734
Fine, okay.

326
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,392
Well, as I was saying,
it's difficult by the borders,

327
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,477
- they're too long.
- But the airport--

328
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,162
Boss.

329
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,688
Henry, come
here.
Our agent, Henry
Navarro.

330
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,148
Come, let me
introduce you,
Henry.

331
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,775
Mr. Andrés Gaviria,
from Gaviria Hotel.

332
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,293
Nice to meet you.

333
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,919
My pleasure, sir.

334
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,905
Mr. Pablo Machado,
from El Último Piso
Real Estate.

335
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,365
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure, sir.

336
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,452
And Mr. Gustavo Cortés,
from Chicken Brothers and Co.

337
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,913
- Call me Gus, please.
- From Chicken Brothers?

338
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,291
Hey, look,
let me tell you something:

339
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,685
The best legs I've ever seen,

340
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,062
those are your chickens'.

341
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,690
Henry, Henry, look.

342
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,427
These gentlemen
are helping us this year
with our fun run.

343
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,220
- They'll be our sponsors.
That's nice!

344
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,863
Thank you very much!

345
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,640
No, the idea is to give them
a little tour.

346
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,350
But I called you
because I want you

347
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,810
to tell them something,
anything

348
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,686
on your department's
activities.

349
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,205
Well, let's see...

350
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,606
The Anti-narcotics
Department,

351
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,859
as its name well indicates,
is in charge

352
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,569
of everything related
to drug dealing, right?

353
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,614
We've a couple
of centers in Colombia,

354
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,508
and well, I'm in charge

355
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,494
of a group right now,
we're dealing...

356
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,220
with designer drugs.

357
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,873
I don't know it you're aware
of what methamphetamine is.

358
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,834
It's a drug...
Have you heard

359
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,461
of a drug that's entered
the country

360
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,187
quite violently, lately?

361
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,356
Truth is, I haven't heard of it.

362
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,275
No, you're not the only one.

363
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,151
There's no information about it.

364
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:37,680
People don't know
of the dangers of this drug.

365
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,017
Look, we've broken into
a couple of labs.

366
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,620
We've hit on a couple of bosses,

367
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,704
but this ain't easy.

368
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,316
- These people put it all in.
- That's right.

369
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,193
That's why it's
so important for me

370
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,961
to have this race be

371
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,238
sort of an informative event
on this drug.

372
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,824
- Well thought.
- Okay, come on, gentlemen.

373
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,426
Thank you very much, Henry.

374
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,827
Let's go to the department
right over here,

375
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,245
it's Borders,
let me show you...

376
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,580
- We'll talk again later.
- Of course.

377
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,582
Nice to meet
you.

378
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,936
So...

379
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,838
Is this one of your
agents?

380
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,090
No.
That's my brother-in-law,
Walter.

381
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,151
He's got a health issue

382
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,345
and we're trying
to give him a hand, see?

383
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,721
What sort of health
issue?

384
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,698
Lung cancer.

385
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,199
Wow!

386
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,476
That's a rough
one!

387
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,077
Come on, no, no!

388
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,437
What are you do--?
No!

389
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,289
That belongs to the office

390
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,024
Please.
- No! How could you?

391
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,209
I'm happy to do it.

392
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,945
It's a pleasure for
me
to be able to help
you.

393
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,301
Well, thank you then.

394
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,995
My pleasure...
Henry.

395
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,098
See you... Gus.

396
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,258
I'm going to have my
surgery
on Friday.

397
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:58,177
So I won't be
coming
for a while.

398
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,306
I'm hopeful it'll go
well.

399
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,434
But if anything
happens,
you have Saúl, okay?

400
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,644
He'll be taking care
of everything.

401
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,064
He's got your money,
he's keeping it for
you.

402
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,488
Jose, don't think
about it, man.

403
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,298
Stop lingering

404
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,009
on things like these.

405
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,828
You need to focus
on your recovery.

406
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:32,144
I deserve this.

407
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,855
That thing you said when...

408
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,634
when we got stuck there
and almost died.

409
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,031
I understand it now.

410
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,808
I deserve everything
that's going on right now.

411
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,518
He was born normal,

412
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,044
but then they saw it was
ataxic cerebral palsy,

413
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,439
that's when the brain...

414
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,315
Walter's arrived.

415
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,192
Aw, Walter, hello!

416
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,803
We were waiting for you.
We called you about 50 times.

417
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,639
We're doing a feature
on Walter Junior.

418
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,140
Hi, wai--
wait a second.

419
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,058
María, you told me
it was an interview

420
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,893
- for the paper.
- No, yeah, that too.

421
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,979
But I thought, if
it's
good enough for the
paper,

422
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,606
it should be good
for the TV,
that's it.

423
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,609
- The TV?
- Yes, come on!

424
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:37,985
Is that
him?

425
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,445
Okay, the father's
arrived.

426
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,238
Great. We're starting
now.

427
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,782
Please, I want you all
seated here in the couch.

428
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,242
- Junior...
- Walter!

429
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:46,703
You go in the
middle,

430
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,579
and mom and dad
on the sides.

431
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,913
Ready?
- Yeah, fine.

432
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,557
- Hi.

433
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,334
Let me see the shot
you're doing...

434
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,752
- What's this?
- Aw, María...

435
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:59,231
Sit down, sit!

436
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,470
We'll start with a
close-up, okay?

437
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,614
Wait.

438
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,224
Let's see,
here...

439
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,601
The jacket,
it looks weird.

440
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,622
Okay.

441
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,522
Alright, ready?

442
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:18,584
Fine, okay, good.

443
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,712
We're starting now.

444
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,339
¿Whose idea was it?

445
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:24,699
It was
Junior's.

446
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,326
Junior came up
with the whole thing.

447
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,828
Junior, you were saying
your dad's inspiring.

448
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,931
Tell us about that.

449
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,561
Yeah.

450
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,564
My dad's the best.

451
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,804
And...
I don't want to lose him.

452
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,660
It's not only me,

453
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,954
we all love him here.

454
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,916
Describe your dad for us.

455
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,504
My dad's the best dad.

456
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,925
And he's a very good teacher.

457
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,037
He knows everything you need
to know about chemistry.

458
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,225
He's very patient...

459
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,086
He's always there for us.
Always.

460
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,566
He...

461
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,526
He's very...

462
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,821
Hum...

463
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,447
He's very responsible,

464
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,226
and above all,
he always does the right thing.

465
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:40,232
He's an example for me
and for anyone.

466
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,370
Does that put him to
sleep?

467
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:57,082
No, this one
just relaxes him a little.

468
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,002
We're almost ready.
I'll be back to take him
in a minute.

469
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,313
Thanks.

470
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,315
Well.

471
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,902
Here we are.

472
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,947
Yes.

473
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,366
Are you relaxed?

474
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:18,871
Humph...

475
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,832
I don't know what they gave me

476
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:25,127
but this stuff's incredible.

477
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,132
Yeah, we've seen that.

478
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,804
We'll be here when you wake up.

479
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,347
Humph. I love you.

480
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,213
- Give me the glasses.
- Hum, yeah.

481
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,066
Hey.

482
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,886
Now, I have them.
Where's your phone?

483
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,490
Which one?

484
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,273
Mommy, why...
Why does he have two?

485
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,088
Henry had suggested...

486
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,801
Forget about it.

487
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:17,246
Aw, mom, don't start
thinking ill of him.

488
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:21,124
He didn't bring the phone,
period.

489
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,316
You may start.

490
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,361
Gauze.

491
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,467
So, my dear Walter.

492
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,386
Pain level?

493
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,888
Fine.

494
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,890
I almost don't feel it.

495
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,750
Shortness of
breath?

496
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,353
Yeah, a bit, but...

497
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,882
In general,
I'm much better.

498
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,844
Good, it seems
everything's doing
fine.

499
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,387
I can't predict
the future, but...

500
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,223
even conservatively
speaking,
I'd dare say that...

501
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,559
you bought yourself
some real time here,
Walter.

502
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,161
So there's no reason

503
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,396
- to be pessimistic.
- Nice.

504
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,415
And...

505
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,193
When can he go back
to his normal life?

506
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,547
He will gradually

507
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,341
go back to his daily activities.

508
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,177
Can he work?

509
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,263
I'd give it a few more weeks.

510
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,807
You know, Walter:

511
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,460
Make sure you avoid
any heavy lifting, and...

512
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:31,271
Make sure you rest.

513
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:34,717
But, I mean,
he can be on his own?

514
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:38,387
I mean, can he do things
on his own?

515
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,864
Yes.

516
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,616
Yes, that's just...

517
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,201
Use your best judgment.

518
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,661
I think so.

519
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,163
Fine, good..

520
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,357
That's good news,
especially for you.

521
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,903
One less baby in the
house.

522
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:12,104
Diego.

523
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,924
- Welcome.
- Santiago, thank you.

524
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,720
My condolences
about your
daughter.

525
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,114
Thank you.

526
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,435
I thought the best thing
was coming back to work.

527
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,562
What a
tragedy.

528
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,024
We're all sorry
and thinking about
it.

529
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,001
How are you?

530
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,795
Good.

531
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,091
Well, after I...

532
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,593
after grieving for a while,

533
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,247
I figured I'd rather be here,
focus on work.

534
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,307
It'll do me good.

535
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,809
Sure.

536
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:59,718
Contact Southern Terminal,
frequency 119,95.

537
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:07,559
Cielos Peruanos 0111,
turn right.

538
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:15,734
Aerocóndor 006,
proceed directly.

539
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,419
I'm going to stay
with Henry and María
for the weekend.

540
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,773
How come?

541
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,816
I'm taking the baby.

542
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:43,320
María is picking Junior up.

543
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:47,141
You're staying here on your own,
two days at home.

544
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,059
I want you to pack
your stuff up

545
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,577
and leave.

546
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,289
Why?

547
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,065
Henry offered
to help you,

548
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,359
so that you don't have
to carry heavy things.

549
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,961
Wait, Cielo!

550
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,320
Hang on a second,
I don't understand.

551
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,239
Walter, I don't want you here
on Monday.

552
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,925
I want you to leave the house.

553
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,744
But, can you at least
explain me why?

554
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,474
Because you're a liar.

555
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,017
You've two phones.

556
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:17,087
- What?
- Yes.

557
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,647
Right before your surgery,

558
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,717
I asked if you had packed
your cell phone,

559
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,594
and you said,
"Which one?"

560
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,198
When was that?

561
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,033
Cielo, I was doped!

562
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,352
I was on the stretcher,
I was delirious!

563
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,979
I mean, I could have said
anything.

564
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,456
No, you know what I think?

565
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,500
You said the truth.

566
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,754
You accidentally told the truth.

567
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,782
Honey, I thought
we were over this.

568
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:53,098
What happened is...

569
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:49,636
happened?

570
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,875
It got me thinking again
about all the strange behavior

571
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,393
you've been having lately.

572
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,561
That weird behavior.

573
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,898
Like the day you disappeared,

574
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,927
I was out of my mind,
looking for you
everywhere, Walter.

575
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,154
I was desperate, calling...

576
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,948
hospitals, even the morgue.

577
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,408
That thing...

578
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,618
Your fugue state.

579
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,854
I really needed
to believe...

580
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,497
all that was true.

581
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,108
Because, who would make up
something like that?

582
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,792
Who?

583
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,027
Cielo, I really don't
get it.

584
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,712
No, wait, no!

585
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:25,839
This is...

586
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,490
You think I'm cheating on you
Really?

587
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,119
You really think
I'm having an affair?

588
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:31,745
I've been thinking about
it
for the last few weeks.

589
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,347
Yeah? Who with?

590
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,832
Who am I having
an affair with?

591
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:39,395
I even thought it was Marcela.

592
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,379
Yeah, I could see omething
was going on between you.

593
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,591
For God's sake!
Marcela?

594
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,551
Okay, what do you
want?

595
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,720
Want me to swear on the
Bible
I've nothing to do with
Marcela?

596
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,598
No, I know,
I've already asked her.

597
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,283
Yes.

598
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:55,060
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

599
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:56,519
She wasn't answering
my calls.

600
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:59,231
So I finally left
a message saying,

601
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,400
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

602
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,694
I thought that would get
her attention, and it did.

603
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,963
Because she called me back.

604
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,783
And she told me
everything, Walter.

605
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,223
Money for the treatment?

606
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:20,043
Edgar and Marcela
didn't give you one peso!

607
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,561
They didn't pay for anything!

608
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,563
Because you didn't let them.

609
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,882
But none of it
made any sense,

610
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,443
because when I called

611
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,219
the people
at the Cancer Institute,

612
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,054
they said that,
except for the operation,

613
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,323
it was all paid for.

614
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,824
Yes.

615
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,311
More than
190 million pesos!

616
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,704
Where did you get them?

617
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,292
Tell me, where did you get them?

618
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:45,402
- Our of nowhere?
- My mother--

619
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:48,464
I also talked to your mother!

620
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,926
I started to think that,

621
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,120
that your mother had
some money stored away,
and you had borrowed from her.

622
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,972
I mean, that was possible,

623
00:40:56,997 --> 00:41:00,183
you not telling me about it.

624
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,601
But it turns out, the money

625
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,104
not only wasn't from her,

626
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,383
but she also had no idea
you had cancer.

627
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,844
I left you at the airport,
Walter, and then picked you up.

628
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,947
You left for four days.

629
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,268
And your mother swears
you didn't go to see her.

630
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:27,319
- Cielo, honey.
- No, don't you touch me!

631
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,048
Lies, lies and more lies!

632
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,374
- Honey...
- No!

633
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,482
At least have the courtesy...

634
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,443
of not denying it, Walter.

635
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,707
Cielo, please, don't leave.

636
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,568
- Cielo...
- Don't touch me!

637
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,195
- Please...
- Hello.

638
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,949
If I tell you the truth,
will you stay?

639
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,243
- Stay, I'll tell you.
- No.

640
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,704
Whatever it is,
I'm freaked out
Walter.
