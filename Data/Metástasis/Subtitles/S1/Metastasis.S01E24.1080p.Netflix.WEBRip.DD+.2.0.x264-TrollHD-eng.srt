1
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,971
Thanks.

2
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:02,605
Hi. How much do I
owe you then?

3
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,066
Cigarettes plus food,
that's 40,000.

4
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,526
- 40,000?
- Aha.

5
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:10,671
Right.

6
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,386
Darn it, I'm out of cash.

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:22,249
I spent it
in gas for the truck.

8
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,351
Can I give you my card?

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,271
Look, only cash here.

10
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,732
Only cash.

11
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,759
Do you know
where there might be an ATM?

12
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,402
There's one in town,

13
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,304
but it's like a half
hour
from here.

14
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,656
Like a half hour.

15
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:40,225
Can I go there
and come back and pay?

16
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,827
I swear I will.

17
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,563
I believe you,
but if the owner came

18
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,524
and checked the
register,

19
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,026
I'd be the one in
trouble.

20
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,320
Right. No, don't you worry,
you're so nice.

21
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,631
So do you like Fucking People?

22
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,908
- Who?
- The English band.

23
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,468
The Fakin Popol!

24
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,786
Sure, they're the best
ever.

25
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,345
They're cool aren't they?

26
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,206
Those guys sure make
good music.

27
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,416
Dirty bitch, dirty bitch,
dirty bitch...!

28
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,170
Yes, they're the
best ever.

29
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,172
I'd do anything
to get a hold

30
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,383
of what that man gets
to make that music.

31
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,761
Because it's not pot.
I smoke a lot, but...

32
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,889
The Fokin guys
have something else.

33
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,448
Really?

34
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,868
So you smoke pot?

35
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,703
No, what those guys do

36
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,330
is meth.

37
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:30,693
No, we don't
have that here.

38
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,254
What if I told you there is?

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,256
Could I pay you with that?

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,118
But isn't that
like dangerous,

41
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,719
addictive, like basuco?

42
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,180
This?

43
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,722
No, no way.

44
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,541
There's no comparing this
to basuco.

45
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,267
No, basuco is nasty,

46
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,769
basuco's for poor people.

47
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:53,632
Look, this has little crystals.
Pure glamour.

48
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,234
This is the stuff

49
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,470
the rich people in Bogota
are doing.

50
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,348
So do you smoke
or inhale that?

51
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,744
Anyway you want.

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,732
So how does it
feel?

53
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,668
How does it feel?

54
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,445
It's kinda hard
to explain with words.

55
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,463
It's like...

56
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,866
Like all your senses
are sharp,

57
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,036
and all of a sudden,
everything's more interesting,

58
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,412
everything makes sense,
you know?

59
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,956
Like the music
by Fokin.

60
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:28,333
Hello, child.
Two coffees, please.

61
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,939
Just a moment, please.

62
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,942
So what do you say?

63
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,016
Well, thank you for your
purchase, and come again.

64
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,703
Okay, thanks.

65
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,748
Hi.

66
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,739
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">How do you feel?</font></i>

67
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,184
I can't move,
I can't breathe.

68
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,479
- It itches.
- Loosen it up.

69
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,331
There!

70
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,942
- Better?
- Much better, obviously.

71
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,585
Right, right.

72
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,487
You know when you'll start
to feel bad,

73
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,280
really bad,
you won't be able to breathe

74
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,382
and your neck will itch?

75
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,385
When you don't get compensation.

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,288
So from now on,
do me a favor

77
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,015
and fasten this tight.

78
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,725
Nice and tight

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,295
as much as you can and hold it
until the day of the trial.

80
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,132
You're not taking it off
in public, is that clear?

81
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,817
Right, now,

82
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,719
if you know of anyone else
that has suffered

83
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,264
some light or strong
psychological or physical trauma

84
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,976
because of the plane accident,
send them over to me.

85
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,148
I'll see you at court,
alright?

86
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,375
Fine, doctor.

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,943
- See you later, excuse me.
- Go ahead.

88
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:24,549
There, that's the spirit!

89
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,552
Is there a problem?

90
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,374
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You slept</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">with Ernesto Silva?</font></i>

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">aren't you?</font></i>

95
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,509
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You called me a "charlatan",</font>

96
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:44,678
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- No, I never said that.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">- But you implied it.</font></i>

97
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:46,972
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You dared me</font>

98
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:48,432

What was that?

118
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,596
She's blending the soup
for the baby.

119
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,514
Well, first things
first, right?

00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,966
Is that good or bad?

129
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,385
There's more.

It' bad.

136
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,648
- How much is it?
- Seven.

137
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,793
Thanks.

138
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,291
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

139
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,435
How can I help you?

140
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,936
My name is Walter Blanco,

141
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,047
and I came to speak
to Mr. Silva.

142
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,549
Mr. Silva
is very busy at this time.

143
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,509
He's unavailable now,
he's in a meeting.

144
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,970
No problem, I'll
wait.

145
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,431
Sir, I'm sorry
but he's in a meeting

146
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,032
and it'll be a while.

147
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,767
Miss, I have all the time
in the world,

148
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,870
don't you worry.

149
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,543
Dr. Silva,

150
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,987
Mr. Walter Blanco
is at the reception desk.

151
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,714
What should I do?

152
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,885
Fine, sir, alright.

153
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,290
Ernesto. There he is,
there he is, don't worry.

154
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,833
- Ernesto, Ernesto!
- Sir, what are you doing?

155
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,394
You cannot go in there, sir!

156
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,714
Open up, Ernesto,
I can see you!

157
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,717
I know you're there,
don't you hide!

158
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,511
Ernesto,
don't be such a paranoid!

159
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,532
I just need to talk to you.

160
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,241
Open the door!

161
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:40,812
I need us to talk
in a civil manner!

162
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,148
Walter, it's just that
I can't talk right now

163
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,942
because I'm busy,
in the middle of--

164
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,544
Yes, exactly!

165
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,903
You're in the middle
of something,

166
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,864
and that's precisely
what I'm here to talk about.

167
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,509
Open the door!

168
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,470
Ernesto, open the door!

169
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,349
You're not going to open it?

170
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,251
Perfect,
because I have a plan B.

171
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,019
Because you asked for it.

172
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,255
Walter, Walter, calm down.
What are you doing?

173
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,299
I'm talking to
Ernesto.

174
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,509
Please, calm down.
What are you doing?

175
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,344
- Move over, move over!
- Hey, hey!

176
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,180
Hey, Walter, my God,
what are you doing?

177
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,865
Wait, Walter!

178
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,351
And next time I tell you
to open the door,

179
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,827
I suggest you open it!

180
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,788
Walter, Walter!

181
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,290
What is this?

182
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,167
I just wanted to talk to him!

183
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,735
Whatever happened
to dialogue?

184
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,216
Let me go, let me go, let me go!

185
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:39,263
I just wanted to talk to him!

186
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,765
nothing happened, relax.

187
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,270
Relax.

188
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,131
Just let me go.
I'm calm, alright?

189
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,215
What's going on?

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,845
What's the matter
with you, Walter?

191
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,431
That's not a reasonable
man's attitude.

192
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,032
By God, man, look.

193
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,160
I found my second wife

194
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,855
with her<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> personal trainer</font></i>
doing the 69 on my bed.

195
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,540
Jesus Christ!

196
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,901
The world is tough, you have
to get used to it.

197
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,544
I just wanted to talk to him.

198
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,280
Well, I'm the one who
needs to speak to you.

199
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,700
I need you to pay attention
and grow up, please.

200
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,702
Let's take what I'm
about to tell you

201
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,954
as a simple
legal counseling.

202
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,831
What if the police
would have got there

203
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,308
and caught you?

204
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,379
I mean, considering
your job

205
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,840
and how you get money,
your living,

206
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,801
what do you think
must be done?

207
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,445
I'm going to help you.

208
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,447
You have to behave

209
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,976
and keep the police away,
feet away!

210
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,188
Now, let's look
at the bright side.

211
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,607
Because you have to
be optimistic.

212
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,983
This is a good time
for you to focus

213
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,736
all that energy
that's coming from within

214
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,988
into something
truly positive...

215
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,841
Like cooking.

216
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:44,162
- How did you know?
- What?

217
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:50,461
How did you know

218
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,391
I had a problem with my wife?

219
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,561
where to find me?

220
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,796
Look, let's please
not change the subject

221
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,756
and talk about what's really
important here.

222
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,359
Did you wire up my house?

223
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,304
Are you tapping
my phone calls?

224
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,847
You're intercepting
what I say!

225
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,616
No, no, wait.

226
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:07,936
You must consider
that right now

227
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,121
that's not your home.

228
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,815
You had left, and besides,
you asked me to.

229
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,500
Me?

230
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,001
I asked you to do that?

231
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,503
Basically.

232
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,447
You implied
you were afraid

233
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,782
about what your wife
would tell the police.

234
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,326
No, that's not true,
Saúl!

235
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,868
Look, let's not get
into this,

236
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,370
about who said this
or who said that.

237
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,913
Why does it matter
now?

238
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,667
This is not a boyfriend
and girlfriend argument here.

239
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,126
What's really
important here?

240
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,628
That your wife
didn't say anything.

241
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,312
What?

242
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,089
She remained silent
and didn't say anything.

243
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,551
This is a tough game
where you win or you lose.

244
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,680
Right now the business
is safe, and that's it.

245
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,098
Why does it matter
that your wife's enjoying

246
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,558
the hardware store
guy--?

247
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,519
What are you saying,
you piece of shit?

248
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,103
What's wrong
with you?

249
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,663
What is this?

250
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,290
You're fired, Saúl!

251
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,584
You're no longer my lawyer!

252
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,110
And I'm not cooking
meth again!

253
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,070
Do whatever you want,
you baby!

254
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,489
You won't be getting
any more donations

255
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,132
in Junior's account!

256
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,575
- Listen to me!
- No more laundering!

257
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,661
You're going to take
all those wires out of my house!

258
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,581
- No more money laundering!
- Shit!

259
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,459
What's with this
freak?

260
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,604
What do we do?

261
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,720
Let's do what
this idiot says.

262
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,866
Hey, wait a minute.
You're leaving it like this?

263
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,619
The walls
are covered in holes.

264
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:50,497
A couple of repairs
and it'll be brand new.

265
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,130
Check that not even one
is left in there.

266
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,396
Just two observations.

267
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,482
This little devices
are imported

268
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,628
and cost 2,000 dollars each.

269
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:27,075
What you say is
not interesting at all,

270
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,120
so there won't be one
left.

271
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,663
Aren't you tired of doing

272
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,666
all the dirty work?

273
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,406
Everyone does
what they know,

274
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,509
and I like my job.

275
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,906
What?

276
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,600
You want a hug
and kiss goodbye?

277
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,453
You know what, Walter?

278
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,104
Sometimes it's good
to have someone

279
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,081
watch our back.

280
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,750
What do you mean by that?

281
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,362
You should stop
looking at yourself

282
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,532
and start paying attention
to your surroundings.

283
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,635
Goodbye.

284
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,764
Walter...?

285
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,852
Walter?

286
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,922
Walter, are you
alright?

287
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,941
Hey, Carmen.

288
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,176
Can we talk in
my office?

289
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,279
Sure, of course.

290
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,618
Take a short break.

291
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,791
Let me be clear on this.

292
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,444
I don't approve
of this trip, Henry.

293
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,362
Well, darling,
what can I do about it?

294
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,922
This is a great chance,

295
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,158
a great second chance
I've been given.

296
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,054
Mexico is like a Ph.D.

297
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,456
for those of us
who work in Anti-narcotics.

298
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,099
Right, so what?

299
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,876
What if something like
the other day happens,

300
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,435
when a head got blown off?

301
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,421
It seems over there
it's like that every day

302
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,065
basically.

303
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,340
You want to see
heads been blown off?

304
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,901
Just turn on the news.

305
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,720
Or is it that Colombia
is Switzerland now?

306
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,825
No, Henry, I don't want...

307
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,685
I don't want you to leave,
I'm scared.

308
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,061
I think it's too dangerous
out there.

309
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,606
Listen, honey,
I'm a cop.

310
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,457
I follow orders.

311
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,959
No.

312
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,005
Hang on.

313
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,008
My boss.

314
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,136
Sir...

315
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,264
Blue?

316
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,582
Are you sure
you found on that guy

317
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,769
blue crystal meth?

318
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,881
No, no, no,
first things first.

319
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,650
I'm on my way sir. Bye.

320
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,052
What
happened?

321
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,429
Remember the drug
I'm trying to track?

322
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,307
- Yes.
- It's back.

323
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,561
So is that good or bad
news?

324
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,289
For you, it's very good.

325
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,108
- I'll call you later.
- ¡Henry!

326
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,531
Trust me, in this school
we understand

327
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,074
what you're going through,
Walter.

328
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,675
In fact, we imagine

329
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,410
you must have had
many sacrifices to make.

330
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,204
But you know
we have a responsibility

331
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,348
with the students.

332
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,895
What's your dog's name?

333
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,940
Martín.

334
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,350
It's a French Bulldog,
isn't it?

335
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,787
No, it's a Boston Terrier.

336
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,398
- Really?
- Yes.

337
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,149
Unbelievable

338
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,736
They're so
alike...

339
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,738
The ears, the...
They're just identical!

340
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,489
Yes, yes, Walter.
Can you please sit

341
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,368
so that we can continue
our conversation, please?

342
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,346
Yes, of course.

343
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:30,087
He's a beauty.
Congratulations.

344
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,048
Walter, I'm honestly
really concerned about you.

345
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,299
Ever since you
came back to work

346
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,136
I've noticed you're
far away, distracted.

347
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,014
I think you've had
behavioral problems, Walter.

348
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,659
Are you feeling okay?

349
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,228
I don't know.
Maybe we could call Cielo?

350
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,288
I'm fine.

351
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,357
I'm sorry,
you have something here...

352
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,751
Thanks.

353
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,712
Can I tell you a secret?

354
00:19:55,737 --> 00:20:00,591
Of course.

355
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,553
Walter, what is it?

356
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,059
Miss, I need a cab

357
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,936
for Walter Blanco.

358
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,881
Los Monarcas School.
Do you have the address?

359
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,524
Yes, that's it.

360
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,010
No, I'll wait for it
at the parking lot.

361
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:22,155
Yes, thanks.

362
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,576
- How are you?
- I'm good.

363
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,536
I'm sorry
to have just showed up here,

364
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,597
but I needed to speak to you.

365
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,958
I went yo the residence
and didn't find you, so...

366
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,127
No, I told you
that was temporary.

367
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:57,174
- I'm back home.

368
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,469
So what's with the box?
Did they fire you?

369
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:08,601
No, it's a license...
for indefinite time.

370
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,371
So yes, I've been fired.

371
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,935
How are things?

372
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,336
Are you sure you don't
want to go

373
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,105
some place else to talk?

374
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,024
No, it's fine here.

375
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,026
Okay.

376
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,654
Okay, here's the deal.

377
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,848
I'd like you to introduce
me to the guy.

378
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,491
What guy?

379
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,686
That guy Saúl introduced
you to, the distributor.

380
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,830
No.

381
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,581
No, Jose, please.

382
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,359
Listen, listen, I've been
thinking about it,

383
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,087
and I want to come back.

384
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,698
Cooking meth is the only thing
I can do right.

385
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,300
No, don't say that!

386
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,245
You know how to do
tons of stuff!

387
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,765
Like what?

388
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,710
Well, think about your problem,
about your addiction.

389
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,479
No, teacher, I'm clean.

390
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,298
Really, I mean, this
is the healthiest

391
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,300
I've been in my
entire life.

392
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:28,890
All I want is to get back
into business, that's all.

393
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,742
Not me, I'm sorry.

394
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,661
No, no, no, I know.

395
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,479
I know and it's great,
I mean it.

396
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,581
I'm not asking you

397
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,443
to cook with me, you
know.

398
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,970
What's this?

399
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,830
Well, it turns out
I had to use

400
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,373
two reflux
condensers

401
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,626
because I didn't want to lose
the pH value, right?

402
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,419
But the rest, the
whole process,

403
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,421
I did it exactly
how you told me to.

404
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,839
I was super careful
with the amounts,

405
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,716
super precise
with the timings at each step.

406
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,135
How about
it?

407
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,694
It's okay, isn't it?

408
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,179
- It's nice.
- What is this?

409
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,739
What do you mean?

410
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,099
- Well...
- This is my formula!

411
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,243
Mine, this is my product.

412
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,602
No, sir.
This is out product.

413
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,979
What do you
mean?

414
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,663
Relax.

415
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,523
I'll give you your share,
don't worry about it.

416
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,359
You're going to give me
my share?

417
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,960
Yes.

418
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,546
I got you into this!

419
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,490
What's gotten into you,
man?

420
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,659
All I'm asking for
is some information.

421
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,244
Well, no, no, no,
definitely not.

422
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,246
- Not a chance.

423
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,664
- Why not?

424
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,764
- Yes, why not?

425
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,791
Do you think
that I'll put my name

426
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,559
on a low-quality product?

427
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,128
Look at the diameter
of those crystals.

428
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,005
You obviously
messed up the shortening.

429
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,522
What did you use?

430
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,066
Platinum dioxide, right?

431
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,509
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

432
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,303
I used a mercury-aluminum
amalgam.

433
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,862
You know dioxide

434
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,864
is very hard to keep wet.

435
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,641
Then you messed up
in some other step.

436
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,102
I mean,
look how cloudy that is.

437
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,413
They're absolutely cloudy.

438
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,814
What was it,
the reduction?

439
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,607
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Mr. Rosas.

440
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,126
I'm embarrassed for you!

441
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,002
Well, it's not, actually.

442
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,255
I gave out lots of samples

443
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,324
and everyone said
it was the bomb,

444
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,242
I mean, the best stuff
ever.

445
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,162
And who were they, I wonder?
A bunch of meth heads?

446
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,039
They should know,
right?

447
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,957
They are the ones
who take it.

448
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,168
- I can't help you.
- Fine, ass-wad.

449
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,212
I'll contact the guy
myself.

450
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,505
My guy is a pro and he
doesn't deal with junkies,

451
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,107
Mr. Rosas.

452
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,591
- Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

453
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,694
Hey, hey!

454
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:08,107
We all need coffee today.

455
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,842
This day is perfect
for napping, isn't it?

456
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,945
It's dragging.

457
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,324
I wish I could stay.

458
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,769
And not have to go anywhere
right now.

459
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,704
So why don't you stay?

460
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,231
What's stopping
you?

461
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:09,043
What, like everything, you mean?

462
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,528
How about
my lunatic husband

463
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,005
refusing to leave the house?

464
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:19,220
So move in here.

465
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,123
And then my son
hating me even more.

466
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,875
I went through that with
the girls.

467
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,853
They adapt.

468
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,799
It's not that big
a deal.

469
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,777
And now everyone at work

470
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,721
thinks I'm an evil
ladder-climbing whore.

471
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,267
They're all fired,
effective immediately.

472
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,978
What more do you
need?

473
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:50,543
Aren't you the answer man?

474
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:55,865
But I also have
questions.

475
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,034
Where did it go wrong,
exactly?

476
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,579
I mean, with you
and Walter.

477
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:05,833
I always saw him as kind
of mild-mannered.

478
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:12,631
Something changed
when he got sick?

479
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:19,280
I don't know what changed.

480
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,559
And I just don't feel really
comfortable talking about it.

481
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:27,063
Sorry. Just asking
out of self-interest.

482
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,940
Gotta make sure
I don't make the same
mistake.

483
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,905
No,
I would be amazed.

484
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,179
I'm off.

485
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,222
Bye.

486
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,217
Just let me see
if I'm following you.

487
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,844
Suncho, you're saying
you gave this stuff

488
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,180
to a guy wearing shorts
and that had a moustache.

489
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,282
Am I right?

490
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,561
-Am I right?
- Suncho.

491
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,329
- Yes.

492
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,607
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity,

493
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,525
or can you help us
with something else?

494
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,085
Let's see, come on.

495
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,420
- Suncho.

496
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,200
Hello!
No.

497
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,119
- Pirateque!
- What?

498
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,079
I remembered,
his last name was Pirateque.

499
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,181
So what's Pirateque's name?

500
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,599
The name, we want the name.

501
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,100
Come on.

502
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,519
Come on, you can do it.

503
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,270
Come on, pal, make an effort.

504
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,565
Come on, come on.

505
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,650
Pirateque?

506
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,093
- Pirateque.
- No...

507
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,278
No.

508
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,613
I think it was Piraquive.

509
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,114
Piraquive.

510
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,158
So what's Piraquive's name?

511
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,103
- Come on.
- I'm not sure right now.

512
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,107
But I can sure as hell
tell you this.

513
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,026
- What?
- His last name
started with a P.

514
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:58,779
Because I remember
the sound was like...

515
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:04,843
P, P, P...

516
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,747
Okay, okay, hey,
hey, hey, easy now.

517
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,041
You'll damage
everything in there.

518
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,185
Okay.

519
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,129
It's starting to smell like
something's burning here.

520
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,507
- Right.
- Come here.

521
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,942
Díaz.

522
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,802
Take my friend here.
Come over.

523
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,862
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

524
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,865
Nice and easy.

525
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,912
It's because of guys like these

526
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,190
that contraceptives
were made, brother.

527
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,233
You know what we should do now,
Gómez?

528
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,862
Let's go to the bar
where they found this Suncho.

529
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,739
- What for?
- What do you mean what for?

530
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,158
To see if we can find a lead
to Heisenberg.

531
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,619
It was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

532
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,554
So who predicted that?

533
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,013
I did!

534
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,599
No, wait, wait.

535
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,460
Heisenberg
is in jail, brother.

536
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,270
He could be an imitator.

537
00:29:56,295 --> 00:30:00,049
maybe there's someone

538
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,230
they're doing something else,

539
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,149
he left,

540
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,592
but he's locked up,
Henry.

541
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:04,470
Understand this, Fredyliso
is not Heisenberg, brother.

542
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,363
They made us believe it

543
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,474
and we absolutely fell
for it, trust me.

544
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,809
Heisenberg
is out there cooking!

545
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,912
Okay, I buy it.

546
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,832
There you go, I buy it.

547
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,274
How do you know
he's gearing up again?

548
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,042
How do I know?

549
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,753
Because I know.

550
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,154
- Don't fool me.
- Yes, sir.

551
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,240
Do you know
why you're sure, brother?

552
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:29,412
Because you're blowing off
the trip to Mexico, aren't you?

553
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,414
That's why you're looking
for crazy guys and hippies.

554
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,375
You can trust me,
tell me.

555
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,144
Okay, you know what?

556
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,396
I'm getting tired

557
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,006
of all the
second-guessing.

558
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,342
If you're not that
stimulated by this case,

559
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,637
do us both a favor
and do something for me.

560
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,071
Ask for a transfer.

561
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,448
What is up with you lately?

562
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,158
What do you mean?

563
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,435
What is up with you lately,
brother?

564
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,911
Looking for crazy guys, hippies,

565
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,454
starting bar fights.

566
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,440
- What's up with you?
- So what'll it be?

567
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:02,002
Okay, fine, I'm sorry.

568
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,587
You know what's the thing?

569
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,822
I'm just worried about you,
brother.

570
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,450
- Really?
- Really.

571
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,134
Really worried?

572
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,180
Appreciate that, brother.

573
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,999
Now take your hand
off my shoulder.

574
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,644
Search,
search thoroughly.

575
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,271
It doesn't have to be the wing
or the turbine of the plane.

576
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,482
It could be anything
that fell off the plane,

577
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,275
anything about the accident
is good enough.

578
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,822
Any little thing at all.
It could be a nut or a bolt.

579
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,339
If you find any little thing,

580
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,716
we already have a case.

581
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,134
We'll be in touch, okay?

582
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,552
Goodbye.

583
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,471
No, no, no,

584
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,373
don't coming
bugging me now.

585
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:40,543
I've had enough emotions
lately.

586
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,144
I understood

587
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,254
when you stopped
cooking,
didn't I?

588
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,465
I told you
to get him cooking again

589
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,275
before he went crazy.

590
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,010
I wanted to show you
his potential.

591
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,387
And what do I get in
return?

592
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,305
My best tie gets
ruined--

593
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,857
Well, hello,
hello.

594
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,862
How in the hell did you get
Walter to do it?

595
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,047
I made it.

596
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,548
I need you to call the guy

597
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:14,510
who knows the guy, alright?

598
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,683
Well, good news is

599
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,686
for a stage-three cancer,

600
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,313
Walter's doing well physically.

601
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:12,969
I'm think of making
an investment for the future,

602
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,888
but for that, I
need to know

603
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,223
if he'll live
long enough.

604
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:22,244
Yes, at least a couple of years,

605
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,939
God willing,
and if he doesn't get a visit

606
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,359
by a few Mexicans
with an axe.

607
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:32,922
The lawyer also told me

608
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,658
José Miguel
is looking for a buyer.

609
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,910
I don't work with
junkies.

610
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,429
That's what I thought you'd say.

611
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:44,875
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

612
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,690
I see.

613
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,510
According to Saúl,
cats and dogs.

614
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,228
Do the deal with
Rosas then.

615
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,118

623
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,155
- Hey.

624
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,365
I'm looking for Dayana.

625
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,868
I'm Dayana.

626
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,395
Dayana,
my name is Henry Navarro,

627
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,189
I'm an agent
in the National Police
Anti-Narcotic Department.

628
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,527
I'm here because a friend
of yours gave me this

629
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,280
and told me
you'd given it to her.

630
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,366
So I need you to tell me
who gave this to you,

631
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,926
and I hope you talk,

632
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:45,512
unless you want me to speak

633
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,597
with Mr. Manuel, your father.

634
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,249
- Shall we speak to Mr. Manuel?

635
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,809
- No, no, no.

636
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,709
- Mr. Manuel!

637
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,544
No, no, no, please,
please,

638
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,504
don't tell anything
to my dad, okay?

639
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,048
I've had enough trouble
already.

640
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,968
I gave it to Laura
because I didn't like it.

641
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:02,054
- I tried it and didn't like it.
- Who gave it to you?

642
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,639
- A guy.
- What guy?

643
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,241
A guy that came

644
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,976
and had nothing
to pay with.

645
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,577
What was his name?

646
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,105
- I don't know.
- What did he look like?

647
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,065
- He was...
- Tall, short, cute,

648
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,791
black hair, from the coast?

649
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,693
- He was cute.
- Cute.

650
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,336
Any particular features,

651
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,491
piercing, tattoos,
black fingernails?

652
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,577
He didn't know or
pronounced
"Fokin Popol" weird.

653
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:29,014
Okay. What other features?

654
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,291
- We was on a bus.
- What do you mean a bus?

655
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,376
What color was it?
How was this bus,

656
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,978
big or small?

657
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:39,091
I don't know,
I don't know about
bus makes.

658
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,526
Please don't tell my dad, okay?

659
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,970
Work with
me.

660
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,848
I don't know,
that might not be possible.

661
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,292
Does that camera work?

662
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,528
No, it's broken
and hasn't been fixed.

663
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:03,115
No wonder
stores are being robbed.

664
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,450
But there's a camera that
works
outside, in the gas station.

665
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,996
- What? Where, where?
- At the gas station.

666
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,747
On the corner over
the vault.

667
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,892
The vault?

668
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,321
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Damn, you bastard.</font></i>

669
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,559
Mom, the eggs are delicious.

670
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,604
Thanks.

671
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,471
Isn't it weird
that it's been three days

672
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:13,977
and nobody made a donation
to my dad's web site?

673
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:16,872
That's how people are.

674
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,833
They suddenly lose interest.

675
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,630
Dad, when...?

676
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:29,034
When will you come back
to school?

677
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,347
I don't know?

678
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,499
What's more,
I shouldn't have gone back
to work too soon.

679
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:40,478
I probably pushed it.

680
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,883
Well, now that
you'll be at home,

681
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,803
you should take care
of Valentina

682
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,972
so my mom
doesn't have to take her

683
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,282
to the office.

684
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:55,244
Right, mom?

685
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:58,955
We'll see.

686
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,999
It's getting late.

687
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,960
I'll go brush my teeth.

688
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,190
What's up?

689
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,691
Your half share.

690
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,387
What do you mean?

691
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,360
my half share?

692
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,487
This isn't about halves!

693
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,931
How can you give me
half?

694
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,725
What the hell?
We won't work with
halves, man!

695
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:45,668
All we need to know

696
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,570
is if you're still willing
to go to Mexico.

697
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,172
Me?

698
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,590
Of course, you!

699
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,426
I'm always there.

700
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,494
It's just that now
we just got a lead

701
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,454
on the Heisenberg case,
you know?

702
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,498
Henry, please.
Heisenberg?

703
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,126
Yes, and I know
you think like everyone else,

704
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,145
that we already got Heisenberg,

705
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,048
but this drug
was just found,

706
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:10,844
which proves us that he's
still out there cooking.

707
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,904
The blue meth, you mean?

708
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,532
But that was a tenth.

709
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:22,564
Okay, I know, but look,
that tenth got things rolling.

710
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,666
And we got to this lead.

711
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,042
Look, look at this.

712
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:27,877
These buses.

713
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:32,490
Remember when we
decided that in order to cook

714
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,617
these people
needed mobile labs?

715
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:37,762
Look what these people use.

716
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,290
Take a look here,
only this part.

717
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:43,210
Do you see the suspension
on this one?

718
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,021
See that it's much higher?

719
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,772
Why is that?

720
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,966
This thing
has been cleared out

721
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,801
and stripped down
to its tight-and-curlies.

722
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,113
For what? Blood bank?

723
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,158
Maybe a bookmobile?

724
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,144
And if we add in
that the driver

725
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,246
is using the meth

726
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,499
to pay minor debts,

727
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,627
we conclude that this is what?

728
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,964
A mobile lab.

729
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,657
But you can't see
the plates.

730
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:17,327
No, no, no,
but thanks to these pictures

731
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:20,163
we could find out
the make of the bus.

732
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,249
We were at Traffic
doing some research

733
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,768
and tracked down all the buses

734
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,770
there are in this make.

735
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,256
- Know how many there are?
- How many?

736
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:32,217
-29 in Bogota.
- Only 29?

737
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,528
So I gotta go, you know,

738
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,029
knock on some doors.

739
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,865
But that's my job,

740
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,367
isn't it?

741
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,352
Henry,
they need you in Mexico.

742
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:45,439
You bet. I'm just gonna
wrap up this thing first.

743
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,357
Henry,
are you telling me

744
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,900
you're refusing the
assignment?

745
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,877
No, no, all I ask

746
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,379
is for a little more time

747
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,714
so that I can close this case.

748
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,574
Wait.
You're not hearing me,
Navarro,

749
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,843
you're not listening to me.

750
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,970
It's a simple yes or no.

751
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,081
Are you going
or not?

752
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,142
I need your answer today.

753
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,819
No, boss, I can't.

754
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,822
You know why I can't, boss?

755
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,742
Because here, in Bogota,

756
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:27,730
I'm about to find something
really big.

757
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,833
Trust me, boss.
