1
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,075
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Clear the area</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and look for the target.</font></i>

2
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,896
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Captain,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">we can't see a thing.</font></i>

3
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:47,942
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Positive, Captain.</font></i>
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The fugitive is running away</font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> .</font>

4
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,460
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Let's go back.</font></i>

5
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,358
Please, I need to get there.

6
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:17,304
I only need that.
Then I'll deal with the rest.

7
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,591
I want you to understand me.

8
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:23,037
I'm not saying
I don't like to experiment.

9
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,124
On the contrary, I love it.
But I'm just so tired

10
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,542
of having Fusión Gourmet
everywhere we go.

11
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,229
It was very good.

12
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,147
But sometimes,

13
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,924
I just want a simple
dish.

14
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,843
Something I can recognize
without passion fruit sauce.

15
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,679
Everything has
passion fruit sauce.
I want to see what
I'm eating.

16
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,849
Your attitude worries me.
You are trading
your intelligence

17
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,144
in order to be critic
about a restaurant

18
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,020
and you're walking away
from science.

19
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,648
No, don't mock me.
We all have the right

20
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,109
to go back to the
simple things.
No passion fruit
sauce.

21
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,821
Sometimes I just wish
I could have potatoes
with rice and meat.

22
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,530
I'm getting tired
of Fusión Gourmet.

23
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,338
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">there's</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">nothing</font></i>

24
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,257
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">like a good piece of</font>

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">with salad and rice.</font></i>

25
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,011
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We should have</font>

26
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,780
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Really?</font></i>

27
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,765
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But I think it's fine</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to try new things.</font></i>

28
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:33,941
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know what?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">We should go</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to a Colombian restaurant.</font></i>

29
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,043
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">To have some beans.</font></i>

30
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,922
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">With chicharrón.</font></i>

31
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,700
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">With no eggs.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I can't stand</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">eggs.</font></i>

32
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:50,499
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But you don't understand</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">what I'm saying.</font></i>

33
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,044
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When I go to a restaurant</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to have something to eat,</font></i>

34
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:57,173
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I want them to serve me food,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">not some herbs.</font></i>

35
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,260
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well now, you are saying</font></i>

36
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:02,820
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This one?</font></i>

37
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,260
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to tell me you're</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">hungry.</font></i>

38
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:06,324
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cabernet.</font></i>

39
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,908
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No.</font></i>

40
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,062
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You think I'm hungry?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, yes.</font></i>

41
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,771
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Now there's</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">two of us.</font></i>

42
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,107
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But it was your</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">idea.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Your idea.</font></i>

43
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,152
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But the thing is that dinner</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">was made of molecules.</font></i>

44
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,487
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You said you wanted</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to try something new.</font></i>

45
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,656
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, since we are</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">trying</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">some new things,</font></i>

46
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,467
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">why don't we go</font></i>

47
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,370
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to a raw food</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">restaurant.</font></i>

48
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,306
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">A what?</font></i>

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,416
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They are trending.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">They only serve</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">raw food.</font></i>

50
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:37,004
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's all about the</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">juices</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and the salads.</font></i>

51
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,548
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And the deserts</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">don't go to the oven.</font></i>

52
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,926
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They are</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">dehydrated.</font></i>

53
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,179
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We should try that.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know.</font></i>

54
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,015
It could be a
good option.

55
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,684
It's just that I don't like
that type of food.

56
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,561
The type of food
that I like is...

57
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,272
- I don't know.
- Considerable.

58
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,275
But not that
much.
I'm eating
better now.

59
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,917
If you say so.

60
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,112
I eat lighter.
I like to have
soups,

61
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,421
salads and stuff.

62
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,676
What happened?

63
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:16,668
Edgar, Marcela,
how are you?

64
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,146
Let me congratulate you.

65
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,508
This new house you have
is truly remarkable.

66
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,094
I've been taking a look
and the upstairs floor

67
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,405
has a wonderful view.

68
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,156
It is something.

69
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,100
-Walter...
-What are you doing here?

70
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,618
I saw you at an interview.

71
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,372
You look so well.

72
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,109
Camera loves you.
Very much.

73
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,737
Walter, if you
hurt us,
I will--

74
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,783
No, look, I came here
because I have
something to give you.

75
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,288
I have it in my car.
Can you come with me?
It'll be just a second.

76
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,999
I'm sorry. I couldn't get
the car much closer.

77
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,917
I have it on a road
quite near your house.

78
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,756
Edgar, do you really
want to solve things
that way?

79
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,802
You're going to need
a much bigger gun for that.

80
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,727
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Put it there,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">right over the table.</font></i>

81
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,277
Marcela, Marcela,
be careful!

82
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,947
I don't want a single wad
ending up underneath the sofa.

83
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:32,119
That's it.
Thank you, Edgar.

84
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,055
On this table,

85
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,437
there are 17,500 million pesos.

86
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
Where did you get that?
And why is it here?

87
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,550
I worked a lot
to earn that money.

88
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,927
And you are going
to give it to my son.

89
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,305
I don't think
that's a great idea,
Walter.

90
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,991
When my son turns 18,

91
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,436
that is 2 months
and 3 days from now,

92
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,438
you are going to give him
this money

93
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,582
as an irrevocable donation.

94
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,944
I want you to tell him
that he can use the money

95
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,241
to whatever he deems necessary.
However, you will tell him

96
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:15,162
that it would be really nice
if he could invest it
in his education

97
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,289
and in the welfare
of his family.

98
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:21,043
Walter, if you want that money
to reach your family,

99
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,669
why don't you give it
to them yourself?

100
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,130
Why do we need
to be involved?

101
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,984
Because it's not possible.

102
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,221
My wife and my son
hate me.

103
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,597
I don't understand
why us.

104
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,642
Edgar, they wouldn't take it.
It's that simple.

105
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,479
And if they do,
there's a great chance

106
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,982
that the Government
will take it away from them.

107
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,777
So that's the part
in which you come in.

108
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,613
You are two rich benefactors
making generous donations.

109
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,742
Isn't that what you did
just recently?

110
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,870
How much did you donate?
A million dollars?

111
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,014
Nobody will suspect of you.

112
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,266
Everyone will understand

113
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:05,296
that you want to help
a family that's suffering.

114
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,439
This makes no sense.

115
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,841
It makes all the sense,
Marcela.

116
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,929
My family is victim
of a criminal,

117
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,115
a monster you knew well,

118
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,602
before he destroyed himself.
Everyone will understand

119
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,272
that you want to help
in this situation.

120
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,650
But I don't care.
You can justify it
however you want to.

121
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,961
Just do it.

122
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:35,075
And I don't want you
to pay anything
with your money.

123
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,166
If there are any expenses,
notaries, lawyers, taxes,

124
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:46,128
you take the money from here,
not from your pocket.

125
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:51,008
My family gets my money,
not yours.

126
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,319
Okay, Walter.

127
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:57,222
You've made a good
point.

128
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,616
We'll do it.

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,950
Fine.

130
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,687
What do we have to
do now?

131
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,858
Just shake hands,
and I'll go.

132
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,641
Hey.

133
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,845
Can I be sure
that you'll do it?

134
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,723
Yes, don't worry.
We'll do it.

135
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,982
Stop, please!
Don't move!

136
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,486
Edgar, don't move
a single muscle.

137
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,572
I don't want my
friends
out there to get
confused.

138
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,741
They might think
you are trying to
escape.

139
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,369
I will try
to put you
into context.

140
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,830
This morning
I had 500 millions here.

141
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,208
That money should be
right over this table,

142
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,059
but I decided to invest it.

143
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,647
I gave the money

144
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,174
to the best hit men
this country has.

145
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,365
Easy.

146
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:34,819
Regardless of what might happen
to me from now on,

147
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:40,258
they will be watching you.

148
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:44,913
And if for some reason,
this money does not reach
my kids,

149
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,017
a countdown will begin.

150
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,505
It might last a day.
It might last months.

151
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,734
But it will end.

152
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,553
Someday, you might be walking
in a shopping mall,

153
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:03,432
or walking through Europe,
or talking about
your molecular food,

154
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,744
or doing anything else,

155
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,396
and suddenly,
without noticing it,

156
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,731
you'll hear a noise
from behind.

157
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,444
- And boom!

158
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,780
Don't worry.
This won't happen to you.

159
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,842
You are good people.

160
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:29,458
You are the best
that Colombia has.

161
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:34,171
I know you will do
the right thing.

162
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,189
Goodbye.

163
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,119
Easy.

164
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,771
Easy, please.
He left.

165
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,392
Sir, with all due respect,

166
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,919
I'm feeling bad
about this.

167
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,774
You see, man, el Mono

168
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,051
is talking about
what we just did.

169
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,736
It's as if we have no morals.

170
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,056
I'm feeling truly bad
about this whole thing.

171
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,283
Yes.

172
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,896
How do you feel
now?

173
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,749
That's better.

174
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,417
I'm healed now.

175
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,947
Have you heard the rumors
about the blue product

176
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,866
being in circulation
again in the market?

177
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,426
What did you say?

178
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,886
Is it true or not?

179
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,622
Yes, it's true.
It's in circulation again.

180
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,600
And who's behind that?

181
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,353
Aren't you behind that?

182
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,714
Are you saying
that you are not cooking now?

183
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,316
It's an excellent product.

184
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,969
It's so fine
we thought it was you.

185
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,113
It has to be Jose.

186
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,932
Old Jose...
That's nice.

187
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,393
Didn't you tell me
he was in Argentina?

188
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,771
Yes, man.
That's what they
told me.

189
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,524
That means
that he's now the king.

190
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,484
- That's amazing, right?
- Yes!

191
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,893
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And what's that?</font></i>

192
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,353
The years I'm turning.

193
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,923
Is it your birthday?
Congratulations!

194
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,108
Thank you.

195
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,447
Good afternoon.

196
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,600
What are you having today?
Tea? As usual?

197
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,644
Yes, thank
you.

198
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,758
Hello.

199
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,094
Hi.

200
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,913
You look very good
on those clothes.

201
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,917
On what?
On this
shirt?

202
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,729
On everything. It's new.

203
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,597
Before you say or do
anything,
please listen to me.

204
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,532
Lidia, please.

205
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,268
Nobody knows I'm
here.
I'm begging you.

206
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,981
It's just two
minutes.
That's all.

207
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:15,113
Please.
Thank you. Thank
you.

208
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,075
I know you are
running out
of methylamine.

209
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,284
I was making
some
calculations.

210
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,871
You are using it a
lot.

211
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,665
The thing is
I have a new method

212
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,836
that doesn't need
methylamine.
It's very simple.

213
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,463
And... I can
teach it to you.

214
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,566
How did you find us?

215
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,843
You and I used to
meet a lot

216
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,154
in this very place.

217
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:44,101
Tuesdays at 10:00
A.M.,
and you are a woman
of habit.

218
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,670
Sorry.

219
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:07,415
I need money.
I spend it all
running away from
Police.

220
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,250
You see, Professor,
I think that right now

221
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,643
we are not in conditions--

222
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,187
How much will it cost us?

223
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,588
A million
dollars.

224
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:17,842
And that's nothing.
Believe me.

225
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,343
Make an appointment
with Joaquín.

226
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,346
With all due respect,
but I think that now--

227
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:28,895
Beto, please,
let me speak to
Joaquín.

228
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,274
Look, this is
convenient
for all of us.

229
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,026
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm sorry, are you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">having</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">anything else?</font></i>

230
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,361
No, thank you.
He was just leaving.

231
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,172
I'm glad to see you again.

232
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,966
We'll keep in touch.

233
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:47,288
Of course. Thank
you.

234
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,142
And you?

235
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,393
I want a beer.

236
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,920
And more sweetener
for me.

237
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,397
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Perfect.</font></i>

238
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,885
Miss Lidia,
with all due respect,
he is the master, right?

239
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,387
I don't think
it's the right time
to be working with--

240
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,808
We won't be working with
him.
It's clear the guy's a mess.

241
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,034
So?

242
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,437
Do I have to
explain it to
you?

243
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,482
That man looks like
an astray dog.

244
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,776
We will put him down
and make him a
favor.

245
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,300
Hi, María.
What's going
on?

246
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,942
Walter is back.

247
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,430
Yes, they found the car
that he had stolen.
They tracked him down

248
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,557
and he appeared downtown.
And what's the name

249
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,892
of that neighbor
you used to have?

250
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,535
Miss Rebeca.

251
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,355
Miss Rebeca saw him,
in broad daylight.

252
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,608
He said 'hi' to her.
He went to that house
that you used to have.

253
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,819
Did he do anything
to Miss Rebeca?

254
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:26,530
He didn't do anything to her.
But she said he's pretty bad,
that he looks finished.

255
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,575
Cielo, the Police
is looking for him everywhere.

256
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,787
It seems they received
several phone calls
saying that he's planning
to blow up Anti-Narcotics

257
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,472
and that he has a press release

258
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,540
and that he will read it tonight
on the evening news.

259
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,751
Is he making those
calls?

260
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:44,423
They don't know
who's making the
calls.

261
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,759
taking advantage of
the moment
to make some bad
jokes.

262
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,220
However, the truth
is
that everybody is
worried.

263
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,265
And that's what he
wants.

264
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,392
Because Walter
is a terrorist.
And as far as I
know,

265
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,228
there are only 3 people
he would look for:

266
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,413
you, me, or Junior.

267
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,997
True.

268
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,499
Now, the Police

269
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,194
is arriving at
Junior's school
and they are alert

270
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,322
in case he shows up.
And they will surely

271
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:13,536
send some people
to your place, right?

272
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,745
However, Cielo,
the important
thing

273
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,207
is that Walter
won't get to you.

274
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,959
He won't get to
you.
I swear that.

275
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,503
That fucker thinks
he's the best criminal
in the whole world.

276
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,921
But you know what?
He's not.

277
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,649
But just be careful.

278
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:33,197
Yes, I understand.

279
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,949
Promise me, please.

280
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,810
Yes.
Thank you for your call.

281
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,479
Alright,
I'll talk to you
later.

282
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:55,078
Five
minutes,
and that's
it.

283
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,805
That's all I need.

284
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,089
Did you kill
someone
to get here?

285
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,816
No.

286
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,844
Did you hurt
someone?

287
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,988
No, I didn't have to.

288
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:30,671
But I feel good.

289
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:35,201
What do you
want?
Why are you
here?

290
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,430
This is the end.

291
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,792
I feel that everything
is coming to an end.

292
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,587
And I wanted to say goodbye
the right way.

293
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:53,428
Not like the last time
we spoke over the phone.

294
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,389
What does that
mean?

295
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,600
Are you going to
surrender
to the Police?

296
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,744
They will come for me.

297
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:16,909
to come
and threaten me again?

298
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,745
When I still had the
house,
three hooded men
came to threaten me,

299
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,126
Valentina and
Junior.

300
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,295
And they said
we were not allowed
to talk

301
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,089
about the women
in the car wash.

302
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,383
If they know
you are in ja--

303
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,486
They won't come back.

304
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:42,619
Not after tonight.

305
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,856
What will happen
tonight?

306
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,905
We don't want your
money.

307
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,741
I think that Junior
was very clear about that
the last time you two spoke.

308
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:03,931
That's right.

309
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:08,185
I don't have money for you.

310
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,796
The last money I had
I spend it coming to you.

311
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:15,485
This...

312
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:22,350
is the only thing
I can give you.

313
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,519
When I leave,
call Anti-Narcotics,

314
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,980
and tell them
that I was here,

315
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,983
that I forced you
to let me in.

316
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:35,530
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

317
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,841
To what?

318
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:43,621
To a mass grave.
There, they will find
the bodies

319
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:49,059
of Henry and Gómez.

320
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,689
I buried all our money there,

321
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,593
and some guys
stole it from me.

322
00:27:56,717 --> 00:28:00,679
Those guys
killed Henry and Gómez.

323
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:07,395
And they buried them
in the hole I dug.

324
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,191
Cielo, you need to negotiate
with the Prosecutor.

325
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,211
You have to,

326
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,531
so you can have
a way out.

327
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:36,273
Look at me, please.

328
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,845
I want you to understand
that I did this bec--

329
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:48,978
No. Don't tell me you
did this for the family.

330
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:56,210
No. I did it for me.

331
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:01,048
I did it because I liked it.

332
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:07,846
Because I was very good at it.

333
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,958
I did it
because it made me feel alive.

334
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,812
Junior will be here
any second now.

335
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,951
Can I see her
before I go?

336
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,561
Thank you, Lucho.

337
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,729
We'll be in touch.

338
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,481
I'll see you tomorrow.

339
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:56,666
Walter!
What a miracle!

340
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,419
What about that new
look?
Those look good on
you.

341
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,077
Move on.

342
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,645
Turn around
and put your arms up.

343
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,842
He's clean.

344
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,163
Well, my friend,
since we are here,
put up your shirt.

345
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:22,167
You think I have a wire
or something like that?

346
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,002
You never
know.

347
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:31,527
Enough?

348
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,971
Can I have my keys
and my wallet back, please?

349
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,433
Don't worry, man.
We'll give them
back later.

350
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,117
Get in.

351
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,660
Wow, you hair is back
and it fits you well.

352
00:33:56,786 --> 00:34:00,080
Congratulations
That looks
good.

353
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,626
We can't say the same
about the rest of your
body.
You look like shit.

354
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,129
Thank you, Joaquín,
I'm glad to see you too.

355
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,650
Shall we talk business?

356
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,802
No, I don't
think so.

357
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,387
No, wait a minute.
Beto, have you told him

358
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,781
what I'm offering to you?

359
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,683
Yes, sure.
He told me
everything.

360
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,019
But we are not
in the business
anymore.

361
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,855
No, but I know
you will run out of methylamine.

362
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,649
What are you going to do
after that happens?

363
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,652
We won't have any
problems.
Lidia has her own
system.

364
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,487
Nobody bothers her
anymore,
you know?

365
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:34,406
She can do her businesses
whenever she wants to,

366
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,242
and as long as that
works out flawlessly,

367
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,036
we don't need
to cook anymore.

368
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,470
Listen to me.

369
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,431
No, no! Wait!

370
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,349
Joaquín, let me talk to you...

371
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,502
Beto, tell them
about the benefits

372
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,671
of the system I'm offering you.
Will you? Please.

373
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,047
I'm so sorry for you,
Professor Blanco.

374
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,899
You shouldn't have returned.

375
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,025
Where shall I kill him?

376
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,427
How can I know, man?
But don't do it here.

377
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:57,972
No one will clean
if you blow his head off
here.
Take him outside.

378
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,390
Damn it!
Take him out of here!

379
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,392
Joaquín, Joaquín!,
Kill me, if you want!

380
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:03,869
But keep your word!

381
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,479
You owe me!
You should have honor!

382
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,564
Honor? What the fuck
are you talking about?
Motherfucker!

383
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,317
You gave me your word
that you would kill Rosas.

384
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,919
And you didn't do it!

385
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,363
You didn't keep your word.
Not only you didn't kill him,

386
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,740
but you also
made him your partner to cook.

387
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,326
Wait a minute!
I don't have any
partners.

388
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,495
Rosas is alive.
And he's cooking for you.

389
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,263
Or are you going to deny it?

390
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,749
Yes, he's alive,
but that doesn't
mean
he's my partner.

391
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,585
I can't be partners
with a filthy rat
like that.

392
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,587
He's a motherfucker
who didn't hesitate

393
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,715
to contact the
Police
and tell them
everything.

394
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,817
Where's that piece of shit?

395
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,442
He's finishing up a batch.

396
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,803
Well, go get him right
now.

397
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,404
But Uncle, the thing is that--

398
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,139
Shut your mouth!
If there's something
I've had

399
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,033
my whole life is honor.

400
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,768
Hurry!
Bring that son
of a bitch here!

401
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,646
And we'll finish
this shit
once and for all.

402
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,482
I will kill him
right in front of
your nose.

403
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,526
And then I'll
kill you.

404
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,003
Move!

405
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,555
You see, motherfucker?

406
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,251
Does this piece of shit
looks like my partner?
Take a look.

407
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,130
Take a good look
so you can see him well.

408
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,339
This fucker
is not my partner.

409
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,901
Yes or no, my friend?

410
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,391
He doesn't eat or shower.
We don't pay for his doctor.
We don't pay for his house.

411
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,869
He's the perfect partner.

412
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,620
And he's also a good worker.

413
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,986
So, what?
Are we doing this shit or not?

414
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,088
Let's go.

415
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,700
Beto, pick them
up.

416
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,055
No, Walter.
Walter, wait.

417
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:02,792
You want your money, right?

418
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:05,154
You want to
know
where it is?

419
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,156
If you pull that
trigger,
you'll never know.

420
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:44,693
Do it. You want this.
Shoot me.

421
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,137
Just do it.

422
00:40:55,162 --> 00:41:00,209
Say it! For the first time
in your fucking life,

423
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:05,439
say what you want!

424
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,384
I won't do anything
until you tell me to.

425
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:12,529
Say you want this!

426
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:17,267
Say you want me
to kill you!

427
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:21,021
I want this.
Kill me.

428
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,683
Then do it yourself.

429
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,598
Hello.

430
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:25,543
Is it done?
Is he gone?

431
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,356
Yeah, it's done.

432
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:34,552
He's gone.
They're all gone.

433
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,240
Who is this?

434
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:41,577
It's Walter.

435
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,454
How are you feeling, Lidia?

436
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,623
Kind of under the weather?

437
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,042
Like you've got the flu?

438
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,569
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That would be the resin</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I gave you.</font></i>

439
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,864
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I slipped it into</font>

440
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,426
My God.

441
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:00,245
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And now,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">it's just a matter of time.</font></i>

442
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,415
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You will feel</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">weaker and weaker</font></i>

443
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,644
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">until you pass away.</font></i>

444
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:12,148
You are dead.
