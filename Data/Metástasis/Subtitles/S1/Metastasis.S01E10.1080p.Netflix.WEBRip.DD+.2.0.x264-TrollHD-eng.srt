1
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,517
- Like that?
- No, more.

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,060
A little more.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,110
Okay.

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,528
Could you stop it
with the stick already?

5
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,036
Finally someone. Hey, hey!

6
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,496
No, man,
they're not taking you with that look.

7
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,250
Yes!

8
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,546
Stop, stop, stop.

9
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,756
You sure this is the way to go?

10
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,925
I do.

11
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,927
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, man.

12
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,429
Thank you.

13
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:26,040
- So what did he say?
- Well, not much.

14
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:29,710
He came in dehydrated and disoriented
but he got stabilized pretty quickly.

15
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,838
Right. But, I mean,
he knows where he is?

16
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,840
Yes,
absolutely. He's completely conscious.

17
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,094
He just doesn't remember
what happened to him.

18
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,428
You can see him if you like.

19
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,681
- Come in,
over there. Okay. Honey!

20
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,023
Are you okay?

21
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,275
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,453
Walter, do you remember me?

23
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,497
Sure I do, come over here.

24
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,547
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

25
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,426
I'm better, I think...

26
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,763
I just don't remember anything,

27
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,392
but I'm fine.

28
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:31,022
You have no idea what
we've been through.

29
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,148
I know.

30
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,025
You have no idea, dad.

31
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,194
Uncle Henry had a confrontation.

32
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,738
a shoot-out. He
almost got killed.

33
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,449
A shoot-out?

34
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,826
Some big Mexican drug dealer.

35
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,288
And he wasted him,
like the cops say.

36
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,582
My God... So is Henry alright?

37
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,626
He's fine, he's fine.

38
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,171
- Are you sure? Where did this happen?
- Everything's okay,

39
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,422
don't you worry. He's okay.

40
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,091
And you're okay.

41
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,467
Yes.

42
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:05,139
We're okay, we're okay..

43
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,849
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Any other news?</font></i>

44
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,144
No, not for now. But they're
going to run a whole series of tests.

45
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,771
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What else did they tell you?</font></i>

46
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,399
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I mean,
there must be</font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif">an explanation or something.</font></i>

47
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,044
Why did it happen,
could it ever happen again...

48
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:22,322
We won't know for sure
until we get the results.

49
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,491
I really, I don't know...

50
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,037
I get this feeling they
gave him scopolamine.

51
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:32,250
Or maybe this has
to do with marijuana.

52
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,920
I don't know. But where
did this happen exactly?

53
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,130
No, wait, wait,
don't start all over again.

54
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,757
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cielo,</font></i>

55
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,466
please don't get me wrong.

56
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,928
I'm just happy that Walter
showed up and is okay,

57
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:48,724
but, I mean,
naked? At a supermarket?

58
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,268
I mean, butt naked

59
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,520
before the customers
at the market. Please.

60
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,564
I hope it wasn't at rush hour.

61
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,733
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">In any case,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm going to get over there.</font></i>

62
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,359
You know what? No, it's okay.

63
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,819
You don't need to.

64
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,198
Better stay with
Henry. How is he?

65
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,910
I only saw him a minute. I
thought it would be different,

66
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,536
but they yanked him away.

67
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,123
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">How did you see him?</font></i>

68
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,792
Well...

69
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,211
No, thanks.

70
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,963
I don't know.

71
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,672
You know Henry.

72
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,968
He's a rock.

73
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,222
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

74
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:31,391
At this point,
I identified the suspect as Tuco Salamanca.

75
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,979
He had a gunshot wound in
his midsection. He was bleeding.

76
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:38,232
- He was shot previous to your arrival?
- Yes, he was.

77
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,110
Again I instructed him to
show his hands. Didn't listen.

78
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,529
He lunged toward the
vehicle and fired on me.

79
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,406
I had to take cover

80
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,618
and started shooting as well.

81
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,537
He continued shooting at me continuously,
like crazy.

82
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,667
I had to stop at
one point to reload.

83
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,296
I got into the
line of fire again...

84
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,716
and I was able to take an
effective shot that killed him.

85
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:09,096
Agent, what were you doing in a
shooting fight on your own, with no backup?

86
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,806
The least I expected

87
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,059
was to find Mr. Salamanca.

88
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,979
I was tending...

89
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,316
- to another matter.
- What other matter?

90
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,776
An unrelated family matter.

91
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,570
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

92
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,490
Your brother-in-law?

93
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,244
Yes. He's since been
found and is alright.

94
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,705
The whole thing was
a misunderstanding.

95
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,960
He'd been missing and,
since he's in poor health,

96
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,963
the whole family was concerned.

97
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,716
I volunteered to look for him.

98
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,468
I was talking to his
friends and acquaintances,

99
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,222
and that's how I got to
this José Miguel Rosas,

100
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:54,099
a former student of his at
the Los Monarcas school.

101
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:57,436
He was his teacher.

102
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,813
The car in the
middle of the gunfight

103
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,982
between Mr. Salamanca and me

104
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,193
was José Miguel Rosas's.

105
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,362
I got to the place

106
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,075
because I was
tracking down the car.

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,662
The least I expected
was to run...

108
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,081
into Tuco Salamanca there.

109
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,418
So how is this José
Miguel Rosas related?

110
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,545
What was his car doing there?

111
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,214
Did he say anything?

112
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,842
We haven't found Mr. Rosas yet,

113
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,886
but we're working on that, sir.

114
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,563
Man, they never give up.

115
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,192
They're like
Jehovah's witnesses.

116
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,696
Why don't they just take a log and bam,
bam, knock your door down?

117
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,533
How can you say that?
Are you dumb or something?

118
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,911
Besides,
they need evidence to get an order.

119
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:01,333
Evidence? But what'd
you do? Rob a bank?

120
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,877
I told you,
this is serious shit.

121
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,879
I'm like an outlaw.

122
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,343
Right, an outlaw.

123
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,220
If you say so, man.

124
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,640
Looks like they're leaving.

125
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,225
Gosh.

126
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:25,607
- Okay, finished, finished.
- Okay, man.

127
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,943
- There.
- Let's do this.

128
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,082
What a crib, José!

129
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,005
- Where's the pseudo?
- No, man, we don't use pseudo.

130
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,342
It's a P2P cook. We use methylamine,
which replaces pseudo.

131
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,302
Okay, let's do it. Help me out.

132
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,096
- No pseudo?
- Right, no pseudo.

133
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,851
Methylamine.

134
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,728
The meth is mine.

135
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,857
Come on,
man. Just take this and get it in.

136
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,611
But I can't just let you
break this down this altar.

137
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,906
Did you now see the cops out
there? Just come and help me, man!

138
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,452
Couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

139
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,829
To get all wound
up for the road?

140
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,915
No, forget it,
all right? Just help me pack everything.

141
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,335
Come on, José,
do me that favor, will you?

142
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,004
You owe me! I'm not forgetting
you just left me stranded.

143
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,882
Come on, now, come on!

144
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,800
I've had just about enough...

145
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,719
Don't mess with me!

146
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,389
And help me pack.

147
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,714
Don't get all ramped up, José,

148
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,393
I'm just saying you owe me.

149
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,233
Dude, just stop it already.

150
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,075
One, two...

151
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,790
One...

152
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,505
Listen, José...

153
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,425
You sure these aren't gunshots?

154
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,177
I'm telling you they're not.

155
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:22,099
You should stop smoking,
you know? You're imagining things.

156
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,059
Come on, man...

157
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,477
Can we trust this dude?

158
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,729
Sure, man, he's my cousin.

159
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,983
So what now?

160
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,693
What had we say, 500?

161
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,031
We didn't say,
and it's double this time.

162
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,618
Double? What do you mean double?

163
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,620
This isn't going to Cartagena,
brother.

164
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,247
It's not the distance,
it's the cargo.

165
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,377
So what then?

166
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,638
Listen, I have 560 here.

167
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,681
No, fuck off, man.

168
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,926
What do you mean "fuck off"?

169
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,698
Hey, no, no, no,
what are you going to do?

170
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,812
- Listen, cousin Cousin.
- Get this right.

171
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,398
- No, no, no, no, hey.
- Germancho, come on, dude.

172
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:15,611
Hey, fix this mess, man.

173
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,321
Cousin, come here, come here.

174
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,550
He'll pay you the rest later.
He's totally good for it! Believe me.

175
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,534
I absolutely trust him.

176
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,663
- You're standing up for him?
- Listen,

177
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,249
I swear over my grandma who's
in heaven. And I don't just swear.

178
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:34,754
I'll give you half now
and half later. I'll get it all.

179
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,007
Don't try to fuck with
me. I'll go and get you.

180
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,425
Fine.

181
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,888
There you go.

182
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,686
- Come on.
- No. What? There's already 500 there...

183
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,939
Nice family you got.

184
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,653
Thanks, cousin.

185
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,953
I saved your skinny ass again.
Now you owe me one more.

186
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,997
What are you doing now, exactly?

187
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,625
I have to call in two hours.

188
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,293
From where?

189
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,837
I know, on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

190
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,716
Alright. You're not
using your own name.

191
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,387
- Look, I'll just do what you said.
- That's right.

192
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,723
But, I mean, why all this?

193
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,932
These people want evidence.

194
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,601
I'll give them evidence.

195
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,354
Come on.

196
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,490
What's the last
thing you remember?

197
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,160
I was driving.

198
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,539
I was... I was going home.

199
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,668
You were at the
house and we talked.

200
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,712
- Don't you remember?
- We did?

201
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,217
No, honey. I'm sorry,
but I don't remember.

202
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,763
Nothing else? No
fleeting images?

203
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,391
Yes, there's...

204
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,476
I have this image of a...

205
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,395
of a highway.

206
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,773
It was so dark,

207
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,443
and I remembered I was scared.

208
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,738
There's definitely
some good news here.

209
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,491
The MRI shows no metastases.

210
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,827
That's great.

211
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,942
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

212
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,162
No.

213
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,164
We're looking really good.

214
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,625
That's great.

215
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,837
So, what was it,
then? I don't get it.

216
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,047
What happened?

217
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,012
We really don't know. We didn't find
any strange substances in the body.

218
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,927
Doctor, sorry to intrude.

219
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,555
I know this isn't your field,
but...

220
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,515
is there a chance that all this

221
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,935
has to do with the
medication I've been taking?

222
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,813
I mean,

223
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,273
there's the antiemetic,
the antitussive,

224
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,609
not to mention the chemo...

225
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,487
He know a lot about drugs

226
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,905
because he worked in a lab,
did some research.

227
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,034
And being off all of them
for the past few days,

228
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,078
I'm feeling much better.

229
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,331
Besides, all those formulas...

230
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,667
it's page after
page of side effects

231
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,960
and warnings.

232
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,087
Right,
exactly. Could it be that simple?

233
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,923
We'll take another look at that.

234
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,427
I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out, Walter.

235
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,263
You've been under so
much pressure lately.

236
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:35,310
- No. No, not stress... Walter,
come on.

237
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,729
You have been stressed out.

238
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,691
I guess I've had a
lot on my mind lately,

239
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,360
but as I said,
I'm feeling much better.

240
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,779
In fact, I'd leave right now.

241
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,197
When can I go?

242
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,199
No, that won't be possible.

243
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,284
I believe you'll be with
us for a few more days.

244
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,870
A few more days?

245
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,583
Yes, and we'll schedule
a psychiatric evaluation.

246
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,518
No, man,
come on. I don't think it's that serious.

247
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:03,380
Walter, I'm sorry. Nobody
likes being in the hospital,

248
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,174
but until we know what
caused this incident

249
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,593
we can't be certain
it won't recur.

250
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,002
How much do you have left?

251
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,505
A hit.

252
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,257
Finish it quick.

253
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,797
- Stand still!
- What's going on?

254
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,468
- On the floor! Pin her down,
pin her down!

255
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,304
- Pin him down now!
- Now, now, now!

256
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,974
Come on, come on. Do it now!

257
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,350
- I'm going, I'm going.
- Get him tight, tight!

258
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,770
- Don't you move!
- Let me go, man!

259
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,857
José Miguel Rosas, I presume.

260
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,651
What, man? What did I do?

261
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,529
Walk,
we're talking someplace else.

262
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,991
Careful!

263
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,840
- Okay, stop, stop! Be still now!
- Hey, dude!

264
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,050
I'll tell you what...

265
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,594
Tell me the whole
story once again.

266
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,180
Again? What's there to tell?

267
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,266
- Her and I were partying, that's it.
- Partying?

268
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,144
Partying for three days
straight? How do you do it?

269
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,146
What do you do?
After you have sex,

270
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,025
you have a shower,
dance, sing, eat...

271
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,694
You have sex again? No,
wait, I know.

272
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,238
You smoke that crystal
you got from Tuco?

273
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,158
Who the fuck is Taco?
I don't know any Taco.

274
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,493
And I didn't say crystal,

275
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,831
- don't make me lie.
- Fine, enough.

276
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,124
The fags of the hall, right?

277
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,337
We believe everything. Three
days without eating or going out.

278
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,464
So did you order take-out?

279
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,174
I guess.

280
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,570
Where from, the Chinese guy on
the corner? Some dog they've got.

281
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,263
No, we didn't necessarily order.

282
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,975
We got stuff from the
vending machine at the hotel.

283
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,853
You know,
chips and stuff. I had a croissant.

284
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,855
Chips and croissant.

285
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,566
And you didn't notice
your car was gone?

286
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,527
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door

287
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,112
and took me by force.

288
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,573
Even then I didn't notice
because the car was gone.

289
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,547
Now who's going to pay for that?

290
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,843
Management's going
to be on my ass for sure.

291
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,284
You can't get away with that

292
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,245
because I have no
money to pay for that.

293
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,414
So why didn't you
answer your phone?

294
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,918
It was in my car.

295
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:32,130
Weird. We found your car,
but your phone wasn't in it.

296
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,883
You found my car?

297
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,843
Awesome!

298
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,721
Anti-Narcotics all the
way! You guys rule!

299
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,286
- That's cool!
- Hey, don't touch me!

300
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,061
Since we're talking
about missing property,

301
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,480
did you leave anything
else in the car?

302
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,691
Like what?

303
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,700
Forty-five thousand

304
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,287
nine hundred and fifty dollars.

305
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,918
I've never seen that case,
man. That's not mine.

306
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,296
That's not yours?
Says it's not his.

307
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,257
I really thought
that might be yours.

308
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,219
- I wish I had that much.
- Imagine that.

309
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,973
If I lose an amount like that
I might as well kill myself.

310
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,724
Listen, Gómez,

311
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,145
That's a new interdiction
van right there.

312
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,647
We can get the truck with that,

313
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,191
the uniforms,
the mini-soccer team...

314
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,610
Perfect!

315
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,112
Who's your boss, punk?

316
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,780
What does that even mean?

317
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,117
I think your story's bullshit.

318
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,911
You knew Tuco Salamanca.

319
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,581
I think your car was there
because you were there.

320
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,292
Tuco Salamanca had a
bullet in his midsection.

321
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,086
And I think you know why.

322
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,796
So, what are you saying?

323
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,298
I shot someone? With,
like, a gun?

324
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:02,679
Duh, duh,
duh... Who shot Tuco Salamanca?

325
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,347
Man, I don't know... I told you

326
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,391
I was partying with Guendy.
That's all there is to it.

327
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,393
Chips and croissant?

328
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,065
Your turn, Gómez.

329
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,070
The man won't cooperate,

330
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,739
so I'll tell you what.

331
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,159
Let's talk to the lady.

332
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,163
Some hot chick. Nice girl.

333
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,999
That's a good idea, buddy.

334
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,751
We could talk to
that skinny ass.

335
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,294
I don't know why,

336
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,422
but I have the feeling
that woman is going to talk.

337
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,299
And not only will she talk.

338
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,343
She'll drown you, man.

339
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,768
Don't you go nowhere.

340
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:58,651
I was about to forget...

341
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,322
Kind of heavy.

342
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,995
We'll be right back.

343
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm thirsty.

344
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,961
And I want to piss.

345
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,923
I got medical issues.

346
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,716
Medical issues?

347
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,467
I got medical issues.

348
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:26,930
This chick looks like a dude...

349
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,974
Alright, Guendy,
tell us everything

350
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,019
and I'll grant you a bath
and something to eat, okay?

351
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,729
I don't know about the piss...

352
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,899
- If you volunteer...
- I'll pass.

353
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,485
Guendy,
tell me about the last three days.

354
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:50,453
I told you,
we were shacked up since Saturday.

355
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,415
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little minute?

356
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,253
I don't know,
maybe for a second...

357
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,339
José Miguel left, didn't he?

358
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:05,260
Guendy, Guendy, Guendy,
come on, look at me, look at me.

359
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,511
José Miguel did leave? Here,
here...

360
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,014
He did leave,
didn't he? Come on, tell me...

361
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,809
Tell me everything,
and I'll let you leave, okay?

362
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,061
Guendy!

363
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,480
You have clients to tend to,

364
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,817
but there's an awful whore
who's taking them for you.

365
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,236
So? Do you really want that?

366
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,238
Do you really want that,
or don't you?

367
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:32,078
I know. You came
up the other day.

368
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:36,207
You wanted me to do that kid.

369
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,293
Wait, wait. What are you saying,
Guendy?

370
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,337
She's absolutely wasted, man.

371
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,588
- She has no clue.
- But is he retarded,

372
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,049
or maybe deformed in his body?

373
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,385
Your mouth will be
deformed if you don't talk!

374
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,719
Come on now! Speak!

375
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:53,308
Okay, okay, okay.

376
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,353
José came over...

377
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,396
on Saturday

378
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,732
at 11 o'clock.

379
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:06,404
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

380
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,532
Nobody ever left.

381
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:15,413
I really need to take a piss...

382
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,293
I think I'm sick.
- What a damn bitch.

383
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,880
Wait. Henry...

384
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,840
You actually took your
nephew to Guendy?

385
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,067
Are you some kind of pervert?

386
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,343
Wait, it's a long story, man.

387
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,888
No,
don't tell me. And another thing...

388
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:36,142
- José Miguel Rosas has to be released.
- No.

389
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,979
I've got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

390
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,357
Just wait and see, brother.

391
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,444
And how are you sleeping,
Walter?

392
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,740
Fine.

393
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,410
Most nights.

394
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,454
Have you noticed any
recurring thoughts or images

395
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,748
- you can't get out of your head?
- No.

396
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,625
How about feelings
of guilt or persecution?

397
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,546
Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude,

398
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,591
but where is this going,
exactly?

399
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,135
We're starting a process,
Walter.

400
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,512
- How long will it take?
- We've only just begun.

401
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,099
Could be days, weeks, months...

402
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,351
Look, I feel fine, really.

403
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:22,563
I mean it! I'm great. I'm...

404
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,108
Now, if this is truly necessary,

405
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,735
can't I continue
as an outpatient?

406
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,696
Walter,
a fugue state is a very serious event.

407
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,990
What if you were to
disassociate while driving?

408
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,993
Or you could be in
danger with the police.

409
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,799
You understand,
we can't allow you to leave

410
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,690
until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

411
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,128
Would you tell me

412
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,213
about patient confidentiality?

413
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,965
It's very straightforward.

414
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,819
Without your permission, I can't
disclose anything you tell me to anyone.

415
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,595
What about my family?

416
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,890
Not your family,
not to the police, not to anybody.

417
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,244
The only exception would be if
you threatened to kill someone.

418
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,588
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

419
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,193
And you abide by these
strictures absolutely.

420
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,987
Right.

421
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,697
Okay.

422
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,866
Right...

423
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:20,204
I confess there
was no fugue state.

424
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,624
I remember everything.

425
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,209
Look, doctor...

426
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,342
The truth is,

427
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,635
I couldn't stand
being in that house.

428
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,181
I needed to get out of there...

429
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,892
I needed to
breathe. And so I left.

430
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:45,980
I took a cab and
went to the station.

431
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,567
Then I took a bus to a small
town... I don't remember...

432
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,530
I stayed at a hotel
just thinking. That's it.

433
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:57,158
So, being found naked in a supermarket was
your way of giving credibility to a lie?

434
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,039
- That's right.
- Why run away?

435
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,665
What did you feel
you had to run from?

436
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,797
Doctor,
my wife is seven months pregnant

437
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,966
with a baby we didn't intend.

438
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,515
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

439
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,895
I am an extremely overqualified

440
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,400
high school chemistry teacher.

441
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:34,028
My salary is barely
enough to live for a month,

442
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:39,992
while all my friends
and colleagues are rich.

443
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,328
Maybe in 18 months...

444
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,164
I'll be dead.

445
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,333
And you ask why I ran?

446
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,133
José Miguel?

447
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,179
I have this Tuco-nuts
person to introduce you to.

448
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,056
Got it?

449
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,155
This man is Héctor Salamanca.

450
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,700
Tuco Salamanca's uncle,
who you already know.

451
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:27,665
So, Mr. Salamanca,

452
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,500
can you understand
me when I speak?

453
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,173
That means yes.

454
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,217
One time means yes.

455
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,511
Two times means no.

456
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,055
No,
this has to be the worst joke ever.

457
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,182
He doesn't even know
what planet he's living on.

458
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,601
No, no...

459
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,102
Okay.

460
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:55,234
Let's do an exercise,
Salamanca, listen carefully.

461
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,570
I'll name several planets.

462
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,448
When I get to the right one

463
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,742
just say yes, or no.

464
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,830
Right now we're on Saturn.

465
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,669
We're on Mars.

466
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,716
Mr. Salamanca, we're on Earth.

467
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:24,138
Seems like he's all there.

468
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,100
Go ahead, Gómez. Ask away.

469
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,936
Mr. Salamanca.

470
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,731
This man right before you,

471
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,149
was he at your house?

472
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,994
Mr. Salamanca...

473
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,706
Was this guy in
your house or not?

474
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,374
Do you know him?

475
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,713
Did he do business
with your nephew Tuco?

476
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,140
Calm down, Mr. Salamanca.

477
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,976
Tell us.

478
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,437
Are you afraid of this man?

479
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:17,149
How can he be
afraid of this prick?

480
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:21,028
Come on, granddad. Calm down.

481
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,863
Cooperate with us.

482
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,056
Take him. I guess that's a no.

483
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,150
There you go.

484
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:04,321
That's a Mexican
old-school mob guy.

485
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:07,491
They'd rather drop
dead than help the police.

486
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,302
Right, but we had to try something,
didn't we?

487
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,788
There has got to be a way.

488
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,373
We have got to kick
him loose anyway.

489
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,669
I can't tell you how pissed I
am that the punk got away with it.

490
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,255
He's a punk,
after all. He's nobody anyway.

491
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,358
Gómez, are you saying you
buy that lame-ass story of his?

492
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,469
Do you really think
that wasn't his money?

493
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,314
- Tell me! Do you?
- Enough, enough already.

494
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,515
Wait, wait, let's be reasonable.

495
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,560
That much money
has got to be Tuco's.

496
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,729
- Whose else?
- Tuco, you say Tuco, Gómez?

497
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,148
That money's the punk's!

498
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,877
- Hello?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Hey, it's me.</font></i>

499
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,504
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Pay phone?</font></i>

500
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,173
Yes,
everything's fine. Are you alright?

501
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,844
Yes, all good. How are things?

502
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,220
They asked me a bunch of stuff

503
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,807
and got me on edge for a while,
but then they let me go.

504
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,350
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So when will you be out?</font></i>

505
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,185
Tomorrow.

506
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,980
Who questioned you?
What did they ask you?

507
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,858
That's where we have a problem.

508
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,669
The man who questioned
me was your brother-in-law,

509
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,736
and he's even got
my mattress money.

510
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,613
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What?</font></i>

511
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,508
Yes, my money. The guy took
every single penny and left me nothing.

512
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,408
Not even for a bite.

513
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:34,036
Wait. What does he
know about the money?

514
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,289
No, man,
he doesn't know shit. The plan worked.

515
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,458
But I got bills due,
man. I'm screwed.

516
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,878
Did he mention my name?

517
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,213
No, never.

518
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,007
But thanks for
caring. I appreciate it.

519
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,552
- What about the basement?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- It's clean.</font></i>

520
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,178
And the bus?

521
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,180
A friend's cousin
took it to his garage.

522
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,348
It's all under control.

523
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,392
Can he get it running again?

524
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,352
What? Why?

525
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,229
So we can cook.

526
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,273
So you still want
to cook? Seriously?

527
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,818
José Miguel,
nothing's changed here.

528
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,209
38 thousand dollars

529
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,670
for my kids' college,

530
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:29,508
plus the mortgage...

531
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:34,388
That would be two and
a half pounds a week...

532
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,770
The cash on hand.

533
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,754
Sorry, honey.

534
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,381
Did I wake you up?

535
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,508
No, he was awake.

536
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,134
Want me to get you
something to eat?

537
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,261
No, I'm not hungry. Thanks.

538
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,471
Are you okay?

539
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,376
Don't tell me you're still caught
up in the chemical storage thing?

540
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,753
Look, buddy.

541
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,176
What's this?

542
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,553
It's the blue meth. It
was found on Tuco.

543
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,806
People in the lab say

544
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:50,560
it got cooked,
P2P-style. What did I tell you?

545
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:55,024
So what are you thinking? The
two stooges over here cooked it?

546
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,275
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

547
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,902
At least since this.

548
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,202
This is El Loco's.

549
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,245
My God.

550
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,081
So what about these two?

551
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:14,668
I want to find out if there's any
relationship, working one or personal,

552
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,379
or maybe this one cooked,
or that one...

553
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,758
A simple explanation,
only I'm not seeing it.

554
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:26,180
Wait, before that melon of
yours gets completely bald,

555
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,141
let's go grab a beer.

556
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,726
It's 11 in the morning.

557
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,478
I'm buying.

558
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,023
- What?
- I'm buying.

559
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:40,236
Hey, come on,
now. Just come, come on.

560
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,406
One for each,
or do we have to share?

561
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,700
- A beer, I said a beer.
- What did I say?

562
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,536
We can sneak on that girl.

563
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,082
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Surprise!

564
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,751
You sneaky bastard!

565
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:58,295
No, come, come,
look, look, look...

566
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,756
Just as ugly,
but with a nicer face.

567
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:05,219
But I have more
hair in this one.

568
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,179
Wait a minute, hold on.

569
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,806
Just a second, people.

570
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,226
We're going to
hand out the gift.

571
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,186
This is from all of us.

572
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,148
Good job, Henry.

573
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:21,443
Wow, thanks a lot. Thank you,
all of you.

574
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,570
Let's take a look...

575
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,199
Let's see what you got me...

576
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:32,495
No, Gómez, no, no, no, buddy.

577
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,625
Was it this sick bastard's idea? No,
what's this, man?

578
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,961
Alright! Cheers!

579
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:41,004
Thank you so much!

580
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,598
- Dad, don't you want juice?
- No, thanks.

581
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,392
But the nurse said you
have to stay hydrated.

582
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,394
But I'm not thirsty.

583
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,940
Dad, just drink up, okay?

584
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,067
Please.

585
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,405
All of it.

586
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,241
- Mr. Walter!
- Henry!

587
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,327
- Hey, kid.
- Hey, uncle.

588
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,536
Hey,
I'm sorry for not coming earlier.

589
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,455
How are you?

590
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,124
Hey, María got that, didn't she?

591
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,959
That's just like her!

592
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,324
She did, she came this morning
and brought me some color.

593
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,213
Hey, I just saw Cielo,

594
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,799
They're rounding up
a wheelchair for you.

595
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,426
You free-loading bastard!

596
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,554
So tell us about the shoot-out.

597
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,016
No, no, it was nothing.

598
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:37,394
Just doing my job. Whole thing
was over in about ten seconds.

599
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,105
So how are you?

600
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,566
Really,
I'm feeling fine. I'm getting discharged.

601
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,778
That means I'm okay.
I'm actually much better.

602
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,198
- Really?
- Yes, the doctor said...

603
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,325
Well, he said it was a kind of

604
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,785
transient global amnesia.

605
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,289
So is that contagious?

606
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,624
No, it means non-recurring.

607
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,377
It won't happen again.

608
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,128
That sounds good.

609
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,173
I'll tell you what, brother.

610
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,384
I'm glad your back.

611
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,678
I'm really glad. And
you're healthy and well.

612
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,930
You really gave us a scare.

613
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,307
I know.

614
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,228
Henry,

615
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:23,690
I just wanted to say
I'm truly ashamed.

616
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,069
With everything that happened,
and you were in danger.

617
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,945
I'm really sorry. I
want to apologize.

618
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:32,532
What are you saying,
man? That's what we're for.

619
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,118
Wouldn't you do the
same thing for me?

620
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:39,581
At the office,
they're treating me like I'm the king.

621
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,418
Like a national
hero or something.

622
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,794
They're making
parties and stuff.

623
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,632
A massage. That's not true,
not that.

624
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:53,429
But you know what? You
ought to disappear more often.

625
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,893
Just kidding. Listen, listen.

626
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,312
Look what they
gave me at the office.

627
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:05,023
- Sick people. Look...
- What's that?

628
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:09,152
That is the grill of
this Tuco Salamanca.

629
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:10,570
Who?

630
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,241
The guy I shot a few days ago.

631
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,618
- That's weird.
- I know, right?

632
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,497
Mexicans use this now
like some sort of trend.

633
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,417
Can you imagine this
guy with one of these?

634
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,727
How would he talk? How would he?

635
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:28,088
"Weirth, heth speath weirth".

636
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,893
I'll wash these clothes.

637
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,398
Listen, baby.

638
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,819
I can't tell you how
good it feels to be home.

639
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,282
Thank you.

640
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:19,389
Honey.

641
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:23,018
I was just thinking about going
to the store. Want anything?

642
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:26,188
I don't know, maybe a banana,
couple of plums.

643
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,084
This will not happen again.

644
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:53,965
I swear this won't
happen ever again.

645
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:01,890
Walter...

646
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,017
Do you have a second cell phone?

647
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,854
No. Why?

648
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,692
The night you disappeared

649
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:17,072
you were very upset,
something was going on.

650
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:20,367
We were talking,
and then your cell phone rang.

651
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,620
You didn't answer,
and then you just left.

652
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,706
- Really?
- Henry did some searching,

653
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,001
and that phone call
never showed up.

654
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,170
That's weird!

655
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,758
I don't remember any of that.

656
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,553
But one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.
