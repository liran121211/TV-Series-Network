1
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:15,850
What happened, yo?
What happened?

2
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,520
I feel dizzy, I feel dizzy.
I need some fresh air.

3
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,063
Come on, come here.
Sit down.

4
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,524
- I can't brea--
- Sit down here.

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,359
It's okay,
it's okay.

6
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,795
I feel like I'm burning inside.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,297
Inhale, breathe, relax.

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,162
When were you
going to tell me?

9
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,764
What?

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,374
About the cancer.
You have cancer, right?

11
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,190
How do you know?

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,635
'Cause my grandma
had one of those...

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,015
marks that
radiotherapy leaves.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,143
Dude, we're partners
in this.

15
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,563
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not good, bro.

16
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,710
What stage are you in?

17
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,630
3 A.

18
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,116
It's already in
the lymph nodes.

19
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:23,167
In what condition was your
grandma when you got to know?

20
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,353
Very bad.

21
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,276
How long did she last?

22
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,054
Seven months and
four days exactly.

23
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:39,725
I was always
beside her.

24
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,332
It's pretty obvious.

25
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,568
Now it's clear.
You're doing all this

26
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:53,698
to leave some money
for your folks, right?

27
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:58,052
You have any problems with that?

28
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,321
Simmer down
there, sparky.

29
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:20,451
Easy, man, you lost.
You're fucked up, easy.

30
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:25,164
Uncle, I don't see
José Miguel, he's gone.

31
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,516
Anybody got eyes on Rosas?

32
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,060
No.

33
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,088
You two go find him,
see what happened.

34
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,884
Boss, see what we've got here:
cops.

35
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,737
Nice.

36
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:48,228
No, no, no,!
Joaquín, don't do it!
Please, don't shoot!

37
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:53,275
Get me out of here,
Peto, don't shoot!

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,237
Joaquín, Joaquín,
don't shoot, please.
Don't shoot, don't kill him!

39
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,363
- Get back here.
- Easy.

40
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,158
The hell not?
He's a cop.

41
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,884
He's my family.

42
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,303
Say again?

43
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,038
He's my
brother-in-law.

44
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,792
So this fucking cop
has something to do with you?

45
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,920
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us you had a cop
for a brother-in-law?

46
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,354
Did you know about this?

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,507
I called you off, remember?
God damn it!

48
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,468
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come!

49
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,637
It seems to me
we did you a solid.

50
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,597
No! You weren't
supposed to be here!

51
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,657
Too late now.

52
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,477
How's about you telling me
what was the fuck going down
out here, buddy.

53
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,064
From what I see,
you and your brother-in-law

54
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,358
don't seem to be
getting along too well.

55
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,943
It doesn't
concern you.

56
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,695
We just wasted
his partner here

57
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,072
and he's wearing a bullet.
So, yeah,
I'd say it does concern me.

58
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:41,699
No! This is between
him and me.

59
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,260
No cavalry coming?

60
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,762
No, no!

61
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:53,169
You bet your ass
the cavalry's coming.
They're almost here.

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,172
No, no, no!
That's not true!
I swear!

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,633
Henry, Henry, I know
nothing can change
what just happened

64
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,927
but you can walk
out of here alive.

65
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:06,140
Henry, please,
you just promise us

66
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:10,728
promise that you'll let this go,
this didn't happen, tell him!

67
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:20,404
Yeah, I thought as much.
Sorry, man. Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

68
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,824
No, no, no!
Joaquín, Joaquín, no!

69
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,952
I have money! I have money!
It's buried out here.

70
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,621
It's eighty million dollars.
They're yours.

71
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,209
So that's what got
this party started?

72
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,601
You know what's the problem?

73
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,338
This money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

74
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,174
Yes, it will!
Joaquín, think about it.

75
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,802
You can do anything.
It's eighty million dollars!

76
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:47,431
150 billion pesos.
All you've got to do
is let him go.

77
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:51,727
That's a hell of an offer.
What do you think, Fed?

78
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,647
Don't call him Fed.
His name is Henry.

79
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,943
How about it, Henry?
Should I let you go?

80
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:06,784
I'm special agent Henry Navarro,
and you know what I think?

81
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,888
That you can go fuck yourself!

82
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:14,083
No, no, no, Henry!
No, Joaquín, wait!

83
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,044
Henry, you gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

84
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,546
Do it!
God damned it, tell him!

85
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,266
You're the smartest guy
I ever met.

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,060
But you're also the
most stupid.

87
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,495
Don't you see?

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,818
Ten minutes ago, this guy
made up his mind to kill me.

89
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,781
So do what you're
gonna--

90
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,884
No!

91
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,776
Most people
tell me to be somewhere

92
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,963
"After that house

93
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,074
there on the left,
or 2 miles after the bridge

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,244
on the right, there's
a post and a sign

95
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,579
whatever, but these are
pretty specific directions.

96
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:39,793
It's very weird.
Not even back in the day

97
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,171
we used those references
nor shit in the sticks.

98
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,231
That money is around here.

99
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,342
That fancy phone of yours,
where does it say
this is exactly?

100
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,146
Look at this.
He brought all the gear

101
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,998
shovel and everything.

102
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,341
Boss, the kid now.

103
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,159
Then we'll take
care of him.

104
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,680
Says this is it right here.

105
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,894
So dig.

106
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,740
What's that?

107
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,618
What's this?

108
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:45,650
Look, boss!
Boss.

109
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,670
Joaquín.

110
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,256
Hell yeah!

111
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,787
That's right,
lift the lid.

112
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,141
What's this?

113
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,269
That's what I call guts!

114
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:12,052
Out of there, man.
Come on, get it out.

115
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,988
Come on, show me, show me.

116
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,823
Whoo! Look!

117
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,153
All right.
Go get the bodies.

118
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,588
Yeah, boss.

119
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,499
Thanks, uncle.

120
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,991
Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in that car.

121
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,746
Seriously?
That's, like,
10 or 11 million right there.

122
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,333
Do the maths.
I don't know, but think that's--

123
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,712
You gonna make me say it again?
What have I told you?
Go. Chop, chop.

124
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,297
Whatever you say, boss.
You heard him.

125
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,884
Jesus.
What's with all the greed here?

126
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,387
In my day, nobody showed
their true colors like that.

127
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,978
Hey. I'm leaving you a barrel.
Boys are gonna load it for you.

128
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,314
You got the keys
for these cuffs?

129
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,002
I'm sorry for
your loss.

130
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,927
My nephew here,
he respects you.

131
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,472
He would never forgive me
if things went another way.

132
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,766
Also, I'll be honest,
you caught me in a good mood.

133
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,286
So here's what's gonna happen.

134
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,064
You're gonna get in your car
and drive out of here.

135
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,318
You get lost.
All right? No hard feelings.

136
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,253
We put all this behind.

137
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,634
We square?

138
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,831
Why do you have to be
so rude?

139
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,000
No, no, man.
Let me tell you something.

140
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,770
I gotta know we're square.

141
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,506
Or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

142
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,905
Very good.

143
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,120
Rosas.
You still owe me

144
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:13,024
If you can find him,
we'll kill him. Count on it.

145
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,002
Found him.

146
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:26,263
No! Get off me! Get off!

147
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,567
All right. Good to go?

148
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,496
Uncle, wait.

149
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,569
He was out here
working with those
feds.

150
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,071
Shouldn't we find out
what he told them first?

151
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,158
Maybe he told them some
stuff that might not be
good for us.

152
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,286
And I'll bet I could get it
out of him back home.

153
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,999
Me and him, we got history.
I'm sure he remembers.

154
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,503
And we'd take care
of the job after that.

155
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,731
We bring him back dead.

156
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,759
Works for me.
Works for you?

157
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:35,357
No, no, Walter, no, no,
Walter! Get off!

158
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:43,214
Wait!

159
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,760
Remember that girl you had?

160
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,497
That you loved
so much, Juana?

161
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:55,544
I watched her die,
you know?

162
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,402
I was there the night she died.

163
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:09,349
I was standing there.
You were both completely wasted.

164
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,787
Until she began throwing up.

165
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:19,359
I saw her choking
in her own barf and did nothing.

166
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,321
I could have saved her.
But I didn't.

167
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:02,432
Hi.

168
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,935
Hello, sir.

169
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,796
That truck
belong to you?

170
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,273
It does. It's mine.

171
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,816
I'd like to buy it.

172
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,819
No, sir. It's not for sale.

173
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,955
Buddy.

174
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,207
I told you it's not for sale.

175
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,361
That truck brings back memories
of my family.

176
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,219
Sir.

177
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,911
Thank you.

178
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,702
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, it's me again.</font></i>

179
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,270
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What time would</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you be back?</font></i>

180
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,565
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Just give us a call</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">whenever you can. Bye.</font></i>

181
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,291
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi.</font></i>

182
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,584
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Auntie!</font></i>

183
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,028
How's my favorite
nephew going?

184
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,049
I haven't seen you for a while.

185
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,242
I've been busy, you know.
This and that.

186
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,747
But I need to talk to your mom,
so I thought I'd stop by.

187
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,249
I wish you'd called first.
This isn't the best time.

188
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,295
Well, I guess Morgan
can hold down the fort.

189
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,149
Yeah, sure. I got it.

190
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,593
Okay, honey.
Thanks.

191
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,639
Why don't we go
into your office?

192
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,705
How can I help you?

193
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,332
María, I have nothing to say.

194
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,904
Well, I do, so you can
just sit there and listen.

195
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,824
I got a call
from Henry.

196
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,827
He arrested Walter
three hours ago.

197
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:50,641
It's over, Cielo.

198
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,503
They are working with a former
associate of Walter

199
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,841
José Miguel Rosas.
You know him, right?

200
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,677
He has supplied them
with everything they
need.

201
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,848
They're booking Walter
as we speak.

202
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:08,768
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

203
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:15,900
I almost didn't come here.
Christ, I barely even know
who you are.

204
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,421
And you know what?

205
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:25,035
I don't even know if I
can ever trust you again.

206
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,498
And then I think about the time
you were so upset with Walt

207
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,126
and asked us
to stay with the kids

208
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,753
because you wanted
them out of the house.

209
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:39,423
And all of this makes me believe
that there has got to be hope
for you.

210
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,719
Because I don't know what
Walter did to your head

211
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,613
but it can be undone.

212
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:51,102
And I've been forcing myself to
remember that you are my sister.

213
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:54,898
And so I'm here.
But everything changes now.

214
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,110
And you have got to prepare
yourself.

215
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,404
Henry will help you,
I know he will.

216
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,742
And I will support you,
but I have conditions.

217
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:12,623
I want you to give me
every video you did

218
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,334
every single copy
of that obscenity

219
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,212
that the two of you made
to discredit Henry.

220
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,355
You understand me?

221
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,422
Answer me.
Do you
understand me?

222
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,275
Yes, yes, yes.

223
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,468
Now you'll dry
your eyes and get Junior.

224
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,680
You're going to tell
him everything.

225
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,558
He deserves to know the
truth from his family.

226
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,143
Not a bunch of uniformed
strangers.

227
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,942
No, no, no.
Please, Junior cannot know, no.

228
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,028
You tell him. Or I
will, Cielo.

229
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,448
Junior needs to know
the truth

230
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,701
and he needs to
know now.

231
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,534
Good afternoon.

232
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,575
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

233
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,136
I don't know anything else.

234
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,622
Just go to Henry Navarro's
house, the tape is there.

235
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,334
I swear, no one else
knows about it.

236
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,379
Just me and his partner.
I can't stand it anymore.

237
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:45,842
Get out. Or you want me
to help you climb?

238
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:49,820
Yo, I swear, I did nothing.

239
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:56,060
Get out.
The day's nice out here.

240
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,578
Come on.

241
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:14,578
I'll hold the ladder so you
don't get hurt. Easy.

242
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:24,381
One foot, then the other.
That's it. Slowly.
Watch your head.

243
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,190
Relax, I got you.

244
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:47,070
There it is.
I got you.

245
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:54,202
Let me help you.
There you are.

246
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,680
Relax, okay?

247
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,591
All right.

248
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,637
You ready?

249
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,828
Let's cook.

250
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,170
You're out of your mind!

251
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:17,660
It's the truth, honey.
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

252
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,162
Then both of you are
out of your minds!

253
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,471
No.

254
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:24,959
Then how could you keep
this a secret?

255
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,520
Why would you go along?

256
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,006
Why wouldn't you
tell the police?

257
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,134
I'll be asking myself that
for the rest of my life.

258
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,763
So you're saying all of this
time you were lying about this?

259
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,409
You're a liar, mom!

260
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:54,713
No more lies, lies!

261
00:26:54,738 --> 00:27:00,537
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?
Which lie is it?

262
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,081
Morgan, now your mother
is telling you the truth.

263
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,335
Right here, right now.
Believe it.

264
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,629
This is bullshit!
I wanna talk to dad.

265
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,466
Your dad's in custody.
He won't be able to answer.

266
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,009
Then I'm calling
my uncle!

267
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,760
I've tried.
He's not answering either.

268
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,096
He must be in the thick of it
with your father.

269
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,948
Sit down and calm--

270
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,033
Don't touch me!

271
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:33,152
I don't want
to be here.

272
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,280
You'd better go home to stay
with Valentina and Junior,

273
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:39,200
so you can calm down
and talk about all this.

274
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,052
I'll stop by later.

275
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:43,864
Put your seatbelt on.

276
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:48,686
Junior, could you put
your seatbelt on, please?

277
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,247
Honey, I'm serious.

278
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,485
Please, put it on.
You know it's not safe.

279
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,779
You can get injured,
or even police can stop us

280
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,839
and give us a fine and--

281
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,909
You're shittin'
me, right?

282
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,954
If all this is true
and you knew about it

283
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,139
you're as bad as him.

284
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,273
Honey...

285
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,908
Whose truck is that?

286
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,372
Dad!

287
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,192
Come on.
Come inside and pack right now.
Pack your stuff.

288
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,195
Mom and aunt María,
they said you were arrested?

289
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,905
What? No, I'm here.
Don't you see?

290
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:46,243
They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

291
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,762
What are you talking about?

292
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,954
- Talk to me, dad!
- No!

293
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,666
Go and pack! Our priority
right now is to pack.

294
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,792
Just tell me, dad!
I'm talking to you.

295
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,795
Go, go. Junior, I need you
to go into your bedroom

296
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,773
and pack your stuff.

297
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,509
Uncle Henry,
they said he arrested you?
You were with him?

298
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,720
I will discuss
all of this
later, okay?

299
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,613
Why not now?!

300
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,306
Just because!
It has to be now!

301
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,059
Go to your bedroom
and pack your things!
Go! Now!

302
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:14,271
Cielo, you too.
Please, go grab your things.

303
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,790
Why are you here?!

304
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,816
Grab everything
for you and the kids.
Right now!

305
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,237
But Henry had you in custody.
He wouldn't just let you go.

306
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,572
What happened?
Where's Henry?

307
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:23,881
I negotiated.

308
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,132
Negotiated?!

309
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,325
- Yes, negotiated.
- What does that mean?

310
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,619
It means we're fine,
Cielo, okay?

311
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,081
Everything is gonna be fine,
but we need to leave right now.

312
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,832
No, no, no!
Tell me where's Henry?!

313
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,768
Why do we need to leave, dad?

314
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,589
Cielo, I have 11 million dollars
in cash right outside
in the truck.

315
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,717
We can have a fresh start.
Whole new lives.

316
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,902
But I need us to go right now.

317
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,430
I'll explain everything later,
I promise.

318
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,656
You killed him.

319
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,200
- What?

320
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,436
No, no, no!
No, Gosh, no!

321
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,355
I tried to save him, I swear!
No!

322
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,359
Please, trust me.
Cielo, trust me.

323
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,695
Junior, I'll tell you everything
later.

324
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,254
No! Tell me now!

325
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,491
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It can't be now, Junior.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need you to trust me.</font></i>

326
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,992
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Talk to me!</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Tell me what's going on.</font></i>

327
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,053
I'll tell you later.

328
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,721
Stop fooling around.

329
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:13,872
I'm not fooling around!
Junior, we have to go now.

330
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,111
What happened to uncle Henry?

331
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,989
Get out!

332
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:35,352
Cielo, I promise you, we
will figure this out.

333
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,104
Enough!
Get out of here!

334
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,397
- What are you doing?
- Out!

335
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,065
- Get out of here!
- Put it down.

336
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,417
Mom, please, calm down!

337
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,777
- Get out.
- Put the knife down.

338
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,779
- Get out of here!
- Put it down now!

339
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,589
- Mom, watch out!

340
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,800
No, no, mom!

341
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,910
Go!

342
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:55,180
No! Don't hurt her!

343
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,433
Get out of here!

344
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,101
Watch out!

345
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,775
Let go!

346
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,610
No, no!

347
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,366
What are you doing?!

348
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,828
Mom, are you okay?

349
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:24,735
What the hell is wrong with you!
We're a family!

350
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,965
We're a family.

351
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:36,330
I need the police.
My dad, he pulled
a knife on my mom.

352
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:41,418
He's going to kill her.
He's a murderer.

353
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:46,340
Please, come quickly.
Yeah, he's still in the house.

354
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:52,095
He might attack us.
He's dangerous.

355
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,349
We're at 21 12-1.
You've gotta come quick.

356
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,268
Dad, what are you doing?
Mom?

357
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:05,401
What?! No, no, no.
Not Valentina, Walter.

358
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:11,281
Walter, no! Let her go!
Please, Walter!

359
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:16,495
You can't do this!
Walter, you can't take her!

360
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,752
Give me my baby back!
Please, don't do it!

361
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:28,048
Give me my child!
Please, Walter, Walter!

362
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,845
Let her go!
Walter! Please!

363
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,163
Daddy got you a new sweater.

364
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,290
The other one was filthy.

365
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:50,880
This will keep you warm.

366
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,031
Everything will be okay,
you know?

367
00:33:53,156 --> 00:34:00,263
Look, do you like it?

368
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:04,460
Beautiful.
Let's throw this away.

369
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,148
Mommy.

370
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,236
Confirming the abduction.

371
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:18,348
Valentina Blanco Restrepo,
18 months

372
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:23,312
Caucasian, last time she
was seen wearing a white jacket

373
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,041
with a kitty and pink pants.

374
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,585
Henry called and told me

375
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,362
he had caught Walter
and had him in handcuffs.

376
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,506
I don't get it.

377
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,474
Are you expecting a call?

378
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,108
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cielo, it's me. Pick up.</font></i>

379
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,509
That's him.
That's my husband.

380
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:54,777
Start tracing the landline.

381
00:34:54,802 --> 00:35:00,116
The number's 50-51-77-85-86.

382
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,310
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know you're there,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">so pick it up.</font></i>

383
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,870
Got it.

384
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:06,814
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">If you're there, I need you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to pick up the phone.</font></i>

385
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,151
Walter, where's
Valentina?

386
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,655
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Are you alone?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">No police?</font></i>

387
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,618
No. No police.
Tell me, where are you?
Where's my girl?

388
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,705
-<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> What the hell</font></i>
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">is wrong with you?</font></i>
- Walter!

389
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,665
Why can't you do
one thing I say?

390
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,433
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Why don't you do as I tell you?</font></i>

391
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,518
What?!

392
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,354
This is your fault.

393
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,800
This is what comes
of your disrespect.

394
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,153
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And I told you, didn't I?</font></i>

395
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,614
I warned you for a solid year.

396
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,894
I warned you
that if you crossed me

397
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,121
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">there would be consequences.</font></i>

398
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,372
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Didn't I make myself clear?</font></i>

399
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,775
What part of that
didn't you understand, Cielo?

400
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,777
You took my
child!

401
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,462
'Cause you need to learn.

402
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,322
You bring her
back now!

403
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:02,202
Maybe now you'll listen.
Maybe now you'll use
your damn head.

404
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,747
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you never believed in me.</font></i>

405
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:09,209
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You were never grateful</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for anything I did</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for this family.</font></i>

406
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:13,672
No! You kept whining:
"No, Walter.
You have to stop.

407
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,885
Walter, it's immoral.
It's illegal.
They're gonna get you."

408
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,098
You're always judging
and complaining.

409
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:26,268
While I do everything,
absolutely everything,
on my own.

410
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:30,773
And now, on top of it,
you tell my son

411
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,734
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">what I do,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">everything I've done</font></i>

412
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:39,949
after I've told you and told you
to keep your damn mouth shut.

413
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:44,954
You stupid bitch!
How dare you?

414
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,972
I'm sorry.

415
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:51,334
Listen, Cielo.
You have no right
to discuss anything I do.

416
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,423
No right! What the hell
do you know about it anyway?

417
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,427
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You never knew</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">about anything I did, did you?</font></i>

418
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,321
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And you didn't care to know.</font></i>

419
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:08,894
I built this. Me. Me alone.
Nobody else!
You hear me?

420
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,773
You're right,
you're right.

421
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:17,211
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Maybe now you'll be able</font></i>

422
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:23,492
to mark my words.
Listen carefully, Cielo.

423
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:28,747
You tow the line
and do what I say

424
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:33,794
or you will wind up
just like Henry.

425
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:39,341
Please, we need to know
what happened to Henry.

426
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:49,309
You're never gonna see
Henry again.

427
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,746
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He crossed me.</font></i>

428
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:58,777
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And bear this in mind family</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">or no, you sink with me.</font></i>

429
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:02,114
Walter, please, I just
want my daughter back.

430
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,494
Please, just come home
and bring Valentina back.

431
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,708
No, I've still got things
left to do.

432
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,180
Thanks.

433
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,859
Who turned on the flares?

434
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:09,990
Mate.

435
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,217
Shh, shh.

00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:08,073
