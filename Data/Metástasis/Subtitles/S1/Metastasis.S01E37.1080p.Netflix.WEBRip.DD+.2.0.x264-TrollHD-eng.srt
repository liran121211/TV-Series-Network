<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Addiction to games.</font></i>

12
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,421
Gambling made me lose
many things in my life.

13
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,025
Mi family, my friends.

14
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,860
It was like a robbery,

15
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,280
only I was the thief.

16
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,266
It's amazing,
the stories you tell yourself

17
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,036
to justify it.

18
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,665
Just to play one more hand.

19
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,777
At anything:
dices, cards, slots.

20
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,463
Anything I could gamble at.

21
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:46,328
No, María, that's out deal.
Don't worry.

22
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,831
No, you're not paying
for anything.

23
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,209
We'll take care of
everything, okay?

24
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,628
We're meeting to say a word
about the bills.

25
00:04:54,753 --> 00:05:00,634
We just want everyone
to know about Walter.

26
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,263
In therapy they call it
"socialize the problem".

27
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,825
Okay, fine.

28
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,285
Kisses. Bye.

29
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,830
Well...

30
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,084
Tonight's the night.

31
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,211
There's no turning back.

32
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,922
All right.

33
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,174
Let's do this.

34
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,969
So, this is the deal.

35
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,562
First I assign point values,

36
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,007
correlate to the effect
of removal.

37
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,861
You're going to split the 8s?

38
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,055
- May I continue?
- I'm sorry.

39
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:53,187
The mathematical principle,
known as the Kelly Criterion,

40
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,122
upon which I devised

41
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,999
my own strategy

42
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,944
is not dissimilar
to the MIT system.

43
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,072
No, no, no, wait.
You're not teaching them.

44
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,257
Focus.

45
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,701
You said you wanted me
to be thorough.

46
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,454
- No, just play.
- No.

47
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,497
- Play. You're taking too long.
- it's not that simple.

48
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,584
I have to be able
to explain all this.

49
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,670
No, here you have to look
professional.

50
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,632
Pretend you're in a movie
and you're an actor.

51
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,261
- Just act. Do it!
- No, no, no, Don't.

52
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,804
Don't be--
- For real. Believe me!

53
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,640
I've studied
every detail of this.

54
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,144
But you've lost
half of the hands played.

55
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,454
Because it's not that easy.

56
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,649
I know how to count the cards.
That's what it's about.

57
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,876
But it doesn't always work.

58
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,655
If it always worked,
I would be in a casino.

59
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,159
Walter, please,
they have to buy this story.

60
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,328
You know how they'd buy
this story?

61
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,431
If I didn't play.

62
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,599
I'm in recovery.

63
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,938
I shouldn't even be playing.

64
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:06,177
What you're doing is like
giving meth to an addict.

65
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,346
That's true.
You're right.

66
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,682
- Of course.
- It makes absolute sense.

67
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,267
- You can't touch any card.
- No.

68
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,270
Perfect!
The first point is solved.

69
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,230
The first point?
There's more?

70
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:22,276
Of course.
We're not leaving anything
at chance.

71
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,504
Here's what we have to say.

72
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,047
What's this?

73
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,367
- Well...
- Is it a script?

74
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,451
Yes, there're
our dialogues.

75
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,887
This is like a novella script?

76
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,623
So you're a writer
all of a sudden?

77
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,459
No, but you can learn a lot
on the Internet.

78
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,254
- This is ridiculous!
- No! No.

79
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,089
- You're nuts!
- Hey, it's not ridiculous.

80
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,857
It's necessary!

81
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,363
Henry is a cop.

82
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,640
He's used
to doing interrogations

83
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,895
and he knows
when someone is lying or not.

84
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,814
We can't tell him
a stupid story.

85
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,943
We can't sell him
a full-of-hole story

86
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,406
about how we suddenly have
enough money to buy a car wash.

87
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,963
Hold on.
Am I supposed
to memorize this?

88
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,549
Don't complain!
You've memorized worse things.

89
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,176
- Boring chemical stuff--
- No, no, no.

90
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,262
Be respectful with chemistry.
It has nothing to do with this.

91
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,155
Please, Walter!

92
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,408
This story has to be believable!

93
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:39,144
Cielo, you told this story
to María.

94
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,107
I know María
and I'm sure she told Henry.

95
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:47,027
Well, for the first time
in her entire life

96
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,988
María hasn't said anything.
Henry has no idea.

97
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,990
He thinks the insurance
is paying for his treatment,
not us.

98
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,343
I don't get it.

99
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,371
Why do we
have to keep this secret

100
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,015
is we have the perfect alibi?

101
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,544
Gambling. The brilliant system
I invented.

102
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,146
I'll tell you why.

103
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,609
When you were ill,

104
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,361
did you let anyone help you?

105
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,474
Did you take money
from Edgar and Marcela?

106
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,617
Because I seem to recall

107
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:22,729
that you'd rather sell drugs
than take help.

108
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,361
So why would Henry
think otherwise?

109
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,881
Fine.

110
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,658
- Fine, I give up.
- Perfect.

111
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,118
- Happy?
- Good.

112
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:44,268
Guys, we have good news.

113
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,878
Walter and I
are buying a car wash.

114
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,441
Yay!

115
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,718
The next logical question Henry
will probably ask is:

116
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,221
Where are you getting
the money from?

117
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,864
To which I'll say:

118
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,018
"We want to tell you
the whole story.

119
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,270
It's a doozy,
so hold on to your hats."

120
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,539
What hats?

121
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,416
That's not in the script.

122
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,068
No, I know.
But...

123
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,571
- It just came out.
- It just came out?

124
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,632
It just came from inside.

125
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,784
- Fine Whatever. Go on.
- Okay.

126
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,954
That's where you will take over,
starting with your diagnosis,
pages 1 and 2.

127
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,707
Please,
concentrate on the cancer.

128
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,417
- I will.
- That makes the public
like you.

129
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:31,232
What public?

130
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,485
María, Henry and Junior.

131
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,969
- Yes.
- They're our public.

132
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,055
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

133
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,366
After that, per pages 3 and 4.

134
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,868
Please, that part.

135
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,870
Go.

136
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,696
"Despair and fear
made me act like..."

137
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,158
- Like an idiot?
- Yes.

138
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,869
- No.
- Yes, an idiot. Come on.

139
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:09,336
I terribly, terribly
regret my ac--

140
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,755
No, saying terribly twice
doesn't sound good.

141
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,425
You have to sound
like you regret it.

142
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,801
But the tone is not okay.
I don't like it.

143
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,639
Just look for another word.
Improvise.

144
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,642
What matters is that you look
regretful and embarrassed.

145
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,144
That's the part
that doesn't fit at all.

146
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,316
Why am I so regretful
and embarrassed?
I don't get it.

147
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,734
- Don't you?
- No.

148
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,861
Do I have to explain to you
that part?

149
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,698
Cielo, supposedly,
I did this for my family, so...

150
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,092
No, stick to the script.

151
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:45,247
This story
makes me look like an asshole.

152
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,459
Like a weak guy
who doesn't make decisions,

153
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,335
who loses control.
I'm the villain.

154
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:55,132
No, this is story
that also has defects.

155
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,093
- And we both look bad.
- Do we?

156
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,445
Where are your defects?

157
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,307
You don't look bad
in this story!

158
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,116
It's implied.

159
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,661
It's implied, sure.

160
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,789
Just tell me one ting.

161
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,108
Where is it implied
you slept with your boss?

162
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,459
Or did you leave that out?

163
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,922
You know what?

164
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:23,051
For a fired schoolteacher

165
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,178
who cooks crystal meth,

166
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,472
an illegal drug,

167
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,374
I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

168
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,769
Don't you think so?

169
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,771
I don't think so!

170
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,549
I don't want Junior
thinking less of me.

171
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,011
No.
Don't worry about that.

172
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,055
You'll be like a prince
for Junior.

173
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,225
You'll be the cool one
in the story.

174
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:52,189
I'm just the bitch
that made
his poor dad's life impossible.

175
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,500
You're the victim of this bitch!

176
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,884
Cielo...

177
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,385
Cielo, I'm sorry.

178
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,165
I'm sorry that I put you
through all of this.

179
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,226
I'm really sorry.

180
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,187
This is all my fault.

181
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,525
I really regret all this.

182
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,723
That's the tone
I like!

183
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,225
See?
Didn't that sound good?

184
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,769
Can I add it to the script?
Give me the pen.

185
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,542
Come on.

186
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:45,659
So then
comes the part

187
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,327
where I say
how proud I'm of you

188
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,638
because you're in therapy

189
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,097
and then comes the end.

190
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,419
Just a suggestion.
You might look down on the floor

191
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,562
with remorse.

192
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,881
There's remorse again!
Just cut that out.

193
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,301
Fine, I know
you can't feel that.

194
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,304
- Then just look at your feet.
- Yes, I prefer that.

195
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,614
Fine.

196
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,116
So then,

197
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,870
I'll take María's hand.

198
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,646
How could you get her
hand?

199
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,315
Just look where she is.
Will you get over me?

200
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,611
- We're in the wring places.
- Then move.

201
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:21,837
Jesus!

202
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,074
So I'll take María's
hand and I'll tell her:

203
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,305
"It's such a relief to tell you.

204
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,543
We're just so glad we have
a strong family to help us
through this."

205
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:41,423
In that moment, maybe,
I could tear up a little.

206
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,759
It all depends
on how I'm feeling.

207
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,052
You'll cry
in that precise moment?

208
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,305
I don't know.
It's just an idea.

209
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,015
Through which eye?
Left? Right?

210
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,769
It's just an idea!
Don't make fun of me!

211
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,120
No, I'm not making fun.

212
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,039
I just want to know.

213
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,402
- One or two tears?
- This has to be convincing,
Walter,

214
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:06,214
I'm doing the best I can here.

215
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,174
I have to be meticulous.

216
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,510
You know what I think?

217
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,537
Maybe lying doesn't come
as easily to me as
it does to you.

218
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,367
María, why do you push me here?

219
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,119
I'm sorry!

220
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,814
- Hello, guys.
- Hi, aunt.

221
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,398
- Welcome!
- What's up, uncle?

222
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,959
What's up, boy?

223
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,401
- How are you?
- Fine. Super!

224
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,128
Hello.

225
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,532
You look good.
Thank you.

226
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,743
What do you have there?
You have no idea
what I cooked.

227
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:56,956
I might get an honest-to-God
meal here for once?

228
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,584
Your aunt María, she's cute,
but she could burn water.

229
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,312
Yes, I know.

230
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,315
So funny.

231
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,757
I'll head
to the kitchen.

232
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,886
Go show the boys
your new rock collection.

233
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,262
It's not rocks, María.
It's minerals.

234
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,740
Mi-ne-rals.

235
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,076
You want to see my collection?

236
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,202
Really?

237
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:19,521
Yes, sure.
Let's go.

238
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:20,898
Do I help you?
No, no.

239
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,707
Don't worry. Look.

240
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:27,028
This is how you do it.
I'll just turn around.

241
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,172
Look.

242
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,052
Uncle, what's this?

243
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,413
That's my favorite one.
That's Rhodonite.

244
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,141
It's manganese inosilicate.

245
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,685
What makes it this color?

246
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,937
That's the manganese part.

247
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,271
It oxides like rust.

248
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,341
In fact, it's more complicated
than that, Henry.

249
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,971
Manganese can have an oxidation
state of between -3 and +7,

250
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,599
which takes it through a range
of colors.

251
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:59,185
Purple, green, blue.
But its most stable state

252
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,064
is +2, which is usually
pale pink.

253
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,209
Feels like plastic!

254
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,404
Must be so cool
to be you.

255
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,868
You have a very nice collection.
I love it!

256
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,828
Do you?
Yes.

257
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,556
I'm glad you like it.

258
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:23,209
Hey, boy,
give me that file, will you?

259
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,229
You've got to check this out.

260
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,380
- This one?
- Yes, yes.

261
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,028
Come, I'll show you.

262
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,488
Put this there.

263
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,615
Hold on, Henry.

264
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,350
It's not a disturbing image
of a dead body, is it?

265
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,578
- No, no.

266
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,564
It's disturbing,
but not the way you think.

267
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:48,109
Just check it out and see.
You'll fall flat on your ass.

268
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,320
Like when you miss
your crutches.

269
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,614
No, you'll fall on your face.

270
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,132
Watch it.

271
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,719
No, it's just...

272
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,180
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It was more or less this way.</font></i>

273
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,182
Just look.

274
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,002
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">White wine, night</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and old songs</font></i>

275
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,420
Did he record
this on his own?

276
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,897
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And she laughed at me</font></i>

277
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,024
You see?

278
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,776
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Sweet liar</font></i>

279
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,761
Look at his glasses.
That's the best part.

280
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,154
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Fucking spring</font></i>

281
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,017
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That comes</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after an arousing dream</font></i>

282
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,328
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">If I suddenly wake up</font></i>

283
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,231
- Uncle, who's this guy?
- This guy?

284
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,526
That's out number one
public enemy.

285
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,254
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's despairing</font></i>

286
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,465
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Because love hurts</font></i>

287
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,300
So good!

288
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,965
It's such a relief
to finally tell you.

289
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,135
We're just so glad that we have
a strong family

290
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,030
to help us through this.

291
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,307
Calm down.
The worst is over now.

292
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,871
No, I don't...

293
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,025
I don't even know
what to tell you.

294
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,337
Just look at Walter!

295
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,922
Walter, you're such a stud.

296
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,216
How much did you exactly win?

297
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,638
Let's say

298
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,724
it's enough to buy a car wash

299
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,755
and pay for all the taxes,
which are pretty much.

300
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,217
Maybe even pay for a couple of
reasonable college educations.

301
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,195
But why did you stop?

302
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,263
You could have bought me
a convertible.

303
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,656
No, Junior.

304
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,159
Look, the truth is...

305
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,606
And this goes for you too,
I'm terribly,

306
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,068
terribly regretful and
embarrassed for my behavior.

307
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,861
Excuse me,
I have to go to the bathroom.

308
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,929
Wow!

309
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,458
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter!</font></i>

310
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,757
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter!</font></i>

311
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,536
Did you drown in the bathroom
or what?

312
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,704
Did I take too long?
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,916
Hey, man,
let me tell you something.

314
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,586
I'm really surprised
about what you've just told us.

315
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,772
Sure, I understand.

316
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:43,511
I'm sorry.
We should have told you before,

317
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,613
but this is quite delicate

318
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,349
and Cielo and I
thought we should wait
for the right moment.

319
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,368
Sure.

320
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,646
It mustn't have been easy
to talk about it.

321
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,606
No, no, no.
Of course not.

322
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,042
hey, Walter.

323
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,628
I want you to know

324
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,422
you can always bend my ear,

325
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,549
you know?

326
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,759
If you have any problem

327
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,204
or if you just want to talk,
I'll be there.

328
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,847
For whatever you need.

329
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,499
Thanks, for real.
I really appreciate it.

330
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,101
And...

331
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,189
The same goes for you.

332
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,425
If you ever
want to talk about something,

333
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,612
either personal or...

334
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:32,393
Even some technical question
about your work,

335
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,787
I can help you with that.

336
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,914
I'd be pleased to.

337
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,875
You can count on me.

338
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,654
Sometimes just talking something
through,
really makes a difference.

339
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,664
We're not talking
about an improvised lab.

340
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,500
This is a big ass operation.
Massive production.

341
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,269
At least...

342
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,272
220 pound per week or more.

343
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:04,508
Who is this person?
What do you know about him?

344
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,236
Well...

345
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:10,431
Not precisely.
We just know
he's a weird guy

346
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,768
and that he's deader than a
Texas salad bar.
That's all.

347
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,162
But I'm totally sure

348
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,789
he's my guy.

349
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,791
Your guy?

350
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,296
There's this mystery man

351
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,740
I've been chasing
for the better part of a year.

352
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:32,829
Cooks the purest meth
that I've ever seen.

353
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,390
He accomplished a 99% of purity.

354
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,334
Not even Mexicans and Americans
can do that.

355
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,604
You know what they call him?

356
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,924
- "Jaisenber".
- Jaisenber?

357
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,012
The physicist?.
The physicist, yes.

358
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,030
The one who helped Hitler.

359
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,391
- Yes, I know him.
- Precisely.

360
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,853
Anyway, I figure with a handle
like that,

361
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,872
my guy's got to be

362
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,625
some sort of an egghead.

363
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,113
I asked you to look at this
to see if you can find

364
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,216
any logic in all these formulas.

365
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,802
For what I read,

366
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:16,622
these people
cook with phenylacetone.

367
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,848
Right?

368
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,544
Yes, that's it.
Here it is.

369
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,715
Didn't Americans use that
to cook meth

370
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,859
in the 60s?

371
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,845
Especially to make
blue crystals,

372
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,863
which his what I'm looking for.

373
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,145
There's something
that called my attention.

374
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,026
"Two sticks of dairy free
soy margarine,

375
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,571
two cups of sugar,
a bit of salt..."

376
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,589
What's that?

377
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,634
It's a recipe for vegans' mores.

378
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,412
- No way.
- Yes, yes.

379
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,915
Guido Bermúdez
is really special.

380
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,876
Give it to me.
I'll show you something.

381
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,962
There's all kinds of crazy crap
in there.

382
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,797
But there's one thing
that called my attention.

383
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,609
This dedicatory.

384
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,613
"To W.B.

385
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,116
Silent master.

386
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,742
My inspiration."

387
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,412
W.B.?

388
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,998
Who could be W.B.?

389
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,625
Wilson Borja?

390
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,654
Wilberto Buitrago?
You get me?

391
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,884
Walter Blanco.

392
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,640
You got me.

393
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,811
And I give in.

394
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,231
Asshole!

395
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,469
For real,
who could be W.B.?

396
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,530
Give it to me.

397
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,200
I think I remember...

398
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,563
Here!
It's a poem.

399
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,832
"Proverbs of hell".

400
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,735
"The road of excess
leads to the palace of wisdom.

401
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,338
Prudence is a rich ugly old maid

402
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,465
courted by Incapacity.

403
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,868
He who desires but acts not,
breeds pestilence."

404
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,680
Guess who wrote this?

405
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,974
William Blake.

406
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,352
An English poet.

407
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,812
No way!

408
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,689
No, but...

409
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,009
How did you guess that?
How did you see that?

410
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,470
I've been reading this
every day.

411
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,155
Mystery solved.

412
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:41,809
That's it.
W.B. William Blake. Of course!

413
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,770
Thank you, really.
I was going to start
following other leads

414
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,399
make a mess.
Thank you.

415
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,860
Henry, this Guido,
the one who wrote these notes,

416
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,923
You think he's Jaisenber?

417
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,910
Yes, I think so.
And it makes me mad.

418
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,638
Why is that?

419
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,707
I'd have liked
to catch him myself.

420
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,586
I wanted to be the one to slap
the handcuffs on him.

421
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,255
I understand
what you're feeling.

422
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,175
But you know what?
Don't worry.

423
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,303
Generally,
when a big guy falls,

424
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,697
other more dangerous come up.

425
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,907
That's no consolation.

426
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,701
Listen, Henry.

427
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,436
What about the person
who killed Guido?

428
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,789
You have any leads?

429
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,359
That's not our problem,
it's APD's.

430
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,529
They say they've got
some fingerprints

431
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,574
and an eyewitness
saw a person of interest.

432
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,910
But they know nothing yet.
They'll find him eventually.

433
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,554
Yes, sure.

434
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,763
No doubt.

435
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,559
José!

436
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,273
José Miguel!

437
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,077
Jose!

438
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,913
Here!

439
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,544
I need to talk to you.

440
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,213
Go ahead.

441
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,490
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

442
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,676
I need your attention!

443
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,661
When I'm done.
That dude's next.

444
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,513
Okay?

445
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,164
What the hell?
It's urgent.

446
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,418
- Come here!
- Don't be so exaggerated.

447
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:35,465
José, Guido's murder
is being investigated.

448
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,841
So? That's their job.
It's normal.

449
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:41,220
And I have it on good authority
that they found fingerprints
at the scene.

450
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,863
Not mine.

451
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,890
- I'm going back to work.
- No!

452
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,101
How can you be
so sure?

453
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,911
Because I've been here at home

454
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,522
and you're the only one
who came to bother me.

455
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,524
Your brother-in-law's got
such a hardon for me

456
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,361
that if those
were my fingerprints
I wouldn't be here.

457
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:01,031
I didn't touch anything.
Absolutely anything.

458
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,717
The casing!

459
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,662
- Did you pick the casing?
- No.

460
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,391
José.

461
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,459
Tell me exactly what happened
from the moment you got there.

462
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,752
I what to know exactly
what happened.

463
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,424
I went there,
did my stuff and left.

464
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,777
No! I want details.

465
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,220
You drove there.
Get off the car and then?

466
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,826
Focus, damn it!

467
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,895
You went to his door.
Did you knock or ring the bell?

468
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,109
- Knocked.
- Fine, that's fine.

469
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,504
When Guido opened,

470
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,881
did he recognize you?

471
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,784
Did you talk? Did you get in
or shot him from outside?
What did you do?

472
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,471
José. José!

473
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,597
Argh!

474
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:54,418
Who wants to make
200 bucks?

475
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,423
- Let's go.
- Assholes!

476
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,210
Look, the boy's probably right.

477
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,822
If they had anything on him,
he'd be locked up already.

478
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,175
What about Henry's?

479
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,593
He suspects.

480
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,581
He knows José is involved
in the sale of blue meth.

481
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,957
That's the only lead he had
before the attack.

482
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,503
What if he ties
the loose ends?

483
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,214
He goes after him.
How?

484
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,259
On his Rascal Scooter?

485
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:47,263
I'm sorry.
That might have sounded
insensitive.

486
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,239
Anyway,

487
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,617
if he goes after José,

488
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,786
I'll sue his ass

489
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:57,981
for police brutality,
harassment and 16 other things.

490
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,359
The history that those two
have together being what it is,

491
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,613
you got to figure
your brother-in-law
is smart enough

492
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:07,991
not to go down
that particular road.

493
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,453
- There's nothing
to worry about.
- You think so?

494
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,015
Listen, Saúl.

495
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,875
What else should I not worry
about?

496
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,755
Should I not worry that Gustavo
plans to murder me

497
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,607
at the first chance he gets?

498
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,717
Should I not worry
that my drug-addicted partner

499
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,861
doesn't seem to care

500
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,779
whether he lives or dies?

501
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,533
You should see his house.

502
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,245
It's full of hobos.

503
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,565
Now how long
before Gustavo decides

504
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,793
that he's too big of a risk?

505
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,738
How long before he sends
that grunting dead-eyed cretin
sucker-punching me in the face.

506
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,715
Are you talking about...?

507
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,326
That's a good description.
Mario.

508
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:54,997
You know what that guy
is capable of.

509
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:59,293
When did this stop
being a business?

510
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,797
Why am I the only person
capable of behaving

511
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,232
in a professional manner?

512
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,153
This is way too dangerous.

513
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,808
Saúl, how can I
protect my family,

514
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,560
José, myself?
How?

515
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,622
Just a little question.

516
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,983
My name never came up
with those guys, right?

517
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,363
Meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash
to launder the money

518
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,090
and my wife doesn't say a word.

519
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,284
She's telling herself
that I work in this little lab

520
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,804
where there's no blood

521
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,747
and when my contract is up
I'll just hang it all up,

522
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,683
tip my hat, and walk away.

523
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,503
When did everything
get so screwed up?

524
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,632
I won't say you're wrong
because to be realistic,

525
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,861
you're in a little trouble.

526
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,807
But what I do tell you
is that you're in condition

527
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:57,785
of buying a clean slate.

528
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,732
- A clean slate?
- Yes.

529
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:06,527
This is a last resort
back pocket kind of thing,

530
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,906
but if you really got
to protect yourself,

531
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,575
then you should think
of disappearing.

532
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,580
I know a guy,
a disappearer.

533
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:21,124
Some Copperfield
who can do the job.

534
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,669
It's expensive,
and when I say "expensive"

535
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,604
I mean expensive.

536
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,857
But you'll have the chance

537
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,384
of starting a new life
somewhere else.

538
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,444
Costa Rica, Argentina.

539
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,763
Like a witness protection
program

540
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:36,866
kind of thing?

541
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,976
But without
having witnessed anything.

542
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,187
New name, new life,
everything new.

543
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,957
You'd be absolutely lost.

544
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:51,005
But once you make the decision,

545
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,757
there's no chance

546
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,467
of coming back.

547
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,387
None.

548
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,138
What do you say?

549
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,874
- You want his card?
- No.

550
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,129
No, there has to be
another way, Saúl!

551
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,234
I don't know.

552
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,638
We have to make everything
go back to normal. Otherwise...

553
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,682
Sooner or later
someone else will die.

554
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,870
And it can't be me.

555
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,749
Me neither.

556
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,714
All the air we breathe

557
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,618
is mixed
in those invisible waves.

558
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,054
It's in the Internet signal,

559
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,638
when the computer vibrates,

560
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,333
in that transparent little light
of the remote.

561
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:49,046
It's a room full of threads.
There're invisible waves.

562
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,714
Shut up!
That's cancer.

563
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,524
And in microwaves.

564
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,427
That gets in your body too.
Those signals--

565
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,530
Wake up, bitches!

566
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,033
Don't stop the party!

567
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,701
Hey, bitch!

568
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,270
Will you make sure
there's pizza here
when I get back?

569
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,666
Sure! I can do that!

570
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:12,361
I need these people
up and partying
when I get back.

571
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,446
- Sure!
- Understood?

572
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,675
But who's paying for it?

573
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,661
- No problem.
I'll be right back.
- Great!!

574
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,039
- Stand up!
- Wake up, come on!

575
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,833
As I was telling you,
those waves...

576
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,918
Those waves
are killing us.

577
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,812
We're trees.

578
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,021
Like this. Trees.

579
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,146
Listen to me, dude.
Cancer is psychologic.

580
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,107
You cause
your own cancer

581
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,442
with so much stress
and sadness.

582
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,419
You worry about problems.

583
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,379
I rather let drug kill me,

584
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,840
not cancer.

585
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,925
I don't want that.

586
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,469
Buy pizza and anything you need.

587
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,954
- Cool!
- For everyone.

588
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,706
- Cool, dude.
- I'll be right back.

589
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,542
- Look! Pizza!
- Wake up, bitches!

590
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,687
- All flavors and colors!

591
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,206
Hey, bitches!

592
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,709
Christmas's here!

593
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,169
Take it!

594
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,630
Wake up.

595
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,966
José, wake up!

596
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,259
Wake up!

597
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,512
What's up?

598
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,432
What's up with your ear?

599
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,602
Downstairs now!

600
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,689
What the hell?

601
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,782
Where's everybody?

602
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,727
I invited your guests
to leave.

603
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,772
- Fine.
- You know who this is?

604
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,792
No idea.

605
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,071
You ought to.
He's been here for three days.

606
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,546
Okay.

607
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,715
He stole your money.

608
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,261
38 millions look familiar?

609
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,212
This is it?
That's it.

610
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,939
Thanks.

611
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,759
You want to know what's next
for Miss Pissed In His Pants?

612
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:06,136
- No.
- Sure?

613
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,155
I'm sure.

614
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,117
Don't you even want to guess?

615
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,119
Mario, you're going to kill him.

616
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,122
So now what?

617
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:20,358
Is this the part
where I'm supposed to beg you
not to do it?

618
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,613
And then what? I'm supposed

619
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:24,713
to promise to straighten up

620
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:28,491
or some other crap.
Is that what your little show
was all about?

621
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,579
You're on thin ice,
you little shit head.

622
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,165
Mario,
you're not going to kill him.

623
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,918
You know how come I know?
You put a blinder on him.

624
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,378
If you were going to kill him,
You wouldn't mind
him seeing you.

625
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm going back to bed.

626
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,260
Close the door, please.
Good luck.

627
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,541
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

628
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,335
I was taking care of something.

629
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:09,116
- How's your ear?
- Mending.

630
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,136
Tell me.

631
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:16,414
José Miguel Rosas
is increasingly incautious.

632
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,459
He's a risk,
a liability.

633
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,421
I know him and Walter
are a team.

634
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,258
Walter won't like it,
but something's got to be done.

635
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,699
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Leave a message.</font></i>
- José.

636
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,618
I don't know
how many messages I've left you.

637
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,372
Why don't you answer
my fucking calls?

638
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,666
I'm at your house.
If you're in there, open,
freaking irresponsible!

639
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:56,948
José!

640
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,997
José!

641
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,216
José Miguel!

642
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,898
José Miguel!

643
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,532
José!

644
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,914
José Miguel!

645
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,507
José!

646
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,398
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Where is José?</font></i>

647
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,414
What?

648
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,567
Won't you ask me
where we're going?

649
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,336
No.
