1
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,333
Hello?

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,402
I need you to listen
very carefully.

3
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,946
Two men are coming
to kill you.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,655
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They're approaching</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">your car.</font></i>

5
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,198
- Who's this?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- They're coming.</font></i>

6
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,618
Who's this?
Hello?

7
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,720
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Any minute now.</font></i>

8
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,586
Kill him.

9
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,744
What's up?
Are you ready to go?

10
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,805
I'm ready to get out of here.

11
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,729
They haven't come
to pick you up yet.

12
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,831
I can see that too, dude.

13
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:36,194
I have to get back in
to work and--

14
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,171
Go, no one will miss you.

15
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,326
Hey, you can't smoke
here.

16
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,745
Why not?
This is an open space.

17
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,706
No, if you want to
smoke,

18
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,124
you need away from
the door.

19
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,143
So roll me further, bitch.

20
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,186
No.

21
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,117
Male, early 40s,
BP is 70.

22
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,760
Pulse 140.

23
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,662
Weak and thready
at the brachial.

24
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,581
No breaths sounds
on the right side.

25
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,099
Belly is rigid.

26
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,600
Hay several shoots.

27
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,127
- How many entry wounds?
- Four.

28
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,754
Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

29
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,672
Right lung in lower left
quadrant,

30
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,733
no visible exit wounds.

31
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,695
Sorry I'm late, man.

32
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,655
This fucking car

33
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,076
is fucked up, bro.

34
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,437
Damn, brother, look at
you.

35
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,332
That's messed up!

36
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,042
You look good

37
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,027
even now that you're
all beaten up.

38
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,989
So how are you
feeling?

39
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,244
Actually, Tripa,
I'm great.

40
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,951
I don't understand.

41
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,395
I thought things
were going pretty well.

42
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,163
We were becoming a real team

43
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:22,876
No.

44
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,779
A real team
needs other stuff.

45
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,949
Is this about
the temperature setting?

46
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,451
I can assure you
that will not happen

47
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,413
No, it's bigger
than that.

48
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,973
I don't know.

49
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,100
Could you elaborate?

50
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,252
So that I don't do the same
in the future.

51
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,795
Yes, I
could.

52
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,714
But, Guido,
it's nonsense.

53
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,008
Neither of us
would benefit from that.

54
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,777
This conversation

55
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,930
doesn't need to
be prolonged.

56
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,450
You get what I mean?

57
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,036
I set up this entire lab.

58
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,272
You said you liked
the configuration.

59
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:05,127
Yes, I do like it.

60
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,072
For the
most part.

61
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,699
Guido,
you're a fine chemist

62
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,218
with a promising future.

63
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,971
The thing is that I...

64
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,959
I mean, we have
different rhythms.

65
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:26,257
It's as if I'm opera
and you're salsa.

66
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:27,899
Salsa?

67
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,760
And there's nothing bad
with salsa,

68
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,636
on the contrary,
it's fine for me,

69
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,681
it's simply
that I require more...

70
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,908
- Opera. Exactly. That's it.

71
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,373
Bitch, what's up?

72
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,208
Man, this is the bomb!

73
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,212
We'll make real cook now.

74
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:52,491
There's even
a fucking spiral.

75
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,093
My replacement?

76
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,621
Look at this tank,
dude.

77
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,999
How much water does it take?
3,000 gallons?

78
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,336
- What's up, dude?
- Nice to meet you. I'm Guido.

79
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,146
What's up?

80
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,731
We should've ditched that RV

81
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,149
months ago.

82
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,776
It's all shinny up here.

83
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,738
It looks like an aircraft.

84
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,200
Professor, Walter,

85
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,868
I don't mean to be rude but--

86
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,771
Damn, this is
what we deserve.

87
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,690
- Don't we?
- It makes no sense!

88
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,424
All right.

89
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:38,703
That's it.
Excuse.

90
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,140
No, no, no.

91
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:46,353
Víctor...

92
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,130
I can assure you
this is for the best.

93
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,689
I do.

94
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,775
You already know

95
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,010
how much you have
to produce weekly.

96
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,486
Got it?

97
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,987
Walter,

98
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,864
you're the boss here, dude.

99
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,408
What?

100
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,226
Yes, you're a chemist
and all that

101
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,370
so this must be right for you.

102
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,147
Let's get down
to business.

103
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,791
What?

104
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,627
Let's start.

105
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,487
I need you to understand
how all this works.

106
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,989
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

107
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,200
We've only got a couple days
before our first batch is due.

108
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,536
All this equipment
is new for you

109
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,996
and I need to get you
up to speed.

110
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,789
That's fine. I just thought
I'd have

111
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,708
some time to get
to know this and--

112
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,310
What?

113
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,313
How do you...?

114
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,277
I get it!

115
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,281
Have you talked

116
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,199
to your family today?

117
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,243
No, why?

118
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,703
If I were you,

119
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,665
I'd call them, you know?

120
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,519
María.

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,439
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,484
I'm so sorry.

123
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,598
I don't even know
what to say.

124
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,324
How is he?

125
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,352
He's in surgery.
They haven't told us anything.

126
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,413
They gave him four shots.

127
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,844
And Valentina?

128
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,805
I left her with a nanny.

129
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:05,867
How are you, Junior?

130
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,912
Fine.

131
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,918
I need to get some air.

132
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,593
I'll come with you.

133
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:27,414
No, I want to be on
my own.

134
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,068
BP is 80.

135
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,637
Two units of normal
saline.

136
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,639
Right femur's like
a wet bag of gravel.

137
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,141
- See if you get a pulse.
- It's weak.

138
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,143
The left foot
is broken.

139
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,757
Walter.

140
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,556
This is my boss.

141
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,376
- Pleased to meet you. Antonio.
- Pleased to meet you..

142
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,295
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

143
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,301
Can you tell us anything
or any details?

144
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,403
Right now, all we know

145
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,447
is two men ambushed Henry.

146
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,990
They had no ID on them

147
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,810
but we think
they might be Mexican.

148
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,456
Why do you think that?

149
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,609
They have tattoos
of Tapatío cartel.

150
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:43,882
It's like an ID among them.

151
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,717
Why do you think

152
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,093
they attacked Henry?

153
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,637
It could be in relation

154
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,163
to an investigation
Henry was working on.

155
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,417
Maybe it was a general message
to anti-narcotics.

156
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,187
We don't know that.

157
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,147
What happened with these guys?

158
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,149
Henry killed one.

159
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,676
The other one's upstairs
in critical condition

160
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,261
and they're operating
on him.

161
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,863
In this hospital?

162
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,558
Yes. Life is ironic,
don't you think?

163
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:14,145
Anyway, Henry
is tough.

164
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,248
He took them both

165
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,834
even without his gun.

166
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,838
What did you say, Gómez?

167
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,657
How come Henry
didn't have his gun?

168
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,592
Why?

169
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,746
Madam, due to the assault
charge

170
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,181
I had to suspend him.

171
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,793
That means I had
to take away his
weapon.

172
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,877
It's a standard
procedure.
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,771
You're sorry?

174
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,757
If you all had listened
to Henry from the start

175
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,275
and let him arrest

176
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,886
that José Miguel Rosas,
we wouldn't be here!

177
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,723
If he had had his gun,
he'd have defended himself!

178
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,324
María--

179
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,992
What were you doing, Gómez?

180
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,437
You were supposed
to back him up!

181
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,439
Isn't he your partner?
What ere you doing?

182
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,818
Getting ready to go to Mexico
or what?

183
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,194
Is this how you protect
your agents?

184
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,532
You leave them unarmed?
What were you thinking?

185
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,217
Come and sit.

186
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,703
No, I don't want to sit
and I won't shut

187
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,222
until these two go away.

188
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,974
The Anti-narcotics Department

189
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,684
is not welcome here.

190
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,878
Get the hell out of here!
Go away!

191
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,720
And you know what, Walter?
This is also your fault.

192
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,181
Henry would have never heard
from Rosas

193
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,933
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

194
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,644
- María.
- You can't imagine

195
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,522
how much Henry has suffered
because of you.

196
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,249
María, María.

197
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,752
I know you're upset.

198
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,279
You're looking for someone to
blame,

199
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,239
but this isn't
Walter's fault.

200
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,341
Don't blame it on him.

201
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,344
I'm sorry, Walter...

202
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,290
I'm sorry, Walter.

203
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,309
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,027
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

205
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:24,895
Hello!

206
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,939
Eco!

207
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,083

That's
weird.

210
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,745
I'll be
right back.

211
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,797

213
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,134
What the hell
are you thinking?

214
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,320
Why are you calling here?

215
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,556
Tried your cell and it
went straight to voicemail.

216
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,058
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">How am I to get</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">hold of you?</font></i>

217
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,161
You aren't.

218
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,980
We've wasted
twelve hours already.

219
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,915

221
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,127

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">My family comes before</font></i>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">any kind of work.</font></i>

224
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,949
Walter, it's not my

226

227
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,636
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">remember?</font></i>

228
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,872
You tell me
about responsibilities?

00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,332
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Fine. I'll stop talking then</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I rather start doing.</font></i>

230
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,559
I'll just cook on my own.

231
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,962
- You will not do such thing!
- Why not?

232
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,839
You aren't the least familiar
with the equipment.

233
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,883
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, but there must</font>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Hold on, hold on.</font></i>

236
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,473
Don't tell me what
to do, okay?

237
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,935
Stop treating me
like I'm your assistant.

238

240
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,731
José, please, wait.
Be patient.

241
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,566
I'll get there
as soon as I can.

242
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,210
Yes, thank you very much.

243
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,237
Thanks for worrying
and for your prayers.

244
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,031
- Goodbye.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> What?</font></i>

245

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Id your wife there?</font></i>

246
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,467
Yes, thank you very much.

247
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,844
Any kind of spiritual help

248
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,345
is welcome right now.

249
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,414
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Wait, wait, you know</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">what?</font></i>

250
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,959
Don't forget to tell your
fucking brother-in-law

251
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,044
that when he sees the light
at the of the tunnel,

252
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,545
he has to walk
right to it.

253
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,590
Good
luck!

254
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,611
Sure, thanks again.

255
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,599
We're going to have
breakfast.

256
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,976
Do you want to
come with us?

257
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,119
Yes, sure.

258
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,897
Don't you want to know
who called me?

259
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,519
These eggs are really not bad

260
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,731
for a hospital cafeteria.

261
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,550
- Look at that!
- What?

262
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,194
What?

263
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,696
This fork is absolutely filthy.

264
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,407
Disgusting.

265
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,452
Don't you see it's filthy?

266
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,229
María, those are just
water spots.

267
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,830
It's washed.

268
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,749
This is not water, Cielo.

269
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,734
It's dirty
because they haven't washed it.

270
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,461
It's covered in germs

271
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,837
from someone else's mouth.

272
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,298
Aunt, that's clean.

273
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,033
Ours at home aren't
any better.

274
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,343
But this is not your house.

275
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,719
This is a hospital.

276
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,596
They have to follow

277
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,056
some hygiene standards.

278
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,432
But this is the cafeteria,

279
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,476
we're not in the OR--

280
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,253
No, the cafeteria
is part of the hospital.

281
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,854
How could ill people

282
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,439
survive this dead trap?

283
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,050
How?
With this shit?

284
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,969
You can't survive like this,
Cielo!

285
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,699
I survived.

286
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,453
When I had the lobectomy done

287
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,913
I was so scared

288
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,041
I though I was going to die.

289
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,295
I tried to hide it.

290
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,796
But I couldn't stop thinking

291
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,756
that they'd cut me open

292
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,634
as some piece of meat.

293
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,511
When they anesthetized me,

294
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,013
I was sure

295
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,183
I'd not see my family again.

296
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,293
The first thing
I thought when I woke up was:

297
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:19,689
"I'm here."

298
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:24,928
But the best part
was my family was there.

299
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,280
You know why I'm saying this?

300
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,991
I'll tell you something, María.

301
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,853
I'm not half of the man
your husband is

302
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,664
and I survived,

303
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,484
so I have no doubt
he'll make it.

304
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,273
Hello, Juan.

305
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,425
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What the hell</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">is going on there, Gustavo?</font></i>

306
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,677
I was going to ask you
the same question.

307
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,279
You know about my men,

308
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,989
the Salamanca twins?

309
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,267
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I heard that they</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">attacked</font></i>

310
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,102
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">an anti-narcotics</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">agent.</font></i>

311
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,478
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">why.</font></i>

312
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,748
Those guys are nice,

313
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,525
but whenever they do something,
they have a reason for it.

314
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,236
What do you want me
to tell you, Juan?

315
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,571
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The Salamanca</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">wouldn't do such a thing</font></i>

316
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,173
just because.

317
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,550
Someone gave the go ahead.

318
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,052
Are you accusing me?

319
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,470
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm just saying</font></i>

320
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,597
this is quite weird-

321
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,166
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">If you want to,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">come to Colombia,</font></i>

322
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,085
and we'll solve
this confusion together.

323
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,145
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I have things to do here.</font></i>

324
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,022
But listen carefully.

325
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,024
I order you to protect

326
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,802
the Salamanca
that survived

327
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,904
until I send someone there

328
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,931
so that he tells us
what really happened there.

329
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,850
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Understood?</font></i>
- Got you.

330
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,896
When you get so
close to the spine

331
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,773
there's always going
to be

332
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,542
cause for concern.

333
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,447
But it's really too
soon to tell.

334
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,283
And what's next
after surgery?

335
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,703
The post-op and
what we hope will be

336
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,179
his way to recovery.

337
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,555
When can I see him?

338
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,015
Unfortunately not yet.

339
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,600
He's in intensive care

340
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,794
and have to wait
for him to stabilize.

341
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,521
How long will that take?

342
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,939
We don't know.

343
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,483
But we'll let you know

344
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,884
as soon as we
have news.

345
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,220
That's all I have to tell
you for now.

346
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:33,364
Thank you.

347
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,855
María, why don't we
take you home

348
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,457
so that you rest for a while?

349
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:46,836
No, I'm not going anywhere.

350
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,839
Me neither.

351
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,369
Is anyone else dying to brush
their teeth

352
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,471
or is it just me?

353
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,389
What if I ran over to the house

354
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,807
and picked up a few things?

355
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,060
Walter, yes, thanks.

356
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,063
See you later.

357
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,741
Walter, what happened?

358
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,119
We could say he's fine.

359
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:24,565
He got out of surgery
and now we have to wait.

360
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,585
That's good news.

361
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,529
Though the best diagnostic
is for the wrong person.

362
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,423
What do you mean?

363
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,284
That Mexican mother fucker
is recovering

364
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,369
and he got here
even worse than Henry.

365
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,804
Really?

366
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,265
You want to see him?

367
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:46,896
Come.

368
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,851
Come and meet him.

369
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,078
There's that piece of shit.

370
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,862
Hello!

371
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,491
Hello, eco!

372
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,871
About damn time!
I was--

373
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:33,604
Why aren't you cooking?

374
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,287
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mr. Walter Blanco,</font></i>

375

378
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,757
Excuse me, madam?

379
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,366
You have a call on hold
over there.

380
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:05,328
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

381
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,373
- Hello?
- Hey!

382
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,141
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You again?</font></i>

383
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,727
How can I help you,

384
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,270
reverend?

385
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,173
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We've got problems.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Bug ones.</font></i>

386
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,343
Reverend, I'll turn on
my cell phone

387
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,220
so you can call me there,
is that all right?

388
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,894
I told you to wait for me,
to be patient.

389
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,623
I really can't find

390
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,124
another way to tell you this.

391
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,318
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Then don't tell me shit</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and listen to me.</font></i>

392
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,962
That creepy, quiet guy

393
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,464
showed up.

394
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,906
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Gustavo?</font></i>
- No, not the boss.

395
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,618
Apparently I'm not worthy
of meeting him.

396
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,261
The other one.

397
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,538
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The one I'm qualified</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to speak to.</font></i>

398
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,180
Yes, Víctor, what did he say?

399
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,915
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He asked why we weren't</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">producing anything.</font></i>

400
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,476
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And what did you tell him?</font></i>

401
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,794
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What could I tell him?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Nothing.</font></i>

402
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,563
Just bullshit.

403
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,882
- Did he tell you anything else?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- No, he just reminded me</font></i>

404
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,467
we have a quota due
tomorrow.

405
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,469
Walter, do you really
not care

406
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,304
about what might happen
if we don't do this?

407
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,181
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm the one who's</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">here</font></i>

408

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">for them to kill.</font></i>

409
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,851
José, calm down!
Listen to me.

410
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,788
I need you to answer a question.

411
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,164
Do you remember when Tuco

412
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,624
kidnapped us?

413
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,527
Tuco, let's see, no,
no...

414
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,280
You mean that psycho
that was about to kill us?

415
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,115
Of course I remember,
bitch!

416
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,034
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But what does that</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">have to do with this?</font></i>

417
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,536
Just leave irony aside,
will you?

418
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,413
I need you
to remember something.

419
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,248
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Tuco said</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">that someone from Mexico</font></i>

420
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,308
would come for us, remember?

421
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,852
Yes, his cousins.

422
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,462
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But what does that</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">have to do with this?</font></i>

423
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,649
Yes, cousins.

424
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,093
- Are you sure?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Yes, I'm sure.</font></i>

425
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:47,196
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Why do you ask?</font></i>

426
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,794
Hello.

427
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,696
- Hi.
- Any news?

428
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:07,424
No, nothing.

429
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,370
I brought some clothes
for everyone.

430
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,723
María, I didn't know

431
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,124
whose toothbrushes were
whose

432
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,084
so I stopped by
and bought some for all.

433
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,169
- Thanks.
- There's paste...

434
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,756
- Whatever you need.
- I'm going to wash my face.

435
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,901
I need to wake up.

436
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,762
- Come with me?
- Yes.

437
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:36,729
Look, the book
you asked me for.

438
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,122
Is this yours?

439
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,359
No, the uncle
gave it to me.

440
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,736
And what is it
about?

441
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,129
It's about Pablo Escobar

442
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,949
and how much
he damaged this country.

443
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,509
I'd all be different here

444
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:55,848
if drug dealers didn't exist.

445
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:58,183
Yes, well...

446
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,043
In fact it's much more
complex

447
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,562
than what you think

448
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,921
because it
involves--

449
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:08,110
It's a pity that here...

450
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,220
what bad guys do
is most known

451
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,197
than what a lot of good people

452
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:16,018
like the uncle do,
don't you think?

453
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,029
Give me a second.
I'll be right back.

454
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,077
No, Gustavo,
we're working hard.

455
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,996
I can assure
you that.

456
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,415
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So I can expect</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">delivery by tomorrow</font></i>

457
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,100
as scheduled.

458
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,003
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, that will be</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">hard because...</font></i>

459
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,772
Well, I had a problem

460
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,216
and we're not going to be able
to keep our schedule,

461
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,944
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but not for luck of trying.</font></i>

462
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,138
Is there anything I should know,
Walter?

463
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,449
Yes, sir.

464
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,267
Well, to be completely
honest with you,

465
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:58,786
Guido screwed us up.

466
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,773
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I mean, not on purpose.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">He made a mistake.</font></i>

467
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,375
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That set us way back.</font></i>

468
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,586
Besides, I've been out

469
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:12,867
running some technical
errands to catch up.

470
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,994
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly.

471
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,138
So I had to...

472
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,999
Well, it's all very
technical and boring.

473
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,835
It's not worth
explaining it.

474
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,253
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But I can assure you,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Gustavo,</font></i>

475
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,522
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">that we'll do things right</font></i>

476
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,006
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and we'll work</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">twice as needed,</font></i>

477
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,675
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">even on the weekend</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">if it's necessary,</font></i>

478
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,234
but we'll do our part.

479
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,597
I promise next week
we'll have 400 pounds.

480
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,600
- I have your word on that?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Absolutely.</font></i>

481
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,869
I promise.

482
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,162
Fine.

483
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,165
Thanks for the update, Walter.

484
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,519
What's
up?

485
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,981
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

486
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,316
I need to control this rat
all the time,

487
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,835
if not, I don't feel safe.

488
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,503
I get you.

489
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,047
Is there any news?

490
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,825
No, nothing.
I'm just clearing out my head.

491
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,551
How's the family?

492
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,011
Fine, they're fine.

493
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,913
They're trying
to be calm.

494
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,290
Yes, there's nothing else
you can do.

495
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,808
Yes, it's just that not knowing

496
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,727
what's going to happen,

497
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:50,798
not having any news,
the waiting is unbearable.

498
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,442
So what?

499
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,885
You know anything
about the guy that died?

500
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,095
What did they want?
Where were they from?

501
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,722
We're investigating but
there's nothing so far.

502
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,198
We'll find out,

503
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,161
I'm sure.

504
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:08,607
Gómez, do you think
there're others?

505
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,027
I don't
know.

506
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,628
But no one

507
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,488
will ever get
near Henry again.

508
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,282
You know what I
want?

509
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,159
Walk in there
and shoot that bastard

510
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,636
right in the head.

511
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,512
That's it.

512
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,264
Me too.

513
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,853
Excuse me.

514
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,689
Hello?

515
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:35,901
Yes, I'll be right there.

516
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,096
You know Pollos
Hermanos?

517
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,364
Yes.

518
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,475
The owner is a big
booster for the agency

519
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,977
and when he heard what
happened to Henry,

520
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,912
he brought us all food.

521
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,039
That's wonderful.

522
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:53,652
He brought it himself.
Let's go.

523
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,713
Yes, I'll be right there.

524
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,069
It's delicious!

525
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,035
Come, please, Walter.

526
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,955
I want you to meet Mr. Gustavo.

527
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,874
He offered

528
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,876
50 million pesos

529
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,919
on any information

530
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:38,338
to clear Henry's case.

531
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,757
Thank you very much.

532
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:43,760
That will help a lot.

533
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,846
That's very generous of you.

534
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,707
No, please,
you don't need to say that.

535
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,208
I only wish
I could do more.

536
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,852
No, please.

537
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,896
This money will help us

538
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,172
find more details
on the investigation.

539
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,591
I'm really shocked
about this case

540
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,137
because I actually met
agent Navarro.

541
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,846
- Really?
- Sure

542
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,640
His company,
Los Pollos Hermanos,

543
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,784
sponsored the cop marathon.

544
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:12,148
Yes, I talked for
a few minutes with Henry.

545
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:15,151
We even talked about you,
Walter.

546
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,752
Did you?

547
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:20,572
He was preparing a collection
for your treatment.

548
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:24,493
We talked briefly
about your health problems.

549
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,636
I hope you're better now.

550
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,180
Yes, yes.

551
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,624
I'm really well
and getting better.

552
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,977
I'm glad to hear that.

553
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,755
He was really
worried.

554
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,382
It was clear to me how
deeply he cares for you.

555
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:44,572
They're practically brothers.

556
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,407
I've taken enough of your time.

557
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,242
I'll be following the news.

558
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,060
Excuse me.
Good night.

559
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,188
- Goodbye. Thanks.
- Let me walk you out.

560
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,773
No, it's not
necessary.

561
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,776
- Excuse me.
- Go.

562
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:04,366
Well, at least
that's some good news.

563
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,910
I'm going to the toilet.
Excuse me.

564
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,788
- It's tasty, isn't it?
- Delicious!

565
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,110
How's everything going, guys?

566
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,570
It's all right, sir.

567
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,989
Thanks for the chicken.

568
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,390
It was delicious,
wasn't it, guys?

569
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,100
I'm glad I can help you
with something.

570
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,660
Good night.

571
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,203
Mr. Gustavo...

572
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,830
Yes?

573
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,940
I just wanted to thank you
again in person

574
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,401
for everything you're doing
for my family.

575
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,611
It's my pleasure.
Good night.

576
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,631
And I wanted to ask you

577
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,408
if we could speak
for just a moment.

578
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,379
You knew my brother-in-law
was in anti-narcotics.

579
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,148
I investigate everyone

580
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,984
with whom I do business, Walter.

581
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,321
What careful man wouldn't?

582
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,447
Sure.

583
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,616
I can assure you Henry

584
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:16,772
is no problem for the
business not for us.

585
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,041
You being here...

586
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,360
Is this some sort
of message?

587
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,131
I'm supporting my community.

588
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:30,410
I hide in plain sight,
same as you.

589
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,123
- Anything else?
- Yes.

590
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:37,417
I don't understand this
attack on my brother-in-law.

591
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,519
I don't know what it means.

592
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:44,133
If you know something,
please, give me a clue.

593
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,009
I fear for my
family.

594
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:49,012
Don't worry about your family,
Walter.

595
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,348
I am told
the assassin that survived

596
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,491
is gravely injured.

597
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:58,038
It's doubtful he'll live.

598
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,082
Really?

599
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:03,652
I was told he was
recovering.

600
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,571
Now thank me
and shake my hand.

601
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,494
Mr Gustavo,
thanks again

602
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,954
for everything you're
doing.

603
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,413
Thank you and Pollos
Hermanos.

604
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,932
It's my pleasure, Walter.

605
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:21,978
Good night.

606
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,367
One, two, three.

607
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,412
One, two, three!

608
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,871
Patient is in asystole.

609
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,040
Continuing chest compressions.

610
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,251
One, two, three!

611
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,877
Give me a liter of saline.

612
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,505
One, two, three.

613
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,967
One, two, three!

614
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,719
One, two, three...

615
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,889
One, two, three!

616
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,557
He's dead.

617
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,519
9:44.

618
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,656
Gustavo, you're a son
of a bitch.

619
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,910
I have Federals
surrounding my house

620
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,870
and you're behind all this,
bastard.

621
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,806
Why would I do this?

622
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,499
Because you're
the only one who knew

623
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,519
I was at my house.

624
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,521
But I got you, son of a bitch.

625
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,297
You're doing all this
to be on your own

626
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,258
because we don't let you
cook meth, right?

627
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:51,760
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I think you're under lots</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of pressure, Juan.</font></i>

628
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,054
Call me back when you
see things more clearly.

629
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,947
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Sure we'll talk, fucker.</font></i>

630
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,366
Sure we'll talk.

631
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,950
I want you to know

632
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,644
there's no fucking prison
in Mexico than can stop me.

633
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,064
We'll pay you a visit,
son of a bitch.

634
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,915
Police, hand up!

635
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,960
Don't move!

636
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,921
All right, all right.

637
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,923
Calm down.
