1
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,293
Bro, this is less of the half

2
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,379
of what we need.

3
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,616
This is all the money
I have in the world.

4
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,719
At least I have something.

5
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,178
You are the drug dealer here.

6
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,959
I don't know,
try to negotiate.

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,977
Hey, wait.

8
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,770
Why are you doing this?

9
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,522
And tell me the truth.

10
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,982
Why are you doing this?

11
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,651
Because of the money, brother.

12
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,320
Exactly!

13
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,323
Don't give me that, man.

14
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,410
A man like you,

15
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:03,314
looking like a seminarian
and who is 60.

16
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,817
Wakes up one day
and decides to change his path?

17
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,235
50.
I'm 50.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,256
50, 60, same shit.

19
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,717
Look, bro...

20
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,720
If you lost it...

21
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,723
if you are depressed...

22
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,183
you have to tell me

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,643
because that will concern me.

24
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,046
Look, I know exactly
what we are doing.

25
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,966
So, if you know
what you are doing,

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,361
why are you doing it?

27
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,180
Because I finally
opened my eyes.

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,913
This shit, bro!

29
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,982
Very good, man!
Do it!

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,042
Those beauties are yours!

31
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,670
Ha, ha, ha!

32
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,741
Hey, hey, hey!
I have these two fine ladies

33
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,010
and they want to participate.

34
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,012
Two ladies, Gordo?

35
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,513
I only see one!

36
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,082
Are we going to please them
or what?

37
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,767
We have the funds, right?

38
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,461
You do what you want
because we have the funds, bro.

39
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,171
Bring me two bottles
of champagne,

40
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,773
we have the money for that.

41
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,257
And I don't want
that dispensable shit.

42
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:15,511
I want the tall, skinny glasses.
That's what James Bond drinks.

43
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,222
Have you seen
James Bond's movies?

44
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,700
This is the life we deserve.

45
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,161
I have a question.

46
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,689
Where did he get
all this money?

47
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:30,609
Yes, man.
Where did you get the money?

48
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,753
What if I tell you

49
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,156
that some ex teacher of mine
gave it to me?

50
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,134
Just like that?

51
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,137
Are you a gay hooker or what?

52
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,622
It's a long story to tell,
but I will tell it to you later

53
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,542
because now I'm busy
being heterosexual.

54
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,003
Me too!
I'm flying, man!

55
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,091
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Is this a toast?

56
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,301
Yes, because we
are going to live forever!

57
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,903
Yes!

58
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,657
Photo, bro!

59
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,832
Bros!

60
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,672
Man, this was...

61
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,226
This was amazing.

62
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,775
Good morning.

63
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,072
No, bro.

64
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,742
Gordo, I'm fucked up!

65
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,161
I only have 1100 dollars.

66
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:32,290
Jose, what do you mean?

67
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,441
What are you talking about?
That's good money!

68
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,668
You are paranoid.

69
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,530
- Let's go have breakfast.
- I'm not paranoid, man!

70
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:43,367
I was supposed to buy
an RV for today with that money!

71
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,745
- An RV?
- No!

72
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,555
I have to leave town

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,515
or change my identity.

74
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,143
He's blackmailing me.

75
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,378
The guy is crazy,
I tell you that.

76
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,965
Jose...
Do you need an RV?

77
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,234
I have one for you!

78
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,568
For 1100 dollars, Gordo?

79
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,612
Right on.

80
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,226
- Really, Gordo?
- For real.

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,395
Can you get an RV
for 1100 dollars now?

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,316
Give me the money,
I'll be right back.

83
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,986
Don't leave me
without breakfast.

84
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,298
Gordo, we'll see.

85
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,710
Juan Carlos, is that you?

86
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,152
What's up, Gordo?
Where were you?

87
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,694
And why don't you
answer your cell phone?

88
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,339
I was driving your RV.

89
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,049
Here you have it.

90
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,034
What RV are you talking about?
This is a bus, Gordo.

91
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,552
Not an RV, bro.

92
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,889
Jose, they are the same shit.

93
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,125
And you got it
for 1100 dollars?

94
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,684
My cousin owns it.

95
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,812
This is a family issue.

96
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,857
Okay, Gordo.

97
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,739
Don't be so pleased, bro.

98
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,434
I have just saved your life
and you don't even notice.

99
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,204
No, bro, the thing is

100
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,415
that I have another problem.

101
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,625
I was supposed to buy the RV

102
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,610
or the bus,
I don't know what that is,

103
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,254
and also fix it.

104
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,073
But I don't have
any money left.

105
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,716
Relax, brother,

106
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,161
because here is your friend,
Gordo.

107
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,372
Maybe I can lend you
some money.

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,456
Really, Gordo?
How much money?

109
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,350
1100 dollars?

110
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,481
1100 dollars.

111
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,425
Do you think
that will be enough, bro?

112
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,527
I have another cousin

113
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,863
who can do a cheap work on it.

114
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,099
So, do you understand
what I need?

115
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,993
Of course I do,

116
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,353
that's why my cousin
brought you here.

117
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,688
I need it to be
a good work, man.

118
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,666
Well, this is the plan.

119
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,027
Here, below the sink,
you will have a tap.

120
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,405
And here, next to the driver,
you will have the outlets.

121
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,324
You will have to tell me
how many of them you need.

122
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,717
In the center, up here,

123
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,704
we will make a hole,
a skylight for air circulation.

124
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,348
Right.

125
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,333
And you have to take
all those seats out

126
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,268
so we have more space.

127
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,255
It is very important
that this is finished today.

128
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,173
- Okay?
- You will have it done today.

129
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,050
And I will also put
a little table

130
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,152
so you have more room inside.

131
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,096
Can you add another table
in there?

132
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,697
Of course!

133
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,199
If you have the money for it,

134
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,435
I can make an helicopter
from a stove.

135
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,910
Right, cousin?

136
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,915
And here you have

137
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,334
all used spare parts, right?

138
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,085
What are you talking about?

139
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,238
All of our spare parts
are new, original
and factory made.

140
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:53,425
Yeah, right. It shows.

141
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:20,411
Wow!

142
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:23,247
I love this floor.

143
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,374
Can you control the temperature?

144
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,610
Yes, there should be a switch
right next to the mirror.

145
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,589
Wow!

146
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,908
This is the most amazing
invention ever.

147
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,470
I didn't know it.

148
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:41,973
It's not very common.

149
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,518
I had it in Germany.

150
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,854
My contractor talked me into it.

151
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,840
- And here it is.
- Yes.

152
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,801
It seemed to be too much,
but I tried it,

153
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:58,723
I liked it
and I had to have it.

154
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,060
I can never find anything
in this case.

155
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,937
You could leave
a few things here.

156
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:31,923
Tell your father
to come downstairs.

157
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,067
Yes, mom.

158
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,709
Dad?

159
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,755
Dad.

160
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,341
Yes, tell me.

161
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,203
Come to have lunch,
mom's asking.

162
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,474
Yes, I'll be right there.

163
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm telling you.
I don't know.

164
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,437
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, right, you don't know.</font></i>

165
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,691
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Don't you listen to me?</font></i>

166
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,108
Give me the phone.

167
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,818
Like you didn't make

168
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,237
some deal behind my back

169
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,366
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Correct. I did not.</font></i>

170
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,351
I was in my house,
I went to the street,

171
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,119
minding my own business,

172
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,330
when suddenly the man

173
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,708
threw a bag of money on me.

174
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:34,319
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

175
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,879
Let me talk to him.

176
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,422
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I owe you?</font></i>

177
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,550
I owe you nothing!

178
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,077
And I will get
to the bottom of this, trust me.

179
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,512
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Trust you?</font></i>

180
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,096
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, thanks, teacher.</font></i>

181
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,624
Why didn't you tell me that
from the beginning?

182
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,433
I should have known.

183
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,876
Do you want to talk
about trust, José?

184
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,478
Talk, bro.

185
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,146
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Let's talk about trust.</font></i>

186
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,674
I told you
not to cook my formula,

187
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,609
and what did you do?

188
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,221
I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it isn't yours.

189
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,974
It's ours.
Plural, bitch.

190
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,409
You did not have my permission.

191
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,661
All I know

192
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,080
is that I have half of the money

193
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,498
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and you have the rest, bitch.</font></i>

194
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,358
Escalating.
You're escalating.

195
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,527
My meth, my money.
And listen me carefully.

196
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:17,779
I will be a one-man
glass factory.

197
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,131
I will be the boss

198
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,576
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I will rock that RV</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">24 hours a day.</font></i>

199
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,883
What?

200
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,885
It's closed, bro.

201
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,472
I can't see a damn thing.

202
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,207
There is no one in that RV.
Nothing.

203
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,143
There's no cook.

204
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,213
- Nothing.
- There is someone inside.

205
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:20,509
Gómez, believe me,
there is somebody inside.

206
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,236
Let's do something.

207
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,389
We come back later,
with a warrant.

208
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:30,394
- To do things right.
- We have no time, bro.

209
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,939
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

210
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,084
I have to find a way.

211
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,087
Find a way.

212
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:46,009
Hey, Henry, come here!

213
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,052
Shit!

214
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,074
There is somebody up there!

215
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,352
You bastard!
Pervert!

216
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,287
No, no, no.

217
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,706
What are you doing there?

218
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,065
- No, no, no!
- Come down, pig!

219
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,542
Listen, brother.

220
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,585
This is not what you think.

221
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,030
What are you doing?
Come down, if you dare.

222
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,199
What do you want?
I mean it.

223
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,718
Here I have something for you.

224
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,135
I'm really sorry.

225
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,679
I hope you understand.

226
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,664
- Sorry, agent.
- This is my job.

227
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,626
- Right.
- Excuse me.

228
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,785
Did he have something for you?

229
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,037
Nice.

230
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,455
What did you find out?

231
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,041
He's a good guy, man.

232
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,501
The worst thing he has done

233
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,880
was cheating on his wife.

234
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,074
Three RV's, one van,
everything's right.

235
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:13,955
He's a good catch.
Don't let him go.

236
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,875
There is another RV
I want to check out.

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,003
- Let's go.
- No.

238
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,799
- I have to go home.
- Why? Will your wife beat you?

239
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:31,181
- I have to pack.

240
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,402
- What?

241
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,281
- Where are you going?

242
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,992
That's it, bro.

243
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,769
I'll go to Mexico
for some training.

244
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,545
Nice.

245
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,276
Honey, are you home?

246
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,782
Henry?

247
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,423
Honey?

248
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,681
Can I come in?

249
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,474
Hi, babe.

250
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,892
How did it go last night?

251
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,062
Did you catch the RV guy?

252
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,105
No.

253
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,289
Do you want some breakfast?

254
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,208
I can cook you some eggs.

255
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,197
No, I'm heading back
to the office after the shower.

256
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,883
But you worked all night.

257
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,384
Get some sleep.

258
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,661
Those RV's
aren't going anywhere.

259
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,221
They're vehicles, María.

260
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,250
They transport people,
that's what they do.

261
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,063
You know what I mean.

262
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,466
I spoke to Blanca.
She told me about Gómez.

263
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,484
So?

264
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,262
- What do you think about that?
- Nothing.

265
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,322
I turned it down, right?

266
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,617
End of story.

267
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,578
Good, I'm relieved.

268
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:45,665
María, I can't leave right now.

269
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,192
I'm deep into this investigation
and I need more time.

270
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,278
I had to choose
between Mexico and Colombia.

271
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,838
I chose Colombia.

272
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,698
- Done?
- Of course.

273
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,160
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

274
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,178
You don't have to go

275
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,056
through this alone.

276
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,642
María, I made a decision.

277
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,796
I'm fine,
I'm not going through anything.

278
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,691
I'm just doing my job.

279
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,929
- But I would like--
- What would you like, María?

280
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,406
A five stars hotel in Acapulco?

281
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,491
Is that what you deserve, María?

282
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,786
You didn't let me finish.

283
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,939
I was going to say
that I would like to have
a better communication with you.

284
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,274
I'm worried about you,
I'm worried about you career--

285
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,529
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

286
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,422
All right.

287
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,950
I only want to know
if you are happy
with your decision.

288
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,593
I want to know

289
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,037
if you don't want
to go back there.

290
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,722
I'm not blaming you, but--

291
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,432
María, María.

292
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,350
Aren't you late for work?

293
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,311
I just wanted to know that.

294
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,188
After what happened,

295
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,090
it would make sense
that you don't want to go back.

296
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,093
Mexico doesn't have
a damn thing to do with it,
María.

297
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,262
I'm into some important stuff
right here, in Bogotá!

298
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,224
And that's the most important
thing to me, understood?

299
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,268
And I would really appreciate it
if you stop judging me.

300
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,704
Because all I get from you,

301
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,148
María, are these
bullshit accusations!

302
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,126
And if everyone thinks

303
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,237
I'm jerking off
on this thing in Bogotá,

304
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,423
I don't care, María.

305
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,967
You know why?

306
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:23,747
Because I know
I am into something!

307
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,891
Understood?

308
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,978
María?

309
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,358
What exactly is this?

310
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,678
I'll tell you
what I think it is.

311
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,906
A ploy to get me cooking again.

312
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,784
And an obvious one at that.

313
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,995
How do you mean?

314
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,732
As if I would seriously believe
you would hire an addict.

315
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,127
José Miguel Rosas, please!

316
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,462
You vouched for him previously.

317
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,257
I took you at your word.

318
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,159
- I did that.
- No!

319
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,579
José Miguel was capable
of working under my supervision.

320
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,666
Trusting him
with a solo venture,
that's quite another matter.

321
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,045
How he could possibly produce
anything other
than a mediocre product at best.

322
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,148
I am told his product

323
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:19,236
was more or less consistent

324
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,639
with the quality
I had come to expect.

325
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,991
More or less?

326
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,978
More or less, Gustavo?
Really?

327
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,106
Boy, don't you think
that is setting the bar low?

328
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,485
Except you don't set
the bar low.

329
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,696
You don't accept a low level.
Do you?

330
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,658
Therefore, what conclusion
am I left to draw?

331
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,702
That you believe
I'm being selfish.

332
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm being selfish
about my own formula.

333
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,183
Some sort of overweening pride.

334
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,210
You think it overwhelms
my judgement.

335
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:56,006
- And it doesn't?
- Absolutely not.

336
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,732
I simply respect the chemistry.

337
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,777
The chemistry must be respected.

338
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:07,391
I apologize
for being so transparent.

339
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,786
Walter.

340
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:14,457
Would you take a drive with me?

341
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,375
I'd like to show you something.

342
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,617
Hi, is everything okay?

343
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,729
She's already finished
an entire bottle
and fell asleep.

344
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,289
But I was thinking I'd give her

345
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,958
another when she wakes up.

346
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,418
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, absolutely.</font></i>

347
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,212
Fatten that baby up.

348
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,340
Will do.

349
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,591
Was that it?

350
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,410
So where are you?
Are you at work?

351
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,971
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, I'm at work.</font></i>

352
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,681
I shouldn't be much longer.

353
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,183
Is that okay?

354
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,711
You know I love
my little princess.

355
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,630
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years,
as far as I'm concerned.

356
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,902
Great, thanks.

357
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,636
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Are you sure you're okay?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">What is it?</font></i>

358
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,782
It's Henry.

359
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,534
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry?</font></i>

360
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,062
- What about him?
-<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> I don't know.</font></i>

361
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,980
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

362
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,233
He doesn't talk to me
since he came from Mexico.

363
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,320
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">God knows he went</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">through a lot down there.</font></i>

364
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,673
Blood everywhere.

365
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,825
I don't want
to think about it.

366
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,288
Last week, Mexico
said they want him back.

367
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,264
So?

368
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,266
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's not going. Gomez will go.</font></i>

369
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,019
I don't know.

370
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,271
Well, he's certainly

371
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,524
a lot safer here, isn't he?

372
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,318
Of course, and I want him safe.

373
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,070
I want him calm.

374
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:10,114
But I can't tell what he wants.

375
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,682
I don't know what is happening
with him.

376
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,159
He hardly even comes home.

377
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,618
He leaves really early

378
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,748
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and comes late.</font></i>

379
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,958
He's not the same, Cielo.

380
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:24,445
It's like something's
eating him away from inside.

381
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,239
Facing death,
it changes a person.

382
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,342
But...

383
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,886
You must know it.

384
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,665
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I guess you've noticed</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">a change in Walt.</font></i>

385
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,010
This way. Come with me.

386
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,449
What is this?

387
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:20,077
Your new lab.

388
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,704
If you want it.

389
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:39,180
This is truly amazing.

390
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,598
This reaction vessel

391
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:44,227
has to be 1200 liters!

392
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,230
Unbelievable.

393
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,406
Thorium oxide as catalyst basis.

394
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,450
Interesting.

395
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,456
This is a perfect design.

396
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,529
How did you know
how to put this all together?

397
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:15,592
I had excellent help.

398
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,553
As will you.

399
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,706
Quite a lot of planning
went into this.

400
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,309
I would say so.

401
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,353
The laundry upstairs,

402
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,688
I've owned it for years.

403
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,383
It receives large chemical
deliveries on a weekly basis,

404
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,528
detergents and such.

405
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,181
There is nothing
suspicious about it

406
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,074
and my employees,

407
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,451
to be sure, are well-trained,

408
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,703
trustworthy.

409
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,122
The filtration system

410
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,875
is state of the art.

411
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,237
It will vent nothing but clean,
odorless steam

412
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,755
just as the laundry does

413
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,760
and through the same stacks.

414
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,762
I need 200 pounds per week

415
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,623
to make this
economically viable.

416
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,726
You would choose your own hours,

417
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,087
of course come and go
as you please

418
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:14,525
so long as the quota is met.

419
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,235
Sorry.

420
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,992
The answer is still no.

421
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,535
Look...

422
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,355
I have made a series
of very bad decisions

423
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,124
and I can't make another one.

424
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,193
Why did you make
those decisions?

425
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,629
For the good of my family.

426
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,549
Then they weren't bad decisions.

427
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,951
What does a man have to do,
Walter?

428
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,388
A man provides for his family.

429
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:47,224
This cost me my family.

430
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,643
When you have children,

431
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,103
you always have family, Walter.

432
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,048
They will always be your
priority, your responsibility.

433
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,567
That's why a man...

434
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,777
a real man...

435
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,780
provides for his family.

436
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,476
And he does it even when he's
not appreciated, respected

437
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,204
or even loved.

438
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:12,442
He simply bears up
and does it. Period.

439
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,921
Any chance we could grab
a quick bite?

440
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:38,342
Pizza place around the corner's
pretty good.

441
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:43,072
I really have to head home.

442
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,891
All right.
Next time, then.

443
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,171
We were together

444
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,925
and she told me she liked sushi.

445
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,595
And I said it was okay with me

446
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,970
because she was really pretty.

447
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,751
I couldn't think
of anything else!

448
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,896
I'm a stupid.

449
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,118
Can I be excused?

450
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,398
To do homework
or to play video games?

451
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,126
Both things.

452
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,502
Okay.

453
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:41,004
Go.

454
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,823
You want to take her?

455
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,074
Yes.

456
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,790
Thanks. Come here.

457
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,834
Hi!

458
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,439
Half of an RV

459
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,149
in the backyard of a house?

460
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,109
No, that's useless, bro.

461
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,736
All right.

462
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,447
Vicky!

463
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,492
Come here, help me, please.

464
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,894
Because I couldn't find
anything.

465
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,773
But the people in the Transit
Office have already sent

466
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,691
the information on all the buses
they have before 1990.

467
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,002
Could you check it again?

468
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,796
Maybe you missed something.

469
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,740
- Help me, please.
- Does it have to be now?

470
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,426
Please.

471
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,843
Can I do it after the party?

472
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,804
I'm dead in the water here.

473
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,015
Okay, I'll check.

474
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,460
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

475
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,025
I'm going to miss you all.

476
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,944
Thank you, thank you very much.

477
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,112
Thanks to all of you.

478
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,447
Who made this cake?

479
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,949
Who?

480
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,453
Who's going to cut it?

481
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,121
Who's going to put his finger?

482
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,875
So, Gómez?

483
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,360
Time for the little bird
to fly the nest.

484
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,504
The right guy for the job.

485
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,698
I only want to tell
you one thing.

486
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,618
Be careful
with the chili peppers.

487
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,553
Bro, I know you well

488
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,997
and I know you are weak
down there,

489
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,808
so if you eat one of those,

490
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,685
you will start...

491
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:13,808
Come here.
Come here, brother.

492
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,034
Here.

493
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:20,063
- What is this?
- Jesús Malverde.

494
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,900
He's the boss of all the drug
dealers there in Mexico.

495
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,419
Know your enemy and all.

496
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,463
He has many things there.

497
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,549
You will know.

498
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,886
Thanks.

499
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,805
The situation there is tough.

500
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,685
But don't forget it.

501
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:44,354
You are tougher, bro.

502
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,983
So...

503
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,901
Fight the good fight, brother.

504
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:52,070
Thanks, bro.

505
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,741
Henry, you know...

506
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,200
You know what you mean to me.

507
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,853
- My brother.
- Sure.

508
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,872
So, what are you drinking?

509
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,900
Just some soda?
I can't believe it.

510
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,710
I will fix this.

511
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,211
Dear!

512
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,922
Boss, don't leave.

513
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,492
Your hunch was right.
One more RV.

514
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,327
Transit said the registration
wasn't renewed,

515
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,413
but then they realized
it was never filed
as non-operational or destroyed.

516
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,416
And it was also used
for transporting students.

517
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,726
Lieutenant Rada!

518
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,587
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

519
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,908
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

520
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,677
Damn it!

521
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:42,305
It's like I'm paralyzed.

522
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,708
Like if I take a step
in any direction

523
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,545
I'm going to make
a spectacular mistake.

524
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,689
God.

525
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,358
Anyway, breaking news...

526
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,679
I am sleeping with my boss
and I don't know why.

527
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,305
That's a lie.
I do know why.

528
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,825
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

529
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,328
He's a really good person,

530
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:08,649
but it's not like we're ever
going to have something serious.

531
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,530
And I didn't tell it
to anybody.

532
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,132
Unbelievable!

533
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,158
And everyone seems to think
that I am...

534
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,827
My sister.
My own sister.

535
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,496
My brother-in-law.
My teenage son.

536
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,457
All of them think
that I'm an evil bitch

537
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,017
that makes Walter suffer.

538
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,419
That I batter him
without any reason.

539
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,772
And I know that you told me

540
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,133
to tell them the truth,
everything about Walter,

541
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,693
but I can't.

542
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,597
I can't!
How could I?

543
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,116
And you know what?

544
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,951
This man that I'm seeing,

545
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,352
I'm doing it
to make Walter leave me.

546
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,689
I just want
that Walter leaves me.

547
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,375
But I have to admit

548
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,503
that I...

549
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:57,406
when I'm with him,
with the other man,

550
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,717
I feel so...

551
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:04,304
I don't know.

552
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,875
It is the only thing in my
day where I don't feel like
I'm drowning.

553
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,061
I feel free with him.

554
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:15,925
So he knows
about this other man?

555
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,802
- Yes.
- So then he'll sign?

556
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,888
Walter says
he's not going anywhere.

557
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,656
Walter is staying.

558
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,116
Because he's a genius.

559
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,493
He's a fucking genius!

560
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,455
He keeps money in the house.

561
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,499
How much money?

562
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,317
I don't know.
I didn't count it.

563
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:37,420
But it's a heavy bag.

564
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:40,757
It would make you think again.

565
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,259
Cielo...

566
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,635
Are you asking my permission

567
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,054
to spend this money?

568
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,123
No, no, God.
No.

569
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,226
I just...

570
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,712
I'm just trying
to talk it through.

571
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,423
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified

572
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,551
and twice the price
of a therapist.

573
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,862
And this situation is so clear

574
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,682
that we don't have anything
to discuss.

575
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,201
I'm just saying, you know?

576
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,870
We have a history.

577
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,748
He's the father of my children.

578
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:16,610
And what he did,
he did it for the family.

579
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,196
I'm sorry,
but he's manipulating you.

580
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,992
He gave you an huge load
that you don't deserve.

581
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,843
Maybe.

582
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,720
I want to tell you something,

583
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,597
but I apologize beforehand.

584
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,791
You are a fool to stay
in that house one minute longer.

585
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,502
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

586
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,587
If you stay there, you are
an accessory after the fact.

587
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:36,856
And that will make you guilty.

588
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,356
You and your children

589
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,234
could lose everything you own.

590
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,860
And why?

591
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,238
All courtesy of this criminal

592
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,241
you refuse to divorce.

593
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,620
I didn't marry a criminal.

594
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,039
Well, you're married to one now.

595
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,498
For our next meeting,

596
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,000
I'll have all the documents

597
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:59,486
for you to have
a good pension,

598
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:06,035
although they seize
that money from him.

599
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,180
I think we won't meet again.

600
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:14,584
Cielo, don't you want
to do this?

601
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,270
I think...

602
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,797
that I'm good
only with the divorce papers.

603
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,690
I really appreciate it.

604
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:24,736
Thanks.

605
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,964
Send him in, Panchita.

606
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,674
Good to see you.

607
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,219
Please, have a seat here.

608
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:31,636
Mr. Rosas...

609
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,055
You're late.

610
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,974
Good.

611
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,018
Gentlemen, if we could

612
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,253
come to some accommodation
here now.

613
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,522
There's always a way

614
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,025
to oil everyone's lock.

615
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,137
This young man is prepared
to offer you

616
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:51,223
a sweetheart of a deal
for doing precisely nothing.

617
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,516
- Really?
- Really.

618
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,393
Ten percent
of all future profits

619
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,496
from his solo venture.

620
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,916
That's money you get paid

621
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:03,835
for walking down to the mailbox.

622
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,963
Consider it a gesture of respect

623
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,074
for your valuable contribution
to the business this far.

624
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,994
I'm sure you'll agree
that's fair.

625
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,912
That's charity,
is what that is.

626
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,098
I do all the work.

627
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,708
You sit around on your fat ass
judging people.

628
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,436
You son of a bitch.

629
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,838
Listen, listen, please,
what did we say about your tone?

630
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,024
Quiet, quiet.

631
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,650
I continue.

632
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,762
So there's that, but then
there's one small detail.

633
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,932
Clearly a mistake was made on
the part of our mutual associate

634
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,784
when he paid you

635
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,702
half of José Miguel earnings.

636
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,996
He must not have realized

637
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,732
that you two had come
to a parting of the ways.

638
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,090
It belongs to you.

639
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,908
You're damn right
it belongs to me.

640
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,139
Ha! Great!

641
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,932
I knew I could trust you.

642
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,834
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice.

643
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,395
Beautiful.

644
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,187
I'm almost crying.

645
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:05,897
Enjoy it.

646
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,275
Spend it in good health.

647
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,818
That is the last money

648
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:14,390
you'll ever earn
in this business.

649
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,766
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

650
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:19,269
Well, I hate to break it to you,
José Miguel,

651
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,330
but our mutual associate

652
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:25,083
was only using you to get to me.

653
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,128
What are you talking about?

654
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,656
See, he needs someone
with expertise.

655
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,701
Someone who knows
what he's doing.

656
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:39,181
In other words, he needs me.

657
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,917
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

658
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,877
Let's see,
how should I put this?

659
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,503
Because I need you
to understand it.

660
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,006
I'm in.
You're out.

661
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,692
Hey, Walter!

662
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,861
Hold on there.

663
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,946
What was the offer, exactly?

664
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,614
If I may ask, of course.

665
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,726
It's three million
for three months of my time.

666
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,146
You're going to need
that money laundered.

667
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:04,706
What was our deal before?

668
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,525
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

669
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,961
Let's settle on an even 15.

670
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,464
That's a nice round number.

671
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,965
Five percent.

672
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,425
Hey, hey, hey!

673
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:18,011
Fourteen's fair.

674
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,971
Five.

675
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,140
Thirteen is good enough.

676
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,809
Five per cent.

677
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,854
Twelve, for old times' sake.

678
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,881
- Five per cent.
- No, no, hold on.

679
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,802
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

680
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,678
Ten per cent?
Ten per cent.

681
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:39,032
But I can't go any lower.

682
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,658
Five!

683
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,853
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

684
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,522
Kid, you have
an important lesson to learn.

685
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,123
That's the way of the world.

686
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:50,126
Go with the winner.

687
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,740
You think this
will stop me from cooking?

688
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,117
- Yes?
- No, you can cook

689
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,094
whatever you like.

690
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,662
As long as it's
that ridiculous meth

691
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,598
or you make up something else.

692
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,376
But don't even think
about using my formula.

693
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,811
Just try and stop me.

694
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,855
Bitch!

695
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,538
Yes, tell me.

696
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,872
Mrs. Olga?

697
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,332
It's me.

698
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,341
Mrs. Olga, I'm Henry Navarro,

699
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,093
anti-narcotics agent.

700
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,345
We're interested in an RV

701
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:44,080
that's registered
to your name and address.

702
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,475
It was stolen months ago.

703
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,085
- Stolen?
- Yes.

704
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,962
Then I'm curious because the
theft was never reported.

705
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,549
I'm not seeing any records of it
with the police.

706
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,568
I'm really busy in the house.

707
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:59,028
I didn't have the time to do it.

708
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,972
You didn't have the time
to report the theft

709
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,241
of a bus of yours?

710
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,867
And I've been ill.

711
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:08,163
I understand.

712
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,248
So...

713
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,775
And don't you care
about that bus?

714
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:16,004
Don't you need the money?

715
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,880
Well...

716
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,757
Yes, I do.

717
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,368
Do you know
what is the problem here?

718
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,346
If the people that stole the bus

719
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:26,264
use it for something unlawful,

720
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,041
you will have the problem
because the bus is yours.

721
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,185
Do you get it?

722
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,086
The bus is registered
with your name.

723
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,646
Do you have any ideas at all

724
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,649
who might've taken it?

725
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,443
I didn't want him arrested.

726
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:41,446
He ran with a bad crowd,

727
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,741
but he was never a bad person.

728
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:48,937
I thought he could turn
his life around.

729
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,997
In every house

730
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,067
there is someone
who needs help.

731
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,128
Who are we talking about?

732
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:01,758
My son.

733
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:06,413
I'd really like
to speak with him.

734
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,768
He's passed away.

735
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,936
He was shot two months ago.

736
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,691
I'm really sorry.

737
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,653
What was your son's name?

738
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:25,281
Juan Carlos Ortega.

739
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:28,660
We called him Gordo.

740
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,697
Could you give me
more information

741
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:43,800
about Juan Carlos?

742
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,677
Come on in.

743
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,920
Except from the lamp
and the flowers,

744
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,980
everything is like he left it.

745
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:21,129
Thank you for your cooperation.

746
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:24,382
No problem.

747
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,342
I only hope our Lord

748
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:30,288
takes him out of the purgatory
and brings him to Heaven.
