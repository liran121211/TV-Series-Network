1
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,013
Come on.

2
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,263
Go.

3
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,496
Walter.

4
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,381
Morning.

5
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,217
Afternoon.

6
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,911
- Really?

7
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,222
No.

8
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,625
You shouldn't
have let me sleep.

9
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,019
You needed it.

10
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,105
Terrible...

11
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,736
Sorry.

12
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,474
I don't entirely remember what
happened last night.

13
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,994
If I said something...

14
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,912
Did you know Guido Bermudez?

15
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,584
Who killed him?

16
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,379
Was it the people you work for?

17
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,032
No, no, no, no.
Definitely not.

18
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,951
Was it somebody who
at one point

19
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,954
- might want to do
the same to you?
- Cielo.

20
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,665
Cielo, my head is going to
burst. Don't you have
something?

21
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,378
- Really.
- I think...

22
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,257
I think I know what happened
last night.

23
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,341
I know exactly
what happened last night.

24
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,444
I drank too much wine.

25
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,555
I won't do it again.
I swear!

26
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,781
No.

27
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,784
Last night you told Henry

28
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,813
that the man he was looking for
might still be out there,

29
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,361
that Guido might not be this
Jaisenber after all.

30
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,840
And I was up all night

31
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,829
wondering why you would
say that to him.

32
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:14,583
Because I was drunk, Cielo.
That's it.

33
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,518
No, but then I was remembering

34
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,880
the black eye
you got from work.

35
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,774
Come on... Cielo...

36
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,985
I don't want to talk about this.

37
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,406
About any of this, ever.

38
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,657
Listen to me.

39
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,202
It's the best for both of us.

40
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,854
No, Cielo, these are two
separate worlds,

41
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,398
they don't have to
touch each other.

42
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,025
- Terrible!
- No.

43
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,277
And then I remembered
the message you left me
the other day.

44
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,463
Remember?

45
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,340
When you said you loved me.

46
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,702
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe--

47
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,472
I thought that maybe

48
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,750
you were regretting
what's happened between us, but

49
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,020
After last night,

50
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,688
I think you're scared.

51
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,590
- No.
- You were very scared!

52
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,302
- No, no, I wasn't.
- Tell me the truth, please.

53
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,928
That was a kind of goodbye,
wasn't it?

54
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,988
Of course not, Cielo.

55
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,157
I think it was a goodbye!

56
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,768
You know what else?
I think some part of you

57
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,162
wants Henry to catch you.

58
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:23,043
That is it. Exactly, yes.

59
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,445
A brilliant conclusion,
Doctor.

60
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,034
That's exactly what
To get caught,

61
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,911
and spend the rest
of my life in jail.

62
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,556
Great diagnosis!

63
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,503
If he caught you, at least this
would all be over.

64
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,505
Of course this would all be
over!

65
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,941
If they catch me I'll die!

66
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,760
And if I die
this all ends right now.

67
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,680
Finally I understand.
Thank you!

68
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,951
Walter.

69
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,203
I've said it before:

70
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,248
If you are in danger...

71
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,692
- we go to the police!
- What?

72
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,362
I don't want to
hear about the police.

73
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,654
- No!
- Walter,

74
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,299
I do not say that lightly.

75
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,035
I know what it could do
to this family

76
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,387
if we go to the police.

77
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,457
But if it's the only
real choice we have,

78
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,460
I'm willing to take
what comes,

79
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,354
rather than see you dead.

80
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,524
No! Under no circumstances!

81
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,859
Not the police!

82
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:33,513
You're not some
hardened criminal, Walt.

83
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,075
You're in over your head!

84
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,810
That's what we tell them.
That's the truth.

85
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,231
- That is not the truth.
- Of course it is!

86
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,625
A schoolteacher, cancer,

87
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,546
desperate for money?

88
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,088
You are a victim.

89
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,674
Okay, we're done here.

90
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,826
- This is ridiculous!
- You had nothing

91
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,288
to leave to your family!
It was the circumstances.

92
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,915
You told me that
yourself, Walt.

93
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,851
Let's behave like grownups.

94
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,506
Stop trying to justify this
whole thing and admit
you're in danger.

95
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,717
Who are you talking
to right now?

96
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,321
Who is it you think you see?

97
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,118
I am a fundamental piece.

98
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,995
They need me!

99
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,274
Without me,
there'd be no production.

100
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,359
You clearly don't know
who you're talking to.

101
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,822
- Walter--
- so let me clue you in!

102
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,009
Someone knocks the door.

103
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:42,249
A guy opens that door,
and gets shot.

104
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,001
Which one do you think
is me?

105
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,272
I am the one who knocks.

106
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,553
I am not in danger.
I am the danger!

107
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,542
Cielo, I think the best thing
is for us to talk--

108
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,270
Cielo.

109
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:37,737
Cielo?

110
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,417
Let's finish this.

111
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,377
And where is your pretty wife?

112
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,155
She has other business
to attend to.

113
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,287
Well, like I say to her,
place is as is.

114
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,122
- Understand?
- Yes, I understand.

115
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,501
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

116
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,978
No. The place is as is.

117
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,737
So here's everything you need.

118
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,990
I keep very good files.

119
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,186
- Perfect.
- Well...

120
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,997
So you are the boss now.

121
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:39,991
You think you're ready,
Walter?

122
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,801
Yes, I think so.

123
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,055
I say this to you,

124
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,208
because running
one of these business,

125
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,186
is really hard.

126
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,063
Being in charge is not easy.

127
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,483
But maybe,

128
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,319
when you are the boss,

129
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,096
you will
just keep your feet up

130
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,033
and relax.

131
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,579
But...

132
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:12,608
Not everyone knows this is
but the real important thing

133
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,778
is to be tough,
a boss has to be tough.

134
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:21,007
You have to be tough.

135
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,134
For instance,

136
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,456
has to make cashiers
wipe down cars,

137
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,433
even if they don't want to.

138
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,892
You hear?

139
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,230
Can you be tough, Walter?

140
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,341
I'm sure you can handle,
and if not

141
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,551
you can always
call your wife.

142
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,446
Can I have the office keys?

143
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,563
Who'd have thought someday I
would hand these keys to you?

144
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,005
Ramiro,

145
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,716
that stays.

146
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,595
It's my lucky bill.

147
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,040
- It was the first--
- We said as is.

148
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,047
Thank you, Ramiro!
A pleasure.

149
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,159
Eat something.

150
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,230
No, I'm fine with coffee.

151
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:26,825
You okay
there?

152
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,539
It's all right.
I'm not using....

153
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,808
I get a...

154
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,518
But I'm fine.

155
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,315
Eat something, man.

156
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,405
That's right.

157
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,887
Hello.

158
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,390
I'm here with him.

159
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,228
Fine.

160
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,738
I have to go.

161
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,228
You want me to call her back?

162
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,008
No, no.
That's fine.

163
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,612
And...

164
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,363
What exactly did she say?

165
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,032
Not much.

166
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:19,855
She asked if I was okay,
and not to worry.

167
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,023
Did she say at what time
she's coming back?

168
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,584
No, nothing.

169
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,071
It's about
the gambling, right?

170
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,802
It's kind of hard to explain.

171
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,162
It's not like you're
doing this on purpose.

172
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,349
It's no that simple.

173
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,227
You have a disease.

174
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,714
Addiction is like a disease.
She must understand.

175
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,465
It's like you're
an alcoholic.

176
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,193
No, it's not.

177
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,345
Yes, it is.
I read online.

178
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,640
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you,
and she can't be mad at you
about the cancer.

179
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,895
No, son, these are two
very different things.

180
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,313
- Not really.
- Yes!

181
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,610
what is going on with me
is not about some disease.

182
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,337
It's about choices.

183
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,797
Choices that I have made.

184
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,257
Choices I stand by.

185
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,718
Is that clear?

186
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,929
Yes, sir.

187
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,545
You're not moving
back in, are you?

188
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,899
No.

189
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,408
You know what?

190
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,602
School can wait. Why don't we
take a little detour?

191
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,730
What kind
of detour?

192
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,504
So?

193
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,591
So...

194
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,327
I think it's time
we got you your own car.

195
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,763
You are doing well in school,

196
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,375
you have a license,
so here we are.

197
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,962
Walter, are you
trying to buy me off?

198
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,565
Maybe.

199
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,642
If you are going to,
then buy me off.

200
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,412
What does that mean?

201
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,932
It's amazing!

202
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,144
I love it!

203
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,854
Uyuy!

204
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,843
- How's that?
- It flies!

205
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,845
- I saw that.
- I don't believe it.

206
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,222
Watch out
for the speed limits.

207
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,475
Thank you!
Really, thank you!

208
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,910
You're welcome, son.

209
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,313
I love it!
Uyuyuy!

210
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,465
So you're here!

211
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,536
Yes, nice to see you too.
What else?

212
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,246
You're actually here?
To work?

213
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,685
You're actually here to work?

214
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,938
Let's just get started.

215
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,397
Come here a second.

216
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,526
What is it?

217
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,486
I need an update.

218
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,321
Update on what?

219
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,182
An update on these little field
trips that you've been taking
with Mario.

220
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,785
I told you already.

221
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,271
We pick up money, check on
things, stuff like that.

222
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:54,027
And you're his bodyguard,
right?

223
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,404
- Are you making fun of me?
- I'm not making fun!

224
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,450
I just want to know
what's going on.

225
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,911
That's what you said
you did, you defend him.

226
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,204
No, I never said
I defend him.

227
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,473
I said I was backing him up.

228
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,543
Like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

229
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,897
And this has to be you.

230
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,299
Couldn't it be anyone else?
The new guy. What's his name?

231
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,817
- Mosquera.

232
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,637
Him or any of those muscle heads
he has working for him? No!

233
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:24,074
It has to be Jose Miguel Rosas.

234
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,852
Why? Is there something about
you that I don't know?

235
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,329
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

236
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,664
Something you haven't told me?

237
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:33,733
You suddenly aren't that
sensitive boy I once knew?

238
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,377
Leave me alone, ok?

239
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,462
All I'm saying is

240
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,574
that do you
not even question this?

241
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:45,011
This is strange.

242
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,538
Do you believe you mean anything
to these people?

243
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,084
Do you think they care?
Even a little?

244
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,712
And I'm not trying
to be insulting.

245
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm just trying to make you
see things clearly.

246
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,860
See things clearly?

247
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,487
You want to know what I see?

248
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,224
They can't
outright kill me.

249
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,742
They need me alive.

250
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,104
But they don't want me
getting high.

251
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,315
I see this thing probably
started as getting Mario
to babysit me.

252
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,193
No!
I don't think so.

253
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,669
But you know what?

254
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,989
I saved Mario
from getting robbed,

255
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,341
even killed, maybe.

256
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:27,578
So maybe I'm not
such a loser after all.

257
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,265
I mean, what if it--

258
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,810
What if it's all just a setup?

259
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,854
What do you mean?

260
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,882
Think about it! Your first day
out guarding Mario.

261
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,885
He steps out for one second,
and what happens? You
immediately get robbed.

262
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,111
You are such an asshole.

263
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,804
What a coincidence,
don't you think?

264
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,740
You are crazy.

265
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,227
- Crazy.
- Look.

266
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,120
It's the perfect way to do it.

267
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,664
Gustavo knows it.

268
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:58,609
Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

269
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,947
Like you said, Gus can't kill
you because of me. He knows I
won't stand for it.

270
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,744
He needs me, and he hates
the fact that he needs me.

271
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,872
So what does he do?
He goes to work

272
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,917
driving a wedge
between you and me.

273
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,894
It wasn't a setup.

274
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,897
I was there and you weren't.

275
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,925
You know what's the matter
with you?

276
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,609
You can't accept

277
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,179
that I do anything
other than what you order me.

278
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,655
Wait a minute.

279
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,226
How long did those guys chase
you?

280
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,773
Because the way
you describe it, they gave up
pretty damn easy. No.

281
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:40,777
No, Jose. This whole thing,
it's all about me.

282
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:45,282
Gustavo is doing this
to screw with me.

283
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,176
You are an egomaniac, Walter.

284
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,080
Hello.

285
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,334
Yes. Hang on.

286
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,835
It's for you.

287
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,678
Hello.

288
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,766
I'll be right up.

289
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,673
- What?
- I got to go.

290
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,068
How so?

291
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,360
Where are you going?

292
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,446
Ey, Jose. Ey.

293
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,722
Am I supposed to
clean all this on my own?

294
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,017
We have to wash the tanks
and clean everything up!

295
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,452
Ey!

296
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,977
Hello.

297
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,271
Ladies, how are you?

298
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,007
- Fine, thanks.
- I'm glad.

299
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,052
I need help to clean up my work
station.

300
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,028
No, we can't.

301
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,035
Help me!

302
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,332
I need a sign.

303
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:42,125
If this one turns off...
we'll leave.

304
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,876
If that one turns off,
we'll stay.

305
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,538
We'll stay.

306
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,968
What's the deal?

307
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,429
What are we doing here?

308
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,913
The deal is we're
watching that house.

309
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,100
What for?

310
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,921
A little birdie told me
there's some guys in there

311
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,049
that have two kilos of our
product which they're selling,

312
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,885
which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

313
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,946
Did they steal it?

314
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,532
Looks like it.

315
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,369
So what's the plan?

316
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,230
I just told you. We sit
here and watch that house.

317
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,152
Are we going to stay here for
ages until someone comes out?

318
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,279
- Yes.
- No.

319
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,657
We wait for one of them to pop
out, then we ask questions,

320
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,369
and get our property back.
Simple.

321
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:04,081
Why don't you just go
break the door down

322
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,335
and pistol whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

323
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,588
Because a little birdie
also told me these guys

324
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,757
are heavily into the product
and most likely armed.

325
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,553
Now, what you may not
know about meth heads...

326
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,346
They're kind of
unpredictable,

327
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,890
I don't care for
unpredictable.

328
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,766
We don't want a shooting
in this area.

329
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,540
This is going to take forever.

330
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:33,570
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90% of the job.

331
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,796
This isn't like the movies.

332
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,590
Get down from that cloud, son.

333
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,927
I could have brought a book.

334
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,347
A book?

335
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,917
All you read is porn
and comic books.

336
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,379
- Are you an intellectual now?
- No...

337
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:55,633
Here, I brought
some empanadas.

338
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,529
Chicken of beaf?

339
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,071
That's fine.

340
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,366
You'll see.

341
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,065
I know what I'm
going to do.

342
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,443
Where are you
going?

343
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,505
So they're selling, right?

344
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,298
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

345
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,260
Go and see.

346
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,157
What is it?

347
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,893
- Who the hell are you?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Tato!</font></i>

348
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,938
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Will you shut the damn door?</font></i>
- I'm here to buy.

349
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,042
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Tato, shut the door!</font></i>

350
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,861
Not my question.
I asked who you are.

351
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,797
They call me Bolis.

352
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,116
Word on the street is you're
selling the good stuff.

353
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,495
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Tato, I told you!</font></i>
- The blue one.

354
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,498
Boli, Boli, Boli...
I don't know any Boli.

355
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:11,267
Just looking for a tenth.

356
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,793
- Help a brother out.

357
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,647
We don't sell to strangers!

358
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,566
Chao, chao. Come on!

359
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,336
How did it go?

360
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,255
Hand one over.

361
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,842
Empanada?

362
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,386
These are chicken.

363
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,179
Plan B, we wait.

364
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,488
Mario, flip the trunk, will you?

365
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,156
Why?

366
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,433
There's something
in there I need.

367
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,119
And what would that be?

368
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,773
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

369
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:22,321
You may know this whole
P.I. sit-in-the-car business,

370
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:25,341
but I know meth heads.

371
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,479
They don't teach this in school.

372
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,469
What are you doing?

373
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,931
Digging.

374
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,310
Why?

375
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,605
You know why.

376
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,155
How deep are you going?

377
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,785
Ay!

378
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,792
I don't know.

379
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,418
How deep do you think it is?

380
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,047
Pretty deep.

381
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,037
You mind taking over
for a minute?

382
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:33,093
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Tato!</font></i>

383
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,600
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Tato!</font></i>

384
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,064
Who the hell are you?

385
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,651
Easy, come on, now.

386
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,887
- Who the hell are you?
- Easy now.

387
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,014
Just want
to buy some of the blue.

388
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,643
- It's not for sale.
- No, I have money.

389
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,854
- You were
selling it earlier...

390
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:02,523
- How do you know that?

391
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,623
- Easy, man.

392
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,567
Easy. Tato.
Tato told me.

393
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,903
Tato needs to learn to keep his
damn mouth shut.

394
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,170
Tato!

395
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,380
It's all good.

396
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,215
You going to help me out?

397
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,159
Don't have enough for all
of Tato's asshole friends!

398
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,287
- Tato!
- I think he's outside.

399
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,306
Why don't you go outside.

400
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,600
Let's go find Tato.

401
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,936
Forget it. Okay?

402
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,713
I don't want to start
any trouble.

403
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,774
Trouble? Trouble?

404
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,860
What does that mean, trouble?

405
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,176
- It's all cool.
- Trouble?

406
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,820
We're good.

407
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,180
Don't put thoughts
in my head!

408
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,266
You don't put
thoughts in my head!

409
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,375
There's the bag.
It's our stuff, right?

410
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,713
"Ready to talk"?
What does that mean?

411
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,272
Nothing.

412
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,217
How are you?
Are you all right?

413
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,237
Everything's fine.

414
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,017
Ladies, thank you
very much for everything.

415
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,478
- Thank you, Boss.
- On the contrary.

416
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,187
You can count on me
for whatever you need.

417
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,856
All right, Don
Walter.

418
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,291
Ladies...

419
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,693
- This way, please.
- We are not done--

420
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,294
Come with me.

421
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,220
Mosquera...

422
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,890
please don't hurt them.

423
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,083
Who do you think
you are talking to, Walter?

424
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,586
- What will you do to them?
- Do you want to know?

425
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,715
I'm putting them on a bus
back to the little town
they came from.

426
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:52,942
No.

427
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,445
Mosquera.

428
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,863
This was my idea.

429
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,783
Don't punish them.

430
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:05,145
You tell Gus
to blame me, not them.

431
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,956
He does.

432
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,391
Thank you.

433
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,401
Wait for me outside.

434
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,952
We won't be too long.

435
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,546
I'm listening.

436
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,509
The crew that hit our truck

437
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:04,287
gave away the cargo to a couple
of local nobodies.

438
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:09,251
Very disciplined, though,
not keeping anything
for themselves.

439
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,061
All we lost

440
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,896
is what those two used.

441
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,773
It's not worth it.

442
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,594
It was all about sending
a message, literally.

443
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,597
It was written on the bucket
"Ready to talk?".

444
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,783
What do you think?

445
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,619
It's the Mexicans, obviously.

446
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:31,189
They hired people here
to get the job done.

447
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,501
They found good people, tough.

448
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,419
How good are they?

449
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:41,450
I would need 10 to 15
top notch men,

450
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:48,498
and we hit them back,
hit them hard.

451
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:53,670
These men were hired
by the cartel.

452
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:55,064
Yes.

453
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,528
This war stays cold for now.

454
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,780
We'll see what happens.

455
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,366
What about their message?

456
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,743
What's the answer?

457
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,537
Set up a meeting.

458
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,940
Let's see
what they have to say.

459
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,668
As you wish.

460
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,280
Speaking about
Jose Miguel Rosas.

461
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,865
Does he still think himself a
hero?

462
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,177
He doesn't suspect anything?

463
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,116
I hear you can handle yourself.

464
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,619
I guess.

465
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,623
Good night.

466
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:56,833
Excuse me.

467
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,173
Yes?

468
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,803
Why me?

469
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,166
I like to think
I see things in people.

470
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,616
There she is.

471
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,620
Don't be nervous.

472
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,581
You know how she gets.

473
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,335
She won't take the car away.

474
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,461
- Good evening.

475
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,005
You wait and see.

476
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,869
Trust in me. You'll see.
Everything's going to be fine.

477
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,707
- Hi, mom.
- Hi.

478
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,044
Did you see
what's in the driveway?

479
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,354
So that's yours?

480
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,067
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

481
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,319
That was very nice of him.

482
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,071
It's a super safe car.

483
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,657
We mustn't think

484
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,243
about appearances.

485
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,119
Appearances?

486
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,621
I promise...

487
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,207
I will always be careful.

488
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:06,546
- Ajá.

489
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,252
- I will respect

490
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,446
- the rules and speed limit.

491
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,908
So Dad said I can take it
around the block a few times.

492
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,345
That okay?

493
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,637
Just around the block.

494
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,667
Yeah.
Just around the block.

495
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,024
I'm glad you're back.

496
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,782
Junior.

497
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,243
Seat belt.

498
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,561
And remember the speed
limit.

499
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:39,955
Yes, sir.

500
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,208
I guess we should talk.

501
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,362
I think you said
plenty the other day.

502
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,214
Look, about that,

503
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,449
I want to straighten
some things up-- Cielo.

504
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,162
Did you get the
keys?

505
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,846
Yes, here they are.

506
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,848
Thanks.

507
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,020
Hey...

508
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,926
I may have overstated things
earlier...

509
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:13,738
It got out of hand,

510
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,408
and I'm sorry to be so forward.

511
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,577
I want you to know something,

512
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,314
I need you to understand that
Junior, Valentina,

513
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,082
you are completely safe.

514
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,751
Everything that I do--

515
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,046
I do it to protect this family.

516
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:32,382
Sure!

517
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,826
So buying that car, that was
protecting your family?

518
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,053
The car...

519
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,581
All right, maybe
it's a little flashy.

520
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:40,932
I don't know.

521
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,144
But he needed a car,

522
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,563
and I'm his father,

523
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,548
and I should be able
to get what he wants.

524
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,984
It goes back tomorrow.

525
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:55,097
That car directly
contradicts our story.

526
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,573
Our story!

527
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,227
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family,

528
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,329
it means protecting the story.

529
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,441
What do you think the neighbors
are going to say?

530
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,359
What about Henry or Maria
or the Government?

531
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,169
Did you think about that? No!

532
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,588
What were you thinking?

533
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,075
I wanted to do
something nice for my son.

534
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,135
Cielo, I just worry

535
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,179
that he'll blame you for this.

536
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,722
Don't worry about that.

537
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,208
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother

538
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,896
for taking away

539
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,006
what his
loving father has given him.

540
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,818
So thanks for that.

541
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,572
You know why, Walt?

542
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,157
You know why?

543
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,768
- Do you know why?
- Why?

544
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,771
Someone has to protect
this family

545
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,898
from the man
who protects this family.
