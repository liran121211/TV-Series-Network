1
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,642
Hello...

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,087
I'm sorry.
The door was open.

3
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,106
Welcome!

4
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,651
Let me introduce you.

5
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,111
This is Walter, my husband.

6
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,096
- Pleased to meet you.
- You too.

7
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,823
Cielo told me you work

8
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,282
at Número Atómico lab.

9
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,910
That's right.

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,161
I've heard about the place.

11
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,899
What you do over there
sounds like Science Fiction.

12
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,335
Well, we just call it Science.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,379
Yes, sure.

14
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,090
Exciting, isn't it?

15
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,466
Honestly, what I do

16
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,176
would bore you senseless.

17
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,597
Well, this is it, honey.

18
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,833
This is the house
I can't stop talking about.

19
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,418
What do you think?
Do you want to take a tour?

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,020
Sure.

21
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,563
Let's do something.

22
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,381
How about I give you
some privacy

23
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,859
so you check out the place?

24
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,552
She knows the style
perfectly well.

25
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:36,072
I'll go for a walk meanwhile.

26
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,598
- Sounds good.
- Fine.

27
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,725
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

28
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,271
What I like about this house
is...

29
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,400
I don't know.
The energy.

30
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,211
I love the garden!

31
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,699
And the fountain.
It's incredible, isn't it?

32
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,242
- And it has rooms as well.
- Really??

33
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,578
- Where people sleep.
- No kidding! That's good!

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,165
- Let's go upstairs.
- How many?

35
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,601
- Three.

36
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,062
That's all?

37
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:12,216
No, we need five
at least.

38
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,220
Do I look like I'm about to drop
a litter?

39
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,492
We need three at least, right?

40
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,202
Yes, sure.

41
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,829
Hugo, Paco and Luis.

42
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,747
I don't know, honey.

43
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,667
I feel we need something more...

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,738
- More what?
- I don't know. Bigger.

45
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,422
Spacious.

46
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,577
Honey, I swear I've already been
to every house in the city

47
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,512
and this is a good neighborhood.

48
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,931
It's the best house we can get

49
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,516
for our price range.

50
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,586
Then let's stretch
our price range.

51
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,133
How are we supposed
to stretch it?

52
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,177
No, I'm just saying
we should live the moment.

53
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,570
That's all.

54
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,242
Hey, are you in the mafia?

55
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,728
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

56
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,273
Cielo, we don't have to fear
the future.

57
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,902
Was can't just paralyze
or be too cautious.

58
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,297
We've got nowhere to go

59
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,008
but up.

60
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,136
So let's go up.

61
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,569
Hello?

62
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,781
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, it's us.</font></i>

63
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,449
So.

64
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,409
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walk towards us.</font></i>

65
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,774
Mario, I'm going to need
some kind of assurance.

66
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,960
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter...</font></i>

67
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,963
I assure you I could kill you

68
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,966
from way over here.

69
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,048
Walter.

70
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,549
Mario.

71
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,912
You've caused
too much trouble lately.

72
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,014
That's how things are now.

73
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,890
Put your arms out on the sides.

74
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,725
Please.

75
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,948
The hat.

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,444
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

77
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,532
I was out all night cleaning up
after you.

78
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,204
Though I'm old
and I get insomnia,

79
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,557
I need to sleep, Walter.

80
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,644
You said no half measures.

81
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,688
You gave me that advice.

82
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:23,817
It's funny how words

83
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,179
can be so open
to interpretation.

84
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,615
Let's go.

85
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,210
You got your car fixed?

86
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,295
No. Not yet.

87
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,505
Do it, it's important.

88
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,159
Sure, it's the car
my wife uses.

89
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,744
And that you use
to kill our people.

90
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,472
Has your condition worsened?

91
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,792
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition,

92
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,978
your health,

93
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,023
has it grown worse?

94
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,731
Not that I know of.

95
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,094
Is there a ringing
in your ears?

96
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,139
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

97
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,865
No, I'm quite well.

98
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,186
- Thanks for asking.
- No.

99
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,371
You're not well.

100
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,792
Clearly you are not.

101
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,464
No rational person

102
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,382
would do what you did.

103
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,761
What you did

104
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,556
was not intelligent.

105
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,976
Explain yourself.

106
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,713
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

107
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:28,942
I intervened.

108
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,237
Some worthless junkie.

109
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,907
For him you intervene

110
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,202
and put us all at risk?

111
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,273
Some contemptible junkie who
couldn't keep the peace

112
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,999
for eight hours?

113
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,168
That's right. He couldn't.

114
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,655
He was angry because
those two dealers of yours

115
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,033
had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

116
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,677
I heard about it.

117
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,706
He should have let me
take care of them.

118
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,600
maybe.

119
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,020
Then again, maybe he thought

120
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,980
it was you who gave the order.

121
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,363
Are you asking me

122
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,890
if I ordered the murder
of a child?

123
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,036
I'd never ask you that.

124
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,830
Where is José Miguel Rosas now?

125
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,208
I don't know.

126
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,779
Could be in Medellín,
Venezuela. I don't know.

127
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,091
the thing is he's not near.

128
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,511
He's got enough money

129
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,263
to last forever.

130
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,957
He knows
he needs to keep moving.

131
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,062
I don't think you'll find him.

132
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,190
I don't know, Walter.

133
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:55,595
It's what I do after all.
Find people.

134
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,892
Make them appear
and disappear.

135
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,770
The way I see it,
José Miguel Rosas doesn't exist.

136
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,624
He's out of the picture.

137
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,859
That's what you wanted
from the beginning.

138
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,335
Am I wrong?

139
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,448
Gustavo,
you've always struck me

140
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,550
as a very pragmatic man.

141
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,787
I'd like us to manage things
that way.

142
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,641
The best ting to do

143
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,876
would be to review
the options we have.

144
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,811
"We have"?

145
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,022
Right. That you have.

146
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,926
I think you have two.
May I?

147
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:40,115
You kill me right here and now.

148
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,560
You start looking
for José Miguel,

149
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,686
you'll find him
sooner or later.

150
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,022
You kill him.
End of story.

151
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,958
Just a revenge exercise

152
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,127
that seems pointless to me.

153
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,963
And option B?

154
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,215
I continue cooking.

155
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,326
You and I
forget about my ex-partner.

156
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,803
We forget this ever happened.

157
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,097
We consider this a lone hiccup

158
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,458
in an otherwise
long and fruitful

159
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,019
business arrangement.

160
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:14,983
I prefer option B.

161
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,655
You'd need a new assistant.

162
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,851
- Sure, I'll get one.
- No.

163
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,788
This time, I choose.

164
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,749
Sounds good.

165
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,265
Get your car fixed.

166
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,101
I will.

167
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,674
Excuse me.

168
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,451
Those are the new rules?
I can't open the door?

169
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,344
The new rules.

170
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,541
Guido.

171
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,960
Professor.

172
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,631
It's good to have you back.

173
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,800
It's good to be back.

174
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,790
- Shall we?
- Let's cook.

175
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,207
We're here!

176
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,113
- Ready?
- And the others?

177
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,423
The others are for me.

178
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,576
No, grandpas
don't play with balloons..

179
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,703
I do.
Besides, you have to tell me

180
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,371
why you want a rhino at home
if they're ugly.

181
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,140
No, they're nice.

182
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,585
Besides,
with such a big nose,

183
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,603
they'd break everything at home.

184
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,214
It's not a nose,
it's a horn.

185
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,442
You never stop learning.

186
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,861
Can I have a pink balloon?

187
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,596
Later, honey.
I need them for a job.

188
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,740
Some other day.

189
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,557
- Come in.
- No, I don't have time.

190
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,868
Sen grandpa a kiss.

191
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,742
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Fine.

192
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,343
I brought your car.

193
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,387
It's perfect now.

194
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,515
These guys are real genius.

195
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,350
There're no signs of the bump.

196
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,419
By the way,
I cleaned it

197
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,731
and polished it.

198
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,716
Thanks.
It was quite useful.

199
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,611
But you have to be careful.

200
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,889
You crashed because you left
in a hurry the other night

201
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,617
and I was worried.

202
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,494
Yes, I'm sorry.

203
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,690
It was just a mistake.
I was in a hurry-

204
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,318
I know, I'll get nowhere
if I hurry.

205
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,446
It was just to do something
for work.

206
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,174
Do you need to keep the car?

207
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,718
No, no, no.

208
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,372
What's more, I asked one
of the car sellers

209
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,749
to come with me
so I could leave you your car.

210
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,434
What?

211
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,854
Come.

212
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,264
- You bought a new car?
- Yes.

213
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,394
I just realized I was
spending too much on taxis.

214
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,023
Besides,
you have to enjoy life,

215
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,401
you never know
how long you'll last.

216
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,087
It's an expensive car.

217
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,673
No.

218
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,050
Not that much.

219
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,120
it's not showy,
ostentatious.

220
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:41,042
For an unemployed professor,
it is.

221
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,311
You think so?

222
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,356
But...

223
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,442
I think it's totally normal

224
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,679
for the owner of a car wash
to have such a car.

225
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,684
That justifies
the deal I offered you.

226
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,703
Doesn't it?

227
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,343
What happened?
What was that?

228
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,470
Quiet.
Come here.

229
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,572
Come, come.

230
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,609
Hi, Carlitos!

231
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,596
Do you have anything
you want to tell me?

232
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,990
Thank God you're here.

233
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,019
- They were keeping me prisoner.
- Prisoner?

234
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,814
Then that's why
you haven't sent us

235
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,665
the inputs, right?

236
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,235
Mario, please,
I don't work for them.

237
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,796
They stole my chemicals.

238
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,673
I couldn't do anything.

239
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,509
You know I'm a businessman.

240
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,038
- A businessman, I know.
- Of course.

241
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,249
The lady out front
knows how to drive?

242
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,351
Yes, why do you ask?

243
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,717
Because she's driving you
to hospital.

244
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,319
Untie her.

245
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,572
She's going to need her shoe.

246
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,536
And from now on

247
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,372
I strongly recommend you

248
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,166
to answer our calls.

249
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,643
Mexican.

250
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,421
Just that one.
The others are from here.

251
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,549
He was probably
looking for people

252
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,151
for that case in particular.

253
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,096
Neither them nor him
are good.

254
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,473
Anyway, we're talking
about people from the cartel.

255
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,909
No doubt about it.

256
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,729
They must be looking
for our weaknesses

257
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,289
because they must have heard

258
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,874
we're producing.

259
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,917
But they found none.

260
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,254
What about Rosas?

261
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,590
I'm making inquiries.

262
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,131
You can take your mask off now.
Let's activate this.

263
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,648
Yes, sir.

264
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,579
Does that guy ever leave?

265
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,581
I don't think so.

266
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,959
When exactly did that start?

267
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,656
It's new.
We had...

268
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,576
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

269
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,221
I'm sorry to hear that.

270
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,681
No, it'll be fine.

271
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,334
Things will continue
to smooth out.

272
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,477
But if you're at all worried

273
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,186
about working with me.

274
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,479
No, no, no, I'm not.

275
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,231
It's all right.

276
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,342
Because whatever my shortcomings
last time,

277
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,136
I intend for things to go
perfectly

278
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,821
from here on out to--

279
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,183
No, Guido, for real.
Don't worry. It's all right.

280
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,601
You're a great chemist.
I'll all be all right.

281
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,204
We'll do things your way.

282
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,789
That's it.

283
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,459
I just want to learn from you.

284
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,127
Thanks, Guido.

285
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,095
Four.

286
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,138
Guido.

287
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,098
Boss! Mr. Gustavo.

288
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,226
I should have called first.

289
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,962
- Do I interrupt?
- No, no, no, sir.

290
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,964
- Come in.
- Thanks.

291
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,941
Excuse me

292
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,867
You want some coffee,

293
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,851
green tea,
some liquor?

294
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,578
No, no, Guido.

295
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,397
No, thanks.
I'm fine.

296
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,249
In fact, I came here

297
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,835
to talk to you

298
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,087
about something serious

299
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,173
and rather pressing.

300
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,343
Yes, sure.

301
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,889
If push came to shove,

302
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,460
I was wondering how soon
you might be able

303
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,269
to take over the lab yourself.

304
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,522
You and an assistant.

305
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,260
Mr. Gustavo,
are you asking me

306
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,070
to be in charge of the lab?

307
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,072
Yes.

308
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,850
Why would push
come to shove?

309
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,036
Guido.

310
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,874
Has Walter ever talked to you

311
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,443
about why he got into this
particular line of work?

312
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,920
No, sir.

313
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,408
I assumed it was
because it pays so well.

314
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,469
That could be a reason.

315
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,789
But specifically,
has he ever spoken to you

316
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,308
about his health problems?

317
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,564
I'm not surprised.

318
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,150
He's a very private person.

319
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,762
What exactly are
his health problems?

320
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,575
He's dying of cancer, Guido.

321
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,855
He's doing this
to provide his family.

322
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,484
In my opinion,
he's got enough money.

323
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,463
They'll never want for anything.

324
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,674
He's accomplished his goal.

325
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,055
How long does he have?

326
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,392
We don't know.

327
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,059
Every time I ask him,

328
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,937
the conversation is not easy.

329
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,773
I understand.

330
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,735
I intend to keep Walter on

331
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,030
as long as he wants,

332
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,475
assuming he's physically
up to it.

333
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,662
But...

334
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:31,317
As he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be,

335
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,820
I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

336
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,634
How soon would you be ready

337
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,178
to take over the lab, Guido?

338
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,682
I think that...

339
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,335
I suppose if we had at least
a few more cooks together...

340
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,215
You don't think
you're ready now?

341
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,733
No.

342
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,427
The things is
he's such a genius,

343
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,572
he's a master.

344
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,724
There's always
some more for me to learn.

345
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,771
But if you ask me
for a date,

346
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,583
I'd say one or two more cooks.

347
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,878
One.

348
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,797
I'd be ready with one more.

349
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,049
I guess.

350
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,344
I believe in you, Guido.

351
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,846
I know that when the time comes

352
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,182
to make a decision,

353
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,434
you'll be ready.

354
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,206
What's up, Guido?

355
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,627
Walter, I have a question.

356
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,133
Why do I get the impression

357
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,244
you're more curious
than usual today?

358
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,871
- No.
- No, no. Just ask me.

359
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,474
What I wanted to know was...

360
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,821
Is there any particular trick

361
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,282
to purging the catalyst bed?

362
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,076
No, it's pretty straightforward.

363
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,287
I'll show you when we get there

364
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,956
Thank you.

365
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,813
Mario, I'm busy.

366
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,273
I see.

367
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,092
I'm looking
for one of your clients.

368
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,970
- Which client?
- José Miguel Rosas

369
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,140
Why don't you look for him
on the internet

370
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,033
or on the phone book?

371
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,454
I need you to concentrate.

372
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,832
The sooner you tell me,

373
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,124
the sooner you can get back

374
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,917
to whatever the hell

375
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,044
this is exactly.

376
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:22,863
Mario,
let me tell you someth--

377
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,799
You're good right there.

378
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,160
I'll sit here
and we'll both be comfortable.

379
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,639
We all know why I tell you

380
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,832
I'm looking
for José Miguel Rosas, right?

381
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,395
And you pretending otherwise

382
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,606
only wastes my time

383
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,902
and serves to annoy me.

384
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,823
The problem is

385
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,100
there're rules
to this lawyer thing.

386
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,536
Is that right?

387
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,288
Yes, yes.

388
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,775
It's the attorney-client
privilege,

389
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,376
so I can give you information

390
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,211
just like that

391
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,113
because that could cost me
my license.

392
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,365
And I'm not just talking
about this client.

393
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,844
I offer you the same service.

394
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,223
So if I give up José,

395
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:17,100
then you'd be right to think

396
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,836
I could give you up as well,
don't you think?

397
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,522
So then where's the trust?

398
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,774
I trust the river flow

399
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,903
I'd throw Saúl Bueno in.

400
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,531
Yes, it's an argument.

401
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,868
So don't make me beat you

402
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,953
till your legs don't work.

403
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,538
Whose legs?

404
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,566
- The kicker's
or the kicked one?
- It's the same.

405
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,155
No, no, no.
I can't tell you.

406
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,825
I couldn't live with myself.
I'm sorry.

407
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,910
No, no, no!
Fine, fine, fine.

408
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,846
I can't "say" anything but...

409
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,014
But who's to say

410
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,935
that I wrote it down

411
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,311
in my day planner

412
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:04,899
and you just saw it

413
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,984
while searching my office

414
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,903
when I was not here?

415
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,404
That's good, right?

416
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,098
Don't touch anything
on my desk.

417
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,367
I'll make myself some coffee.

418
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,619
Agree?

419
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,118
I'm just looking out for you,
that's all.

420
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,678
Believe me, money laundering

421
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,973
isn't what it used to be.

422
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:41,351
I do miss those times.

423
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,128
They used such lively colors.
I still like them.

424
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,339
- Light colors.
- Stop, Saúl.

425
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,467
I'm not interested
in anything else.

426
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,304
I'm buying the car wash.
That's it.

427
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,948
End of story.

428
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,908
One look at this place

429
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,076
and you'll fall in love.

430
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,646
You'll thank me
for the rest of your life.

431
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,695
Come, Walter, Come.
Look.

432
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,464
Here it is!

433
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,676
Here it is.

434
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,385
What do you think?

435
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,098
Are you serious, Saúl?

436
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,851
Of course I'm serious!

437
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,061
Where else are you going to find

438
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,213
a cash-only business
that's this much fun?

439
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,065
This could easily be called

440
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,942
"Laundryfun"

441
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,428
- No. This won't work.
- No, no, no. Wait.

442
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,513
Don't say anything
until you see it.

443
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,700
Don't be so incredulous.

444
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,660
Let's get in and you'll see.

445
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,145
Listen to me.
Come.

446
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,542
This place is ideal.

447
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,627
You can have children's parties,

448
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,338
baptisms, communions, birthdays,

449
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,340
with moms and dads

450
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,467
and you can also organize

451
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,178
some orgies for teenagers.

452
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,790
Saúl, thanks.
Just leave it there.

453
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:03,183
No, no, I won't.

454
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,502
How come
they're tracing the car?

455
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,022
Is it bugged?

456
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,802
- I said "Maybe. Maybe.
- They're following me, Walter.

457
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,595
Mario, who's supposed
to be on my side,

458
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,405
threatened to break my legs.

459
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,948
I'm so nervous

460
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:20,810
I had to double
my whisky doses in the morning.

461
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:22,703
What are you getting me into?

462
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:26,023
I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing.

463
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,543
And that goes for you too.

464
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,380
Mario is no dummy.

465
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,324
Give us 17 hours
before he finds out

466
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,660
the address I gave him
goes nowhere.

467
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,303
So you guys talk your stuff,

468
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,722
do your thing

469
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,724
but make it snappy.

470
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,083
I'm going to look
for somewhere to pee.

471
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,394
Maybe the house of terror.

472
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,154
How are you holding up?

473
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,240
Just here.

474
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,617
You?

475
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,536
I got my job back.

476
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,872
At least until they kill me

477
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,874
and Guido takes over.

478
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,709
So he's their boy?

479
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,880
How long you think you've got?

480
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,339
I don't know.

481
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,575
He asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

482
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,954
I try to be as vague
as possible,

483
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,764
but it's not easy.

484
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,749
They watch me
day and night.

485
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,003
Maybe the only thing
that's saving me

486
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,521
is Guido's fastidiousness.

487
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,883
He won't be sure until he learns
each detail of the process.

488
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,611
But once he learns

489
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,238
the entire method...

490
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,410
So what do we do?

491
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,207
You know what we have to do.

492
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,654
There's got to be
some other way, Walter.

493
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,465
Maybe it's better for you

494
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,550
to just go to the cops.

495
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,870
You could tell them
you did it for your family

496
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,121
and give them
lots of information.

497
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,973
They'll be happy.

498
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,250
You could even make a deal
with the DEA.

499
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,210
They could take you
to thee U.S.,

500
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,879
change your name,
your surname.

501
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,647
Maybe just the surname.

502
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,382
Walter is American.
That would work there.

503
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,360
I can disappear.

504
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,512
I can live like this.
I've been doing it.

505
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,726
We made a good career,
but it's over now.

506
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,687
No! No!
I'll never go to the police!

507
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,580
I'll never go to the DEA!

508
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,583
We have to keep cooking, José.

509
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,194
That's the one thing
I'm certain of.

510
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,698
Gustavo can't stop production,
he can't afford to.

511
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,953
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got,

512
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,304
then I've got leverage.

513
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,140
And leverage keeps me alive!

514
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,017
It keeps you alive too.

515
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,587
If I'm the only chemist
that he's got.

516
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,716
I can't do it.
I can't.

517
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,427
I'm no murderer,
you said so.

518
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,280
I'll do it.

519
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,574
But I need your help.

520
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,144
José, they watch me
all day.

521
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,187
I can't even get close
to Guido.

522
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,252
But if I could just shake Victor

523
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:20,238
for even an hour one night,
I could...

524
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,407
I think I may be able to make it
look like an accident.

525
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,342
There has to be some other way.

526
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,469
I wish there was,

527
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,013
but there isn't.

528
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,334
If it comes down to us and him,
then it's him.

529
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,253
José, you're the only edge
I've got.

530
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,589
As long as they don't know
you're in Bogotá,

531
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,524
you're my only edge.

532
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,070
But I need you to track Guido.

533
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,682
Get me his address
and I'll do the rest.

534
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,328
José, I saved your life.

535
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,082
Will you save mine?

536
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,924
So cute.

537
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,267
Such lovely little hands.

538
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:17,896
Yes.

539
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,304
Hello?

540
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,430
Tell me you have good news,

541
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,975
tell me you found him, please.

542
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,311
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He lives behind Teusaquillo.</font></i>

543
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,313
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Route 20, number 25-12.</font></i>

544
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,759
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Can you hear me?</font></i>

545
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,819
Yes, I'm here.

546
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,322
Route 20, number 25-12.

547
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,268
- Is he at home?
-<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Yes.</font></i>

548
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,745
Anyone watching the place?

549
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,831
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, looks pretty calm.</font></i>

550
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,192
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">There's no one here</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after 6 PM.</font></i>

551
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,127
Fine.

552
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,587
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When are you doing it?</font></i>

553
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,467
Tonight.

554
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,387
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Don't do it.</font></i>

555
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,330
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is not the same</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">as killing two guys</font></i>

556
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,373
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">who deserved it.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">This guy it's innocent.</font></i>

557
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,017
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's not worth it.</font></i>

558
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,519
There's no option.

559
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,300
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, go to the cops.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Listen to me.</font></i>

560
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,089
Hey, we've got a problem!

561
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,658
There's some kind
of chemical leaking in your lab.

562
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,343
You have to come.

563
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,597
Sure.

564
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,542
- I'll follow you.
- No!

565
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,338
They told me to bring you.
Get on.

566
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,816
Hurry!

567
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,024
I don't know if it's a barrel
leak or what,

568
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,943
but you got something stinky
down there.

569
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,922
After you.

570
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,037
Walter, the sooner
you figure out what this is,

571
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,373
- the sooner we'll go home.
- No.

572
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,376
No, Mario,
please, don't do this.

573
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,686
Unfortunately, I do.

574
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,714
No, no, no. Let me cook.
I'll cook for free.

575
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,425
- I'll do anything!
- No.

576
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,509
If I could talk to Gustavo,
I could explain it to him.

577
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,762
- He'll understand.
- No.

578
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,931
Please!
I can convince him!

579
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,557
- No.
- Please! Please, Mario!

580
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,352
Shut up!
I can't talk to Gustavo.

581
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,021
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- I'll give you Rosas!

582
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,900
He's the problem.
You know it.

583
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,946
Without him,
we'd be all right.

584
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,423
I'll tell you where he is.

585
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,451
He's in Bogotá.
He's not near,

586
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,203
but he's not
where you're looking.

587
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,222
I need an address right now.

588
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,373
No, no, no,
I have no address.

589
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,808
He moves around.

590
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,543
But if you let me call him,
I--¡No, no, no!

591
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,687
It's my phone!

592
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,090
Calm down.
I'm just getting my phone.

593
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,651
I'll call him

594
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,445
and I'll have him meet me.

595
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,149
Hello.
Did you do it?

596
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:50,152
- No, you have to do it.
- What?

597
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:52,195
What?
No way,.

598
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:53,755
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Listen to me.</font></i>

599
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,924
You're closer than we are.

600
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,534
You'll have about 20 minutes
lead.

601
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,453
They've got me at the laundry.
They'll kill me!

602
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,955
So it, José!
José, do it!

603
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,209
Just what the hell
was that exactly?

604
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,811
You might want to hold off.

605
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,105
Why?

606
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,424
Because your boss
is going to need me.

607
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,194
Route 20, number 25-12.

608
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,489
You?

609
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,410
How can I help you?

610
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,039
No...

611
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,610
I had nothing to do
with their firing you.

612
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,713
They just called me.

613
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,075
I have money.
You want money?

614
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,785
I can give you anything.
What do you want?

615
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,597
Please, don't...

616
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,976
Please, don't.
