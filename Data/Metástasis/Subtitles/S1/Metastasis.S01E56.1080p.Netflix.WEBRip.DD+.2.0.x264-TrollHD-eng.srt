1
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,700
Hello, Mariano.
It's Walter.

2
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,744
I need you to get Cielo
on the line.

3
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,389
Tell her it's urgent.

4
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,141
I don't care, get her!

5
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,376
What do you mean
she won't get off the phone?

6
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,854
I'm telling you it's urgent!

7
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,981
Get her now!

8
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,882
Mariano, I am giving you
permission.

9
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,359
Tell her to hang up.

10
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,276
Interrupt her!

11
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,098
What do you mean
she's locked up?

12
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:05,310
Mariano,who is she
on the phone with?

13
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,313
No, no, forget it.
It doesn't matter.

14
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,600
Aaah!

15
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,022
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes.</font></i>

16
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,857
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, Henry.</font></i>

17
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,945
Yes.

18
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,824
I understand.

19
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,690
Have a brilliant day, sir.

20
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,525
Mariano, where is Cielo?

21
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,944
She just left.

22
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,386
- Where did she go?
- She didn't say it.

23
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,406
Do you want something to drink?

24
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,349
- Coffee?
- Coffee.

25
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,493
Coffee, please.

26
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,083
My head is spinning.

27
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,501
Spinning real bad.

28
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,404
And yours...
I can't even imagine.

29
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,966
So much makes sense to me now.

30
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,301
You jumping in the pool,

31
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,221
you sending us your kids,

32
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,496
I just wished
I'd seen it sooner.

33
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,558
The only thing I don get

34
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,685
is how I didn't see it.

35
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,106
He's a monster.

36
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,761
Walter is sick.
Really sick!

37
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,365
I don't know what he did to you

38
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,100
to force you
to keep his secrets.

39
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,827
If he threatened you,

40
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:55,522
I don't know if there was
psychological or physical abuse.

41
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,959
I have no idea.

42
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,377
But what I want you to know

43
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,213
right now

44
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:04,340
is that you can be open with me.

45
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,344
Don't hold anything back.

46
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,057
Okay?

47
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,419
I don't even understand if you
know the full extent of this,

48
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,399
what he's done.

49
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,817
I don't know--

50
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,154
Not just the meth cooking.

51
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,822
No!

52
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,366
But the lives he's destroyed.

53
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,911
All the violence, the killing.

54
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,999
But that's all behind you.

55
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,668
That's behind you, Cielo.

56
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,254
Okay?

57
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,256
Yes?

58
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,968
From now on,

59
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,662
you're done being
Walter Blanco's victim.

60
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,098
Not anymore.

61
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,540
Because here's
what we're going to do.

62
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,977
Okay?

63
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,646
You and the kids

64
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,880
are going to move back
to our house

65
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,484
where you'll be safe,

66
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,444
you'll be protected.

67
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,571
Walter can't get you there.

68
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,702
María...

69
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,371
Does María know?

70
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,248
No, no, no.

71
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,416
This is between you and me.

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,318
- Aaah!
- Okay?

73
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,199
Before we get you back
to the house,

74
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,617
I'm going to ask you to tell me
everything you can.

75
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,512
Okay?

76
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,638
Well...

77
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,230
Take as long as you like.

78
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,983
I have no rush, okay?

79
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,068
Good.

80
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,194
Henry...

81
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,074
Okay.

82
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,452
Just start from the beginning.

83
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,956
Tell me everything.

84
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,666
How it happened,

85
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,568
when you first became aware
of Walter's activities,

86
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,004
when you knew,

87
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,382
all of his contacts, everything.

88
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,200
Just try to be
as detailed as you can.

89
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:12,844
Okay?

90
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,620
- Come on.
- How?

91
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,039
- Here?
- Yes.

92
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,474
Now?

93
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,876
Why not?
The sooner it--

94
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,693
Come on.

95
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,821
Think about it, remember.

96
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,240
State your name and the date

97
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,367
before you start.

98
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,786
Do we...?

99
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,500
Do we have to do this right now?

100
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,961
No.

101
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,031
No, we don't have to do this
right now.

102
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,594
We don't.

103
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,013
But here's the thing.

104
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,499
I need something solid
that I can bring to my people.

105
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,727
I have all these little pieces.

106
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,438
If I go with that,

107
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,022
nobody's going to believe me.

108
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,942
Because that's my point of view.

109
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,069
That's what I believe.

110
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,570
So...

111
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,449
You testifying

112
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,034
to Walter's criminal activity,

113
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,702
can help me a lot.

114
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,621
Cielo, this is a big case,

115
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,083
and gathering all this evidence,

116
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,212
enough to get a conviction,

117
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,072
we're talking a long-haul
proposition here,

118
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,716
and I don't want

119
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,885
that bastard

120
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,179
running out the clock

121
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,832
before being punished
by justice.

122
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,542
What do you mean
running out the clock?

123
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
- What are you talking about?
- His cancer.

124
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,630
His cancer is back,
he told me so.

125
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,360
What?

126
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,698
He didn't tell you?

127
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,077
Who's to say it's even true?

128
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,204
Lying piece of shit.

129
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,735
Let's believe him, okay?
Let's believe him.

130
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,365
You have to help me
anyway, Cielo.

131
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,576
That son of a bitch looks me in
the eye and says:

132
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,246
"If what you think
about me is true,

133
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,682
I'm going to be dead

134
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,768
before you can prove it".

135
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,894
What do you think?

136
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,151
Cielo, you have to understand

137
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,219
that you are a really
important piece

138
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,904
in this case.

139
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,198
Without you, I can do nothing.

140
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,413
I'm sure that if the judge

141
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,815
hears all you know
about this case,

142
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,276
he will get Walter
in jail in that very moment.

143
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,004
And we could avoid

144
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,255
he keeps doing what he wants.

145
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,758
Do you understand me?

146
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,884
Cielo!

147
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,557
Maybe I need a lawyer.

148
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,141
No, no, no.

149
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,560
You don't.

150
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,252
- Maybe I do.
- No, Cielo, no.

151
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,231
I am here to help you.

152
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,882
But to do that,
I need your help.

153
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,051
We start bringing in lawyers and
they start putting up

154
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,778
roadblocks

155
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,323
where they don't need to be.

156
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,658
I need to have the control

157
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,059
over this situation.
Do you understand me?

158
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,203
Yes, but I need...

159
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,998
I need to defend myself.

160
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,417
I should have

161
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,834
someone to talk to.

162
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,693
You have me. I'm your biggest
advocate here.

163
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,048
I'm taking care of you.

164
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,466
Believe me.

165
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,118
And I'm telling you,
for your own good,

166
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,912
you need to get out
ahead of this thing.

167
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:47,057
Cielo.

168
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,770
Listen.

169
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,272
If you start getting defensive

170
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,856
and have a lawyer,

171
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,925
people won't know
what side you are in.

172
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,596
The prosecutor
will want to interrogate you.

173
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,782
The important thing here

174
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,058
is that you show
you are cooperating.

175
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,494
If you cooperate,

176
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,354
the prosecutor
will treat you differently.

177
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,356
He will treat you
like a victim

178
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,126
and not like an accomplice.

179
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,026
And there's where
everything goes south.

180
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,736
But you don't know
that for sure.

181
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,590
No, no, but I'm almost sure!

182
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,450
That's the way
prosecutors act.

183
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,011
It's in your best interest

184
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,454
to get out there
and show the world

185
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:28,891
you have nothing to hide.

186
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,017
Cielo!

187
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,481
Look...

188
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,757
No one in the world
is more important to me

189
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,944
than your sister.

190
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,113
If something happens to you,

191
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,948
she will be affected.

192
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,451
So I'm doing everything I can

193
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,202
to keep you safe,

194
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,289
to keep you out of this.

195
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,957
You telling me

196
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,875
not to talk to a lawyer

197
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,836
doesn't sound like that at all.

198
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,633
On the contrary,

199
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:05,345
It sounds like what you want

200
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,056
is to get Walter at all costs.

201
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,851
No matter the consequences.

202
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,645
Listen...

203
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,772
Let's slow down.

204
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,859
Relax.

205
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,492
You can talk to a lawyer later,

206
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:31,035
but not now.

207
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,749
Now, what we need to do,

208
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,960
we need to go get the kids,

209
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,945
we need to bring them
to my house.

210
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,757
María is there.

211
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,552
She will take care of them.

212
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,846
They will be safe.

213
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,557
An we are going

214
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,100
to help each other

215
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,022
to put this animal away.

216
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,694
Okay?

217
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,111
Henry...

218
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,388
- Come on, come on.
- Henry!

219
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,848
- Let's talk in the car.
- Am I under arrest?

220
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,368
What?

221
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,566
- Am I under arrest?
- No, no, no, no, no.

222
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,001
No, no, no.

223
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,421
No, no, I didn't say that!

224
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,321
You're not thinking straight
about this.

225
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,758
You have to listen--

226
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,157
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

227
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,576
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

228
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,011
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:33,558
Are you arresting me?

230
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,540
Am I under arrest?

231
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,465
Brother...

232
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,009
I have to do something.

233
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,135
There is no other way.

234
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,140
What are you doing, Stewart?

235
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,559
Are you going to tell me

236
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,895
that you didn't think about it?

237
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,313
When are we going to have

238
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,565
another opportunity like this

239
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,776
to do it?

240
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,486
We are here to do a job,

241
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,904
not to play.

242
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,864
I know, but this feels good.

243
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,203
Screw it.

244
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,255
I'm just saying one thing

245
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,258
to take it out of my head.

246
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,177
Anybody could think

247
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:37,431
of escaping with all this money.

248
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,141
I'm just telling one thing

249
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,269
for you to forget about that.

250
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,104
The owner of this money

251
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,900
killed ten guys in jail

252
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,026
in two minutes.

253
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,445
I have already forgotten it.

254
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,409
Good.

255
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,875
Listen, kid, you have to hide

256
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,292
those bags.

257
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,985
The monkey is in the banana
patch, understand?

258
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,838
Please, call me

259
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,215
when you get this.

260
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,633
Aaah!

261
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,343
This was the third message.

262
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,887
Where the hell is that kid?

263
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,291
- That's Cielo.
- Don't answer.

264
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,960
- We need to talk.
- No, no!

265
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,437
You answer that phone

266
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,088
and Henry Navarro
is on the other end of the line

267
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,149
with a legal wire tap

268
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,318
recording everything you say.

269
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,779
You're not doing

270
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,238
anybody any favors.

271
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,514
In fact, why do you still have
a battery in that thing?

272
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,659
Take it out.

273
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,311
They might be trying
to triangulate your movements.

274
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,354
Take it out!
I'm not being paranoid.

275
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,793
I'm sure she talked to Henry!

276
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,669
She just panicked.

277
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,504
She went right to him

278
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,047
without even talking to me.

279
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,507
Without a moment's hesitation.

280
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,009
Now you have to relax.

281
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,177
I'm not saying it's not bad,

282
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,888
but it could be worse.

283
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,164
How much worse could it be,
Saúl?

284
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,100
You mean like a fire rain?

285
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,518
Something like that?

286
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,312
I'm just seeing the facts.

287
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,105
Let's think.

288
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,441
What does she actually know?

289
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,509
What can she tell
your brother-in-law?

290
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,946
It's only hearsay.

291
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,530
The only real evidence

292
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,932
that she can lead them to
is your money.

293
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,392
Once we take care of that,
then they have nothing.

294
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,811
- There is no evidence.
- Nothing?

295
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,246
What do you mean, Saúl?

296
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,499
Henry knows the truth.

297
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,917
That's not nothing!

298
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,836
Okay, that's something.

299
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,253
I don't know what to do!

300
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,297
Have you given any thought

301
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,300
to sending your brother-in-law

302
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,303
on a trip to a Caribbean island?

303
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,721
What does that mean?

304
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,431
You know, where Mario went to,

305
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,850
for instance.

306
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,750
- Henry is family!
- Okay, it's an option.

307
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,186
No, no!

308
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,586
- Family!
- I'm just telling--

309
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,505
You have to understand that!
That's sacred!

310
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,983
I'm just telling you.

311
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,400
No, you are sick!

312
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,819
You don't mention that option.

313
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,887
It's an option
that has worked very well

314
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,073
for you in the recent past.

315
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,491
That's why I mention it.

316
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,892
- No, no!
- Okay, okay!

317
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,601
I take it back.
You respect family.

318
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,021
- I didn't talk.
- Exactly! It's sacred!

319
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm just throwing
thoughts out there.

320
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,208
This is a creative meeting.

321
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,860
I'm going to send you
to some island!

322
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,337
No, you don't need to say

323
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,755
this ugly stuff, Walter.

324
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,173
Relax.

325
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,591
Finally.

326
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,010
What took you so long?

327
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,469
Have you two been followed?

328
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,370
If they had, we'd all be
in handcuffs right now.

329
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,514
Let's go.

330
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,594
I took the tops off
in case you wanted

331
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,155
to see it's all there.

332
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,200
Good.

333
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,745
But I don't.

334
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,454
A few bills

335
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,956
won't make a difference.

336
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,441
If you need any help
transporting these,

337
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,877
just tell us.

338
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,545
We could hold the barrels

339
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,963
because they really move.

340
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,089
I'll manage.

341
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,807
Saúl.

342
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,394
Pay them.

343
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,812
Take your cut.

344
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,230
The rest is mine,

345
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,941
in case I need you.

346
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,358
In case you need me?

347
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,217
I'm thinking
the probability is high.

348
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,653
Find José Miguel,

349
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,072
that's important now.

350
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,489
Keys.

351
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,615
Close it.

352
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,966
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need to talk to Saúl.</font></i>

353
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,993
I'm Cielo,
Walter Blanco's wife.

354
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,889
Francisca, don't tell me that.

355
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,808
I know he's there,

356
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,250
but he doesn't
want to talk to me.

357
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,811
Get him on the phone.

358
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,562
Okay, okay.

359
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,981
Just tell me

360
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,275
if my husband was there.

361
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,694
What do you mean you don't know?

362
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,197
Was he there or not?

363
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,537
Aaah!

364
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,711
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Open the door</font></i>

365
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,880
because I'm not leaving.

366
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,864
I will be here
as long as it takes.

367
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,574
Just you.

368
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,441
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cielo, tell me Henry went</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">crazy.</font></i>

369
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,610
Tell me he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

370
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,756
That he's not fine.

371
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,591
Please, please!

372
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,094
You have to give me something

373
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:51,430
because I can't believe this.

374
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,973
I can't believe it.

375
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,099
This is not true, right?

376
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,313
Is this true?

377
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,817
This can't be true, Cielo!

378
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,155
How long have you known?

379
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,949
Please, tell me.

380
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,785
Tell me!

381
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,245
When you did that in the pool,

382
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,956
that's when you knew.

383
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,648
Was this the reason
you did that?

384
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,691
Tell me, please.
Tell me.

385
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,088
No.

386
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,798
Do you know this

387
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,425
since Gustavo Cortés?

388
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,137
Aaah!

389
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,056
The money.

390
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,725
All that money that he made...

391
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,811
And your whole gambling story.

392
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:43,107
That was all a lie.

393
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,566
Of course you knew

394
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,985
because you

395
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,321
made up all that story.

396
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,572
God!

397
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,313
Tell me, please,
did you know it

398
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,707
before Henry was shot?

399
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,542
Tell me, please.

400
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,544
I'm asking you!

401
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,946
- I'm sorry, Ma--
- You're sorry?

402
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,715
You're crazy!

403
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,135
You won't talk to Henry

404
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,552
because you think that Walter

405
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,222
is going to get away with this.

406
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,348
Mom.

407
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,102
Mom.

408
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,061
Come here.

409
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,564
What are you doing?

410
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,483
Don't touch my child!

411
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,568
No, stop!

412
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,221
- You won't take my child.
- She's coming with us.

413
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,657
I'm not leaving her here.

414
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,099
- Let her with me.
- No!

415
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,660
She's coming with us.

416
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,061
- Give her back to me.
- No!

417
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,146
- Henry, help me!
- I'm calling the police!

418
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,772
- Give her back!

419
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,500
- No!

420
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,482
- Give me my child back!

421
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,609
- Let me go!
- Give me my daughter!

422
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,338
What's going on?

423
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,881
María, give her back.

424
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,342
Give me my child right now!

425
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,783
- No, Henry!
- Let her go.

426
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,012
María!

427
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,805
María, now!

428
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,417
It's okay, darling.
It's okay, honey.

429
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,437
It's okay, it's okay.

430
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,362
Everything's fine, darling.

431
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,321
It's okay.

432
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,162
Promise this to me, Henry.

433
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,355
Promise me you're going
to get that son of a bitch!

434
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,915
Promise!

435
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,329
34, 59, 20.

436
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:29,166
106, 36, 52.

437
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:36,030
34, 59, 20,
106, 36, 52.

438
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,777
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter?</font></i>

439
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,031
Where are--?

440
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,620
What happened to you?

441
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,091
Walter, Walter,

442
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,010
You moved the money, didn't you?

443
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,888
You buried it somewhere.

444
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:28,225
Did you get my messages?

445
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:31,168
Walter,
I told Henry nothing.

446
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,605
I swear I didn't.

447
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,147
I didn't say a word to him.

448
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,069
Say something.

449
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,011
Talk to me, say something.
Please.

450
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,448
Talk to me.

451
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,574
Walter, Walter!

452
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,826
How long was I out?

453
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,330
I don't know, hours.

454
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,546
The cancer's back.

455
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,049
Right?

456
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:48,263
Does that make you happy?

457
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,124
I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

458
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,939
Just tell me.

459
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,899
I know you talked with Henry.

460
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,945
I know you made a deal.

461
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,576
Tell me.

462
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,578
I'll make this easy.

463
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,788
I'll give myself up.

464
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,957
If you promise me one thing.

465
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:22,881
You keep the money.

466
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,300
Never speak of it.

467
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,135
Never give it up.

468
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,471
I want--

469
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,557
You pass it on to our children.

470
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,642
All of it.

471
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,143
Please, Cielo,

472
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,646
Give them everything.

473
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,064
Please don't let me

474
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:42,191
have done all this for nothing.

475
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,576
How did Henry find out?

476
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,578
Did somebody talk?

477
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,624
No one talked.

478
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,961
I screwed up.

479
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,925
When I talked to him,

480
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,719
he only had suspicions.

481
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,889
Not much else.

482
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,395
You can't give yourself up

483
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,980
without giving up the money.

484
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,735
It's the way this works.

485
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,861
I think...

486
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,407
I think...

487
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,576
we should stay quiet.

488
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,498
We should stay quiet.

489
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,234
Okay, you can take it off now.

490
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,798
So, tell me.

491
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:30,467
What's so important

492
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:33,577
you had to come
all the way out here?

493
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,621
For the amount of money
I'm bringing in,

494
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,056
I think I deserve to see exactly

495
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,309
why it's all going so wrong.

496
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,898
Are you an expert

497
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,609
on meth labs now?

498
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,569
Are you going tell us

499
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,738
how to fix our operation?

500
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,139
Are you going to teach us
how to do what we do?

501
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,950
And what if I can help?

502
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,371
What will it hurt to show it?

503
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,123
Nothing.

504
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,083
I don't like

505
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,502
my time being wasted.

506
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,920
Well, I'm here,

507
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,612
and ten minutes
is a small sacrifice

508
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,048
when we're talking

509
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,825
about a 50 million shortfall.
Don't you think so?

510
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,845
So?

511
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,892
Go ahead.

512
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,908
Safe to come down?

513
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,867
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes.</font></i>

514
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,663
Ladies first.

515
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:57,845
Aguirre, wake up!

516
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,151
Okay, now you've seen it.

517
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,195
Yes.

518
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,072
I've seen it.

519
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,490
So what?

520
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,391
You could start cleaning
a little bit.

521
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:20,827
This place is filthy.

522
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,996
What are you, my mother?

523
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,331
This is not filthy.

524
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,083
The problem

525
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,485
is we don't have
much light down here.

526
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,921
This doesn't have

527
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,613
the quality standards
of your predecessor

528
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,048
Not even close.

529
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,867
I don't care a shit
about my predecessor.

530
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,053
The product we're making here

531
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,597
is selling just fine.

532
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,123
Heisenberg's standards
don't matter anymore.

533
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,977
To whom?

534
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,962
A bunch of scabby
local tweakers?

535
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,631
They matter to my buyer
in the Czech Republic.

536
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,066
Therefore, they matter to me.

537
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,467
- Listen, lady--
- You listen!

538
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,636
I cannot move
what this person is making

539
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,572
if it's substandard.

540
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,991
No offense.

541
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,409
You can do better, do better.

542
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,537
I don't know what to tell you.

543
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,772
I mean, you tried to get
the man back, right?

544
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:09,208
That Heisenberg.

545
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,069
He said no, so I mean,
what do you want me to do?

546
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,505
Peto.

547
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,156
Use Peto again.
He learned from Heisenberg.

548
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,076
At least Peto's first two cooks
were at 74%.

549
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,995
On his third cook,
he started a fire

550
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,932
we almost go all to hell!

551
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,018
Listen, lady...

552
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:29,771
I want to cook in my territory,

553
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,690
I want to use guys that I trust,

554
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,984
not Todd, who I don't.

555
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,885
And do you know
why I don't trust him?

556
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,887
Because he's not
one of my people.

557
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,764
And that's the end
of the conversation,
as far as I'm concerned.

558
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,183
- Period.
- It's a shame.

559
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,228
I really wish you'd have given
him a chance.

560
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,234
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Boss!</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">We have a problem!</font></i>

561
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,387
Mrs.,

562
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:06,516
You wait for me here.

563
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,103
Heisenberg!

564
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,086
Who is Heisenberg?

565
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,271
I can't believe you.

566
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,690
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Open!</font></i>

567
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,888
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Done!</font></i>

568
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,280
I don't want to see anything.

569
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,850
Maybe you should
close your eyes.

570
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,203
I'll help you.

571
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,915
Slowly.

572
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:15,127
The other leg.

573
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,628
Okay.

574
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,571
Now I need you to lift
your right leg.

575
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,532
Higher, higher.
That's it.

576
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,343
Relax, everything's fine.

577
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,762
Now to the left.

578
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,598
That's it, walk.

579
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,600
Wait a minute.

580
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,685
That's it.

581
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,104
Don't worry.

582
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,131
Here we have a stone.
Right.

583
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,526
Hold on one moment.

584
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,032
Uncle, what about this one?

585
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,493
Ouch! Look at him.

586
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,689
Tell the lady
to close her eyes real tight.

587
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,876
We are saying it beforehand.

588
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,255
Now you can go on.

589
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,991
- Relax.
- We're good now.

590
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,409
I need you to lift
your right foot a little bit.

591
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,972
Easy, that's it.

592
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,016
Now lift the left leg.

593
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,142
Higher, that's it.

594
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,938
Okay, boys.

595
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,089
Let's get everything
in the lab.

596
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,091
- We pack and we leave.
- You heard him!

597
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,527
Let's see.

598
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:25,554
Let's get all that stuff
and get out of here!

599
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,009
Could you sleep?

600
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,135
Not much.

601
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,473
And you?

602
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,016
No.

603
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,526
Are you going to work?

604
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,654
No, I don't feel like it.

605
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,780
And you?

606
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,995
You have to tell them, Henry.

607
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,082
Today.

608
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,941
No, María,
I just don't have it yet.

609
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,294
I don't have anything.

610
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,712
I don't have what I need

611
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,381
to prove Walter is Heisenberg.

612
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,801
I have nothing, María.

613
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,386
But...

614
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,097
Why don't you tell Gómez?

615
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,099
Ramón?

616
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,642
They are going to believe you.

617
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,252
Honey, put the whole
anti-narcotics

618
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,272
working on this.

619
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,689
That's how it works.

620
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,525
No, María, no, no, no.

621
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,195
You can't do it alone, Henry.

622
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,805
- You can't.
- María, listen to me.

623
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,557
They have warned me
at the office.

624
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,103
I can't work on this case.
Do you get it?

625
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,291
It's different now.

626
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,417
Show them what you have.

627
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,629
Look, the day I go in with this,

628
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,239
that's the last day
of my career, all right?

629
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,674
Get it, María!

630
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,176
What am I going to do?

631
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,535
I'll walk in there, look them
in the eye and tell them:

632
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,454
"Partners, the person
I've been investigating

633
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,224
for so long,

634
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,500
the drug dealer,
the murderer,

635
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,647
is my own brother-in-law".

636
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,966
María, if I do that,
that's the end for me.

637
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,693
I have nothing left.

638
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,112
Done.

639
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:33,325
I'll be no more than a civilian

640
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:36,352
and I we won't be able
to help Cielo.

641
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,664
So...

642
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,791
when I go to the police,

643
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,668
I need go with proofs,

644
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:48,213
not with suspicions.

645
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,261
I can be the man who caught him.

646
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,498
I'm going to be
the man who caught him.

647
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:04,504
What if you wait and they catch
Walter without you?

648
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,941
If they find out that you knew

649
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,567
and you said nothing?

650
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,987
Wouldn't you go to jail too?

651
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,546
Hey, boss.

652
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,923
What's up?

653
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,741
- How are you?
- Brother!

654
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,177
So good to see you, bro!

655
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,577
- Yes.
- How are you?

656
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,555
Better, brother, better.

657
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,973
Did you miss me?

658
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,683
I couldn't stop crying.

659
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,101
Really?

660
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,811
Like I miss

661
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,313
my balls.

662
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,814
Do you have balls?

663
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,568
I didn't know it, bro!

664
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,052
- What's new?
- Everything's fine.

665
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,655
I organized your schedule.

666
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,410
You have a budget meeting,

667
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,310
and then you have
a meet and greet

668
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,746
with the guys.

669
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,206
Let's see if we can get

670
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,417
that budget meeting pushed.

671
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:06,834
Why?

672
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,254
I need to check something.

673
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:10,653
Boy.
- Easy, brother.

674
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,215
Don't ask, just help me.

675
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,593
Okay.

676
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:18,287
- Good.
- Thanks.

677
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,722
Welcome.

678
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,140
Thanks, bro.

679
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,583
Did you hear
about that money thing?

680
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,271
What money thing?

681
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,688
Don't you know?

682
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,132
It involves your old pal,
José Miguel Rosas.

683
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:32,777
Rosas?

684
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,820
Ha ha, you're going to love it.

685
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,822
I'll tell you later.

686
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,833
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll give you this, Rosas.</font></i>

687
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,793
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You're never boring.</font></i>

688
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,382
So, bro.

689
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,218
Do you want to say something?

690
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,288
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars

691
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,099
all over the south of Bogotá?

692
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,101
Talk.

693
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,111
I promise you we can hold out

694
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,988
just as long as you can.

695
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,406
That's a fact.

696
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,850
I got a bladder the size
of a hot water bottle.

697
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,331
All that cash?

698
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:28,857
I wouldn't be able to stop
talking about it.

699
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,275
And I don't think
I'd be tossing it

700
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,420
out my car window.

701
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,838
I barely can take vacations

702
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,675
with my salary.

703
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,702
And I definitely
can't be playing Robin Hood.

704
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:46,666
But apparently Rosas here
is just raking it in.

705
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,186
Yes.

706
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,938
He's just missing the costume.

707
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,732
Osorio, you know what?

708
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:58,053
I believe he has a good reason
for doing what he did.

709
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,556
And I'm sure he has a perfectly
reasonable explanation

710
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:04,117
for where he got it.

711
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,499
He found it.

712
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:11,501
Yes.

713
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,045
Or won it in a card game, maybe.

714
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,047
Who knows?

715
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:19,008
That's it!

716
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,844
Lucky night at the casino.

717
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:24,472
Rosas!

718
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,474
Are we right?

719
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,476
Did you have a lucky night?

720
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,571
Okay, boy.

721
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,431
We're going to let you gather
your thoughts.

722
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,454
Do you want something?

723
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,249
Coffee? A soda?

724
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,795
Thought not.

725
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,933
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So?</font></i>

726
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:10,768
Not talking?

727
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,728
Not a word.

728
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,423
Gentlemen, I'm in the middle
of another investigation,

729
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:18,841
and I would like to talk
to José Miguel Rosas,

730
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,278
if you and your office

731
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,404
don't have problems with that.

732
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,534
I have a history with him.

733
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,952
Personal.

734
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,146
He hates me,
he can't stand me.

735
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,315
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

736
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,792
Do you understand?

737
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,420
He can start talking.

738
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,171
You know, any kid like him...

739
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,090
starts talking with something.

740
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,259
I go in, when he's ready

741
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,428
to deliver the information,

742
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,805
you go in and finish with him.

743
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,223
What do you say?

744
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,642
Of course,

745
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,959
if he gives me anything useful
while he's with me,

746
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,438
I'll share it.

747
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,397
What do you say?

748
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:01,152
I could use a smoke break.

749
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,570
And you?

750
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,721
Maybe you could keep an eye
on our suspect for us.

751
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,658
Just for a few minutes.

752
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:08,808
- Do it.
- Thanks, gentlemen.
