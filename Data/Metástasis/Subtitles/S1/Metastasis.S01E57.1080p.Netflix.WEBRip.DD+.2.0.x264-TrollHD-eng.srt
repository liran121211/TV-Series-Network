1
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,196
Hi, teach?

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,781
It's me.

3
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,891
I don't mean to bother,
I know you're pretty busy

4
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,685
with your retirement
and everything.

5
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,538
But it's very important for me

6
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,981
that you know about
everything that's been going on.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,275
Remember the buyer
you introduced me to?

8
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,611
The guy I was
cooking with?

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,529
Well, it turned out
that...

10
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,699
Well, this guy and I
had some sort of...

11
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
misunderstanding, you
know.

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,930
So...

13
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,371
Well, the thing got
a little messy.

14
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,873
But you don't have to
worry,

15
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,291
it's all straightened
out now.

16
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,852
Just a heads-up,

17
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,502
there's been a kind
of change in management.

18
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,940
Anyway, it's all fine now,

19
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:48,191
I'm taking care of it.

20
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,610
I was just calling because...

21
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,194
Well, er...

22
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,262
It's important for me
that you know everything.

23
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,264
I'm not bothering you
any longer.

24
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,743
That's it.

25
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,351
Feel free to call me
if you want the details,

26
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,413
'cause here I am.

27
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,790
Don't you worry.

28
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,665
Bye.

29
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,453
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So there I was,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">on the tanker, right?</font></i>

30
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,622
Pumping the water in,
and the teach's down there,

31
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:22,333
watching to make sure we do it
exactly what he calculated.

32
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,894
And we gotta be real precise,

33
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,004
'cause you know
methylene and water

34
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,088
-weigh different.
-That's obvious.

35
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,215
This guy did
his investigation and all,

36
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,735
because we couldn't screw it.

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,178
Anyway, I'm up there
with my hose,

38
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,697
we were running out of time.

39
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,598
And remember
we had that accident there

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,308
-that we made up.
-The bikes and everything.

41
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,019
-The bikes, we know.
-Of course, yeah.

42
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,746
And it was just going on great,

43
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,372
until suddenly...

44
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,941
this truck appeared,
and we were pretty much screwed.

45
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,943
No, no, no,
that was the whole fuss

46
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,987
because the man wanted
to tow the other car, right?

47
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,464
To clean the road.

48
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,948
But, what did
you do then?

49
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,324
Could you do
something
about the man?

50
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,885
What could I do? Tell him?

51
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,494
"Would you please
help me
and take it slower?

52
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,245
We're still stealing
cargo back there".

53
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,747
No, we couldn't do
anything about it.

54
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,083
I was watching there,
and in the meanwhile,

55
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,627
the gallons were just slowly
ticking away.

56
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,671
Until the teach
gave me the sign.

57
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,231
He said, "Cut it".

58
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,299
And so I fling the hose,
I'm grabbing the cap,

59
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,301
I'm screwing in the bolts
and all,

60
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,779
and that was it.

61
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,304
-But guess what?
-What happened?

62
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,348
-The truck started moving.
-And you were on top?

63
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,826
Of course, what could I do?

64
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,243
No, I'd have pissed my pants

65
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,829
But everything went smoothly,

66
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,938
as the teach had organized it,
he's a genius.

67
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,415
Those guys didn't realize

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,959
we were stealing.

69
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,027
It's been the biggest
tanker robbery

70
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,254
in the whole Latin America.

71
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,530
Just imagine,
and who was there?

72
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,132
My nephew.

73
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,575
-Well done, uncle.
-Well done, dork.

74
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,053
Good, that's it.

75
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,995
Can I get you anything
else?

76
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,914
No, beautiful,
I think we're leaving.

77
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,374
I'm ready for the check.
Good.

78
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,293
Can you pay at
the register?

79
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,005
-Fine, thanks.
-Okay.

80
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,611
You ready to cook or what?

81
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,113
For sure.

82
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,805
Are you sure you'll be
able

83
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,515
to run your own lab
and all?

84
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,660
After all I've been telling you,

85
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,037
you've no faith in me?

86
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,997
Trust me!

87
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,624
Well, no more talking, man.

88
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,067
Let's start
making money.

89
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,484
-Good.
-Fine.

90
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,755
You pay, I need to pee.

91
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,321
-Of course.
-I'll be right back.

92
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,756
I'm leaving you too.

93
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,413
This country's
changed.

94
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,331
In my time,
you could really think

95
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,250
of helping others
and all that.

96
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,210
That's why
I got into this stuff,

97
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,130
to see if I could make
a social change.

98
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,899
But I don't know what happened.

99
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,507
I don't know when it was
that we started losing

100
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,485
our moral principles.

101
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,262
No everything's a question
of business, money, bro.

102
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,990
That's too sad.

103
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,160
But you're making money, right?

104
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,019
Well, yeah,
that's the good
part.

105
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,124
You have to be positive.

106
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,191
You've to see the glass
half full.

107
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,318
[laughing
]

108
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,089
Well, then...

109
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,547
Good.

110
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,762
That's it.

111
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,512
Smart asses.

112
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,309
Let's go, we're out of here.

113
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,730
Wake up, we're leaving!

114
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,649
Fine, it's done, let's go.

115
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,985
That's it.

116
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,610
That's it, baldy.

117
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:11,829
José Miguel Rosas.

118
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,251
How are you?

119
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,860
Not so
good?

120
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:24,658
Well, luckily,
I'm here to help you.

121
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,994
I came to talk
about your partner...

122
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,429
What was his name?

123
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,931
Jaisenber...?

124
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,392
Heisenberg...?

125
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,559
Walter B...?

126
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,630
[laughing
]

127
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:43,177
That was the look
I was hoping for.

128
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,989
Thanks for confirming it.

129
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,117
So, bro, lucky for you...

130
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,809
I'm not interested in
you,

131
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,229
I'm more interested in
him.

132
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:57,399
Besides, I got an offer
for you.

133
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,318
If you help me out
here,

134
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,571
if you tell me everything
about you and Walter,

135
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,116
how you cooked the
meth,

136
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,035
who you sold it to,
where you distributed
it,

137
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,121
I promise I'll
help you.

138
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,791
I've a friend on the
case,
he's an attorney

139
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,393
and he'll wipe it off.

140
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,711
Nothing happened
here.

141
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,046
What do you
think?

142
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,236
Look, I know Walter

143
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,971
is the mastermind
on this operation.

144
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,785
And, well...

145
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:35,604
according to the things
you've been doing lately,

146
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,773
I can tell the relationship
between you two

147
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:41,735
is not going that
well.

148
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:47,783
No more chemistry
between the two of you?

149
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,968
Am I wrong?

150
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,935
Why don't you suck it?

151
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,252
[laughing
]

152
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,590
You really want us to
handle it
like this?

153
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,513
Why don't you try
and beat it out of me?

154
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,158
That's your thing, right?

155
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,480
Faggot, look at
yourself.

156
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,234
You're into deep
shit.

157
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,906
What? He
humiliated you?

158
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,783
And he
threatened you,
I guess.

159
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:35,455
I don't see
happiness
anywhere.

160
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,017
Well, for me

161
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,377
happiness doesn't mean
going out there

162
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,772
throwing millions away.

163
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,215
I don't think
Walter

164
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,693
liked that much.

165
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,469
But maybe that's why you
did it,

166
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,614
I understand.

167
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,765
I'd have done the same
thing.

168
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,163
And you know...

169
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,940
Walter's my
brother-in-law.

170
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,526
And that
shithead...

171
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,196
lied to me in
the face.

172
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:11,533
He used me for a
year,
that motherfucker.

173
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,786
Me, he was
mocking me.

174
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,622
So I understand
what you're going through.

175
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,042
Let me tell you,
help me out.

176
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,627
The two of us can catch
him
and put him behind bars.

177
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,505
What do you
say?

178
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,608
Talk.

179
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,028
With you...

180
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,446
never!

181
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,352
Agent Navarro,
glad yo see you.

182
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,829
How many suspects

183
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,415
have you beaten to death lately?

184
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,107
That's his favorite method,
you knew that?

185
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,667
Hasn't he told you?

186
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,944
Hasn't he told you the story
with my client?

187
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,905
Last time they were
alone together, he knocked
the poor kid unconscious.

188
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,383
Who'd think of that?

189
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,117
He's so nice,
with that big smile.

190
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,011
You shouldn't trust him.

191
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,804
So, what do you want, gentlemen?

192
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,348
Another lawsuit?

193
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,249
I could start writing
your names down.

194
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,684
Hey, bye, Rocky!

195
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,710
On your guard,
hit left.

196
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,272
Defense.

197
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,006
And you, boys,
just go and have a coffee,

198
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,777
this will take me quite long.

199
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,845
That's it, no sugar,
it's bad for your nerves.

200
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,781
So...

201
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,396
Let's see, where shall
we start?

202
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,358
First thing, I'm gonna try
to remain calm,

203
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,570
but will you do me a favor
and tell me
what you're thinking?

204
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,031
What the hell is up
with you?

205
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,868
My guys are
busting their asses

206
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,578
trying to hide Walt's
money

207
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,206
from anyone holding
a Government ID.

208
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,417
And you're tossing
yours
out a window?

209
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,128
Like a drunken
Marilyn Monroe?

210
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,981
And I also have to hear

211
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,842
about your little act
of philanthropy on the
news.

212
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,885
What's wrong with
you?

213
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,554
Did you hit your
head
or something

214
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,306
and didn't tell me
about it?

215
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,224
Why didn't you call me
the second you got
arrested?

216
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,226
What did you say to
Navarro?

217
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,312
I didn't tell him anything,
chill out.

218
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,105
Chill out! Chill
out!

219
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,541
Tasty, easy.

220
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,983
Chill
out!

221
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,360
I can't chill out right
now.

222
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,819
Why? 'Cause
things

223
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,713
have gone nuclear.

224
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,365
You get it?
Biblical.

225
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,992
I guess Navarro shared with you
his recent discovery.

226
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,621
Did he? Ok, well,
then...

227
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,957
You realize why I can't
be chilled

228
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,043
or relaxed,

229
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,467
I want you to use
the money I left you

230
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,571
for unexpected events, Saúl.

231
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,514
No, listen for a second,
Saúl, lis--

232
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,158
Saúl, Saúl, listen...

233
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,683
Look, Saúl,
could you please

234
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,077
stop talking for a second?

235
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,232
No, I don't care!
Just make it happen.

236
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,627
You're the one who knows.

237
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,297
Do whatever you have to do, OK?

238
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,424
And call me when he's out.

239
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,133
Good.

240
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,930
Dad, I'm home!

241
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,391
I'm upstairs.

242
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,169
Are you going to work
today?

243
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,856
Yes.

244
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,675
You were out late last
night.

245
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,264
-Dad!
-Yes!

246
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,933
I'm gonna head out,
okay?

247
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,452
Where you going?

248
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,687
I'm going to aunt
María's.

249
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,232
She's just called,
and asked me

250
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,192
to help her out
with the
computer,

251
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,319
and asked me to stay
for dinner.

252
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,029
-Is that cool?
-Cool.

253
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,864
-Alright, bye.
-No, no, no.

254
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,866
Junior, wait a second,
Junior.

255
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,662
I wanted to talk
to you.

256
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,182
Dad, what happened to you?

257
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,293
This? Nothing.
No, I'm fine.

258
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,728
You sure you're fine, dad?

259
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,422
Im sure.
Come, let's talk.

260
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,924
-What?
-I want...

261
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,218
I want us to talk
about a couple of
things.

262
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,028
Sit down.

263
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,326
Er...

264
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,705
Look...

265
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,027
You
know?

266
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,446
I think you
deserve to know

267
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,531
what's happening,
the truth.

268
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:26,788
I don't want to make up

269
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,243
lie
to you anymore,

270
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,806
any more stories.

271
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,040
I passed out
yesterday.

272
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,043
It was a second,
it was very briefly,

273
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,129
but that's how I
got this.

274
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,274
But, why did you pass out?

275
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,026
Because...

276
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,988
Well, my latest scans

277
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,724
show a little shadow on my
lung.

278
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,518
But my doctor put me
right on

279
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,645
a new round of
chemo,

280
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,148
which is why I've been
so weak lately.

281
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,568
Of course, I know I was
pushing myself too hard.

282
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,613
I know that's
bullshit...

283
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,533
But I've learned my lesson,
really.

284
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,952
I know I've to take care
of myself, and I will.

285
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,705
But, what's next?
What do we have to do?

286
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,140
What did they tell you?

287
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,500
Nothing, relax,
calm down.

288
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,979
Don't worry, we'll go on.

289
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,422
That's what we've
always done.

290
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,275
Look, I beat this once.

291
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,676
There's no reason to
think

292
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,945
I won't again.

293
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,804
So don't you
worry.

294
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,515
Besides, the
doctor told me

295
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,017
I'm responding great
to the treatment.

296
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,411
I'm fine, okay?

297
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:39,528
Junior, I need us
to be positive.

298
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,673
Really.

299
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,298
Can you do that?

300
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,703
-Mmmhh.
-Good.

301
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:50,372
Say you
will.

302
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,749
That's it,
perfect.

303
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,712
Well, that's what
I wanted to tell you.

304
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,757
Go to your aunt María's
and help her with the computer.

305
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,592
We'll talk about this
later with your mom.

306
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,153
No, dad, no way.

307
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,070
I'd rather stay here with you.

308
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,418
Hi, love.

309
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,628
Hello.

310
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,987
Hey, wasn't Junior
coming with you?

311
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,407
He had to come? How
come?

312
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,842
How was it?

313
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,955
How'd it go?
That bad?

314
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,628
-I didn't tell them, María.
-Why not, Henry?

315
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,939
It's just not time yet.

316
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,006
María, I can't go there
and tell them,

317
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,717
"Look, the person
I've been chasing

318
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,219
all this time
is my brother-in-law,

319
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,847
I had him in front of my eyes
and didn't see him."

320
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,308
-I can't do that, María.
-Why not, Henry?

321
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,727
Why not? We've already
talked about it this
morning.

322
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,186
You've to tell them
as soon as possible.

323
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,523
What if they found out
you already knew?

324
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,358
I've got some things
I gotta chase down.

325
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,860
-What things?
-Leads.

326
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,113
I've no proof,
I need to gather some proof.

327
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,948
Leads, proof, okay,
what's going on?

328
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,617
Where are you right now?
I want to know.

329
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,637
Look, I'm not hiding anything.

330
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,012
Please, do me a favor.

331
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,014
Let me do my job.

332
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,819
You sure you wanna do this?

333
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,861
Yes.

334
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,164
Now.

335
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,754
My name's Walter Blanco.

336
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,674
My ID number is 970

337
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,926
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">451 822.</font></i>

338
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,303
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm currently living in Bogotá.</font></i>

339
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,933
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is my confession.</font></i>

340
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,655
They're here.

341
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,598
Thank you for coming.

342
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,795
Cielo and I
wanted to tell you--

343
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,356
Good morning, ladies.

344
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,007
My name's César. I'll be
taking care of you today.

345
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,593
Can I start anybody off
with some beverages?

346
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,111
Want to see our wine list?

347
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,530
How about some cocktails to--?

348
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,556
No, thanks,
we'll think about it.

349
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,075
Of course.

350
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,952
I'll leave you the menu.

351
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,619
Excuse me.

352
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,190
-So...
-You're confessing?

353
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,548
There's nothing to confess here.

354
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,198
We're here to talk
about Walter, Jr.

355
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,617
Walter Junior and
Valentina

356
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,244
should be living with
us.

357
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,831
And while we respect
your opinion, María,

358
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,500
we also think that your concern
is exaggerated.

359
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,169
-You do?
-It's misplaced.

360
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,814
Look, this thing you're doing

361
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,298
to take Junior
away from us

362
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,859
and lure him to your house...

363
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,970
-I wasn't trying to lure him.
-Call it what you want.

364
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,323
But the thing is, we believe...

365
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,600
you should leave our children
out of this.

366
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,644
Junior's already had
enough for this year.

367
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,771
How about
that?

368
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,373
Henry, do you realize

369
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,066
what this investigation
will do to Junior?

370
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,420
If he hears all these things?

371
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,488
What do you prefer
him to hear?

372
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,800
Me kicking your door

373
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,034
and arresting
you?

374
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,097
That?

375
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,832
If that day ever comes,
so be it.

376
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,586
But in the meanwhile,
you have no evidence

377
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,631
to support your claims
against me.

378
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,985
Why tear this family apart?

379
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,635
I wanted to tell
you
we've a couple

380
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,471
of specialties
that aren't in the menu:

381
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,348
Raw sea bass,
grilled provolone
cheese--

382
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,242
Look, do us a favor, okay?

383
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,119
We're talking here.

384
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,063
Can you come again later?
Thanks.

385
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,149
How can you sit there
and listen to this?

386
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,669
The kids are in danger,

387
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,903
keeping them under the same roof
as this monster.

388
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,196
-You know that.
-They're safe.

389
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,841
Are they?

390
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,116
You yourself asked me
to take them to my place.

391
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,220
And I brought them back myself.

392
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,973
Look, María...

393
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:46,644
Whatever you think Walter did,

394
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,879
this is not
an ongoing situation.

395
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,048
-Cielo...
-No.

396
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,652
They need to understand.

397
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,804
It's over, really.
It's over.

398
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,264
It's over, it's in the past,
understand me.

399
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,017
And you expect us
to believe you?

400
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,143
After all the lies
you've told us,

401
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,663
you expect us to believe you?

402
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,146
I don't even know
what's true anymore.

403
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,190
That affair of yours?
Did that even happen?

404
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,069
Look, María, that's not
the issue here.

405
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,905
The issue here is that
Junior has just found out

406
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,465
that my cancer's back.

407
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,258
He's already facing the idea

408
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,177
of living without his father.

409
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,388
To put this on top of that?

410
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,390
It's just not right.

411
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,975
Well, look,

412
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,835
are you going to tell me
what's right?

413
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,212
-No, I don't mean that.
-What's right?

414
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,756
Killing
people's right?

415
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,650
Cooking meth?

416
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,360
Controlling a drug cartel?

417
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,844
-Henry...
-Is that right?

418
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,679
-There's no cartel.
-Quit that bullshit!

419
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,305
What do I do
for you to believe me?

420
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,516
Why don't you kill yourself,
Walter?

421
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,143
Why don't you kill
yourself,

422
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,021
cut your veins
or eat some poison,

423
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,899
This whole thing
dies with you, right?

424
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,859
That's what you wanted
to ask Henry, right?

425
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,236
Time, 'cause you're dying.
Come on, do it.

426
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,696
-Kill yourself.
-That's not the answer.

427
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,699
You're right,
it's not a solution.

428
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,327
This motherfucker's not
getting off that easy.

429
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,747
-Henry...
-And the same goes for you,

430
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,541
if you stick with him.
You know what, brother?

431
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,644
This is it.

432
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,147
Because I'm not going to allow

433
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,256
you to walk away
with this one,

434
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,734
did you understand?

435
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,444
That is not what we're saying.

436
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,138
We're here to talk
about something else.

437
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,158
Enough with the bullshit!

438
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,535
You're just a couple of liars.

439
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,995
I'm not here to negotiate

440
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,081
your way out of this thing.

441
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,916
No, sir.

442
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,501
There's only one solution here,

443
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,237
and that would be your facing
everything you've done here.

444
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,673
You get it?

445
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,092
There's no other way.

446
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,974
Let's go now.

447
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,813
OK.

448
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,920
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">My name is Walter Blanco.</font></i>

449
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:22,466
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">My ID number is 970 451 822.</font></i>

450

451
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,681
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is my confession.</font></i>

452
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,167
If you're watching this tape,
I'm probably dead.

453
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,420
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">murdered by my brother-in-law,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry Navarro.</font></i>

454
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,983
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mr. Navarro has been building</font></i>

455
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,718
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">a meth empire</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for over a year now,</font></i>

456
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,405
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and using me as his chemist.</font></i>

457
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,367
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Shortly after my 50th birthday,</font></i>

458
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,827
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">my brother-in-law asked me</font></i>

459
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,520
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">that I use</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">my chemistry knowledge</font></i>

460
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,149
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">at his service,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to cook methamphetamine.</font></i>

461
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,110
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He would then</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">be in charge of the rest,</font></i>

462
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,905
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">like the distribution</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of this drug,</font></i>

463
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,342
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">using the connections he made</font></i>

464
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,786
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">during his career</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">at the Anti-narcotics agency.</font></i>

465
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,472
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I was astounded at first,</font></i>

466
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,332
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I thought it was impossible</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for a person</font></i>

467
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,936
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">with Henry's high morals,</font></i>

468
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,171
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">for a person</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">that I've always considered</font></i>

469
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,548
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to have an irreproachable</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">code of ethics,</font></i>

470
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,633
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to be making</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">such a proposition to me.</font></i>

471
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,153
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, at that time</font></i>

472
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,489
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I was particularly vulnerable,</font></i>

473
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,726
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">something he knew</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and took advantage of.</font></i>

474
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:35,188
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I had been just diagnosed</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">with cancer at the time,</font></i>

475
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,151
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and the whole thing</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">had affected me deeply.</font></i>

476
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,672
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Above all, I was worried</font></i>

477
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,426
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">about my family's wellbeing.</font></i>

478
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,453
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So Henry took me</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for a ride one day,</font></i>

479
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,249
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">let's say he invited me</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to witness an operation,</font></i>

480
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,227
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">it was a raid on a lab,</font></i>

481
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,211
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">one of those meth labs,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and he did that,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">among other things,</font></i>

482
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,899
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to show me how...</font></i>

483
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,442
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">such a small meth operation</font></i>

484
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,801
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">could make me earn</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">loads of money.</font></i>

485
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:08,572
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So I was weak and accepted.</font></i>

486
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,349
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">At the time, Henry</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">had partnered up</font></i>

487
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,685
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">with an important businessman,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mr. Gustavo Cortés.</font></i>

488
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,372
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's a well-known entrepreneur,</font></i>

489
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,818
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he owns a huge</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">chain of restaurants</font></i>

490
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:26,465
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He managed to somehow sell me</font></i>

491
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,700
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">into servitude</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to this Mr. Cortés,</font></i>

492
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,037
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">they made me cook,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">as they say,</font></i>

493
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,514
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">this synthetic drug</font></i>

494
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,058
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">at a very sophisticated lab,</font></i>

495
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,227
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">owned by Mr. Cortés.</font></i>

496
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,271
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">At some point, I wanted to quit</font></i>

497
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,231
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and retire from all this,</font></i>

498
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:47,903
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but Gustavo Cortés's answer was</font></i>

499
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:53,599
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">not only threatening me,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">but also my family:</font></i>

500
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,395
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he threatened to kill</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">my wife and my two kids,</font></i>

501
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,856
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">so I had no other choice</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">but stay.</font></i>

502
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,649
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Eventually, they started</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">having some trouble,</font></i>

503
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,526
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Gustavo Cortés</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and my brother-in-law.</font></i>

504
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,797
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know the exact reason,</font></i>

505
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:10,092
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but those differences they had</font></i>

506
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,510
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">put some distance between them</font></i>

507
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,537
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and they ended up having</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">a huge fight.</font></i>

508
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:19,334
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So much so, Gustavo Cortés</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">attacked my brother-in-law.</font></i>

509
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:24,130
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He failed,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">but he was seriously injured</font></i>

510
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,923
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and had to stay in bed</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for a while,</font></i>

511
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,902
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">totally unable to walk.</font></i>

512
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:32,347
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">During that time,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I had to pay his bills.</font></i>

513
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:36,226
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It was a total amount</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of 350 million pesos,</font></i>

514
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,245
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">that's what his therapy cost.</font></i>

515
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,272
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've the proof</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to support that.</font></i>

516
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:45,419
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The thing is, when he recovered,</font></i>

517
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:49,006
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he was bent on revenge.</font></i>

518
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:56,579
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So he partnered up</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">with some Héctor Salamanca,</font></i>

519
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,957
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and together they plotted</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to kill Cortés.</font></i>

520
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:06,190
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, you know how that ended.</font></i>

521
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,693
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I was the one who built the bomb</font></i>

522
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,470
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">they used</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">against Gustavo Cortés.</font></i>

523
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,114
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I had to do it.</font></i>

524
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,409
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">My brother-in-law forced me to</font></i>

525
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,537
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've to confess that</font></i>

526
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,273
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've tried to kill myself</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">a number of times,</font></i>

527
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:26,252
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But I've never been able to.</font></i>

528
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,963
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I haven't had the guts.</font></i>

529
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,383
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm a coward.</font></i>

530
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,471
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I wanted to go to the police,</font></i>

531
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,915
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but I was scared, I didn't know</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">whom I could trust.</font></i>

532
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,502
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I didn't know if he had</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">more connections there,</font></i>

533
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,063
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and that's impossible now,</font></i>

534
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,339
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he's been promoted</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to the head of the department.</font></i>

535
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,276
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Of course, having that position,</font></i>

536
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,446
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he kept me in line,</font></i>

537
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,764
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and he even kidnapped,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">let's say he kept my children</font></i>

538
00:25:56,806 --> 00:26:02,103
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">at his house for three months,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">just to put some pressure on me.</font></i>

539
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,039
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">My wife doesn't know.</font></i>

540
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:07,484
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">She has never been aware</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of my activities,</font></i>

541
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:14,824
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and she was horrified.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I understand that.</font></i>

542
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:20,497
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I hated myself for what</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I had brought upon my family.</font></i>

543
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,183
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I tried once again to quit,</font></i>

544
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,268
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and this was his answer.</font></i>

545
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:34,552
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I live in fear every day,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't...</font></i>

546
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,804
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">when he'll kill me,</font></i>

547
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,016
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">or what's worst, if he'll do</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">something to my family.</font></i>

548
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,162
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So my last resort was</font></i>

549
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,746
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to make this video</font></i>

550
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,231
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and hope that somebody</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">will finally learn about it.</font></i>

551
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,127
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That the whole world finds out</font></i>

552
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,944
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">the kind of person</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry Navarro is.</font></i>

553
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,592
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That's what I hope.</font></i>

554
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,411
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I want him to be</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">finally exposed.</font></i>

555
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,277
Who do you think ...

556
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,737
he's shown this to, Henry?

557
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,202
It's a threat against me.

558
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,853
He hasn't showed this
to anyone.

559
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,731
Henry, you've to show this
to your boss tomorrow.

560
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,526
I mean, anyone who knows you
must know you don't--

561
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,462
350 million what?

562
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,113
What's he talking about,

563
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,908
My God.
-María.

564
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,386
No, María...

565
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,179
350 million what?

566
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,056
Henry, I was told that money

567
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,848
was gambling money.

568
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,754
What was gambling
money?

569
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,590
María, please,
what are you...?

570
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,067
How was I supposed to know?

571
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,301
How would I know
where it came from?

572
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,324
So my treatment...

573
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,101
was paid with that
money, María?

574
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,061
What about my
insurance?

575
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,729
It wouldn't have covered
the treatment

576
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,249
we wanted to give you,

577
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,108
and I wanted
the best for you, Henry.

578
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,836
Why didn't you tell me?

579
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,654
Because you wouldn't
have accepted.

580
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,492
Without it, you may never
have been able to walk again.

581
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,296
María, I've nothing
left.

582
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,939
I'm done with this.

583
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,986
Son of a bitch.

584
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,487
What are we going to do?

585
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,987
If I were you,
I'd be more nervous.

586
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,715
Hey! But, why?

587
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,825
Why do these meetings
must always take place

588
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,410
at the bottom of the
world?

589
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,663
The typical kind of
place
where you get killed

590
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,723
and buried.

591
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,177
The car's clean.

592
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,704
I wouldn't have driven it here
if it wasn't.

593
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,973
You should get one of these.

594
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,475
It's easy.

595
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,934
Besides, it reads radio signals.

596
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,293
And you can get it
on the Internet

597
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,854
and save that pain in the ass...

598
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,134
What does Henry
know?

599
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,198
He knows you're Heisenberg,

600
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,116
but I think that's all.

601
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,286
Otherwise, you'd be locked up.

602
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,811
What did he say,
exactly?

603
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,566
He wanted to know
everything about you,

604
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,670
everything we did.

605
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,963
What else?

606
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,114
I don't think he's told
anyone else.

607
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,636
No one, not even Anti-narcotics.

608
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,680
Why do you say that?

609
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:32,164
Just him being there
all by himself.

610
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,917
He seemed to be acting
on his own.

611
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,754
Everything was on tape,
and he came
and turned off the camera.

612
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,505
He was acting weird,
he didn't want

613
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,507
the rest of the policemen
to hear anything.

614
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,068
Alright, good.

615
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,653
Could we now please talk

616
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:47,764
about that shit rain
he brought upon us,

617
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,617
thanks to this good Samaritan?

618
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,578
Do you want to hazard a guess

619
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,687
what his little charity drive
cost you?

620
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,939
Why don't you go
take a walk, Saúl?

621
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,784
Will you let me help
you, Jose?

622
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,286
Don't act tough,
man.

623
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,706
I don't like seeing you
like that.

624
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:17,251
Maybe it's time for a
change.

625
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:20,170
- What kinda change?
-I don't know.

626
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,022
I don't know exactly.

627
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,594
Maybe it's time for you to just
leave all of this behind, Jose.

628
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,141
Get away,
move away from Bogotá and...

629
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,559
start all over again.
Look,

630
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,353
Saúl knows a man.
He specializes

631
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,457
in giving people new identities.

632
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:41,918
He moves them far away

633
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,278
and sets them up
with a whole new life.

634
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,217
Maybe that's what you need.

635
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,076
No, I know it may sound
a little bit extreme,

636
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:55,790
but if you think about it,
it makes sense.

637
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,559
Imagine that!

638
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,295
Starting a new life,
far away from here.

639
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:04,274
You deserve that, Jose!

640
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,776
Just think about it.

641
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,636
You finally get
the job you want,

642
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,281
something you like.

643
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:14,493
A girl, a good woman

644
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,978
to start the family
you've ever wanted with.

645
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,582
Look, if I could,

646
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,358
I'd change a thousand things
in my life.

647
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,193
I'd change decisions
I've made,

648
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:28,614
I'd change moments,
people, meetings.

649
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,723
If I could simply

650
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,124
had a chance to hit
the reset button.

651
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,005
In a few years, this might
all feel like nothing more
than a bad dream.

652
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,239
Come on, bro.

653
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,454
Would you just,

654
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,980
for once, stop manipulating
me?

655
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,457
What?

656
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,171
You've heard me.

657
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,407
Can you just stop working me
for, like, ten seconds
straight?

658
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,116
Stop jerking me around,
please.

659
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,221
I am not working you.

660
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,455
That's exactly
what you're doing, bro.

661
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,710
Just drop the whole
concerned dad thing

662
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,963
and tell me the
truth.

663
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,549
This whole thing you're
saying,

664
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,718
that I should
get lost,

665
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,472
you make it sound as if
it was for my own good,

666
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,077
for my own interest.

667
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,104
But you know this whole
thing's
really about you, bro.

668
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,648
Am I
wrong?

669
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,292
'Cause you are the one

670
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,444
who's got an interest
in me leaving town.

671
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,422
And you know why?

672
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,573
'Cause you know
your dickhead brother-in-law

673
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,658
won't give it up
until you fall,

674
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,993
and he catches
you.

675
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,540
Just ask me to do
you a favor.

676
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,188
Face it, bro.

677
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,134
Just tell me,
for the first time in
your life,

678
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,762
that you don't give
a shit
about me.

679
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,267
It's either that,
or you will just

680
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,853
have to kill me,
same way you did with
Mario.

681
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,817
I mean, isn't that
what this is all about?

682
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,111
Us meeting
way the hell out here?

683
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,257
In case I say no?

684
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:42,873
Tell me, Walter,
just look into my eyes

685
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,834
and tell me you need
me

686
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,852
to save your ass.

687
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,881
Or just kill me out
here.

688
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,959
-Thank you very much.
-Thanks.

689
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,602
Hey, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

690
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:51,025
Can you take over
the register for me?

691
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,836
Cielo, are you listening?

692
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,451
Look, the tape thing
worked,
I assure you.

693
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,246
We're fine, we're
cool.

694
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,324
Tell me one thing.

695
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,267
How come Oscar and Rodolfo
are watching over

696
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,270
José Miguel Rosas out there,
at the lawyer's office?

697
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,898
I put them on
it.

698
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,624
How come, you put them on it?

699
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,214
Okay, fine, I've understood.

700
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,783
Since you're the boss
and they aren't my men,

701
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,552
they're not part of my team,

702
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,661
you can do
whatever you feel like.

703
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,705
I mean, why am I
asking you this?

704
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,768
There's one thing, Henry.

705
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,129
Rosas belongs to
another division, remember.

706
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,981
You got a history with this kid.

707
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,524
He could sue us.

708
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,026
You know what's going on?

709
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,010
What should I say
to the big boss?

710
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,155
I gotta pull my guys out, Henry.

711
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,366
Fine. Take them off.

712
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,077
Isn't that what you want?

713
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,703
Go take them off!

714
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,535
Sure you don't want
to say good-bye to anyone?

715
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,472
No.

716
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,290
Your family, friends,
Andrea or the kid?

717
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,604
No, I'm not saying good-bye.

718
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,798
I'll say it again,
this is the end of it.

719
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,134
Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

720
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,818
You get that?

721
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,157
Good.

722
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:48,433
Afternoon, I need
a new dust filter

723
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,580
for an extra-strong MX 322.

724
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,457
Yeah, I'll pick it up today.

725
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,233
No, no, the vacuum's
still working,

726
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,920
it just doesn't move much.

727
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,297
I mean, not like before.

728
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,907
Yeah, yeah, he's read
the catalogue.

729
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,742
The manual too,
it's clear.

730
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,162
I explained it to him,
he's good with it.

731
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,081
Okay, he'll be waiting for it
in an hour.

732
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,103
It's done.

733
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,549
This time it'll only cost you
500 million.

734
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:27,014
Your benefactor asked me to send
you out with something extra.

735
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,909
Get you started, you know?

736
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,399
Wants you to stay out of trouble
and be able to defend yourself

737
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,484
until you get into the groove
of your new life.

738
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,114
Of course, you don't toss it
out the window

739
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,825
or by the road,
as you usually du.

740
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:50,537
You might wanna think
about making a budget.

741
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,140
Hey!

742
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,957
Hey, no, you can't
do that here, kid!

743
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,102
Don't! Put that out!

744
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,645
Seriously, put that out.

745
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:02,216
Look, Mr. Naturist,
hippie, gypsy, tripy.

746
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm not gonna let you
sabotage this thing!

747
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,864
You hear me?

748
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,933
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high.

749
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,660
So stop screwing around,

750
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,978
because we'll just
be in trouble.

751
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,956
Don't keep that, don't.

752
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,499
Leave it here, leave it.

753
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,821
Some people are immune
to good advice.

754
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,823
I'm gonna get a bag
for this cash.

755
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,827
Don't even think about
lighting up again!

756
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,766
Francisca!

757
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,794
I need a bag, a suitcase,
a backpack, anything.

758
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,928
He's gonna drop you
at the pickup spot

759
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,281
and he'll leave immediately.

760
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,907
Why?

761
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,183
Guy won't pick you up
if you've got company.

762
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,828
You have a phone?

763
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,622
No, the police took it.

764
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,794
Here, take it.

765
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,296
In case something goes wrong,

766
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,655
guy doesn't show, whatever,
you call me.

767
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,698
Is this for real,
Saúl?

768
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,326
Don't you have something
more manly?

769
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,161
Stop it,
stop busting my--

770
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,372
I dunno if it's for girls
or boys, but it's for free.

771
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,041
No, you don't look
a gift horse in the mouth.

772
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,270
Do you?

773
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:23,755
Stewart,
this is the address.

774
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,300
Now do me a favor
and behave yourself,

775
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,944
be patient.

776
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,012
This guy's punctual
with a capital P. Understood?

777
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,514
Don't move,
don't do no bullshit.

778
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,033
You just stay there, quietly.

779
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:38,228
He picks you up, you pay,
he'll take your ID.

780
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,999
He'll give you a new one.

781
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:42,917
So, that's it.

782
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,628
Good-bye, José Miguel Rosas.

783
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:49,031
Hello, Mr. XXX,
or whatever you may call

784
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,659
the man congratulated
by society.

785
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,262
Okay.

786
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,787
So, do I get to
pick where I go?

787
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,349
Well, of course.

788
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,541
It's your life,
you can do whatever you want.

789
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,168
Want a suggestion?
San Andrés.

790
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,937
I like it, it's sunny,

791
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,796
nice women wearing G-strings,
well-tanned,

792
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,025
you can swim with dolphins.

793
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,693
How about the Amazonas?

794
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,760
Well, you can swim
with pink dolphins there..

795
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,031
I don't know about the Amazonas.

796
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:15,640
The jungle, the bugs, dunno,
I get allergic,

797
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,535
but whatever floats your boat.

798
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,371
Amazonas is fine.

799
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,063
-Yeah, I like the Amazonas.
-Right, sure.

800
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:25,025
Anywhere you can get
a fresh start is gonna be good.

801
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:28,129
So, Jose.

802
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,572
-Good luck.
-Fine, thanks.

803
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,508
Good. Are you armed?

804
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,010
No.

805
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:37,138
Anyway, we better make sure.

806
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,789
-If you'll excuse me.
-That's it.

807
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,391
Okay.

808
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,605
That's better.

809
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,132
-He's clean.
-Fine.

810
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,595
Good luck,
and have a good new life.

811
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,706
If you'll excuse
me.

812
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,768
Okay.

813
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,359
What are you doing, bro?

814
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,194
Hey, Saúl, I'm here!

815
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,970
-Easy, this doesn't hurt.
-Easy, bro.

816
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,265
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I think Byron</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">must have been poisoned.</font></i>

817
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:23,268
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, there's some stuff</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">called ricin.</font></i>

818
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,811
How do you know that,
Jose?

819
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,480
It doesn't matter,
just tell them
it's a supposition.

820
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,082
Ricin.

821
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,774
Why did you poison Byron,
Walter?

822
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,568
How the hell
could I have gotten it?

823
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,903
Saúl, you made Saúl
take it from me!

824
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,340
What are you doing, bro?

825
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:37,175
Hey, Saúl, I'm here!

826
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,843
Easy, man, easy.

827
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,843
Tell me why you did it.

828
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:18,656
They didn't pick you up?
I thought--

829
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,513
Red code, red co--!

830
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,354
Stewart, Stewart!

831
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:34,631
What are you doing now,
shithead?

832
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,508
Stay where you are,
both of you!

833
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:42,722
What did I do?
I don't get it. What did I do?

834
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,182
-You stole it off of me, Saúl!
-Me?

835
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,850
You and that fat ass
stole from me!

836
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,537
You stole the cigarette pack.

837
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,288
Okay, calm down.

838
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:52,399
I had Stewart
steal your joint,

839
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:54,484
I couldn't risk the guy
not taking you.

840
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,403
No, no, no, before
that!

841
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,655
The cigarette! You had him
steal it off of me!

842
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,174
What?

843
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,783
The poisoned
cigarette, bro.

844
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,201
The ricin
cigarette!

845
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,203
You had him steal
it from me!

846
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,871
And all for that
son of a bitch, Blanco!

847
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,874
He poisoned Byron,
and you helped him!

848
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,043
-No, no.
-You helped him, Saúl!

849
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,021
Calm down, José Miguel, please.

850
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,838
Tell me one more time
to calm down!

851
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,525
Tell me to clam down!

852
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,445
Alright, okay, listen to me.

853
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:22,804
Well, yeah, that time
I told Stewart

854
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,698
to take the ricin from you,

855
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,017
but Walter forced me to,
you get it?

856
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,687
He told me he was helping you,
he was saving you.

857
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,649
I swear, if I had known
what it was for,

858
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,334
I'd have never agreed to it.

859
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,211
You know me, I don't do that.

860
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,965
Please, take it easy now.

861
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:44,302
Calm down now.

862
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,345
No, no.

863
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:52,875
You're a fucking
son of a bitch,
Saúl.

864
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,187
Back up!

865
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,364
Don't touch me!

866
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,240
What do I pay you for, Stewart?

867
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,378
It's me, it's me...

868
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,798
We're in deep shit.

869
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,576
Son of a bitch!
