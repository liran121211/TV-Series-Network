1
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,103
- Walter!
- HI!

2
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,455
Leave me.

3
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,457
Cane. Cane.

4
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,085
My God.

5
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,987
Thank God you're here
to rescue me.

6
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,948
This Mother Teresa
can't leave me in peace.

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
- How are you?
- Hi, Walter.

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,577
- Let me.
- Are you ready?

9
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,203
Are you ready
to get some chicks?

10
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,514
Okay.

11
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,792
So that "Mineral show"
is just some sort of guy code

12
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,226
for strip club.

13
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,145
Is that your secret code?

14
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,798
She caught us.
Did your bring cash?

15
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,816
Those girls take no pennies.

16
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,192
Come on.

17
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,638
- Do I help you?
- No, don't worry.

18
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,515
Walter, don't let him
get too crazy.

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,767
If he gets home
with a giant geome...

20
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,786
Geode!

21
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,147
A giant geode,
we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Let me put the belt on.

22
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,858
- I can.
- Bye, María.

23
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:50,461
- Bye.

24
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,584
- OK.

25
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,361
- Bye, babe.

26
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,754
Be safe.

27
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,131
- Bye.

28
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,992
- Have fun!
- Thanks.

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,011
Longest week ever.

30
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,538
I just hope we get
something good, you know?

31
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,184
Keep your fingers crossed.

32
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,434
What's up?

33
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:11,149
Relax, buddy.

34
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,317
This isn't a dramatic movie,

35
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,344
one of those
that make you cry.

36
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,405
This is different.

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,826
Just think about the adventure

38
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,854
we'll get in.
An action movie.

39
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,984
Action. Adventure!

40
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,012
All right.

41
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,706
So you know
what you have to do, right?

42
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,292
Yes, the same as the other time,
but just the other way round.

43
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,895
Repeat it.

44
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,271
Come on.

45
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,151
I'll walk by Gustavo's car,

46
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,513
I bend down,
as though I'm tying my shoes,

47
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,475
I take the device, get in,
buy something and come back.

48
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:07,396
Fine, and then we go home,
download it on the computer

49
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,315
and see where this mother fucker
has been going.

50
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,876
Ready?

51
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:12,944
- Yes.
- Do it.

52
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,030
What happened?
Why didn't you go in?

53
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,201
I don't know, Henry.
I messed up.

54
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,203
- No.
- All this makes me nervous.

55
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,704
Yes, but this
might be suspicious.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,289
Someone might be getting you
on camera.

57
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,624
What do I do?
Go and buy something?

58
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,292
No, no, no.
Let's go.

59
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,543
- Let's go.
- Here.

60
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,536
Well, let's see.

61
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,013
What the hell?

62
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,514
What is it?

63
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,935
That's work, that's home,

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,770
that's work, that's home.

65
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,314
that's work, that's ho--

66
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,508
He just went two places
every day all week?

67
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,527
It's unbelievable.

68
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,222
- Listen, Henry,
- Can't be.

69
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,349
Is it possible
that maybe, just maybe,

70
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,994
this is not your guy?

71
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,578
No, no, no.

72
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,039
A guy this clean

73
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,458
has got to be dirty

74
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,777
Right now we just have
to figure out

75
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,130
what's his play.

76
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:25,325
When he less expects it, we'll
catch him with the guard down.

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,011
Yes...

78
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,220
But how?

79
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,555
What?

80
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,984
Hello.

81
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,862
My name is Walter Blanco.

82
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:31,433
I live in Los Alcázares,
on the corner of 35th and 21st.

83
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,813
I want to report
some very strange movement.

84
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:39,108
It's been several days now,
but there's a man

85
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:44,880
staring at a particular house.

86
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,132
Yes.

87
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,535
No, no, no.
He's in a blue car.

88
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,638
Plates BXA 189.

89
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,100
He's tall, white skin,

90
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,894
light blue eyes.

91
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,980
I'm sure he's dangerous.

92
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:05,425
I'd really appreciate it
if you could send anyone

93
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,111
to arrest him.

94
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,530
Thank you.

95
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,367
Yes, I'll be alert.

96
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,826
Thank you.

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,482
Late, isn't it?

98
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,551
- Let's start.
- It's all set.

99
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:48,986
Really?

100
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,994
Can I have one?

101
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,937
- One what?
- A cigarette.

102
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,777
It's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.

103
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,212
Give me one.

104
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,886
You shouldn't be smoking.

105
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,289
Don't worry.
I'm not interested in dying.

106
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,642
If you say so.

107
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,909
I'll do it.

108
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,745
What will you do?

109
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,331
I'll kill Gustavo.

110
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,545
Dude, I told you I'd do it

111
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,254
and I will.

112
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,173
Just give me some time.

113
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,551
It doesn't matter any more.

114
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,387
We're both dead men anyway.

115
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,879
Hi. Talk to me.

116
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,007
So Mr. I'm Almost 16

117
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:38,095
So Leave Me Alone

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,289
doesn't want a big thing
for his birthday.

119
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,749
He just wants to hang out
with his friends.

120
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:47,045
That's fine by me.
And you?

121
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,442
Fine by me too.

122
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,735
So...

123
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,738
I don't know...

124
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,865
Should we get him a car?

125
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,409
A car?

126
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,522
Yes, I know we've been
through that,

127
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,981
but it could be
something simpler.

128
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:11,611
The problem is not the car,
but the kind of car.

129
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,130
Yes.

130
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,257
Yes, I agree.

131
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:21,246
Well, I was thinking
about a used car,

132
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,081
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but no more</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">than five years old.</font></i>

133
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,084
It should be automatic
so that it's easier for him.

134
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,671
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What do you think?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Does any car come to mind?</font></i>

135
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:34,067
Or do I look for one?

136
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,487
OK, go on.

137
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,572
Fine. Good.

138
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,827
On another subject,

139
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,870
the business is doing good.

140
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,706
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Very good.</font></i>

141
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,958
So good that...

142
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,195
Maybe you won't need
your second job anymore.

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,614
Really?
We're having profits?

144
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,549
We're almost there.

145
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,552
In a month, two top.

146
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,305
I'm just saying this

147
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,751
because maybe you cold start
looking for...

148
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,394
an exit strategy.

149
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,397
Yes, I'm working on it.

150
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,732
Perfect.

151
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,111
That's good.

152
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,403
So...

153
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:21,490
Bye.

154
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:38,840
Hello?

155
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,076
Hey, buddy!
Did I wake you up¿

156
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,581
No, no, no. Don't worry.
I was awake already.

157
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,499
Look, I don't want
to waste your time,

158
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,835
but I've been thinking
about Gustavo Cortés.

159
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,879
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This thing about him going</font></i>

160
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:55,857
home, one restaurant, right?

161
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,735
He comes and goes every day.

162
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,554
Well, just let me tell you
that's bullshit.

163
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,643
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The man owns</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">other 13 restaurants</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of Los Pollos Hermanos,</font></i>

164
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,286
a total of 14.

165
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:12,274
So he didn't go
to any of those restaurants
these days?

166
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,711
Who supplies them?

167
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,405
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Doesn't he go to the plant</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">or factory</font></i>

168
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,258
where they produce the chicken?

169
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,994
I've been looking into this
and outside of Bogotá

170
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,582
there's a plant
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

171
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,252
I'm looking at the pictures
online right now

172
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,980
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and this place is enormous.</font></i>

173
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,609
This place is so big

174
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:44,556
that there could easily be
a meth lab.

175
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,576
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So what do you think?</font></i>

176
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,035
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What do you say?</font></i>

177
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,579
Do we go on another field trip?

178
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,357
I'll take the sandwiches
and the beers. What do you say?

179
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,820
Yes, Henry, that sounds great.
The thing is...

180
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,507
Look, I won't lie to you.

181
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:06,119
You caught me
somewhat indisposed.

182
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,871
What do you mean?
Like taking a dump indisposed?

183
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,541
Why don't people just say:
"I have diarrhea"?

184
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,501
Just say it!
"I have diarrhea."

185
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,003
Must be a burrito
I ate yesterday.

186
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,339
I can't find
any other explanation.
I didn't eat anything else...

187
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,591
But I'm really sick.
I'm...

188
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,234
Don't worry.

189
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,261
You don't need
to go into details.

190
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,238
You're right.

191
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,450
Probably one guy in a diaper

192
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,744
is enough for this trip anyway.

193
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,271
I'm sorry.
I'd have really liked--

194
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,791
No, don't worry, dude.

195
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,778
Don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you
lately.

196
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,489
I'll find another ride
for this one.

197
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,382
Another ride?

198
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,451
My trainer, for instance.
He can help me.

199
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,953
I'm sure he'll help me.
Don't worry.

200
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,265
No, no. Henry, look...

201
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,168
You know what?
I think in 24 hours,

202
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,171
24 hours top,
I'll be fine.

203
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,773
Buddy, the thing is

204
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,566
you know what this is like.

205
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,843
- This has to be--
- Henry, just wait.

206
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,030
I'd really love to go with you

207
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:11,268
because I'm trapped
by this story

208
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,187
and I don't want to miss
a single detail.
You get me?

209
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,708
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, I really appreciate it.</font></i>

210
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,651
I won't break your heart.
So let's do this.

211
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:23,363
Just call me
when you feel better.

212
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,756
Yes, yes, yes.

213
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,366
I will.
I'll call you.

214
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,843
Thank you!

215
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,502
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Hello?</font></i>
- Mario...

216
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:42,006
Mario, I just want to say,
first off, don't be angry.

217
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,734
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What is it, Walter?</font></i>

218
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,054
My brother-in-law
will soon probably visit

219
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,724
certain distribution center,
you know what I mean?

220
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,769
He wants to look around
for things

221
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,037
and you and I know--

222
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,372
Hello?

223
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,623
Mario?

224
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,833
Mario!

225
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,091
Move.

226
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,051
Pick all that up.

227
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,912
Secure them tightly
so that they don't fall.

228
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,665
Put them
at the same distance.

229
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,061
Clean it. Clean it.

230
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,698
It has to look impeccable.

231
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,616
Mario,
what's all this going on?

232
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,885
Stop asking so many questions.

233
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,162
I told you
to put all that in order.

234
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,866
Here are the keys.

235
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,810
- The boy will give you the car.
- Thank you.

236
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,353
Thank you.
Come back soon.

237
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,067
Yes, sir.
Today we washed
the rugs in the black van.

238
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,752
Perfect!

239
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:30,490
But vans are more expensive
and it was a special wash.

240
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,801
We washed the engine.

241
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,957
Sir, thank you.
Take this.

242
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,502
The boy
will give you your car.

243
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,399
Hi.

244
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,029
Hi.

245
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,390
Someone from the office
said you worked here,
so I thought to come and say hi.

246
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,369
Hi then.

247
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,330
You look great.

248
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,668
No. You look...

249
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,374
I probably look crazed.

250
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,045
Happy.

251
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,238
Last time we met
you were...

252
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,257
Yes.

253
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,551
Yes, yes, yes.

254
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,886
I know.

255
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,391
I need to talk to you.

256
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,934
Wait a second.

257
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,936
Hi. How are you?

258
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,188
Let's see.

259
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,716
Yes, sir.
Your car is ready.

260
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,276
Fifty thousand pesos.

261
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,075
These are your car keys.

262
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,602
The boy over there
will give it to you. Thanks.

263
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:44,998
I need to talk to you.

264
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,653
Ernesto,
I don't mean to be rude

265
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,905
but I don't really think
we have anything to talk about.

266
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,464
Actually, we do.

267
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,636
An audit?

268
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,388
Tomorrow?

269
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,667
Ernesto, how long
have you had this?

270
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:08,964
A while. I didn't know
whether to contact you or not.

271
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,883
Why me?
Why don't you get a lawyer?

272
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,219
They're accusing you
of tax evasion,
and you can go to prison.

273
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,780
Yes.

274
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,365
They're sending you to prison.

275
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,910
Cielo, I was thinking...

276
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,912
Maybe you could help me.

277
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,705
ME? How could I help you?

278
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,943
You know the books,
the moves inside the company.

279
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,696
You want me to uncook
your books?

280
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,422
No, no, no.

281
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,740
I don't want you to uncook
the books,

282
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,742
but see if there's something
you can do.

283
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,911
No, no, Ernesto!
You have to understand!

284
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:43,289
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is done.

285
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:49,170
My name and my signature
are there.

286
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,215
I'm responsible for this, Cielo.
Not you.

287
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,468
No, no. Let me explain
what's going to happen.

288
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,305
Once the Tax Department
discovers this fraud,

289
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,367
they'll ask for an investigation

290
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,896
and they'll build the strongest
possible cause against you.

291
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:11,026
You have an 80% chance
of going to trial and sentenced.

292
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,907
They'll monitor your calls,
your mails, and not just you.

293
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,243
Everyone involved
in those books.

294
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,120
God.
- No, no. You know what?

295
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,164
I don't have time now.
I can't be investigated now,

296
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,558
much less have an audit.

297
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,310
Look, you'll be all right.

298
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,504
They're after me.
I'm the captain they want,

299
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,506
not some cashier
at a car wash.

300
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,448
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,061
I'm going to figure out
a way through this.
Don't worry.

302
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,178
Look, there. There.

303
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,470
Here?

304
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,854
So then?

305
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,984
Is he going to kill him?

306
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,694
Who's going to kill who?

307
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,157
Gustavo.

308
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,201
Mr. Blanco's brother-in-law.

309
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,814
He's the reason
for all this right here.

310
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,275
Because it's totally logical
for him to off the dude.

311
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,824
Nobody likes a cop
getting in your place.

312
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,867
Especially if he's
from anti narcotics.

313
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,304
It'd make sense

314
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,290
if he wanted to put an end
to that problem.

315
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,633
But killing a cop...
I don't know.

316
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,095
If the guy who's investigating
you is suddenly murdered,

317
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,240
then you'd be a suspect.

318
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,121
Not to mention Mr. Blanco.

319
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,815
He'd get totally nuts
if they killed his family.

320
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,752
He'd be totally furious.

321
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,571
He'd never cook
for Gustavo again.

322
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,465
Never again.

323
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,621
Guess there're a lot of angles
to consider.

324
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,559
And if anything happened to him,

325
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,378
would you have a problem
with that?

326
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,776
Who cares what I think?

327
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,615
- You get comfortable, kid.
- Son of a bitch!

328
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,998
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

329
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,581
Son of a bitch.

330
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,612
Get down!

331
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,255
No.

332
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,301
Let's go.

333
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,824
Hello?

334
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,784
Tell them the answer is...

335
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,994
yes.

336
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,491
Coming!

337
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,425
Should I even ask?

338
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,718
What for?

339
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,178
I wouldn't.

340
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,421
Is this going to be
a regular thing now?

341
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,756
Meth cooking
and corpse disposal?

342
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,983
Grab us a barrel, Walter.

343
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,819
What was it this time?

344
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:57,307
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gustavo?

345
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:00,410
No, wait.

346
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:03,313
Did Gustavo just need to send
another message?

347
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,122
Shut your mouth.

348
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:09,110
I don't want you talking
to me or José.
Just get the barrel.

349
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,280
If you plan on calling the cops
on one of my guys again,

350
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,365
you go ahead and get two
barrels.

351
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,141
And here again.
Unreported income.

352
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,726
That's more than a year straight
so far.

353
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,354
Do you want to say something
about this?

354
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,022
Because I'm having a hard time
figuring out.

355
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,502
Yes, sure.

356
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:56,157
I'd have to have a look
at the copies of the receipts

357
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,008
to refresh my memory.

358
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:01,120
Take all the time you need,
Mr. Silva.

359
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,722
That's why were here.

360
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,709
To clear out
all inconsistencies.

361
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,936
Thanks.

362
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,522
Hello, hello.

363
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,275
I'm sorry I'm late.

364
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,152
Traffic was terrible.

365
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,990
And this building

366
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,492
is so confusing.

367
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,494
There're doors everywhere.

368
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,479
Let's see.
I'll sit over here.

369
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:32,151
- Hi, Ernesto.
- Hi, Cielo.

370
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,794
And you are?

371
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,964
Fiscal detective Jaime Betancur.

372
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,799
You're a detective!

373
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,926
Wow! Pleased to meet you.

374
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,386
Cielo Restrepo.

375
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,096
Mrs. Cielo,

376
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,586
As far as I can see,
you're the accountant
who signed these reports.

377
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,480
Yes. I'm guilty.

378
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:57,051
Perhaps you can shed some light
on this history
of missing revenue.

379
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,737
Missing?

380
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,699
No, no, it's all there.

381
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,935
No. It's not in the records
nor on the reports.

382
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:11,941
That's weird.
Let's take a look.

383
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,196
Look at this one.
Ferreterías Don Fabio.

384
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,908
Mr. Fabio is a close friend
of Ernesto's father.

385
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,470
They've been friends forever.

386
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,415
Mr. Fabio always sent us
an electronic payment,

387
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,834
which I hate
because I'm a paper person.

388
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,341
But he said he was one
of those environment people.

389
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,303
Since there wasn't
a physical check,

390
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,154
I didn't enter it into the book,

391
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,989
but the money's there.

392
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:48,436
Madam, are you aware
of this country's taxation laws?

393
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,084
What do you mean?

394
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,197
How gross income for a business
id defined.
You can't do this.

395
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,174
Yes, I can.

396
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,884
No, no, no.

397
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,469
Fine, don't worry.

398
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,747
You know what they say
about opinions.
Everyone's got one.

399
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,891
You have to respect opinions.

400
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,018
One should be tolerant.

401
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:17,632
If its an electronic check
or a paper check,
income is income.

402
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,677
You're not allowed
to not declare it.

403
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:26,182
When I input everything
into the computer
nothing flashed red,

404
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,767
That has to mean
it's all right.

405
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,395
What program
did you use for this?

406
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,482
Some home software,
just like everyone does.

407
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,834
You used a home software

408
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,320
to manage books
for a business like this?

409
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:43,215
Yes, it's so easy.

410
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,244
It's like having
a giant calculator
on your computer.

411
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,498
Excuse me, madam
I'll ask you
sort of a personal question.

412
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,850
Anything you want.

413
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,560
How did you get this job?

414
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,132
- Ernesto hired me.
- Yes.

415
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:05,137
I guess you have qualifications.
Where did you study?

416
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:10,017
Well, I didn't have a training
per se. No degree or diploma.

417
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,411
No, I don't have one.

418
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:16,315
But I've always been
naturally good for numbers.

419
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,734
- Yes.
- Right?

420
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,126
Very good.

421
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,297
All right...

422
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,801
I can see why this is this way.

423
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,261
One last questions.

424
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,081
You're not managing accounts
anywhere else, are you?

425
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,390
Right now?

426
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,767
No.

427
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,461
I'm a cashier
at a car wash.

428
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,023
Okay.

429
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,441
Fine.

430
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,901
Let's move on.

431
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,114
Pay back taxes,

432
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,034
pay the penalties,

433
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,977
and don't get
in any other legal trouble.

434
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,079
Just move on from here.

435
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,151
Cielo, I don't have
a single cent.

436
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,571
I can't pay for this.
I have no resources.

437
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,507
Just figure it out.

438
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,092
You've just dodged prison.

439
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,636
I know.

440
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,513
Well, then just do something.

441
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,998
Sell your house,
your car, anything.

442
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,684
No.

443
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,629
My house
is under mortgage.

444
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:23,549
I have no assets.
I have nothing to sell.

445
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,609
I can't.

446
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,028
Please, Ernesto.

447
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,931
If you don't pay taxes, they'll
reopen the investigation.

448
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,225
And that little fiction
I just spun up there

449
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,536
will completely unravel.

450
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,456
You have to pay.

451
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,675
Good night.

452
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,134
Come in.

453
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,022
You want to help me?

454
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,733
I rather watch.

455
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,153
You don't like cooking?

456
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,535
It's not my stuff.

457
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,982
So how do you cook
at home?

458
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,292
Delivery.

459
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,654
You'll now see the difference
between delivery

460
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,883
and home-made food.

461
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,996
- Are you hungry?
- A little bit.

462
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,435
Well, I think

463
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,937
we'll have to wait.

464
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,402
It still needs to get cooked.

465
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,487
Be patient.

466
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,531
Hum.

467
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:25,606
Mario told me
you had some questions for me.

468
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,124
Yes.

469
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,782
But I like to concentrate
when I cook.

470
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,953
If not, I can confuse
the ingredients

471
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,122
and change the flavor
of what I'm doing.

472
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,849
I see.

473
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,525
Wait outside.

474
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,318
You don't want to cut yourself.

475
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,506
What am I doing here, Gustavo?

476
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,934
I can understand your concern.

477
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:32,965
What happened yesterday
was terrible.

478
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:37,011
You mean the dude
who got his head blown off?

479
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,989
Yes, that was terrible.

480
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,023
I invited you home
and cooked for you.

481
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,878
I want to discuss the business.

482
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,505
Like men.

483
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,747
I'll explain everything
that's happening.

484
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,683
I'll answer your questions.

485
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:11,087
But first, I need you to answer
one question for me.

486
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,940
What?

487
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,801
Can you cook
Walter Blanco's formula?

488
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:22,114
Excuse me?

489
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,574
You heard me.

490
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,354
Can you cook Walter Blanco's
meth formula on your own?

491
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,331
With no help?

492
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,543
Why are you asking me that?

493
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:41,992
You ask me if I can cook
Mr. Blanco's formula on my own?

494
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:43,802
Without him?

495
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,306
Me?

496
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,127
The junkie loser
you almost killed a month ago?

497
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:57,299
Is that your master plan,
Gustavo?

498
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,218
Invite me to your house
and cook

499
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,280
whatever this shit is.

500
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,348
Be my buddy, make me
feel important, what for?

501
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,851
So that I cook on my own
so that you can kill Mr. Blanco?

502
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,995
Is that what you want?

503
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,774
You want us
to talk like men?

504
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,377
Let's talk like men then.

505
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:22,216
If you kill Mr. Blanco,

506
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,467
you'll have to kill me too.

507
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,178
Did you get that?

508
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,765
That's not why I asked you.

509
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,209
You're here because
circumstances with the cartel

510
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,978
are untenable.

511
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:37,022
And I need your help.

512
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:41,468
I need you to help me
prevent a war.

513
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:48,117
That's why I need an answer.

514
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:49,785
Please.

515
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,285
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hey.</font></i>

516
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:38,770
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need to talk to you.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know if you're</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">with your family</font></i>

517
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,398
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but this is important,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">so I hope you can come.</font></i>

518
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,838
- Thank God you're here.
- What's up?

519
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,315
You want a beer or something?

520
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,675
- No, no, no.
- Come, sit.

521
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,237
Well...

522
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,531
This is the thing.

523
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,600
Word has come down that they
want me to go to Mexico.

524
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,103
There's some sort of war
brewing between Gustavo
and the cartel.

525
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,164
"Word has come down"?

526
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:25,817
Yes, the cartel has been messing
with Gustavo's operation.

527
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,029
The other day
they jacked a truck
to sort of send a message.

528
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,408
Gustavo has been
holding them off,

529
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,993
but between the cartel
taking put shots

530
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,871
and your brother-in-law
trying to throw a net over this,

531
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,416
it's like a rock
and a hard place situation.

532
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,212
So the business
will get out of control.
Gustavo has to give in.

533
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:49,841
The cartel wants half
of Gustavo's entire operation.

534
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:54,404
But not just that.

535
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,449
They want your formula

536
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:58,767
and Gustavo
is giving it to them.

537
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:00,227
- Good.
- I mean, not Gustavo,

538
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:04,080
I have to give it to them.

539
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:06,983
I'm supposed to go to Mexico
and teach some cartel chemists

540
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,320
how to cook
a batch of blue meth.

541
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:14,450
Gustavo doesn't trust you,
so I have to go.

542
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,386
You know what the problem is?

543
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:18,954
That you're a chemist.
I'm not.

544
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,872
I'm not a chemist
I don't know what to do.

545
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,477
Mr. Blanco, I need your help.

546
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:30,424
I was thinking
that maybe you can coach me,

547
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,051
give me some notes,
some advice.

548
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,762
I can study that
and learn.

549
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,280
So you saw Gustavo?

550
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:38,615
What?

551
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,811
- No, I didn't see Gustavo.
- No? You didn't see him?

552
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,126
Then who told you all of that?

553
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:51,545
It's just rumors.

554
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,696
- Rumors from whom?
- Yes.

555
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:56,283
From people. Mario, Mosquera,
all those guys.

556
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,910
So you never met Gustavo,
didn't talk to him,
didn't see him.

557
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,678
Why? Why Gustavo?

558
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,708
You weren't with Gustavo
last night?

559
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,102
What?

560
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,105
What are you--?

561
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,192
It's still here.

562
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,403
Just as I supposed!

563
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,616
Look at me in the eye

564
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,435
and tell me you weren't
with Gustavo last night.

565
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,734
- I didn't have time,
couldn't find the moment.
- "I didn't have time".

566
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,070
I didn't have time.
That's why I didn't tell you.

567
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:37,699
I knew you would get nuts
and not believe me.

568
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,134
What did you expect me to do?

569
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,661
There was just
one big pot of soup.

570
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,013
And we both ate from it.

571
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,124
Was I supposed
to poison myself too?

572
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:49,545
You were with him
for two hours and 18 minutes

573
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,172
- and you couldn't find
a way to do it.
- He never left me alone.

574
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,923
- Liar!
- I was never alone!

575
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,233
Don't be such a liar!

576
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,360
One thing, José.

577
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,195
Just one thing.

578
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:02,807
You just had to do one thing
to save our asses.

579
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,185
You were at his house
and you didn't do it.

580
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,245
Two hours and 18 minutes?

581
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,357
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

582
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,109
How do you know
I was there last night?

583
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,420
Are you following me?

584
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,380
This.

585
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:20,634
From 19.10 to 21.28.

586
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,719
Two hours and 18 minutes.

587
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,704
- You bugged my car?
- You didn't even try it!

588
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,122
You didn't even make
the slightest try!

589
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,684
You're following me, right?

590
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,435
After all I've done for you?

591
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,479
Excuse me?

592
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,855
You put me a bug?

593
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,009
You know what you did?
You killed me!

594
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,595
You've signed
my death warrant.

595
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,112
A bug...

596
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,072
I'll you some advice.

597
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:46,159
Go to Mexico. Go.

598
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,270
Go and screw up
like I know you will.

599
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,789
I don't care.

600
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:56,945
I hope you'll end up
wind up in a barrel somewhere.

601
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,630
Son of a bitch!

602
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,093
Son of a bitch!

603
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:03,861
Can you walk?

604
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,659
Yes.

605
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,190
You get the fuck out of here
and never come back.
