1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,085
- So?
- What's up?

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,214
So what?
Got something for me?

3
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,359
Yes, man.

4
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,684
What's this?
Is this a "five" or an "s"?

5
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,369
No, it's a "five."

6
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,897
Or an "s"?
Let me see.

7
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,875
Yes, it's a "five", man.

8
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,194
How do you spell "street"?
S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,572
Did you write S-T-R-E-A-T?
You should know better!

10
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,966
All I do is sell meth.

11
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,953
I don't have time
for spelling.
S-T-R-E-A-T isn't correct?

12
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,347
So what?

13
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,391
Do they have names?

14
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,809
Yes, man.

15
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,104
The woman is a beanpole.

16
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,314
They call the man Poke.

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,775
Poke?

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,594
Yes, man.
Like the cartoon characters.

19
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,613
Tripa, did you get jacked

20
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,807
by a man called Poke?
Really?

21
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,659
Man, don't be confused.

22
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,145
The most dangerous men
of the country have nicknames.

23
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,873
There is Chupeta, Fritanga.

24
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,069
I wouldn't trust
a man called Poke.

25
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,698
You're looking for a reason
not to do it.

26
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,741
- I understand.
- Wait, wait.

27
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,343
Did I say that?

28
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,014
I'd do it myself.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,766
My problem...

30
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,434
You know.

31
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,837
I'm on parole.
I can't do it.

32
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,839
- I'd do it, but--
- It's okay.

33
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,633
I told you I'd do it.
I'll take care of it.

34
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,487
Yes, man. I'll do it.

35
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,491
Great, man!

36
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,493
This is it.

37
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,270
We have to teach them
who is the boss in the street.
Do me a favor.

38
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,816
Be hard on him.
He scared me to death.

39
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,151
- Okay. You got it.
- We'll talk later. See you.

40
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,235
Give me my money!

41
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,527
The money, and I'll go!

42
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,140
No! "That I'll go", no.
"That'll go", no.

43
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,247
Give me my money!

44
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:35,609
I saw it! I saw it!
That's it.

45
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,544
Give me the money!

46
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,822
You messed up
with the wrong man.
I'm going to--

47
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,657
- Good morning.
- Hello.

48
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,952
Would you do me a favor?
Do you live here?

49
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,220
Why?

50
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,872
I need to leave you
some information

51
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,457
about a squad
of the community.

52
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,934
We'd like to invite you.

53
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,356
Thanks.

54
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,800
Have a nice day.
Good bye. Take care.

55
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,026
You too.

56
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,213
Is there anybody here?

57
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,478
Anybody?

58
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,924
Who's there?

59
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,505
I'm glad
to have you back again

60
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,258
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">in this, that is your kitchen,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Felipe's kitchen.</font></i>

61
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,444

62
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,387

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">because I'll cook a recipe...</font></i>

63
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,906
Hey, man.

64
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,199
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's very tasty.</font></i>

65
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,268
Is there someone else
in the house?

66
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,162
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You can cook it at home</font></i>

67
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,081
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">for dinner or lunch.</font></i>

68
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,150
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You'll surprise</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">your couple or your family.</font></i>

69
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,401
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Or why not?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You can cook it for yourself</font></i>

70
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,380
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">when you are alone at home.</font></i>

00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,882
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Let's make some vegetables.</font></i>

72
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,550
Are your parents at home?

73
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,886
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You'll do it really fast</font></i>

74
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,346
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and ingredients are easy to get.</font></i>

75
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,889
What's your name?

76
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,641
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">These are the ingredients.</font></i>

77
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,352
I'm...

78
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,479
Pelanga.

79
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,106
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">One red pepper in slices.</font></i>

80
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,941
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Three cups of soy sprouts.</font></i>

81
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,777
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Four chopped green onions.</font></i>

82
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,513
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Five hundred grams</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of broccoli.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">A cup of mushrooms in slices.</font></i>

83
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,283
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">One kilogram of Chinese cabbage.</font></i>

84
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,060
Don't you rather watch
something better?

85
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:18,105
Something more interesting
like cartoons?

86
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,875
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Sliced carrots.</font></i>

87
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,261
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is preheated</font></i>

88
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,372
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">because, as you may know,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">we don't have the time</font></i>

89
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,515
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to cook it live.</font></i>

90
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,251
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Therefore,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">we'll add it</font></i>

91
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:42,213
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and we'll sauté it</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">during thirty seconds.</font></i>

92
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,359
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Now we'll add the red pepper.</font></i>

93
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,262
Do you know
when your parents will be home?

94
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,141
What time
will Mr. Poke be home?

95
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,285
I'm hungry..

96
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,702
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello, you three.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, the four of you.</font></i>

97
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,872
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I just wanted to wish Walter</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">a good first day back at school.</font></i>

98
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,433
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I imagine him talking</font></i>

99
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,668
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">about valences and covalences</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and all those things</font></i>

100
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,603
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't even remember.</font></i>

101
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,382
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That's it. See you.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cielo, call me back. Bye!</font></i>

102
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,360
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, Cielo. This is Marcela.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've been thinking of you.</font></i>

103
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,212
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I tried Walter's cell phone,</font></i>

104
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,072
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but the line</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">seems to be disconnected.</font></i>

105
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,741
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Whenever you have the time,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">would you call me, please?</font></i>

106
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,622
Hello, Marcela.
This is Cielo.

107
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,958
Cielo, am I catching you
at a bad time?

108
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,518
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No. No, no.</font></i>

109
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,546
Not at all.
Walter's back at work

110
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,898
and he lost his cell phone.

111
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:09,216
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That's why</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">he didn't answer you.</font></i>

112
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,443
I was worried.

113
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,819
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm glad you called.</font></i>

114
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,863
I know Walter would kill me.

115
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,909
He wanted to handle this

116
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,146
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">with extreme precaution.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know him.</font></i>

117
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,917
But I wanted to thank you

118
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,945
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and Edgar for everything</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you're doing for us.</font></i>

119
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,697
For all the help
and the money

120
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,383
you've given us

121
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,661
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">for the treatment.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You're very generous.</font></i>

122
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,597
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You are the best.</font></i>

123
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,791
- I--
-<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> You don't have to say a word.</font></i>

124
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,394
I'm deeply thankful.

125
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,771
You've saved us.

126
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,190
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, I won't talk anymore.</font></i>

127
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:55,346
Not at all.
When will we meet?

128
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,406
Let's have

129
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,741
a cup of coffee or something.

130
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,285
How about this afternoon?

131
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,536
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Perfect!</font></i>

132
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,669
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Monoalkenes.</font></i>

133
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,590
Polyenes, diolefins.

134
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,134
The nomenclature alone

135
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,869
is enough
to make your head spin.

136
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,555
I get it.

137
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,682
But I'll give you a key.

138
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,142
It's a basic key

139
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,044
to understand
what's all of this about.

140
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,588
That key is here,
in our periodic table.

141
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,649
There's one key element.

142
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,260
Carbon.
Do not forget about it.

143
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,448
Carbon is the center of life.

144
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,783
It's the center of it all.

145
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,268
There's no life
without carbon.

146
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,121
Everything that lives,

147
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,291
lived or will live

148
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,710
has to do with carbon.

149
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,533
Our director, Carmen,
is carbon.

150
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,551
Go on.

151
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,723
I like to think that the diamond

152
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,667
and the woman
who wears it on the finger

153
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,379
are both formed
from the same stuff.

154
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,345
As well as the man
who invented the diamond.
They are carbon.

155
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,365
Exactly. This is the truth.

156
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,450
I finally got your attention!

157
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,786
Write this name down.

158
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,504
Mr. Tracy Hall.

159
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,090
In the middle of the XX Century,

160
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,868
this man invented
the first reproducible process

161
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,095
for making synthetic diamonds.

162
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,999
Synthetic diamonds
are used nowadays

163
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,519
in the petrol industry

164
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,631
in the bits
for well drilling,

165
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,567
and in electronics industry.

166
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,194
Multi-billion dollar companies.

167
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,804
They produce millions of dollars
per year.

168
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,642
Do you know
how much money did they pay
Mr. Hall

169
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,451
for his discovery?

170
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,104
They gave him
a ten-dollar bond.

171
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,999
How about that?

172
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,236
Ten dollars
for this discovery.

173
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,338
He made them rich.

174
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,924
It's absolutely unfair!

175
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,579
Do you know
what my point is?

176
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,667
That ten-dollar bond
was printed

177
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,670
on a carbon-based paper
paid to a carbon-based man

178
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:39,050
for discovering something
made out of carbon.

179
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,528
Walter, it's so nice
to have you back with us.

180
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,004
And you're looking great.

181
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,298
Thanks.

182
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,383
I'm a little skinnier.

183
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,009
Yes, yes. Maybe a little.

184
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,954
That's definitely
no tragedy nowadays.

185
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,767
There's the hair thing.

186
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,893
Well, the lack of hair.

187
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,481
That's a great look for you.

188
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,357
Thanks.

189
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,927
How do you feel?
Tell me.

190
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,446
I'm fine.

191
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,239
I'm very well.

192
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,367
I'm happy to be here.

193
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,036
We're happy, too.

194
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,413
And I--

195
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,545
Is everything okay?

196
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,677
No.

197
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,745
I just want you to know
that you can come to me

198
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,888
if you need anything, Walter.

199
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,917
Any doubt,
any question, whatever.

200
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,421
Completely confidential,
of course.

201
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,398
I have to go.

202
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,110
Thank you.

203
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,892
- Bye, Morgan.
- Bye.

204
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,120
Morgan?

205
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,998
Are they still on that?

206
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,377
Morgan, the pirate.

207
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,220
What's wrong with Junior?

208
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,059
What's that?

209
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,019
Nothing.

210
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,855
Let me see it.

211
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,566
Don't worry about it.

212
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,260
Your classmates
don't have anything to do.

213
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,000
Hello.

214
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,343
Booh!

215
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,304
No?

216
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,858
Booh!

217
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,513
Come.
Come here. Come on.

218
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,057
Stop. I don't want to.
Shut up!

219
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,857
Stay here,
and don't move. Okay?

220
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,150
Go to sleep
and don't wake up.

221
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,902
No matter what.
I'm serious.

222
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,128
Okay?

223
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,719
Come on! Do it!

224
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,513
Shut up!

225
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,015
You dropped it.

226
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,209
No, it fell!
- You dropped it!

227
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,144
Both of you, shut up!

228
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,148
Shut up!

229
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,814
Where...?

230
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,136
Where's my stuff,
and where's my money?

231
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,661
Do you know who did it?

232
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,372
I think I know who did it.

233
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,609
Do you know
what we're going to do?

234
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,004
Let's get him,

235
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,280
and put a bag
over his head.

236
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,282
We'll take him to the
countryside,

237
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,426
and strip him naked.

238
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,662
And we'll make him sit
on a ant's nest.

239
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,850
I saw it on a movie.

240
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,688
Do you like the plan?

241
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,607
If there're scorpions, I do.

242
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,275
Scorpions?

243
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,570
I like the idea.

244
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,976
Damn, dad!
What's that luxurious car?

245
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,411
Who would be visiting mom?

246
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,705
Who knows.

247
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,002
- Go in, I'll be right there.
- Okay.

248
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,914
And this is Junior.

249
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,356
But now
he wants to be called Morgan.

250
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,442
- Mom!
Son.

251
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,945
I'm giving her
both options.

252
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,906
This is Marcela, my love.
We've talked a lot about her.

253
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,574
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

254
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,510
Nice to meet you.

255
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,889
Thanks.

256
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,056
Hello.

257
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,542
- Hi.
- Marcela, I'm glad to see you.

258
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,020
You've changed your hair.

259
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,718
A bald head
is a bit of a shocker.
I know it was for me.

260
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,947
You don't look bad.

261
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,615
Thanks.

262
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,869
Thank you so much

263
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,647
for what you've done
for my dad.

264
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,916
You're very welcome.

265
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,779
We're going
to find a way to repay you.

266
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,132
Don't worry.

267
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,493
I hate to say it,
but I really need to get going.

268
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,970
I just wanted to say hi.

269
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,097
You should stay for dinner.

270
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,375
I have a something to do
with Edgar.
Some other time.

271
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,086
Let me walk you
to the door.

272
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,105
Your bag.

273
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,318
Nice meeting you.

274
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,845
Likewise. Thank you.
Goodbye.

275
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,139
Edgar and you
are welcome any time.

276
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,159
I'd love to be in touch.

277
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,326
Of course.

278
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,437
- Bye. See you.
- Let's go.

279
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,422
Marcela. Marcela.

280
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,616
Marcela, please!
Marcela.

281
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,053
Marcela, don't go, please.

282
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,707
I'd like to know
what you told her.

283
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,102
I know we have to talk.

284
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,005
In the meantime,
I need a big favor.

285
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,632
Don't say anything
to Cielo, please.

286
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,320
Marcela.

287
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,534
Please!

288
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,912
My money and my goods!
Where are they?

289
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,666
- Where?
- Okay, okay, okay.

290
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,101
What will you say?

291
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,755
You hit me really hard.
I think I'm seeing double.

292
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,274
Shut up and sit down!

293
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,510
- Does your head ache?
We'll have to see the doctor.
- I have to go to the doctor.

294
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,030
- Shut up, my love.

295
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,723
Empty your pockets.
Hurry up!

296
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,533
- Stand up!

297
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,647
- Stand up. Yes.
- Are you making fun of me?

298
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,608
Stand up here!
Empty your pockets!

299
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,085
Hurry up, shit!

300
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,862
Empty your pockets!
Empty them! Do it!

301
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,781
- Shut up!
- There's nothing there.

302
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,741
- Your back pockets!
- We don't have--

303
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,302
They're empty.

304
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,871
- Your back pockets!
Hurry up!
- They're empty!

305
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,748
The shoes.
Put them here.

306
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,683
Put them here!

307
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,253
Calm down, brother.
We don't have nothing.

308
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,466
What happened then?
Where's everything?

309
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,860
Where's everything?

310
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,388
We don't have anything
because we used it yesterday.

311
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,685
Really? Everything?

312
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:11,537
Do you think I'm stupid?

313
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,437
An ounce in a day and a half?

314
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,690
- We really wanted to do it.
- Yes.

315
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,901
Yes, poor him.
You know where it is.

316
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,669
Where is it?

317
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,046
Where could it be?

318
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,990
Where is it?
He has it.

319
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,950
He has it in his ass.
There it is.

320
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,512
Stop! You know where it is.

321
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,957
Take it out of your ass,
or I'll do it myself.

322
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,391
Stand up!

323
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,980
Hurry up, shit!

324
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,054
- Here.
- Put it on the table.

325
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,181
Don't you like it?
He doesn't like it.

326
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,116
I said shut up.

327
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,494
You're a nice couple.

328
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,188
One keeps the heroine,
and the other the meth.

329
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,190
Well done!
You're very organized.

330
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,900
- We're well organized.
- Yes, very well.

331
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,127
- Sit down!

332
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,115
But--
It's not complete.

333
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,593
Where's the rest of it?

334
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,538
Where's the rest of it?
It isn't complete.

335
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,665
- Do you want to hear the truth?
- Yes.

336
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,333
She did it.
She dropped it!

337
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,044
Don't betray me,
son of a bitch!

338
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,838
- Stop it!
- Go over there.

339
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,982
You stay there. Don't move!

340
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,985
Where's the rest of it?

341
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,655
He has a headache.

342
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,142
He has a headache,
my poor baby.

343
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,228
- He has a headache.
- I'm going to faint.

344
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,980
- Let's go to the doctor.
- Is he going to faint?
Poor her.

345
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,608
Listen to me.
I have six bullets.

346
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,610
One for each knee and I'll
cure his headache with this.

347
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,255
What do you think?

348
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,030
- No, please.
- Okay? What do you think?

349
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,799
What do you think?

350
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,592
Stop it.

351
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,681
My poor boy.

352
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,226
This is a rude man.

353
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,169
Do you know
what will happen?

354
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,313
You won't do anything

355
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,464
until I get back
what's mine.

356
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,882
You know how it feels,
don't you?

357
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,217
No.
- Don't you?

358
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,385
- No! What? No.
- Don't do this.

359
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,055
- You went too far.
- Then what are we going to do?

360
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,781
Look...

361
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,162
We can pay you.

362
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,647
- Really? Tell me.
- Plus interest.

363
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,915
How?

364
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:25,446
Stand up slowly.

365
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,336
Slowly.

366
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,546
Shut up!

367
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,958
That's my bank, too.
What are you doing?

368
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,961
Calm down.
They don't charge for this.

369
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,297
- Shut up!
- Shut up.

370
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,569
How did you bring that here?

371
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,654
With the help of technology.

372
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,390
- Be careful.
- Shut up!

373
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,991
Be careful.

374
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,858
Were there any witnesses?
Did they saw you?

375
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,918
No, we were very careful.

376
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,295
Yes, very careful.

377
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,025
What do you want?

378
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,178
Help me open it,
and take your money.

379
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,005
Nothing happens!

380
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,115
You told me
you stole six of them.

381
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,468
Yes, I swear it!

382
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,453
Yes, but one thing
is to steal it

383
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,954
and something different
is to open it.

384
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,140
Sure, but look--

385
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,625
Be patient,
and you'll succeed.

386
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,421
Seven is my lucky number.
I'll open it this time.

387
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,900
He won't do it.

388
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,490
Don't listen to that bitch.

389
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,658
Don't call me bitch!

390
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,769
- Okay, okay.
- Bitch, bitch.

391
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,271
- I'm not a bitch!
- Calm down!

392
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,913
Both of you, calm down!

393
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,733
I'll shoot you next time.
Open that damn box!

394
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,735
You sit down there
and stay calm.

395
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,171
Where's the kid?

396
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,865
- Where's the kid?
- I don't know.

397
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,635
That bitch.

398
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,496
- Don't call me that!
- See? That happens

399
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,831
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">...because you're a bitch.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Bitch, bitch, bitch.</font></i>

400
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,294
Don't call me that!
Bitch!

401
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,604
Don't call me bitch!

402
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,258
- Are you all right?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Bitch.</font></i>

403
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:53,303
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Bitch, bitch, bitch.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Don't call me bitch.</font></i>

404
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,472
Stay here.
Don't move, okay?

405
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,699
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Bitch, bitch, bitch.</font></i>

406
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,562
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.
- Don't call me bitch

407
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,206
Don't call me bitch.

408
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,774
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.
- Don't call me bitch.

409
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,068
Don't call me that.
Why do you call me that?

410
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,488
- Don't call me that.
- No? Okay.

411
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,590
Open that!

412
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,842
What are you thinking?

413
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,204
Why aren't you a good mom?
Your boy is right there.

414
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,457
Use this for something else
than using drugs.

415
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,058
Buy him some food.

416
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,794
Buy him some clothes,
a decent television.

417
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,104
What's the matter?

418
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,939
I have a headache.

419
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,608
I told you I have a headache.

420
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,011
Give me some.
give me some and--

421
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,054
- You have a son, get it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

422
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,973
- Yes. Come on. Come on.
- I'll become a supermom.

423
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,476
Come on.
Give us some.

424
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:44,645
Stay there. Don't move!
Think, please.

425
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,148
Shut up.
Move over there.

426
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,917
Hurry up!

427
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,820
You're useless.
Sit over there.

428
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,047
What?

429
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,883
I don't get anything.

430
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,495
- You're useless.
I don't get anything.

431
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,558
Don't call me bitch.

432
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,880
I agreed on coming here

433
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,908
because you told me
you'd explain it to me.

434
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,718
But you haven't say a word.

435
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,371
No. I asked you to come
to talk to you.

436
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:47,766
I really appreciate you came.

437
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,733
So you didn't tell anyone?

438
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,067
Not even Edgar?

439
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,737
Not yet.

440
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,823
What does that mean?

441
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,409
Exactly that.

442
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,728
It's a determination
I have yet to make.

443
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,874
Yes, I understand.

444
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,777
And I respect it.
Fair enough.

445
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,799
I also asked you to come

446
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,428
because I wanted to apologize

447
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,582
for involving you
in this misunderstanding.

448
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,020
Misunderstanding?

449
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,317
Yes. I'm really sorry.

450
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,778
Okay.

451
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,032
Tell me why you did it.

452
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,021
The reason
doesn't matter right now.

453
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,652
You told me your insurance
was covering the treatment.

454
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,670
Is it true?

455
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,531
If you're not paying it
with Edgar's and my money--

456
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,383
how are you paying it?

457
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,845
I'm serious, Marcela.

458
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,056
That isn't your business.

459
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,726
Yes, it is my business.

460
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,337
You told
your wife and your son

461
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,964
that I was paying the treatment.
Why?

462
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,569
I will clear this up with them.

463
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,352
Cielo thanked me
very moved

464
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,145
because of everything
I was doing.

465
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,939
The look on her face
touched me.

466
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,084
Why did you do it?

467
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,547
Everything has an explanation.

468
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,367
I'm just asking you
to let me give it to them.

469
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,910
In my own way,
in my own time.

470
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,679
All right.

471
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,582
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

472
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,585
I don't owe you
an explanation.

473
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,562
I owe you an apology.

474
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,230
And I have apologized.

475
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,484
I am very sorry.

476
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,862
I've apologized twice now.

477
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,726
Marcela, I'm sorry.
Three times.

478
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,747
Let me just get this straight.

479
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,025
Edgar and I offer
to pay for your treatment.

480
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,193
We didn't expect anything
in return.

481
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,796
That offer still stands.

482
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,241
And out of pride
or whatever,

483
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,925
you turn us down.

484
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,178
And then you tell your wife

485
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,705
that in fact
we're paying for your treatment.

486
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,098
You involved us in your lie.

487
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,753
But you sit here and tell me
that it's none of my business?

488
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,922
That's pretty much
what I'm telling you.

489
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,068
What happened to you?

490
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,154
This isn't you.

491
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,532
What would you know about me?

492
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,018
Do you really think to know
who I am?

493
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,579
Who?

494
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,232
Someone who should go begging
for charity?

495
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,984
Do you really think
you can use your checkbook

496
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,112
like some magic wand
and make me forget

497
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,255
that you cut me out?

498
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,079
I don't understand.
I didn't think--

499
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,165
That was my work,
my research.

500
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,143
You became rich out of it.

501
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,049
- I can't understand that--
- Thank you.

502
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,277
I'm really thankful.

503
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,894
- You left.
Yes.

504
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,690
You've always been
the picture of innocence.

505
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,042
Just sweetness and light.

506
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,255
You left me.

507
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:51,285
My parents' property,
Holy Week.

508
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,455
I went up to our room,
and you were packing your bags.

509
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,098
Did you forget about it?

510
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:01,295
That's your excuse
to build your empire on my work?

511
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,715
You walked away.
You abandoned Edgar and me.

512
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,192
That's great.

513
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,596
Little rich girl
addicted to her millions.

514
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,893
I don't even know
what to say to you.

515
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,232
I'm so sorry
you feel like this.

516
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,086
I feel sorry for you.

517
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,049
Fuck you.

518
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,933
Little man,
are you hungry?

519
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,701
Booh!

520
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,745
Booh!

521
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,675
Come, my love.

522
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,809
Look, Poke, I got him!

523
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,045
That idiot says
I'm a bad mother.

524
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,605
Come on, son of a bitch!

525
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,258
Who's the big tough guy now?
Try and hit me now.

526
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,719
Come on! Hit me now?
How many bullets do you have?

527
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,821
Six? Yes?

528
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,973
Come on, hit me now,
son of a bitch!

529
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,825
Come on! Stand up!

530
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,452
Stand up!

531
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,780
Good evening.

532
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,533
Hi. Good evening.

533
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,497
Should I ask where you've been?

534
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,630
Never mind.

535
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,326
It doesn't matter.
We need to talk
about more important things.

536
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,556
Marcela called a while ago.

537
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,728
We need to talk, Walter.

538
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,097
They won't pay
the treatment anymore.

539
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,913
What did she say, exactly?

540
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:13,111
She said she was sorry.
They couldn't help us anymore.

541
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,631
Good luck, and that was it.

542
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,010
She sounded apologetic.

543
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,708
I called her back,
and she didn't pick up.

544
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,186
What do you know about this?

545
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,314
I'll tell you something.

546
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,233
This is really strange.

547
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,302
She came home this afternoon,
and was very happy,

548
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,805
very calm,
but she got nervous

549
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,531
when you arrived

550
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,118
and decided to leave.

551
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,563
And now she called
and told me that.

552
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,149
What do you know
that I don't?

553
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,252
Where were you, Walter?

554
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,883
I was with Edgar and Marcela.

555
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,095
What? Why?

556
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,055
It was obvious

557
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,207
that she had something to say
when she came here.

558
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,352
For some reason

559
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:15,565
she couldn't tell you nor me.

560
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,343
I needed to clarify
that situation.

561
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,989
What happened?

562
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,976
Well, we talked
for a long while.

563
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,247
Actually, they talked a lot.

564
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,749
But they didn't say anything.

565
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:37,863
They used
a lot of business phraseology.

566
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,926
Leveraged, liquidity.

567
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,996
- Quarterly decrease.
- What did they tell you?

568
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,764
What did they say, Walter?

569
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,767
They were truly saying

570
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,477
that they're broke.

571
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,272
No.

572
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,773
Yes.

573
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,866
They made bad investments.

574
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,368
And they were too ambitious.

575
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,287
That's unbelievable.

576
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,663
I can't believe it.

577
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,958
Why didn't she tell me?

578
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,462
Out of pride, I guess.

579
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,678
Calm down.

580
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:32,042
My love, most of the treatment
has already been paid.

581
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,920
We're much better
than we used to be.

582
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,440
We're going to make it

583
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,276
I promise.

584
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,910
And she still drives that car?

585
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,245
Even when they're broke?

586
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:57,151
It's unbelievable what they do
to keep up appearances.

587
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,921
Showy.

588
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,175
It isn't worth it.
It won't work!

589
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,110
Yes, it will.

590
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,221
Don't you see
the lower part is weaker?

591
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,406
Who says so? Who?

592
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,032
It's logic.

593
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:31,309
If this were the strongest part,
it'd be facing up.

594
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,622
That heroin was too strong.

595
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,084
It's on my head.

596
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,278
You took too much.
I told you!

597
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:45,548
If I use some meth,

598
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,259
I'll even out.

599
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,911
No!
You've lost your share.

600
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,512
Just a little bit.

601
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,706
No! Shut up!
Don't bother me!

602
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,391
You're a stupid bitch!

603
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,934
Don't call me bitch!

604
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,602
You're a son of a bitch!

605
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,838
You are!
I want an apology!

606
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,174
- Let me do my job!
- Apologize!

607
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,218
- Now!
- Apologize.

608
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,777
You're unbearable.

609
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,404
Why do I have to apologize

610
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,972
for telling a bitch
that she's a bitch.

611
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:12,768
Bitch. Bitch, no!
Apologize! Say you're sorry.

612
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:16,230
No! Bitch, bitch,
bitch, bitch, bitch.

613
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,856
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.
- No!

614
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,419
I want you to apologize.

615
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,614
Say that you're sorry
for calling me a bitch.

616
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,323
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Emergency line.</font></i>

617
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:35,225
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Good evening.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Can I help you?</font></i>

618
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,394

621
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,383
Hello, how are you?

622
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:54,428
So? Do you remember our game

623
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,372
about covering your eyes?
Do you remember it?

624
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,474
Cover your eyes.

625
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,417
You'll cover your eyes,
and you won't open them.

626
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,585
Ever, ever.
You can't open them. Ready?

627
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,189
I'm taking you with me.

628
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:06,273
One, two.

629
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,635
Come on. Cover them well.
Don't look at anything.

630
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,096
Don't look.
Cover your eyes.

631
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:15,098
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've just received</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">an emergency call</font></i>

632

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Go there immediately.</font></i>

634
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,791
It's okay.

635
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,295
Let's change the game.

636
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,589
You won't go back inside.

637
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,091
Ready?

638
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,998
I hope life
is good with you now, kid.
