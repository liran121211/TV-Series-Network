1
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:53,988
What's up?

2
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,096
What's up?

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,848
What do you need?

4
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,015
Yo, you buyin', or are you
just stopping to envy?

5
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,020
Punk bitches!

6
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,373
Tripaseca, it's Gordo.

7
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,149
Brother, there's two guys here.
I'm getting eyeballed hard.

8
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,318
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

9
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,466
Can I have your hat?

10
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,343
What did I say?

11
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,096
Get out of here!

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,682
What are you waiting for? Go!

13
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,727
Walter, we've made such headway
with your treatments.

14
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,063
Now it's time we talked
about sealing the deal.

15
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,499
Absolutely.

16
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,152
As you know,
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

17
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,254
That may no longer be the case.

18
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,074
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

19
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:04,078
In this institute we have one of
the few surgeons in the country
performing lobectomies.

20
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,973
Lobectomy?

21
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,766
It sounds aggressive.

22
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,876
Uumm... Very much so.
It's a very delicate procedure.

23
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,296
But if you don't have this
surgery, you're waiting
for the cancer to spread.

24
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,549
Through the treatment
you've had already,
we've bought you some time.

25
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,302
Maybe a lot, probably a little,
but that's all.

26
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,905
In my opinion, Walter,

27
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,056
if you're willing
to take some risk,

28
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,725
then this offer
is the best chance.

29
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:35,151
Doctor, insurance
won't cover this.

30
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,586
How much would it cost?

31
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,213
For international standards,

32
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,781
I'd say some
250 thousand dollars.

33
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,885
But around here,

34
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,680
for one of our patients,

35
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:52,168
I think it would be around
300 million, give or take.

36
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,755
This is obviously
a big decision.

37
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,091
You might need some time
to discuss it.

38
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,180
No, let's do it.
I'll do it.

39
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,184
Don't you think we should at
least talk this through first?

40
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:12,271
Sure, honey.
I just think it's the way to go.

41
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,941
I have to say I think
it's the right choice.

42
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,318
When can we schedule
the surgery?

43
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,529
It's just that the baby
is almost here.

44
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,993
That's what I was about to ask.
When's the due date?

45
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,638
By the end of this month.

46
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,682
What we can do is,

47
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,085
I'll book the surgery
so Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your baby.

48
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,312
Is that okay?

49
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,980
Yes, that's fine.

50
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,286
14 messages?

51
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,460
Hi. What's up?

52
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,362
Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.

53
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,465
I see.

54
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,593
Gordo's dead.

55
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,953
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They shot him</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">several times.</font></i>

56
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,722
Which one is he?

57
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,582
You did not just say that to me.
Eat shit, motherfucker!

58
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,733
What's the word on the street?

59
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,485
No one's dropping no names.

60
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,511
How come, Tripa?
That's odd.

61
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,097
You know everything
on the streets.

62
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,366
It was like a ghost.

63
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,785
So we've got nothing.

64
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,329
I told you already.

65
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,898
Gordo rang me
before it went down.

66
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,401
Said dudes were
mad-dogging him.
That's all I know.

67
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,337
Shit, shit, shit!

68
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,659
Can I ask you a question
without you getting all mad?

69
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,595
Come on.

70
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,957
Why'd we have to go
pushing into new turf?

71
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,643
I don't know.

72
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,895
You don't know?

73
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,981
Is that all you got?

74
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,882
So we just did what Heisenberg
wanted and that's that?

75
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:08,470
No, no, no, Tripa; things
are not that easy up there,
it's complicated.

76
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,807
Come on!
You're the man,
you're in charge.

77
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,119
Yes, I'm in charge.

78
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,870
See...

79
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:20,399
As the man in charge,
I swear I'll do right
by Gordo's people.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,943
- It's the least you can do.
- Come on...

81
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,238
But before we can make our minds
up about what to do next,

82
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,702
make sure you bust up the cell
phone where you got that call
and throw it away right now.

83
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,638
Done. Done.

84
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,791
But this is as far
as I go.

85
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,339
Come on, you can't be
serious. Right?

86
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:48,510
Man... With Gordo gone and Mono
laying low out in Medellin,
I'm the only one left.

87
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,904
What do you mean?

88
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,514
- What about me? Don't I count?
- You're covered, man.

89
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,766
I'm the one putting his
face out on the street.

90
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,394
They will bust me
or kill me.

91
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,021
Come, Tripa, Tripa,
listen up.

92
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,899
We're on the verge
of making some serious money.

93
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,859
What, you're gonna jump ship
now?

94
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,753
Jose...

95
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:10,115
Everyone on the street
knows you didn't kill Poke.

96
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,159
- Everyone knows?
- Sure.

97
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,413
Everyone knows that thing
to the head, the ATM,

98
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,931
his junkie bitch copped to it.

99
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,625
No, Tripa, come on,
why didn't you say something?

100
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,437
I don't know, man.

101
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,109
Listen...

102
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,278
I'm telling you,

103
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,821
just sit tight.

104
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,657
We'll get by. We'll make it.

105
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,368
Come on.

106
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,953
Sorry, I'm out.

107
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,331
If things calm down,

108
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,249
you can count on me.

109
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,003
This is my advise to you:

110
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,509
take care of yourself, man.

111
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,678
That's fine.

112
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,182
Thanks for everything.

113
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,810
See you, Tripa.

114
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,115
We have had a setback.

115
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,284
- What?

116
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:20,852
Sorry, that's an accurate
description.

117
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,271
What do you want me
to say?

118
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:27,067
- How about your fault?
- Don't lay that on me!

119
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,819
You are in charge
of distribution.

120
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,838
You said expand the territory.

121
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,448
That doesn't mean
you become careless!

122
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,510
Guys, guys, please.

123
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,471
Who do I look like?

124
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,621
I'm not your marriage
counselor.

125
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:46,586
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

126
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,923
Let's get to the point.
What happened?

127
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,818
one of our dealers.

128
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,068
was murdered,

129
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,722
It was some kind
of turf dispute,

130
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,267
we lost and then
everyone quit on us.

131
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,353
We have absolutely
no distribution!

132
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:08,317
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

133
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,839
Good news.

134
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,549
Come on.

135
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,783
How about you?
How's the health situation?

136
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,120
- It's better.
- Better?

137
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,664
I may have more time
than I thought.

138
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,642
Outstanding!

139
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,103
Now, as to your dead guy,

140
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,588
may God keep him
in his Glory,

141
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,133
but it's an occupational
hazard.

142
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:37,179
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been
known to happen.

143
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,515
If you are a girl
on the streets,

144
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:42,184
you might get AIDS
or a venereal disease.

145
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,437
If you sell drugs,
you might end up dead.

146
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,208
It's in the contract.

147
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,443
Come on.
What about product on hand?

148
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,588
How's your inventory?

149
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,174
- 17 and change.

150
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,924
Ounces, grams...?

151
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,970
Kilos.

152
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,680
Kilos?

153
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,433
Kilos?!

154
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,976
My God!

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,146
Why the long faces here?

156
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,464
You're sitting
on a gold mine!

157
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,859
A gold mine we can't sell.

158
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,945
We need a proper infrastructure.

159
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,305
We need foot soldiers
and dealers.

160
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,182
We need muscle,
and we need enforcers.

161
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,894
Payback.
That's what we need.

162
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,397
This entire process
has just been so...

163
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,941
It's always been one
step forward and two steps back.

164
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,251
We need help, Saul.

165
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:40,200
All right, all right.
Let's start with some
tough love, all right?

166
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:45,872
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

167
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,543
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

168
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,771
I'm amazed you got this far.

169
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,274
Me too.

170
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,968
We are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.
We have been down that road.

171
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:03,515
No, no, I'm not talking
about some tattooed speed-freak

172
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,827
who only knows ten words. No.

173
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:13,066
What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman,

174
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:17,321
who treats your product
like the high-margin
commodity it is.

175
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,532
Someone who's been
doing this

176
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,826
for 20 years and never
been caught.

177
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,413
Someone who might be interested
in the meth business.

178
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,374
Someone who knows
their shit.

179
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,893
You know someone like that?

180
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,813
Let's just say I know a guy

181
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,841
who knows a guy
who knows another guy.

182
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,844
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

183
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,030
What's his name?

184
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,407
I have no idea.

185
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,244
He's very low profile.

186
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,038
He's careful like that.

187
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:56,193
From what I do hear about him,
he sounds a little like you.

188
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,433
You know what, Juana?

189
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,100
Um?

190
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,189
I need you to leave.

191
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,149
Why?

192
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,760
There's some stuff
about me you don't know.

193
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,891
Like what?
Like you're a drug dealer?

194
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,331
I kind of got that.

195
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,024
You use an alias,
you pay in cash, so...

196
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,585
And I'm still here.

197
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,091
Know what?

198
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,285
One of my guys, a friend who
worked for me got murdered.

199
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,747
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

200
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,099
So, now...

201
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,310
I'm gonna smoke some crystal,

202
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,230
and get really high.

203
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,965
And I just think you should go,
being that you're
in a program and all and...

204
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,510
You could come with me
to a meeting.

205
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,070
No meetings.

206
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,075
We could just get out of here.

207
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,206
It won't help.

208
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,958
Yeah, it will.

209
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,403
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't. No.

210
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,989
I really just need
you to go. All right?

211
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,445
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">One Combo 3.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">One Combo 3 for Table 4.</font></i>

212
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:07,115
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Half a roasted chicken,</font>

220
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,454
You're late.

221
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,288
We ran late.

222
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,167
So?

223
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,403
Today's the big day.
So where's the kingpin?

224
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,965
Your guess is as good as mine.

225
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,951
- So you get the dude's name?
- No.

226
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,120
So let me get
this straight.

227
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:58,082
He's allowed to know
all about us, but not
the other way around?

228
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,669
Why don't you
get yourself some food?

229
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:04,088
So we won't sit here with
our Happy Meals, looking
like a couple chumps?

230
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,884
Gentlemen, is everything
to your satisfaction?

231
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,820
Need anything?

232
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,737
No, thanks.

233
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,812
Yuo know what?
I don't get you, man.

234
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:22,106
A week ago you were all
ready to hang it up.
And look at you now.

235
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,943
- We've got 17 kilos to sell.
- So?

236
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,571
After, you gonna make up
some new magic number?

237
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,364
"I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

238
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,843
Things have changed.

239
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,744
- Don't you understand?
- I know.

240
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,263
We got a guy killed.

241
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,750
Are you going to spend
the rest of your life
thinking about that?

242
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,963
You know what? This is bullshit.
I'm out of here.

243
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,758
Jose, come on,
Jose, come on!

244
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,861
Idiot!

245
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,230
She's waking up
from a nap.

246
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,625
Uhm, aha...

247
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,111
She is certainly going
to want to get out.

248
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,572
We'll keep an eye
on your fluids.

249
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,240
You're on the low side
of normal.

250
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,743
- How low?
- It's not a problem,

251
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,954
unless we see
a growth drop-off.

252
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,205
We'll just have you in
for an ultrasound next week

253
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,767
and keep an eye on things.

254
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,435
All right.

255
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,564
Thank you.

256
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,568
Sorry!

257
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,804
Man, you would
not believe the traffic.

258
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,556
- That's why I left early.
- What did I miss?

259
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:40,393
Here. Here you have a picture
for your refrigerator.

260
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,940
My God!
Look at her.

261
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,876
Incredible.

262
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,253
It's like she's here already.

263
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,864
It's time to make a decision.
We've been talking about it
for months now.

264
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,969
Um... The C-section?

265
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,637
Yes.

266
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,455
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

267
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,045
My last labor
was pretty tough, so...

268
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,380
We had talked about it,
right?

269
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,861
For the baby, let's do it.

270
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,529
Okay.

271
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,932
So why don't we schedule it
for next Tuesday?

272
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,202
Is it Tuesday 13th?

273
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,663
16th.

274
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,290
I like it.

275
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,459
Sure, if that's what you want.

276
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,235
Will you please
tell doctor Sanchez

277
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,196
so he can schedule
your surgery?

278
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,839
Sure, I'll tell him.

279
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,594
Speaking of birthdays,

280
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,346
I have to go buy a cake.

281
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,680
It's the boss' birthday.

282
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,061
Why do you have to do it?

283
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,939
I said I would.

284
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,944
So you'll be late?

285
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,072
I don't know, I might.

286
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,390
Do you want to keep
the car?

287
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,117
No, no, you keep it.

288
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,643
- Sure?
- Yes.

289
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,373
Save me a slice?

290
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,458
Sure.

291
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,544
- Bye.

292
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,579
- Hi.
- Aha.

293
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,563
Let's get out of here.

294
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,065
- Let's do something.

295
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,568
Aha.

296
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,178
You know that museum
you talked about?

297
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,430
- Let's go dancing.
- Aha.

298
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,492
Come on.

299
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,509
Come on.

300
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,090
- What's the emergency?
- This is very important.

301
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,133
- Excuse me.
- Hi, everyone.

302
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,360
- Surprise!

303
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,153
Happy Birthday!

304
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,366
Happy Birthday!

305
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,330
Okay...

306
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,625
Wow!

307
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,710
Haha.

308
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,297
Thank you very much.

309
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,824
You're like family to me,
you know that.

310
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,384
Ehm...

311
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:28,055
This is beautiful, guys.

312
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,207
Are you making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

313
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:33,084
- Bravo!
- Thanks!

314
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,894
A wish!

315
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,506
China's undercutting us
at every turn...

316
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,735
- No, seriously!

317
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,197
There's one thing...

318
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,682
There's something
I always do on my Birthday,
and it seems to work,

319
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,995
it's good luck.

320
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,271
Ehm...
You are going to help me.

321
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,443
- No!
- Come on, Cielo!

322
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,739
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Yes!

323
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,424
It's my wish.

324
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,202
You cannot deny
your employer his birthday wish.

325
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,704
- It's for the good of
the company.
- No, please, no...

326
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,390
Look at me!

327
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,457
I know what you
are talking about!

328
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,168
- Claudia, no!
- Did you see?

329
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,295
I have it here.
Wait a minute.

330
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,588
- Claudia, no!
- Yes, yes, yes.

331
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,191
Please, I...!

332
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,549
Valentina is coming out
of me!

333
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,302
Do it calmly.
This is no problem, right?

334
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,031
Found it!

335
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,515
That's it,
ladies and gentlemen,

336
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,602
I give you
the three times award winning

337
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,831
Soluciones Silva!

338
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,959
Bravo!

339
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,503
Now, come on...

340
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,530
- Ay, no.
- Yes, yes!

341
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,011
Cielo, Cielo, Cielo, Cielo!

342
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,553
Music, please.

343
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,890
Boss, come over here.

344
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,934
Get comfortable.

345
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,025
Bravo!

346
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,265
Bravo!

347
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,316
Thank you.

348
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,467
He wasn't there.
He didn't show up!

349
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,154
He was there.

350
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,306
All I know is my contact
says he was there.

351
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,765
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

352
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,410
Yes, I'm positive.

353
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,786
A fried chicken place.

354
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,288
Los Pollos Hermanos!

355
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,605
How can I forget
that name?

356
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,583
Maybe he stayed out

357
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,169
in the parking lot.

358
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:47,445
You said
we would meet inside.

359
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,631
Maybe he checked you out...

360
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,035
and saw something in you
that he didn't like much.

361
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:58,289
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says
it's a no go.

362
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,251
He can't do that!
God dammit!

363
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,753
How can he decide without
meeting me? That's unfair!

364
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,106
What did I say?

365
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,900
He's skittish,

366
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,885
like a little animal.
He won't show his head.

367
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,863
Like a deer.

368
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,390
- Call him back.
- No, I can't do that.

369
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,783
Call him!

370
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,577
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I can't.</font></i>

371
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:22,480
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

372
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,275
I called a guy

373
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:27,127
who called a guy.

374
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,421
Second of all,

375
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,630
it's over.

376
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,033
With this particular individual
all you get is the one shot.

377
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,411
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll see if I can scrape</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">something else together,</font></i>

378
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,706
but don't get your hopes up.
No one else handles
that kind of bulk. Get it?

379
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,478
Thank you.

380
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,163
Excuse me,
can I take that?

381
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,182
Yes, thank you.

382
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,368
Can I help you, sir?

383
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,995
Sparkling water, please.

384
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,579
Yes, sir.

385
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,694
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

386
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,692
Sandra, from this moment on,

387
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,760
- we no longer make deliveries.
- Okay.

388
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,512
Help me close down
the register.

389
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,779
All right.

390
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,116
Can I help you, sir?

391
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,227
A sugar free lemonade,
please.

392
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,687
- Of course.
- And five minutes of your time.

393
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,902
Gladly, go to your table,
I'll bring you your order.

394
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,789
- Your lemonade.
- Thank you.

395
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,474
Have a seat, please.

396
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,978
Please.

397
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,779
How can I help you?

398
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,603
I would like to know why you
wouldn't meet with me today.

399
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,664
I'm sorry?

400
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,623
I'm not following.

401
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:57,736
I sat here this morning,
waiting to meet with someone.

402
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,738
I believe that person
was you.

403
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,118
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

404
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:07,096
I don't think I am.

405
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,313
Sir, if you have a complaint,

406
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,673
I suggest you submit it through
our complaint box.

407
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,275
That's what it's for.

408
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,759
Otherwise, you may also
use our e-mail system

409
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,595
which you will find
in our website.

410
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,600
I've been watching
you carefully.

411
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,662
I have a hypothesis.

412
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:36,651
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with,

413
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:41,656
is a serious, elegant,
very cautious man.

414
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,827
As far as I know, I believe
you are that person.

415
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,748
If you are
who I think you are,

416
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,668
and I'm pretty sure
you are,

417
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,964
you should give me
another chance.

418
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,611
I believe we're alike.

419
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:10,142
I don't think we're alike
at all, Mr. White.

420
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,479
You are not
a cautious man at all.

421
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:18,067
Your partner was late,
and he was high.

422
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,672
Yes, he was.

423
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,550
He's high often, isn't he?

424
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:29,119
You have poor judgment
to choose your partners.

425
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,080
Are you familiar
with my product?

426
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,933
I've been told it's excellent.

427
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,436
It is impeccable.

428
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,938
It is the purest.

429
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,758
My crystals could go
head to head

430
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,802
with anything you can find
in Mexico or the US.

431
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,198
That is not the only factor.

432
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:51,559
You could charge twice
the current rate, and
your customers would pay it.

433
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,287
See...

434
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,356
Who I choose to do business
with is not your problem.

435
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,819
You won't see him.
You won't interact with him.

436
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,130
Forget he exists.

437
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,425
I have to ask.

438
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,968
Why him?

439
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,430
Because I can trust him.

440
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,096
Because he does what I say.

441
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,418
How much product
do you have on hand?

442
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,380
17 kilos. Ready to go
at a moment's notice.

443
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,530
Will I hear from you?

444
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,034
I have your number.

445
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,953
When I need you, I'll call.

446
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:41,484
You can never trust
a drug addict.

447
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,839
Good night.

448
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,317
Look, this is what I mean.

449
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,176
It's all kind of little
dribs and drabs.

450
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,137
Three million pesos here,
another two there.

451
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,557
Two thousand dollars
for imports
which don't exist.

452
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,685
Another four thousand
over there...

453
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,538
It's a lot.

454
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,482
You said it,
it's all dribs and drabs.

455
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:24,002
Sure, Ernesto.

456
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:27,905
Once you add it all up,
though, it adds up to a lot.

457
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,367
The revenues are almost
10 percent less than
was actually received.

458
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:35,746
And this is every quarter,
for the last two years.

459
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:42,336
When I saw that, I got worried.
That's why I'm here.

460
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,589
So I checked Accounts Receivable
on other customers.

461
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,216
I found six other
instances

462
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:50,177
of revenues being
under-reported.

463
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,095
And I've only just started
to look into it.

464
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,283
Yes.

465
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,703
You know what the deal is?

466
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:01,980
Some of our clients
they overestimate their needs
for the next quarter,

467
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,025
and if I don't,
they'll go elsewhere.

468
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:10,239
Obviously, we forgot.
But the money's coming in.

469
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,301
Right, but...

470
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,179
I took a look at storage,

471
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:20,374
there's no backup for the
reported revenues at all,

472
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:24,754
I found Xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

473
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,064
Let's talk plainly.

474
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:36,640
All right. You got me.
This is all upside down.

475
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:40,603
We're talking nearly
700 million pesos
of undocumented revenue.

476
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:44,314
Almost as much in dollars,
some 400 thousand there,

477
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,416
floating for all to see.

478
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:55,158
Cielo, I'm thinking
about saving this company.

479
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,580
I'm thinking about people's
jobs, not to mention my own.

480
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,498
It doesn't mean that you
have to break the law.

481
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,167
- Yes, it does!
- The Government can catch you
just like that.

482
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,146
Yes! I have to do something.

483
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,340
- That's what I'm doing.
- People go to prison for this.

484
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,854
My dad built this company
from nothing.

485
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,526
The people who work here
are like family.

486
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:33,155
I can't let that all
fall apart because
of a couple of bad years.

487
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,550
I can't do that.

488
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,620
That's why I'm telling you:
I need you to help me, please.

489
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,097
What are you saying?

490
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,499
Ernesto, I can't
get involved in this.

491
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,208
My firm would be backing
these numbers.

492
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,710
Forget it!
I'm sorry. No.

493
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,479
You are right, I'm sorry.

494
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,817
Okay?

495
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,860
Help me.

496
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:08,084
Hey, man,
this is Tripa.

497
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,937
Just checking in with you, man.

498
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,985
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We missed you</font></i>

499
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,320

508
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:54,582
I like to mix some ice with it.

509
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,043
I never did heroin.

510
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,460
What's it feel like?

511
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,922
There's a chill,

512
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,784
don't freak out.
It passes.

513
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,882
Ready? Come.

514
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,465
Where to?

515
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,930
Close your hand.

516
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,932
Hold it tight.

517
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,485
Ready?

518
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,258
I'll meet you there.

519
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:13,012
Guys, phones off, please.

520
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,353
All right, time's up.

521
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,379
Please, sign your exams
and hand them over,

522
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,358
and go to recess, please.

523
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,239
Thank you.

524
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,282
Close on your way out, please.

525
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,091
Yes!

526
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,066
Hi, Miss.

527
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,901
What can I do for you?

528
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,612
Where's the manager?

529
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,348
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?

530
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,516
I'm sorry,
there's some confusion.

531
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,520
I'm actually looking for the man
who was in charge yesterday.

532
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:24,524
He's... He's a tall man,
he was wearing a tie,

533
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,251
very proper.

534
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,031
No. That's the owner.
That's Mr. Gustavo.

535
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:33,592
That's who I'm looking for.

536
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,786
Uhmmm... He could be
at any one of his branches.

537
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,914
- How many are there?
- Fourteen.

538
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,919
Is there any way
I could get in touch with him?

539
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,563
I'm sorry, sir.

540
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:49,258
I can't give that out.
That's private information.

541
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,733
Sure, I understand.

542
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,430
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

543
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,915
Seventeen kilos,

544
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:06,691
1,200,000 dollars
in Colombian pesos
at current change.

545
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,986
It will be in the Shooting
Range, near Soacha.

546
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,864
How long do I have?
It's about 40 kilometers
from here.

547
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,075
One hour.
You're in or out?

548
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,135
In. In. Absolutely.

549
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,664
But I just need a little
more time. I won't make it
in this traffic.

550
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,627
If you miss it,
don't ever show your face
in here again. One hour.

551
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,316
Jose Miguel, come on!

552
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,693
Where the fuck is he?

553
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,487
I need the product now!

554
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,613
I'm coming by.

555
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,032
My cell phone.

556
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:24,620
Ouch!

557
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,012
Jose Miguel!

558
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:48,977
Jose, open up!

559
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,482
Jose!

560
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:09,623
Jose!

561
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,760
Jose, Jose!

562
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,888
Wake up, Jose!

563
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,456
Jose Miguel,
wake up, you moron!

564
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,098
Let go.

565
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,298
Wake up!
Where's the product?

566
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,650
In the kitchen.

567
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:19,360
Where?

568
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,321
Wake up, moron!

569
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,065
BABY IS COMING

570
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:43,110
No! Shit!

571
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,238
Not now!
