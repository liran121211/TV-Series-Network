1
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,739
- Good day, sir.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,410
Can you please
turn the music down?

3
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,305
Down means off, sir.

4
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,352
The car's papers, please,

5
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,146
license and registration.

6
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,533
Is there any problem?

7
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,726
Driving with a broken windshield
in this state is a violation

8
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,912
to the Federal Traffic Law, sir.

9
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,706
Yes, officer, I know.

10
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,691
In fact, I'm on my way
to the repair shop.

11
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,627
I live near the site

12
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,546
of the planes crash.

13
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,130
Have you heard about it?

14
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,948
Yes, yes, I was there
giving a hand

15
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,700
when the debris
was being collected.

16
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,594
Well, just figure,

17
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,014
I was there, precisely,

18
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:44,373
and wreckage from the plane
landed on my windshield

19
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,061
and broke it like this.

20
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:50,689
What a coincidence?

21
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,464
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

22
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,093
I'm giving you a
ticket, sir.

23
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,071
But you don't believe

24
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,031
what I just said or what?

25
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,181
Look, sir, regardless
of what I believe or not,

26
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,201
I have to write you a ticket.

27
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,745
Wait here, please.

28
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,121
You can't lock me in here.

29
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,539
Sir, stay in the car.

30
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,999
Listen, officer.

31
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,877
Please, let me explain, yes?

32
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,485
So now you're
tasering me or--!

33
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,240
This is a violation
to my rights!

34
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,676
Don't you get the scale

35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,386
of what happened to me or what?

36
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,388
Motherfuc--!

37
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,597
José Miguel...

38
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,475
Hi, dad.

39
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,211
I see you're remodeling
the place, cool.

40
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,463
Yes, yes.
We did some work to it.

41
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,066
That's great.

42
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,884
And you, son?
Are you doing okay?

43
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,904
Yeah, dad. I'm great.

44
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,032
I was in the neighborhood

45
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:07,558
and I haven't been here
for a while, so...

46
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,954
Well, I saw the "On sale" sign.

47
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,664
It's the best option.

48
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:17,693
No one in the family
is using it, so...

49
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,529
And the upstairs bathroom
you fixed it too or what?

50
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:24,700
Sure, we changed the tiles
we had it all redone.

51
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,220
Cool.

52
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,263
Can I come in to--?

53
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,081
I don't think so.
The builders

54
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,017
are working and...

55
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,686
You know.

56
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,771
Yeah, I know.

57
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,273
Well, dad, I'd better stay

58
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,442
out of their way, then.

59
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,470
There are some pretty pics
on the state agency's site.

60
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,283
Cool.

61
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,326
Say hi to mom for me, will you?

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,953
Sure.

63
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,772
She'll be glad to know
I saw you

64
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,190
and that you're
doing good.

65
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,609
Great, and maybe
one of these days

66
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,878
we can have lunch together.

67
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,504
Lunch.

68
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:06,366
Yes, yes.
One of these days.

69
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,053
See you, then.

70
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,929
Take care, son.

71
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,544
I know he committed
contempt for authority

72
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,172
and lack of respect and
premeditation, but...

73
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,300
Look, I can assure you,
he's a nice guy.

74
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,111
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

75
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:27,012
The thing is he's got
some problems right now.

76
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,513
As it happens,
he's got lung cancer.

77
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,432
His wife kicked him out.
He's screwed.

78
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,285
Come on, help him out.

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,741
Walter, do you have anything
to say to the officer?

80
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,220
Look, in fact,

81
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,763
I have no valid justification

82
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,248
for having defied
your authority.

83
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,310
I made a mistake.

84
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:00,921
I'd like to apologize
for being disrespectful.

85
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,483
Thanks a lot.

86
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,485
Look.

87
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,493
Thanks, bro.

88
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,791
Do you know where my car is?

89
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,442
Cielo said she would
have it fixed.

90
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,181
Cielo wants to divorce me.

91
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:38,792
Bro.
I don't...

92
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,295
She doesn't want me to see
the children either.

93
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,690
She told you that?

94
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,817
You know me, bro.

95
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,926
I don't like sticking
my nose, you know.

96
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,014
But if she's asking you
that much,

97
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,599
it's because you screwed it
big time?

98
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,918
Can I get a ride?

99
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,570
Yeah, sure.
The car's over there.

100
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,142
At last!

101
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,668
What? I'm the ugly
girlfriend or what?

102
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,463
You don't call, don't write,
don't talk to me.

103
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,298
- What is it?
Saúl...

104
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,384
I've had many women
in my life

105
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:30,510
who had used me,
you know?

106
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,180
They just want my body,
my flesh,

107
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:38,018
and then they disappear.
I'm their sex toy.

108
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,479
They just leave without
noticing that within this body

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,148
there's a man
who has feelings.

110
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,234
Don't do that too,
Walter, please.

111
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,070
Tell me I'm something
more to you than that.

112
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,881
Or am I your toy as well?

113
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,716
Enough, Saúl!

114
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,700
Please, I'm not in the mood
for your jokes today?

115
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,577
This day had
a pretty bad start for me.

116
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,180
What? What happened?

117
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,456
Anything in particular
I should know?

118
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,475
I'm your lawyer.

119
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,935
No, nothing worth mentioning.

120
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,311
Get to the point, okay?

121
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,729
Why are you here?

122
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,856
Wait, in there...

123
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,716
wouldn't you have dirt laundry
on the floor

124
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,343
or a fat woman snoring
or anything of the sort?

125
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,779
What?

126
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,239
No!

127
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,949
Of course, not!

128
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,766
I know who I'm dealing with.
But, you know?

129
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,369
You should think about it,

130
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,103
because I've got a cousin
I can introduce you to

131
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,705
and she can help you--

132
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,940
Enough, Saúl.
Knock it off, will you?

133
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,001
Please.

134
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,822
Fine, we'd better talk
inside.

135
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,467
I don't know when,

136
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:36,868
but my life turned
into a complete disaster,

137
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,703
not even in my
worst nightmares

138
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,973
I went through stuff like this.

139
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,516
Please.

140
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,227
You don't need to exaggerate.

141
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,670
You have no idea
how I'm feeling.

142
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,440
Of course I do!

143
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,007
I'm much more experienced
than you

144
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,277
when it comes to break-ups.

145
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,178
The first two times
you're kicked out of the house

146
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,947
you feel you're a mess.

147
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,722
But then when you learn
to do the dishes,

148
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,433
and to replace
the toilet paper roll,

149
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,393
you realize it's not
that big of a deal.

150
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,121
Enough.

151
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,563
I'm not in the mood
for your jokes, man.

152
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,648
I'm being serious.
But, anyway,

153
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,734
let's leave aside
the romantic aspect of it.

154
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,571
This is very simple:
your wife won't talk.

155
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,424
She'll keep her pie hole shut.

156
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,009
She will?

157
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,469
How can you be so sure?

158
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:20,180
Just one word:

159
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:24,600
consequences.

160
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,769
Look, if she blabs,

161
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,772
it'll be a disaster for her.

162
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,649
Let's analyze it.

163
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,050
What would happen if everything
is out to the open?

164
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,135
I go to jail,
she hates me, I die.

165
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,571
End of story.

166
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,823
No, no, it's not the end

167
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,682
because there are
more characters in the story.

168
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,185
Sorry for making you think
beyond your belly button?

169
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,787
Let's analyze things

170
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,357
from Cielo's point of you,
for example.

171
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,001
What would happen to her?

172
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,529
First, her brother in law,
the anti-narcotics genius.

173
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,840
He'd be so screwed!

174
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,633
You were right under his nose

175
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,093
and he didn't even see you.

176
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,012
He'd end up a supermarket guard.

177
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,015
Then, your kids.

178
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,418
They'd need therapy
for the rest of their lives.

179
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,295
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"My dad is a gangster</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and my mom turned him in."</font></i>

180
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,340
It'll be like
those Peruvian TV shows

181
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,758
where they say:
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"Let the bastard come in!"</font></i>

182
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,236
That would be you, in this case.

183
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,197
And then, the house.

184
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,492
Bye bye house.

185
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,435
They'd apply
expiration of ownership

186
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,479
and the house will become
headquarters

187
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,231
of a random emerging
political party.

188
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,042
No, she won't talk.

189
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,710
She's smart

190
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,612
and I'm sure she analyzed
the consequences.

191
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,821
Do you know
what she really wants?

192
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,908
She wants you to
swallow it.

193
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,369
The problem isn't wether she
talks to the police or not.

194
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,581
The problem is she kicked me
out of her life.

195
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,392
I lost my family, Saúl.

196
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,251
That was the only thing
that mattered.

197
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,522
I did all this for them.

198
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,715
Fine, I get it
and it's hard,

199
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,092
but you've got to fight,
you know?

200
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,028
One day at a time.

201
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,263
Besides, let's see the
bright side of things.

202
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,157
You're back on the market.

203
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,683
Second-hand, but,
anyway...

204
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,768
No, I don't want to be
at any market!

205
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,038
I just want my life back!

206
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,273
Walter, don't jump
into conclusions.

207
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,792
You have no idea

208
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,919
how women are nowadays.

209
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:19,030
Did you know that young girls
get waxed completely

210
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,800
from head to toes?

211
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,535
Each one of their hairs, man!
They have nothing.

212
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,247
It's like the slide
of happiness!

213
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,500
In the meantime, Walter,
and only to distract you

214
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,018
from your dreadful thoughts,

215
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,731
you could do what you do best.

216
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,676
You and I know
what that is.

217
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,302
How about,
I don't know,

218
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:45,765
some cooking to kill time
and clear bad ideas?

219
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,577
Definitely, no.

220
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,228
I won't be the bad guy
in this movie.

221
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,525
No, I'm not the bad guy
in the story.

222
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,152
Okay, I see you need
more time.

223
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,005
Fine, take your time.

224
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,533
I'll talk to you later,
I'm with you, man.

225
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:06,620
In the meantime,
try to stay alive.

226
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,707
Be strong, bro.
Be strong.

227
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,417
Enjoy what you have now,
I don't know,

228
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,253
this room's nice,
you could do something.

229
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,047
I can call my cousin,
if you want--

230
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:21,695
Knock it off with your cousin!

231
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,488
Be strong, my friend.

232
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,583
Pop-pop, can I have some
money for some cotton candy?

233
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,895
You should promise me something.

234
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,480
Don't tell your mom

235
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,880
because she always
tells me off

236
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,234
when I get you candy, okay?

237
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,236
That should be enough.

238
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,996
Yes?

239
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,331
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We have a problem</font></i>

240
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,750
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">with the cook's wife.</font></i>

241
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,084
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need eyes on it.</font></i>

242
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,002
We got an address?

243
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,972
Honey, aunt María
and Henry

244
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,559
are bringing takeout
in a while.

245
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,729
But I can fix you something
if you're hungry.

246
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,665
How about that?

247
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,520
What?

248
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,339
Is there any problem
with my sushi?

249
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,442
I've had enough trans-fat

250
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,861
for one lifetime.

251
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,530
I just have one question.

252
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:33,117
How long was it for that fish

253
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,645
since it left the ocean,
they put it on a boat,

254
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,563
it got to the restaurant,
someone ordered takeout,

255
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:43,485
and now it's on María's table,

256
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,379
Let me tell you something,

257
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,238
that bullshit
the Japanese tell us

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,133
that you have to eat raw fish,

259
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,718
I won't buy it!

260
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,786
You know why the Japanese
do that?

261
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,555
You know why?

262
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,973
Because they want to save what?

263
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,124
The grill, the oil,
the grill chef.

264
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,853
Sure!

265
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,628
As if I didn't know
these Japaneses!

266
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,938
Right, buddy?

267
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,733
Hey!

268
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,967
- Well.
You remember

269
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,529
that Morgan is looking for a job

270
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,155
to help in the house?

271
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,973
So let us know if you happen
to know of something.

272
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,142
Walter, my name
is Walter Junior,

273
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,939
like the man
you never mention.

274
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,859
Fine, if you don't want
to use that nickname

275
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,503
you like so much,

276
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,904
and you want to go back
to your name,

277
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:31,032
I have no problem
with that.

278
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,219
My dad had red eyes

279
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,595
after so much crying,

280
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,639
but you don't even care!

281
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,166
And now he won't even
drive me home

282
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,293
and I know that's because
you don't let him do it.

283
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,104
Honey...

284
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,923
I know
you don't love him,

285
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,942
but I do love my dad,

286
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,610
and I love him a lot.

287
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,803
And you don't let me see him
because you're a bitch!

288
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,989
Hey, hey, Junior!

289
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,641
You can't talk to your mom
like that.

290
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,746
Junior!

291
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:08,612
It's okay,
no problem.

292
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:14,075
Cielo, I know you must have
your reasons for all this.

293
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,637
Cielo, look, I know

294
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,140
it's none of my business.

295
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,395
But keeping Walt from the kids?

296
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,046
Don't you think
you're exaggerating?

297
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:36,681
You're right,
it's none of your business.

298
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,555
Something weird is going on.

299
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,474
Aren't you curious?

300
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,517
No, I'm not curious.

301
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,627
So what?
I'm imagining things now?

302
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,439
Look, when I knew Walter

303
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,715
had two cell phones,
everything was clear to me.

304
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,926
Believe me,
I've seen it a hundred times.

305
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,361
You saw what?

306
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,155
Stop dancing around it.

307
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,782
Look at Walter.

308
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,518
He's a decent guy,
a smart guy, a nice guy.

309
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,354
But he hasn't done well
in life.

310
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,230
He's failed in almost
everything.

311
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,232
He's done,
am I right?

312
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,943
He's got no willing to live,
he's got cancer.

313
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,587
What does he do?

314
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,072
He gets a lover,
the wife finds out,

315
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,700
and the guy, out of guilt,
confesses.

316
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,493
Besides,
Walter is the typical guy

317
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:42,556
who can't say a lie.

318
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,266
I don't know.

319
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,834
You don't know
what, María?

320
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,503
I don't know.
I think it's something else.

321
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,897
Cielo would've told me

322
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,025
if it was that.

323
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,592
- Something else?
-I don't know. I don't know.

324
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,313
I want surveillance
and monitoring

325
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,375
24 hours a day.

326
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,210
How much will that be?

327
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,670
What?

328
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:19,426
No, I'm in the wrong business.

329
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,285
No, no, no,
it's okay, look.

330
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,872
Fine, anyway,
we'll work things out.

331
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,140
Don't worry about that.

332
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,517
Fine.

333
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,853
Bye, bye.

334
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,730
The return of the prodigal son!

335
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,439
So nice to see you!

336
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,340
- How are you doing?
- I'm good, hanging there.

337
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,776
Hanging there?

338
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,319
Man, you're great!

339
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,178
Young, rich,
no commitments.

340
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,014
I would've loved to be
in your position

341
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,575
at your age

342
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,078
with my mouth and loaded.

343
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,996
Speaking of money...

344
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,960
Here's your stash.

345
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,699
I took good care of it,
you know?

346
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,343
Hey, by the way,

347
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,037
your former partner
is giving me an ulcer.

348
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,806
After all he did

349
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,433
to build this great business,

350
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,226
now he wants to walk out.

351
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,938
How about that?

352
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,338
He's got a great talent, but
he flushes it down the toilet.

353
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,113
Look, I know you're not

354
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,656
into this any more, but

355
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,368
could you help me out here?

356
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,727
I mean, you could try
to convince him,

357
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,246
and then--

358
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,624
Look, Saúl...

359
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,501
Fine, yes, I know.

360
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,655
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
and he won't listen to you.

361
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,699
Can I interest you
in a business?

362
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,719
Sure!

363
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,014
- Hello.
- Yes, sir. Good afternoon.

364
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,850
- Your key. Come in.
- Thanks.

365
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,739
- Hello.

366
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:50,285
What are you doing here?

367
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,021
Does your mom
know you're here?

368
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:56,167
Can we talk?

369
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,445
- Hello.

370
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,348
I'm sorry,
do you need the space?

371
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,308
I don't have enough room
for all this

372
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,952
on my desk.

373
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:58,188
No, no, no, I'm here
to see Valentina.

374
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,249
Hello, sweetie!

375
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,168
Hello, Valentina!

376
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,585
She's so beautiful.

377
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,069
Ernesto,
I wanted to thank you

378
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,488
for being so flexible
on me coming in.

379
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,841
Honestly, you have no idea

380
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,509
how easier my life is

381
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,179
having Valentina here.

382
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,554
Look, I'd do anything

383
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,556
to keep you here longer.

384
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,127
You do brighten
up the place.

385
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,172
We need to talk about something
you're not gonna like.

386
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,359
I really can't sing off

387
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,027
on these balance sheets.

388
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,029
I'm sorry, but I can't.

389
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,614
So? What can we do?

390
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,515
If you're going to cook
the books,

391
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,327
it can't be so glaring!

392
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,379
Tell me.

393
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,364
There's revenue with
no backup everywhere.

394
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,366
It's all there is.
Nothing has its backup.

395
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,345
This can't be done!

396
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,680
Cielo, this is all I have.

397
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,140
You know what?

398
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,624
I'll keep you
out of all this.

399
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,561
Okay?

400
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:06,047
Have you even thought
what your kids would think

401
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,901
if they knew about this?

402
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,238
What would you tell them?

403
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,514
I don't know...
I don't.

404
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,476
I'd say that everyone
makes mistakes,

405
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,561
that I did it
thinking of them,

406
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,998
for their own good.

407
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,941
And I'd ask them to try
to understand.

408
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,211
I don't know.

409
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,422
You know what?

410
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,007
I'm too busy worrying

411
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,991
about solving
my present situation.

412
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,702
I don't know what
will happen tomorrow.

413
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,012
Walter, I'm at a meeting
right now, I can't--

414
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,223
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Listen, I just wanted</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to tell you Junior</font></i>

415
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:58,867
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">is here with me.</font></i>

416
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,643
He was waiting for me
when I got back.

417
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,936
- What?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Don't you worry.</font></i>

418
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,497
I talked to him already.

419
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,731
He knows he has
to come back home.

420
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,542
But, dad!

421
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,986
Junior has to head back home
immediately.

422
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,738
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, Cielo,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know that.</font></i>

423
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,699
What's more,
I'm giving him a ride.
Don't you worry.

424
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,952
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, I'd rather</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you brought him right now</font></i>

425
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,888
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">here to my office.</font></i>

426
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,039
Yes, but I don't have
my car right now

427
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,041
and going to your job
at this hour

428
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,585
it's a nightmare,
with all this traffic.

429
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,046
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Isn't it better if I take him</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">home directly?</font></i>

430
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,465
Well, do that,
but not too late!

431
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,859
Yes, sure. No problem.

432
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,363
See you later.

433
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,615
Dad, why does mom do this?

434
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,683
She doesn't want us to meet
and you help her!

435
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,788
Well, it's not like that.

436
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,873
How is it then?

437
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,876
Well, your mom...

438
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,338
She has her reasons.

439
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,299
What reasons, dad?

440
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:58,493
Well, they're just a little
difficult to explain.

441
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:03,015
But, let's see, Junior,

442
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,458
there are two sides
to every story, you know?

443
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,339
And in this case,
well, your mom...

444
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,943
I don't know. Whatever.

445
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,553
This is just how
it has to be for now,

446
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,322
you get that?

447
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,473
You've got to be with your mom
at your house--

448
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,075
And you too, dad.

449
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,101
Aunt María,
uncle Henry and I

450
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,021
know you haven't done
anything wrong.

451
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,082
And we are on your side.

452
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,211
Well, it's not

453
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,087
about taking sides, though.

454
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,631
I don't know what's going on.

455
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,283
But why you let her
treat you like this?

456
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,053
Why?

457
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,496
Junior, enough, calm down.
Take it easy, champ.

458
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:47,166
Listen, the important thing here
is that whatever happens,

459
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,503
our feelings for you
will never change.

460
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,606
You should get that straight.

461
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,632
Your baby sister and you
will always be

462
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,384
the most important thing
in the world for us.

463
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,363
Above anything else.

464
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,448
You get that?

465
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:06,912
Junior, do you get that?

466
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,123
Show me some teeth. Say yes.

467
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,083
Yeah! Good!

468
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,701
- Attorney, how are you?
- How are you?

469
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,304
Hello!

470
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,432
Mrs. Sofía, how are you?

471
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,624
- Mr. Guillermo.
- Nice to meet you.

472
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,101
I'm Saúl Bueno.

473
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,645
You're the attorney

474
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,146
in the late night show, right?

475
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,299
Yes, I am!
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"Better call Saúl</font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> "!</font>

476
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,635
Well, very well.
Let's cut to the chase.

477
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,279
We're meeting today

478
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,780
to discuss the details

479
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,407
of the sale of our property.

480
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,950
Of course!

481
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,785
The meter is not running

482
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,245
and the time flies, right?

483
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,123
Well, today's your lucky day.

484
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,999
I represent a client

485
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,834
who chose to remain anonymous.

486
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,486
But for you to get
the picture,

487
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,004
imagine someone

488
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,340
with a bag full of cash.

489
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,925
Well, this person

490
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,743
wants to buy the
property from you today,

491
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,180
instant payment.

492
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,124
- Instant payment?
Great?

493
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,585
Fine, I've been talking
with Leopoldo already

494
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,671
and showed him my client's
pertinent financials

495
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,631
and, you know,
we're talking

496
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,108
about serious figures here.

497
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,735
Yes, indeed.

498
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,220
That's in Guillermo and Sofía
best interest.

499
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,972
That's why we're sitting here,
attorney.

500
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,659
Sustained, attorney.

501
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,619
So, let's proceed then

502
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:31,270
with the signing of
the deeds.

503
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,523
That expense will be paid
by my client,

504
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,192
of course, and that's it,
we're ready.

505
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,236
I can wire you
your money today

506
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,322
to your account
abroad, in dollars,

507
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,407
just like Leopoldo told
me you wanted to.

508
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,368
There's just one tiny
little detail

509
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,638
I'd like to discuss with you.

510
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:51,040
What we call "one little
hair in the soup."

511
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,083
- The price.
- Okay.

512
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,670
We've estimated
that 800 thousand dollars

513
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,505
would be price
for this excellent property.

514
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,608
We feel that's a fair price.

515
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,218
Of course,
we're open to negotiation.

516
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,196
Well, so we could think

517
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,514
of 400 thousand,
and we're all happy.

518
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,074
Excuse me?

519
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,618
That's half the price.

520
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,477
Are you making fun of us,
attorney?

521
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,121
No, no, let's see, sir.

522
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,398
The house,
even before the remodeling,

523
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,711
was worth much more than that.

524
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,795
That's my offer.

525
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,239
What kind of joke is this?
Let's go, come on.

526
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,841
It's a pretty good offer

527
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,659
taking into account
that in that house

528
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,453
there was a lab
that processed

529
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,456
and produced
illegal drugs.

530
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,227
In the basement, remember?

531
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,211
I've read in detail
the clauses of the contract,

532
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:40,273
because that's how I am,

533
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,091
and I didn't find
any mention

534
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,194
of this matter.

535
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,596
I didn't find either
any report

536
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,932
to anti-narcotics
police, right?

537
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,850
This would be an
excellent case

538
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,412
for my TV show!

539
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,163
I'd call it:

540
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,023
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"Fraud with concealing</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of a felony."</font></i>

541
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,609
And I believe
that people like you,

542
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,336
so respectable, the Rosas,

543
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,986
a family
with such a good
reputation

544
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,823
in the society of Bogotá,
would get stained

545
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,866
if related with a case
like this one, right?

546
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,535
I'm not judgmental,
whatsoever,

547
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,555
not me, of course.

548
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,957
But here, in this country,
people like gossiping.

549
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,501
Leopoldo,
are you blackmailing us? Fuck!

550
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,253
How could you present us
with such a motherf--?

551
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,022
You have every right

552
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,381
of course,
to refuse negotiations

553
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,900
with my client.

554
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,594
If that's the case,
good luck

555
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,740
in trying to sell

556
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,224
a meth-contaminated
house.

557
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,103
The modern devil,
the demon of these days.

558
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:39,816
And god luck
with the future lawsuits
from buyers

559
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,543
who'd feel defrauded,

560
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,235
and who I could,
eventually,

561
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:49,742
represent and make this
business last forever.

562
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,244
I'm telling you for information
purposes, of course,

563
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,722
because you're mature people

564
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,665
and can make
your own decisions,

565
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,667
the ones you
consider pertinent.

566
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,503
Now, what's your advice,
counselor?

567
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,973
- Hey!
- Hello.

568
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,828
You heard us coming?

569
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:18,538
Look, I brought pizza.

570
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,898
Junior's dinner
is ready.

571
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,400
Well, we'll put it
in the fridge.

572
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,196
It'll be delicious tomorrow
reheated.

573
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,132
Hello, honey.

574
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,015
I'm sorry.

575
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,018
He's a bit agitated.

576
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,436
But a slice of pizza

577
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,856
will change his mood for sure.

578
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,508
I told you already.
Junior's dinner is ready.

579
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,319
Cielo, let's talk.

580
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,780
About that?

581
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,806
What kind of example
do we want to set here?

582
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,284
Please!

583
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,311
We sit at the table,
have some pizza,

584
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,956
and talk about his as grown-ups.

585
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,066
I already said
what I had to say.

586
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,820
There's nothing else
to discuss, Walter.

587
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,989
Haven't you understood
a word I said, or what?

588
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,742
Cielo,
it's pepperoni pizza.

589
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,421
Hello?

590
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,965
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When I went out this morning,</font></i>

591
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,073
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I found a pizza</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">something threw away.</font></i>

592
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:39,119
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you happen to have</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">anything to do with that?</font></i>

593
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,806
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, please!</font></i>

594
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,432
Get your act together.

595
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:46,002
Accept the situation
and keep your distance.

596
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,479
You know what?

597
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,022
If you don't do it,

598
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,440
I will get a restraining order.

599
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,858
Cielo, please...

600
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,860
And I'm not cleaning that!

601
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,594
Cielo, I'll do it.
Cielo, hello!

602
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,155
Goddamn!

603
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,992
Hello, Cielo, Cielo!

604
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,351
I don't get why I had
to do this myself.

605
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,727
We should've called
the gardener.

606
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,146
No, I won't let
that random person

607
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,540
who bought this house

608
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,208
gets the plants as well.

609
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,670
But I'll hurt my back--

610
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,236
No!
- Good day.

611
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,989
Son, I'm sorry
but it's really not a good time.

612
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,573
- Okay.
- José Miguel.

613
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,283
José Miguel,
look, the new owner of the house

614
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,094
is on his way.

615
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,913
Yes, I'm going in.
This is my house, see?

616
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,957
I bought it.
In fact, you know what?

617
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,711
I'm going to need
this spare set of keys, please.

618
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,396
And the plant also stays.

619
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,340
I planted it
with my grandma, okay?

620
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,152
Good luck! Take care.

621
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,037
Hush, my love.

622
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,177
Bye, take care.

623
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,762
Drive safe, okay?

624
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,414
Bye, my love.
Give me a kiss.

625
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,463
Cielo?

626
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,741
I've got information.

627
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,585
Boss, a call.

628
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,678
I'm listening.
