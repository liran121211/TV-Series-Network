1
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,581
So what?

2
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,458
How does it work?

3
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,151
You are talking
to the wrong man.

4
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,713
I just wanted to tell you

5
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:31,532
that if you just have
some extra grams...

6
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,511
of meth.

7
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,830
Are you shitting
me?

8
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:40,666
It shows you're a cop
from a mile distance.

9
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,878
I just want a little bit
of something.

10
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,254
I see where you
are coming from.

11
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,773
See that truck there.

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,592
- What truck?
- The one parked there.

13
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,093
The blue
one.

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,762
You are spying on me,
right?

15
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,114
What's wrong with you?

16
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:58,826
A flower van over there.

17
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,436
Can't you at least be
original?

18
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,621
Everybody uses that van.

19
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:05,441
Do you get
it?

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,152
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

21
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,029
The agents in the middle
of the garbage.

22
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,339
With gloves and everything.

23
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,093
I could never figure that out.

24
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,510
Sure.

25
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,054
Don't you say

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,665
that I'm not
helping justice!

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,042
Did you hear that?
Just think about it.

28
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,602
Okay, okay, you know what?

29
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:27,296
If you're not selling me,
I leave.

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,898
Good luck, good luck.

31
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,382
Come here, bro.
You gave up easily.

32
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,026
Come here.

33
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,344
I'm not a cop,
do you understand?

34
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,862
I'm not a cop.

35
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,363
Then lift your shirt.

36
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,141
Show me you're not
wearing a wire.

37
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,786
Okay.

38
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,188
No! I'm blinded by
white!

39
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,998
Douchebag.

40
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,608
Come on.
I was joking.

41
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,127
Come on, bro.

42
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,586
I'm just joking.

43
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,112
I wish I had your abs,
man.

44
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,256
Whatever, dude.

45
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,450
I'm not even sure
I want to buy anymore.

46
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,094
Come on, bro.

47
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,745
Try to put yourself
in my place.

48
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,498
I need to be sure
that you're not a cop.

49
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,059
And how do we do that?

50
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,336
I don't know, I have to think
about something.

51
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,422
I need to prove it,
you know?

52
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,108
I know!

53
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,801
Go over there and
punch that dude

54
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,361
right in the face.

55
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,972
That man?
Are you insane?

56
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,641
No way.
He'd kick my ass.

57
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,685
True that.
He would destroy you

58
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,788
with just one fist.

59
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,815
You know what?
I believe you, bro.

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,500
Two grams cost 100 dollars.

61
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,460
100 dollars?

62
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,863
Of course!
Purity is valuable, bro.

63
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,924
And where do we do it?

64
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,181
Done.
Enjoy it, man.

65
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,705
Okay, good luck.

66
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,082
One more thing.

67
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,459
Get on the ground!

68
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,838
What's up?

69
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,506
No, bro! No, no!

70
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,491
Come on!
Check him, check him.

71
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,968
He keeps it there.

72
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:24,013
Handcuffs!

73
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,952
Good night, dear viewers.

74
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,829
Welcome to this new edition

75
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,291
of Better call Saúl!

76
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,210
We have open lines,

77
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,670
9800-321-21-00,

78
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,380
for you to communicate with us.

79
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,674
Better call Saúl!

80
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,760
Here we can solve any problem

81
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,537
you have, even those
you think nobody can solve.

82
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,181
Here I am.

83
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,349
Today we have a lot of guests,

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,060
all of them innocent,

85
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,504
that will tell us their stories
in front of the camera.

86
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,839
Here we have
our first guest.

87
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,440
Come here.

88
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,800
- She's coming from...
- Hello.

89
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,384
the beautiful county
of Anapoima

90
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,012
and now she will
tell us her problem.

91
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,972
Not only to Saúl,
but also to you

92
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,807
because you are
her witnesses.

93
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,491
Go on.

94
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,645
I came here because I work
at a clothing store.

95
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,873
Mi boss accused me of stealing.

96
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,668
He heard I'm going to quit,

97
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,780
that's why he's
accusing me of stealing.

98
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,365
How do you call that?
Blackmail!

99
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,967
Extortion!

100
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,368
That crime will be
punished.

101
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,954
His crime, not hers,
because she's innocent,

102
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,580
she didn't steal
anything.

103
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,099
But she can't prove it.

104
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,416
From now on,
she can prove it

105
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,935
because she called Saúl

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,437
and has his counsel.

107
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,297
Don't worry, Mrs.
Go in peace.

108
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,799
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

109
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,692
Our next guest is John!

110
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,303
I was out partying,
minding my own business,

111
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,864
maybe in a place I shouldn't be,

112
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,184
but police arrived,
mistreated all us,

113
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,785
they asked me for my I.D.

114
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,645
and accused me
of something I didn't do.

115
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,872
I think that's abuse of power.

116
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,291
That's why I came--

117
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Exactly, abuse of power.</font></i>

118
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,028
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What did he do?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">He called Saúl. For what?</font></i>

119
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,587
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">For solving his problem,</font></i>

120
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,132
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">for avoiding the abuse of power.</font></i>

121
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,994
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mister, don't worry,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you are advised by Saúl.</font></i>

122
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,679
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I will solve your problem.</font></i>

123
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,290
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And the authority will have</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to pay for their abuse.</font></i>

124
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,251
I really need
to get some furniture.

125
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,836
I suggest you start with
a bed.

126
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,717
God, I wish we could smoke
in here.

127
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,514
- Well, you can't.
- I know.

128
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,433
Besides, I really respect
my landlady.

129
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,313
Don't think I can't
smell that weed.

130
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,691
You better seriously
hope that airs out.

131
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,584
Open the windows.

132
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,238
My dad can come by
surprise.

133
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,949
If he finds out,
he will kick you out

134
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,951
and keep your security
deposit.

135
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,578
- Really?
- Yes.

136
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,538
He has a nose like
a damn bloodhound.

137
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,766
Has he ever caught you?

138
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:20,564
Many times.

139
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,941
Do you think he can come today?

140
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,444
What do you say?

141
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,264
Maybe we should
light up some weed.

142
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,785
No, thanks.

143
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,082
Is it cool if I burn one?

144
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,042
Maybe you'll change your mind.

145
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,861
Do what you want to do,
it's okay.

146
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,531
Is everything okay?
Are you all right?

147
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,594
Did I say something wrong?

148
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,080
What is this?
Am I that good?

149
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,182
This is a medallion.

150
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,060
My 18-month chip.

151
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,728
I'm in recovery.

152
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,965
And smoking weed
is like stepping stones.

153
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,858
That's cool. Right on.

154
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,944
Congratulations.

155
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,639
You know, I don't really
burn much anymore.

156
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,908
It's just a sometime thing.

157
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,559
But no more in the house.
I promise.

158
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,537
Okay?

159
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,190
Do you want
to go grab some dinner?

160
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,292
We can eat here.

161
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,754
No, I better hit it.

162
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,549
Are you mad at me?

163
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,969
Are we cool?

164
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,012
Juana!

165
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,417
Don't you think
he's asking a lot?

166
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,144
Yes, and he knows it.

167
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,104
He's done nothing but apologize.

168
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,884
Is this going to be
every Saturday now?

169
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,261
It's just the end
of the quarter.

170
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,655
You remember how that was.

171
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,599
The good news is
that I am earning double time.

172
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:59,121
Ouch!

173
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,021
When the sleepyhead...

174
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,399
When the sleepyhead
we have as a son wakes,

175
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,041
tell him to wash those sneakers.

176
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,985
And tell him not to put them
in the washing machine.

177
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,046
He has to let them air dry.

178
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,012
Okay.

179
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,599
What?

180
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,935
It's Saturday.

181
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,840
I don't know,
maybe you could get casual.

182
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,634
I'm just saying it
because you are beautiful.

183
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,269
Maybe we'll order
a pizza tonight?

184
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,043
Bye.

185
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,548
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cielo, hi, are you there?</font></i>

186
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,817
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need to talk to you, Cielo.</font></i>

187
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,903
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know what to do.</font></i>

188
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,822
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Call me.</font></i>

189
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,075
Hi, María, what's up?

190
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,189
- Walter.
- How are you?

191
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,707
Thanks for coming.

192
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,002
You're welcome.

193
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,613
I came yesterday
and he was here.

194
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,116
He didn't even tell me
that he was coming back.

195
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,759
Who was killed?

196
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,619
Some Mexican guy
that was with him.

197
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,346
Three agents were wounded,

198
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,098
one of them lost his leg.

199
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,933
It was worst

200
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,918
than going to fight
with the guerrilla band,

201
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,337
where they have
land-mines

202
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,896
and bombs.

203
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,107
Because he lived a nightmare.

204
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,733
God.

205
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,735
And Gómez told me all this.

206
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,805
I heard him talking
to his boss,

207
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,266
but he didn't show
anything.

208
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,560
Then he hung up
and went to bed.

209
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,203
I asked him:

210
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,646
"What's going on?
What's going on?"

211
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,149
But he only said he was fine
and wanted to be alone.

212
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,900
- Is he upstairs?
- Yes.

213
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,862
- Should I?
- Please.

214
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,884
Not now, María!

215
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,138
It's me, Walter.

216
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,499
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?

217
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,460
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

218
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,338
- May I?
- Yes, come on in.

219
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,007
How are you
feeling?

220
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,234
Montezuma's Revenge, big time.

221
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,904
My stomach is really on fire.

222
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,682
Don't come too close
because I can...

223
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,410
Boom!

224
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,271
I'll take my risks.
Here.

225
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,904
I guess María told you about
what happened in Mexico.

226
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,090
Horrible.

227
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,536
And what did the boss there say?
That I should go back.

228
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,205
I was the man to stay
there,

229
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,623
- looking for those rats.

230
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,042
"Go back to
Colombia".

231
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,169
And what will you do?
Stay here?

232
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,272
No. Well, I don't know.

233
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,233
They are deliberating.

234
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,806
Do you want to talk it through
with somebody?

235
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,604
- Like who?
- I was thinking about María.

236
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,790
Or me, maybe.

237
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,294
Walter, I...

238
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,673
I don't know how to say it

239
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,907
because I don't want
to hurt you,

240
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,051
but talking with you...

241
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,554
How can I say it?

242
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,331
You and me don't have much
of what you might call

243
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,933
an experiential overlap.

244
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,231
What if I told you we do?

245
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,234
Look, Henry...

246
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,221
I have spent
my whole life scared.

247
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,489
Scared to death.

248
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,266
Frightened of things
that could happen,

249
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,201
might happen, might not happen.

250
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,454
50 years scared to death.

251
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,374
And 50 years is a long time.

252
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,985
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

253
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,463
But you know what?

254
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,990
Ever since my diagnosis
I sleep just fine.

255
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,259
Like a baby.

256
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,387
Okay.

257
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,139
Do you know what I found out?

258
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,685
That fear was my worst enemy.

259
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,878
I'm going to give you
some advice.

260
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,357
You can take it or not.

261
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,902
If I were you, I would get up,

262
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,306
I would get out
in the real world

263
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,409
and I would face reality.

264
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,662
Go get those bastards

265
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,414
and kick them

266
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,374
as hard as you can.

267
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,377
Because they deserve it.

268
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,580
- There it is.
- No, count them again.

269
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,541
- Walter!
- Again.

270
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,923
- That's it. 2000 dollars.
- Good.

271
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,259
You and I, we are going to feed
this machine 24 hours a day.

272
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,403
Right on.

273
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,330
Is this yours?

274
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,081
Give me that.

275
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,834
Okay, so this way.

276
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,170
We have 90.

277
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,130
110.

278
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,842
And this is for our parts.

279
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,951
Who's short?
Somebody didn't pay.

280
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,804
Okay, don't freak.

281
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,806
We didn't get ripped off.

282
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,542
Mono hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

283
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,920
I know he's planning on pulling
an all-nighter, so he's probably
still in the sack.

284
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,631
He's sleeping?
Then wake him up.

285
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,775
He can sleep after we're paid.

286
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,719
Why you have to be
such a hard on?

287
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,362
I'm not.

288
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,472
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.

289
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,141
This only works
when they're scared of you.

290
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,202
I can't believe you.

291
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,023
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after the tone.</font></i>

292
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,526
It's going straight
to voicemail.

293
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,628
Call again.

294
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,296
Walter...

295
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,215
You just count your money.

296
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,925
I'll handle this.

297
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,888
Is that okay?

298
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,146
Hi, Gordo, what's up?

299
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,107
Tell me, have you seen Mono?

300
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,777
Gordo!

301
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,863
Don't you cover for him!

302
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,931
I asked you
a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer!

303
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,491
Yes or no?

304
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,749
What?

305
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,589
Okay.

306
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,843
What's up?

307
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,513
They were too scared to tell me.

308
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,516
Mono got busted.

309
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,715
Is everybody fine?
Did you miss me?

310
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,176
You've got more lives
than a damn cat.

311
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,179
Now if I can only learn
to lick myself.

312
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,864
Come here!

313
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,600
Good to see you!
Where is the tequila
bottle?

314
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,519
No, brother.
They seized it in customs.

315
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,854
- What a problem...
- How is that?

316
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,231
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.

317
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,792
Come here, tell me.

318
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,193
Tell me what
happened here.

319
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,570
- Could you work alone?
- Everything's fine.

320
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,489
- Everything's fine?
- How have you been?

321
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,931
So?

322
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,582
You don't care about those
criminology guys,

323
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,184
do you?

324
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,896
What do you think?

325
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,673
No, tell me.
You know me, right?

326
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,178
It's like if somebody
sleeps with your wife.
Would you like it?

327
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,889
- Hey, hey!
- It's the same thing!

328
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,058
I don't like people
looking into my cases.

329
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,935
I've been working on this
for a long time,

330
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,020
I don't need anybody
sniffing around

331
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,622
when nobody called them.

332
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,982
Let me explain you
what has happened.

333
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,819
We asked them to inform us
in case they would know

334
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,195
something
about the blue crystal.

335
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,948
Sure enough, last
night.

336
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,133
Let's do something.

337
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,661
Let's go to see
him.

338
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,513
You will know.

339
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,015
Come on, man.

340
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,766
Okay, let's go.

341
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,338
I don't want to talk.
I feel manipulated.

342
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,465
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

343
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,927
I thought we were
going to hang out.

344
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,053
We are, Mauricio.
Do I call you
Mauricio?

345
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,780
Or Mono, like they call you?

346
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,323
Talk.

347
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,683
I'm trying to help you
here.

348
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,561
I don't like the people
that lie, understood?

349
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,354
- I like serious people.
- Mono, Mono, listen.

350
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,748
I need you to tell me

351
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,275
who is your supplier,
who gives you the drug

352
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,210
for you to sell it, okay?

353
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,863
If you tell me, I think this
can end very well for you.

354
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,422
Mono, think about it.

355
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:15,869
This is a perfect
felony!

356
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,662
What are you doing talking to
my client without me present?

357
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,597
Bad call, bad call.

358
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,599
Wait a minute.

359
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,393
Who is who?

360
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,187
Did you graduate at 14?

361
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,423
You are really
young.

362
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,508
Have you said something
to this baby?

363
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,697
Did you say anything stupid?

364
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,156
By anything stupid,

365
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,825
I mean anything at all.

366
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,410
Close your mouth.

367
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,328
I'm seeing your molar.

368
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,747
Ouch! You have to lose it.

369
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,124
I'm talking about the molar.

370
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,794
You, out.

371
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,296
A police officer

372
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,116
must be the first one
respecting the law.

373
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,886
Ask your school teacher.

374
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,388
Go.

375
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,932
Come on.

376
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,500
And go grab your
baby's bottle,

377
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,669
I think it's
hot enough.

378
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,106
Very good, okay.

379
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,899
Who are you, boy?

380
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,676
You don't care if I
call you boy, right?

381
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,929
I like my clients
feel I'm trustworthy.

382
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,989
Yes, I'm Mauricio Mejía.

383
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:22,535
Mauricio Mejía.

384
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,165
Mauricio Mejía, good.

385
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,870
here you are.

386
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,709
Public masturbation.

387
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,252
No, bro.

388
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,988
Why don't you do it
at home,

389
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,589
like the rest of us

390
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,050
watching a good porn movie?

391
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,576
You don't do it in
the streets.

392
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,637
I'm not that man.

393
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,205
I'm the one
who was selling meth.

394
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,848
They say so,

395
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,626
but that's bullshit.
I wasn't selling anything.

396
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,771
Here it is.

397
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,172
That's it,
Mauricio.

398
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,716
That was a little
transpositional error.

399
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,511
Nothing a correcting fluid
can't take care of.

400
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,073
Meth.

401
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,392
In this country,
this is a crime.

402
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,477
Yes, but it was
just a little bit.

403
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,121
You know? A little bit.

404
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,772
Yes, but you exceeded
the minimum dose.

405
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,415
Crystal!

406
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,109
Crystal,
that's uncommon here.

407
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,044
Good luck arguing that

408
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,088
in court.

409
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,717
I'll do what I always do

410
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,260
with good people,

411
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,871
that is to say, the people
with a check book.

412
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,665
I'm going to get you
a second phone call.

413
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,375
You can call
anyone.

414
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,461
Your mommy, your daddy,
your parish priest,

415
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,130
somebody who can
deliver me a check

416
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,816
for 4000 dollars.

417
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,551
I'll write that down on the
back of my business card.

418
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,987
One four, three zeros.

419
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,764
And I need that
in a cashier's check

420
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,365
or a money order.

421
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,808
Actually, I want it
in a money order.

422
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,561
And make it out to
"Wool and fabric

423
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,814
from La Sabana
and Associates".

424
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,816
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.

425
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,459
After that,

426
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,114
we can discuss the strategy
because my motto

427
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,923
is "anything has a price".

428
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,177
Any questions?

429
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,955
You're going to get me off,
right?

430
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,415
I look like your high
school girlfriend?

431
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,059
Five fingers, no waiting?

432
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,894
What do you think?

433
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,647
That's a joke, man.

434
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,567
Lighten up.

435
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,762
I will give you the
best criminal defense

436
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,823
that money can buy.

437
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,536
I took the vitamins already.

438
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,121
The blood pressure too.

439
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,832
Yes, everything's fine.

440
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,986
Of course, Panchita,
don't worry--

441
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,379
So, while we're working,

442
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,340
Panchita?

443
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,785
And, suddenly,
a dog this big comes at
me,

444
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,829
- a Great Dane.
- Here they are!

445
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,165
Criminal investigation
and anti-narcotics,

446
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,125
all of them together.
Nice!

447
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,936
Why don't you hold your hands?

448
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,462
You are discussing
my client, right?

449
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,839
Anything you care
to share with me?

450
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,508
Can I have a picture
with you?

451
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,218
Because my mother
loves

452
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,719
your shitty
commercials.

453
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,305
- Of course.
- I want to show it to her.

454
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,908
Everything for your mother.

455
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,644
Is she in rehab
or she's still smelling bad?

456
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,789
Awful, awful joke.

457
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,041
You have free time

458
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,417
in anti-narcotics, guys.

459
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,377
That poor and innocent boy

460
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,171
without a real future

461
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,158
will have his life ruined
in two seconds

462
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,675
because a stupid thing.

463
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:29,122
Let's be honest, the meth
you found is nothing.

464
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,166
Gentlemen, please,
in this country

465
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,044
we have more important issues
to solve.

466
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,670
I will give you
some free advice,

467
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,106
Huey, Dewey and Louie.

468
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,551
Carpe diem, gentlemen.
Carpe diem.

469
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,655
Hello.

470
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,897
So how about we get him
a real attorney?

471
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,356
I mean, what the
hell is this?

472
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,041
This is who he hires?

473
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,610
Are you kidding me?
This is Saúl Bueno.

474
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,420
Haven't you seen him?

475
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,756
"Better call Saúl".

476
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,134
Do you remember Emilio?

477
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
- Of course.
- So, this man

478
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,681
got Emilio off twice.

479
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,624
Both times, they had him
dead to rights.

480
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,060
But he did it.

481
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,046
Man, when a criminal
needs to be defended,

482
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,647
he needs another criminal.

483
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,065
That's how it works.

484
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,029
Walter, I promise

485
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,198
everything's going to be fine.

486
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,851
I know Mono might seem
a little bit stupid,

487
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,371
but he's way too loyal to roll.

488
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,788
Plus he's scared shitless of me.

489
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,416
He's threatened.

490
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:41,252
We pay this man fees,

491
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,962
and, when he frees Mono,

492
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,672
we take it out of his payroll.

493
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,117
And it's only his first
dealing rap.

494
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,427
They plead him out,

495
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,846
they won't take Mono to jail

496
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,556
when there's no place for him.

497
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,934
All right.

498
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,979
Go.

499
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,923
I don't need them
seeing my face.

500
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,025
And do I?

501
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,052
- No, I won't go.
- All right.

502
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,611
Let's flip a coin.

503
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,472
Mejía.
Mr. Mejía.

504
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,938
Come on
in.

505
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,666
Mr. Mejía.

506
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,960
Come in, Mr. Mejía.

507
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,197
You are the uncle
of Mauricio Mejía, right?

508
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,783
You are disguised,
so I was confused.

509
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,343
I didn't see it coming.

510
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,553
Despite I didn't know you,

511
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,680
I couldn't recognize you.

512
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,807
Don't worry, I'm joking.

513
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,395
Welcome, I'm Saúl Bueno.

514
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,896
Come on, come on.

515
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,464
So it's a shame
that we have to meet

516
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,109
under these circumstances.

517
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,928
I believe you have
something for me.

518
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,407
Good.

519
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,185
I'm sorry if I'm
straightforward,

520
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,978
but I don't like
misunderstandings.

521
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,039
Perfect. This is the best.

522
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,916
My apologies, anyway.

523
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,235
Please, have a seat
so I can explain you

524
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,504
the situation.

525
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,922
That's it.

526
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,715
Good.

527
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,009
I have great news.

528
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,953
Mauricio is going to get out
in no time.

529
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,430
There's still a few details

530
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,556
to be ironed out,

531
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,352
but I think he's looking

532
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,896
at time served and probation.

533
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,856
Good, good.

534
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,484
Perfect, thanks.

535
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,759
And that's not an easy
thing to do

536
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,320
because he was busted

537
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,554
by criminal investigation
agents,

538
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,406
but anti-narcotics

539
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,366
is also involved.

540
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,647
So leave your number
with Francisca

541
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,541
when you go out

542
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,502
and we'll be in touch.

543
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,297
Anti-narcotics?

544
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,215
Yes.

545
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,826
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news,

546
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,204
but your nephew got
mixed up with some
pretty nasty customers.

547
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,848
I understand that.

548
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,459
But what does that have
to do

549
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,420
with two different
forces

550
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,797
working in the same
investigation?

551
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,066
I will explain it to you.

552
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,610
They started working together.

553
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,322
They're after some mystery man,

554
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:17,033
some heavy-hitter that goes

555
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,578
by the name

556
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,955
Heisenberg.

557
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,042
I wonder if they wrote it right.

558
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,319
They want this guy like the ax
wants the turkey.

559
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,280
Seems your boy may have
information

560
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,173
that could lead to his arrest.

561
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,699
But don't worry
because your boy

562
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,259
was really good

563
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,345
and didn't say a word.

564
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,846
He didn't point fingers.

565
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,264
What does it mean?

566
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,765
We have good material

567
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,709
when the moment of
the negotiation arrives

568
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,228
and he starts talking.

569
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,687
No, no, Saúl,

570
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,131
there has to be
another way.

571
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,732
Another way?

572
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,093
Yes, there are two:
the first one,

573
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,070
Mauricio takes the deal

574
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,030
and starts telling stories.

575
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,433
The second one,
Mauricio goes to jail.

576
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,992
And you don't want to know

577
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,952
how they will resize his rectum

578
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,662
when he tries to bend

579
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,122
to get to the soap.

580
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,583
Yes, I know, Saúl,

581
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,376
but what if Mono...

582
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,877
I mean, my nephew

583
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,114
decides to inform on
this Heisenberg?

584
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,132
God forbids that

585
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,619
because these people
can take revenge.

586
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,722
Do you something know about him?

587
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,516
Because the kid keeps saying:

588
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,935
"if I talk, they'll kill me".

589
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,728
Right now, he's the only thing

590
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,481
holding up this deal.

591
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,982
Okay.

592
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,484
That's good.

593
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,985
Good?

594
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,779
God, that's terrible!

595
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,197
Mauricio won't last

596
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,949
in prison two weeks.

597
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,825
You let him take his chances

598
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,411
on the outside.

599
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,355
Besides, there are
other options.

600
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,872
Maybe I can work in

601
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,832
some witness protection.

602
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:52,529
No, look, Saúl.
These are vicious people.

603
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,406
I've been told that one of them
killed another man

604
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,909
by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

605
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,622
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

606
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,558
And other people believe it all.

607
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,645
Dear God!

608
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,213
The guy who got
his head smooshed

609
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,589
used to be a client
of mine.

610
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,190
It's a small world.

611
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,942
Do you know who did it?

612
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,986
His wife.

613
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,722
This is real life,
and that's a closed case.

614
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,324
Don't worry.

615
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,267
I'll convince Mauricio,
he will talk

616
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,995
and problem solved.

617
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,997
10.000 dollars.

618
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,922
10.000 dollars cash.

619
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,492
I'm not saying
to throw the case.

620
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,093
Just no talking

621
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,095
to anti-narcotics.

622
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,436
Are you saying

623
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,255
what I think you're
saying?

624
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,340
That dude wouldn't
take a bribe?

625
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,552
What do you think?
That son of a bitch.

626
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,612
"Morally outraged," he said.

627
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,406
He was really offended.

628
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,909
Threatened to call the police.

629
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,747
So Mono is going to spill?

630
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,442
Like the Exxon
Valdez.

631
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,754
So what do we do about it?

632
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,286
How about I follow you home,
Panchita?

633
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,804
I mean, Francisca.

634
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,873
For safety!
You can't go alone

635
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,392
in these lonely streets.

636
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,851
Isn't it dangerous?

637
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,837
No, no, thanks.
Don't worry.

638
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:37,775
What a shame.

639
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,553
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

640
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,206
Okay, relax. Relax.

641
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,583
Everything's fine.

642
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,084
Aah!

643
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,835
Talk to me, guys! Come on.

644
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,837
I have my wallet here,

645
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,297
it's in the left pocket.

646
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,617
And I have a golden ring
with an emerald.

647
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,761
And some collar not good,

648
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:08,038
but it was blessed
by Pope John Paul II.

649
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,640
Aaah!

650
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,892
No, no, please, no!

651
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,394
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

652
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,963
It was Ignacio,
it was Ignacio!

653
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,424
I am your friend, guys!
Your friend!

654
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:19,983
Shut up, ass hole!

655
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,402
What are you saying?

656
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,112
Did Gordon send you?

657
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,030
Who?

658
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,267
Dear God.
Thanks, God.

659
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,327
If you save me from this,

660
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,606
I will come back to church
every Sunday.

661
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,625
Okay, what do you want?

662
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,443
What do you need?
Anything!

663
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,129
Just tell me what you need.

664
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,756
This afternoon,

665
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,282
an associate of
ours

666
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,842
offered you $10.000.

667
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,302
And you said no.

668
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,804
Wait a minute.

669
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,330
This is in regards
to what's his name?

670
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,807
Mauricio Mejía!

671
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,224
Mejía.

672
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,477
The uncle.

673
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,104
That was your guy?

674
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,022
No offense, guys,

675
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,941
but I don't take bribes

676
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,612
from strangers, you know?

677
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,406
Better safe than sorry.

678
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,575
But I'll take your money! Sure!

679
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,645
No, no.
That offer's expired.

680
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,747
It was kind of low anyway.

681
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,541
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

682
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,794
Just tell me what you need.

683
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,671
I'm easy to work with.

684
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,155
I'm going to keep a happy
thought and assume

685
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,491
this is just
a negotiating tactic.

686
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,093
I can forget really fast

687
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,705
that you tried to kill me,
folks.

688
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,081
- Listen to me very carefully.
- Yes.

689
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,250
You are going to give
Mauricio

690
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,711
the best legal representation
ever.

691
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,088
But no deals
with anti-narcotics.

692
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,673
If Mauricio
identifies anyone,

693
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,191
you will pay for that.

694
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,485
Me?

695
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,571
Why don't you just kill him?

696
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,532
Follow me, guys.

697
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,241
If a mosquito's

698
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,786
buzzing around you,

699
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,287
it bites you on the ass,

700
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,356
you don't go gunning
for the mosquito's attorney.

701
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,650
You go grab a flyswatter
and kill the bastard.

702
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,210
I mean, so to speak.

703
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,670
Listen, listen!

704
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,588
We're not killing Mono.

705
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,048
I mean Mauricio.

706
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,844
Then you got real problems.

707
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,595
Because anti-narcotics agents

708
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,915
will make him tell them
what his grandmother died of.

709
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,585
I don't know
if you know that boy,

710
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,379
but I could notice,
in the few minutes
I've been with him,

711
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,481
that he won't

712
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,858
be able to go through

713
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,152
the minimum time in jail.

714
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,906
He will have to talk.

715
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,224
He doesn't have
any other choice,

716
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,243
no matter what happens to me.

717
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,461
Mr. Mejía?

718
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,505
Mr. Mejía, my friend.

719
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,494
I recognize
a friendly coughing.

720
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,204
Why don't you take that mask off
so you can breath?

721
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,390
Take it off, breath.

722
00:31:56,415 --> 00:32:00,002
Get some air.
Go on.

723
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,378
You are going to choke
with that.

724
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,188
Breath, relax.

725
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,732
Breath, go on.

726
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,009
Take it easy!
Breathe in, breathe out.

727
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,152
One, two.

728
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,155
That's it, perfect.

729
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,743
Gentlemen,

730
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,102
I'm going to stand up,
all right?

731
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,204
Just because I have bad knees.

732
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,248
Don't freak out.

733
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,919
Here I go. Very good.

734
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,963
Perfect.

735
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,798
The three of us

736
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,367
- are going to work this out.
- How?

737
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,454
First things first,
you're going to put

738
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,225
a dollar in my pocket.

739
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,048
Do you want attorney-client
privilege?

740
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,966
So that everything you
say

741
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,528
is strictly between us.

742
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:55,808
I mean it!
Put a dollar in my pocket.

743
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,868
Come on, make it official.

744
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,150
All I have is
a five-dollar bill.

745
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,504
I'll take it, I'll take it.

746
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,674
That's it.

747
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,717
Very good.

748
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,245
You're now both officially
represented

749
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,706
by Saúl Bueno
and Associates.

750
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,474
You can put the gun down.

751
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,810
Your secrets are safe with me

752
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,479
under threat of disbarment.

753
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,464
And I don't want
to risk my license.

754
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,316
Do you get it?

755
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,318
Hey, take the ski mask off.

756
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,804
I feel like I'm talking
to a muppet.

757
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,639
- Take it off.
- Come on.

758
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,979
Good!
Let's talk business.

759
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,332
Mauricio...

760
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,209
A prison shanking is completely

761
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,838
off the table.

762
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,531
- Are we sure of that?
- No shaking!

763
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,176
Then the way I see it

764
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,096
is somebody's going to prison.

765
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,184
It's just a matter of who.

766
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,144
His name is John Fredy Angulo.

767
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,522
In 1980, he was busted stealing.

768
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,273
In 1989, he stole a car.

769
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,484
In 1990, he used a gun.

770
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:17,031
Well, 1981, 1991, 2001,

771
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,034
and this is Fredy now.

772
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,185
They call him
Frediliso.

773
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,396
He knows almost all
the prisons in this country.

774
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,441
Bellavista, La Picota,
La Modelo, all of them.

775
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:31,403
He's been in prison
41 of his 59 years.

776
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:32,922
All his life in jail.

777
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,007
For a price,

778
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:38,494
Fredy provides
a very special service.

779
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,621
He pretends to
be certain man

780
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,639
and goes to prison for you.

781
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:46,518
on purpose?

782
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,418
The guy goes to prison

783
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,295
He likes to be
inside.

784
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,897
The outside world

785
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,548
hasn't been too kind
to him.

786
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,150
We know people,

787
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,426
we know their
prejudices.

788
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,512
What a
horror!

789
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,515
Fredy really is a
philanthropist,

790
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,100
he provides a service
and charges for it.

791
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,078
When does all this happen?

792
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,537
It's already happening.

793
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,956
The buy is set for tomorrow.

794
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,916
Cops bust Fredy, Mono gets out,

795
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,085
everybody's happy.

796
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,211
All it's going to cost you

797
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,255
is 80.000 dollars

798
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,993
and one pound
of your finest meth.

799
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,578
$80.000 for eight years
of his life.

800
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:22,955
He's not going to do
eight years.

801
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,682
I'm going to represent him,

802
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,668
and I guarantee
there's going to be

803
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,046
some unexpected problems with
the prosecution's case.

804
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,647
Another thing:

805
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,883
80.000 dollars for him,
150.000 for me.

806
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,692
Why is that?

807
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,694
Why he receives only 80.000?

808
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,572
Who's taking a bigger risk?

809
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,449
He likes prison.

810
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,104
Look, if this option
is too expensive,

811
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,664
there is no problem.

812
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,124
We only have to warn Mauricio

813
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,169
about all the things

814
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:57,006
the inmates will do with him.

815
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,430
Conscience gets expensive,
that's my motto.

816
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,449
Tell me, boy,

817
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,726
have you seen this
man's commercials?

818
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,285
They are good, right?

819
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,705
As an actor, he's a good lawyer.

820
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,440
He cooked you up
a pretty killer deal.

821
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,834
Right, Gómez?

822
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,544
Right.

823
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,087
Time served, no probation.

824
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,006
If you talk.

825
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,075
I couldn't believe the judge
went for it.

826
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,718
He's like a magician.

827
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:45,162
Don't get cocky.
You aren't home free yet.

828
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,681
If you don't give us

829
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,001
the name of your supplier,
you're going nowhere.

830
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,311
Understood, bitch?

831
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,730
Agent, the tough guy act

832
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,148
is unnecessary.

833
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,150
This young man

834
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,402
is cooperating fully.

835
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:05,015
Are you cooperating?
Let's start with a name.

836
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,742
Mauricio Mejía.

837
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:09,953
Are you a clown?

838
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,581
The supplier's name!

839
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,041
Not a name.

840
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,585
He just goes by Heisenberg.

841
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,258
Heinsenberg.

842
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,592
How old is he?

843
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,094
Old.

844
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,637
Really old.

845
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,890
Like 50 or 70 or something.

846
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,349
Height?

847
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,809
Average, I guess.

848
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,271
Medium height, medium weight.

849
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,065
He's an average man.

850
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,441
What color hair?

851
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,068
No hair.

852
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,320
He's bald.

853
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,822
Balder than you, man.

854
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,784
And that's a lot to say.

855
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:55,457
Careful, there is the guy.

856
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,428
There are the agents, go back.

857
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,746
- Go back.
- Okay, okay, okay.

858
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:16,312
Do they see us here?

859
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,272
No, no, no, we're fine.

860
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,387
Mono looks
like he's going to throw up.

861
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,489
Let me see.

862
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,270
Where is that
Fredy?

863
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,414
He should be here.

864
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,650
Do you think
he's actually for real?

865
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,252
It's really weird.

866
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,379
A guy who wants to be in prison?

867
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,824
There's more
than one kind of
prison.

868
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,052
We are really fucked up.

869
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,580
Not only a chemist,
but also a philosopher.

870
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,188
There he is.

871
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,897
No!

872
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,399
That can't be true!

873
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,067
What? What's going on?

874
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,111
Let me see!

875
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,434
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know!

876
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,789
Heisenberg, I presume.

877
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,249
Time to move?

878
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,293
No, no, no, no.

879
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,795
Not till we see the exchange.

880
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:27,924
Son of a bitch!

881
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,385
What's up?

882
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,345
Now he shows.

883
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,205
- Is he there?
- Yes.

884
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,960
No, no, no, bro!
What are you doing?

885
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,145
What?

886
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,837
Fredy is sitting on
the wrong bench.

887
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,940
Shit!

888
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,550
- Where are we going?
- Get out.

889
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,886
- What are you saying?
- Tell Mono what's going on.

890
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,447
If they see me, we're screwed.

891
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,224
I'll do something
with Henry.
Go.

892
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:00,123
Go, go!

893
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,628
Henry! How are you, man?

894
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,197
- Navarro, Navarro.
- Hi, Gómez, how are you doing?

895
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,007
I thought that was you!

896
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,468
It had to be my brother-in-law.

897
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,495
- And it was you.
- Walter, Walter.

898
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,538
- What's up, Gómez?
- Go, go, brother.

899
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,958
- Get out of here, Walter.
- Are you feeling better?

900
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,459
- Good, good.
- Fine.

901
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,253
- Shit, I can't see him.
- Let's talk later.

902
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,397
Shit, I'm blocked.

903
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,065
Are you working on a case?

904
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,508
Yes, yes, go
away.

905
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,427
- You have to move.
- Is something wrong?

906
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,740
Wrong guy! Wrong guy!

907
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,700
Other bench. Other bench.

908
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,687
Come on, Walter,
move!

909
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,522
- Do I continue on this street?
- Drive, man!

910
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,374
Okay, relax.

911
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,959
I'll go and leave you alone.

912
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,710
I'm sorry if I interrupted you.

913
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,987
- Okay. Bye, Gómez.
- Go!

914
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,048
I lost him.

915
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,674
Shit, I lost him.

916
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,343
Where is he?

917
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,761
Where the hell is he?

918
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,138
There he is, there he is.

919
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,309
Looks like it's going down.

920
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:01,726
Is that the meth?

921
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,174
- Yes, there is the meth.
- Yes, yes, the meth.

922
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,900
They can move now.

923
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,360
Take them!

924
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,782
Police! Everybody down!

925
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,202
Hands on the ground!

926
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,819
- Shit!
- Could you do it?

927
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,629
Yes, they bought it.

928
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,990
- Drive.
- Let's go.

929
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,591
Perfect.

930
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,120
Yes, one pound of
blue crystal.

931
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,956
And do you know
who this Heisenberg was?

932
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,434
John Fredy Angulo.

933
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,811
Yes, sir.

934
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,771
It's my job, sir.

935
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,812
- Hi.

936
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,840
You weren't home,
so I them in.

937
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,217
I hope that's
okay.

938
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,737
Yes, thanks.

939
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,742
So you bought a mattress.

940
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,873
A king one.

941
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,335
A king one.

942
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,700
You really are
a chemistry teacher.

943
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,427
Nice!

944
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,304
I was terrible at chemistry.

945
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:43,763
Really bad.

946
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,375
I'm more of a humanities
guy.

947
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,185
How did you find me?

948
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,605
We should talk about that.

949
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,839
It should be much harder
for people

950
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,108
to track you down.

951
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,344
My detective charged me
for three hours,

952
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,903
so I seriously doubt

953
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,140
it took him more than one
because he overcharges me.

954
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,575
What does this mean?

955
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,034
Are you blackmailing me?

956
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,454
God, I'm your lawyer.

957
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:11,525
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

958
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,276
I'm not in the shake-down
racket. I'm a lawyer.

959
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:17,239
Lawyers are necessary
to protect the democracy.

960
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,783
Everybody needs us,
even drug dealers need us.

961
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,302
Right?

962
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,637
Especially drug dealers.

963
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,096
So what?

964
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,349
Are you just doing this

965
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:29,167
out of the kindness
of your heart?

966
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,269
Of course not.

967
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,088
You already know
my rates.

968
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,648
By the way,

969
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,174
where do you keep
the money?

970
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,551
Is it in your
mattress?

971
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,444
Is it in a jelly jar?

972
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,887
I'll tell you
something.

973
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,390
Mauricio may be the first of
your guys to get picked up,

974
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,559
but he won't be
the last.

975
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,452
And if I can find you,

976
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,396
how far behind can
the cops be?

977
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,707
I don't understand.

978
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,400
What exactly are you offering
to do for me?

979
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,321
Have you seen
"The Godfather"?

980
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,089
Vito Corleone?

981
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:03,993
Vito Corleone had
an adviser.

982
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,762
I'm no Vito Corleone.

983
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,373
Of course not, you're still
far from that.

984
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,642
Right now, you're Fredo.

985
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,211
But with some sound
advice

986
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,546
and the proper introductions,
who knows?

987
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,566
You could be one of them.

988
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:20,260
You've
got the right product.

989
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,011
Anything that gets the
anti-narcotics panties

990
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,572
in this big a bunch,

991
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:27,033
you're on to something special.

992
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,660
And I...

993
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:35,358
I would like to be a small
and silent part of it.

994
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,502
Food for thought, yeah?

995
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,337
Relax.

996
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,840
Think about it.

997
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,926
One more thing:

998
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,621
If you want to make more
money

999
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,249
and keep the money
that you make

1000
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,043
"Better call
Saul!"

1001
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,818
Think about it!
