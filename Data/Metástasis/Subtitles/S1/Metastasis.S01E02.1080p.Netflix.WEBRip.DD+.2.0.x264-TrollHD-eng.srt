1
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:43,604
You saved our lives. I
can't thank you enough.

2
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:47,817
I don't understand
what happened to us,

3
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,071
we were driving and
taking a look at the map.

4
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,157
My phone started ringing.

5
00:01:55,199 --> 00:02:01,497
I didn't pay attention to the road and,
all of a sudden, we were in the ditch.

6
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,876
And then you found us here.

7
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,712
Your pants.

8
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,478
The thing is that I was
drinking coffee. With

9
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,399
the maneuver,
the coffee ended all over my pants.

10
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,467
And...

11
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,080
Like I said,
I can't thank you enough.

12
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,332
Exactly. Thank you very much,
bro.

13
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,886
And now what? Can't
we just dump them here?

14
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,461
Yes, of course. We just
dump them here so the man

15
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,017
with the tractor,
who already saw us, finds them!

16
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,852
Let's go!

17
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,609
Come on.

18
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,988
- Come on!
- Don't do that. You're going to flood it.

19
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,659
I'm not going to flood it!
Can't you stay positive?

20
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,996
Come on,
come on. Start this time.

21
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,499
- Come on!
- See? You flooded it. I told you.

22
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,836
I didn't flood it!
It's going to start!

23
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,671
And when it does,
we're going to your house.

24
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,967
No! Not my house! I can't take
that risk! What are you thinking?

25
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,928
Ok, shut up! Listen to me, José.

26
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,974
After we finish doing this,
we won't see each other never again.

27
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:47,019
And we will never ever talk
about this again. Understood?

28
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,772
Understood?

29
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,356
What? I can talk now?

30
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,111
I thought I had to raise my
hand to talk. Yes, I understood.

31
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:58,322
This is it. Come on.

32
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,829
- Come on!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

33
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,166
Come on,
let's go! Thanks for saving me, nan.

34
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,252
- So? Let's go!
- Easy, we have to warm it up.

35
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,424
Shit!

36
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,222
- Do I tie them up or what?
- Yes, of course! Hurry!

37
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,850
Ok, bro, but let's go! Drive!

38
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,943
<i>Walter?</i>

39
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,738
<i>Walter?</i>

40
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,739
Yes.

41
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,199
<i>Are you coming out?</i>

42
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,449
I'm coming.

43
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,880
I have to tell you something really
funny that happened at school.

44
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,094
We had a teachers'
meeting last Thursday

45
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,509
because we had to
talk about certain things.

46
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:47,598
But, this time, we talked about
the photos for the school yearbook.

47
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,227
Last year,
we decided to allow senior students

48
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,730
to have the photo taken by any photographer
they wanted, they could hire anybody

49
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:58,276
so they are not forced to
hire the school photographer

50
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,278
who has been working
during 20 years...

51
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,825
So, all of the senior girls

52
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,996
went to a huge and elegant
place to have their photos taken

53
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,078
and they were all dressed
up and with a hairstyle...

54
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,503
So, Sandra,
the principal... You know Sandra, right?

55
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,300
Right,
she had to check all those photos

56
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,803
and she ended turning
down almost all of them.

57
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,013
Guess why.

58
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,351
Because of the cleavage.

59
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,649
- Do you want more bread?
- No, thanks, mom.

60
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,319
The thing is that even
the small-busted girls,

61
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,946
and we know them,

62
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,865
had a big cleavage showing.

63
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,870
Apparently,
there is some new brassiere for that,

64
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,456
but I don't know how it works.
Haven't you heard about it?

65
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,960
It's the Wonderbra.

66
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,838
- Really?
- Yes.

67
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,007
It's a new bra with
some push up action.

68
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,134
<i>We are calling you</i>

69
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:08,387
<i>because we want to know if you are
interested in our long distance rates.</i>

70
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,555
I get it.

71
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,975
<i>We would like you to answer
this call as soon as possible.</i>

72
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,812
- Yes, this is Walter Blanco.
<i>- Bro--</i>

73
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,982
You told me not to worry
because he was almost dead.

74
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,693
You know what?
He is as alive as you.

75
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,696
Sir,
I'm having breakfast with my family

76
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,992
<i>and I can't talk right now because
I'm spending sacred time with them.</i>

77
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:34,205
So please erase my
name from your database

78
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,665
because I'm not interested
in the service. Thank you.

79
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,751
Don't get nervous,
teacher! Don't get nervous, bro!

80
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,920
I can hear that man
groaning from here.

81
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,506
When will your Highness come?

82
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,218
<i>I need you here to
solve this problem!</i>

83
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,387
Calm down! I'll be
there after school.

84
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,929
<i>After school?</i>

85
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,682
You are insane! That's
too late. Come here now!

86
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:58,062
<i>Call in sick, say you had an accident,
but come here now!</i>

87
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:02,274
Mr., again,
I'm not interested in that service, thanks.

88
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,694
And please, don't call again.

89
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,364
But--

90
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,497
You can't believe these people.

91
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,168
They don't give up.

92
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,426
- Bye, love.
- Bye.

93
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,200
<i>What's up? This is my house.</i>

94
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:58,622
<i>This is Jose's place.
Leave it at the tone.</i>

95
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,323
Chiral.

96
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,575
The term derives from
the Greek word "hand".

97
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,287
And it means that your left hand

98
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,705
and your right hand
mirror each other.

99
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,460
One in front of the other.

100
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:48,213
Identical, but opposite.

101
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,925
Same thing happens with
two organic compounds

102
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:56,430
that are identical,
but opposite at the molecular level.

103
00:09:56,472 --> 00:10:01,143
Although they are identical,
they don't always behave the same.

104
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

105
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,993
Some good example
is Thalidomide.

106
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,667
The right-handed isomer of
this drug is a good medicine

107
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,295
for pregnant women to
avoid morning sickness.

108
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,215
But if you give a pregnant woman
the left-handed isomer of the drug,

109
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,552
the baby could be born
with physical defects.

110
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,555
This is what
happened in the 1950's.

111
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,724
There exists some
investigation you could watch...

112
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,064
Well, so, let's say it again. Chiral,
mirroring.

113
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,817
Active, inactive, good, bad.

114
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,986
Sir,
is this going to be on the murder?

115
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,114
What?

116
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,991
Is this going to be on
the mid-term exam?

117
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,828
Chirality? No. I don't know.

118
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,665
You have to study it
anyway. And remember:

119
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,544
Knowledge is power.

120
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,795
Have a good day.

121
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,914
No, shit.

122
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,815
No, no, no.

123
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,276
Shit.

124
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,622
No, no, no!

125
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,472
What is he doing here? Shit!

126
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,605
Hey, hey!

127
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,273
What are you doing?

128
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,238
Is he ok? Do you need some help?

129
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,701
He's my nephew,
he has some drug problems.

130
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:49,037
I need to take
him to the hospital.

131
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,845
What do we do?

132
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,234
The one in the RV is...?

133
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,820
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

134
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,196
Totally?

135
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,032
Yes,
bro! You can go and see it for yourself.

136
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,909
That's not a bad idea.

137
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,263
We should go see him to make sure
he doesn't rise and walk like Lazarus

138
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,664
on the neighborhood.

139
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,628
So what,
bro? This is all my fault?

140
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,880
You know what,
teacher? I've been through a lot.

141
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,300
So take it easy because
I'm getting sick of it.

142
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,468
All this shit is your fault.

143
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,720
Ok, stop it!

144
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,600
We need to move forward.

145
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,937
Tell me something
about this guy. Anything.

146
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,939
I don't know.

147
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,500
What do you mean?
Don't you know his name?

148
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,067
"Loco". They call him "Loco".

149
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,694
What kind of name is that?

150
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,822
They call him Loco! What
do you want me to do?

151
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,284
How long have you
been working with him?

152
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,747
- I worked with his cousin.
- Who is his cousin?

153
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,415
Was.

154
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,001
Emilio, the guy out in the RV.

155
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,921
Emilio worked with Loco.

156
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,675
Loco was one level higher.

157
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,927
He was the one that sold the
product to the big ones, you get it?

158
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,890
He was like... Like...

159
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,160
He was like those people that sell
the products to the supermarkets.

160
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,769
- A distributor?
- Right.

161
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,480
Loco is a distributor?

162
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,358
Is he dangerous?

163
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,486
Dangerous.

164
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,280
Well, let's see...

165
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,241
He tried to kill us yesterday,
so yes, he's dangerous.

166
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,245
I'm trying to say that
he is a businessman

167
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,457
and maybe he could act
out of mutual self-interest.

168
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,750
What?

169
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,629
Maybe he can listen to reason.

170
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,467
Maybe he does,
teacher. Go and ask him.

171
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,178
"Dear Loco, if we let you go,

172
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,724
do you promise not to come
back and cut us to pieces?"

173
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,768
I don't think he listens
that kind of reason.

174
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,396
I mean, he's Loco.

175
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,819
What was that?

176
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,043
The guy is awake, bro.

177
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,099
Marijuana?

178
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,317
"What I would do".

179
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,154
"I would do the Kardashians".

180
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,865
"Kardashians".

181
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,287
"I left school and
joined Los Monar--"

182
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,497
Los Monarcas?

183
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,975
No, be careful. Listen.

184
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:42,687
If I were him,
I would lie there faking being almost dead.

185
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,690
And I would wait for the
right moment to attack.

186
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,819
- You get it?
- So what do we do?

187
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,576
What are you doing? Jose,
where are you going? Jose!

188
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,744
- So what?
- Enough.

189
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,455
Can you stop making
the same question?

190
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,875
- You have to do something.
- We.

191
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,502
We have to do something,
and I'm opened to suggestions.

192
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,214
- No, bro, this is your fault.
- Don't blame me!

193
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,174
You brought those guys here!

194
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,843
Yes, of course.

195
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,387
And I came to you
begging to cook meth.

196
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,305
"Come on, teacher, please".

197
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,726
I want you to listen me carefully
and understand it once and for all.

198
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,021
I prefer to cook with my granny in a
wheelchair before cooking with you.

199
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,696
Teacher.

200
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,990
- And the phosphate gas?
- Phosphine gas.

201
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,326
- Same shit.
- They are not the same.

202
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,786
What about that?

203
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,749
I don't know. Can't
that gas still kill him?

204
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,586
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

205
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,380
You're supposed to be the scientist,
bro!

206
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,133
Look,
that isn't the worst problem now.

207
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,345
In case you don't remember,
we have a body in the RV.

208
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,100
And that's like leaving
chicken under the sun.

209
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,020
We have to do something! And fast,
before somebody finds it!

210
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,110
I've been thinking.

211
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,613
I think our best option is
chemical disincorporation.

212
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:02,326
- What?
- We have to dissolve it in strong acid.

213
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,500
You are joking, right?

214
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,883
And who's going to do that?

215
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,930
- We'll do it together.
- No, bro.

216
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,474
I'm not good with dead bodies.

217
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,769
When I was a little kid,
I had a dog named Valentino.

218
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,895
And somebody killed it.

219
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,332
I was so traumatized that I
still dream about Valentino.

220
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,817
Enough!

221
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,444
We are in this fifty-fifty,
right?

222
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,238
I think it is fair
to do it together.

223
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,869
One of us deals with the body and the other
one deals with the guy in the basement.

224
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,123
And who decides the tasks? You do,
I guess.

225
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,796
We can flip a coin.

226
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,717
Do you have one?

227
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,138
No.

228
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,268
Rock-paper-scissors.

229
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,105
Right, I'll do the acid thing.

230
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,858
No! Rock-paper-scissors.

231
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,993
One, two, three,
rock, paper, scissors.

232
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,789
- I won! I'll do the acid thing.
- No. Two out of three.

233
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,582
Yeah, right.

234
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,226
<i>What's up? This is my house.</i>

235
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:55,857
<i>This is Jose's place.
Leave it at the tone.</i>

236
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,775
<i>Teacher, pick up the phone.</i>

237
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,529
<i>It's me. I have a question
about the container, bro.</i>

238
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,414
- What's up?
- What kind of plastic, bro?

239
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,874
<i>Polyethylene.</i>

240
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,293
And how the hell am I
supposed to know that?

241
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,515
Jose,
I told you. The container must have a

242
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,923
stamp at the bottom
that reads "L - D - P - E".

243
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,967
L - D - P - E.

244
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,641
No, not this one.

245
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,481
Right, got it.

246
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,901
But this doesn't seem to be very resistant,
man.

247
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,694
<i>Any acid is going to
eat right through this.</i>

248
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,115
- Not hydrofluoric acid.
<i>- Why not?</i>

249
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,539
<i>You didn't pay attention
to any of my classes, right?</i>

250
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,085
You know what? Thanks for the conversation,
it was pretty instructive.

251
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,087
And friendly.

252
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,547
Listen.

253
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,217
Let's talk about
the important issue.

254
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,510
<i>Have you already done your part?</i>

255
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm getting prepared for it.

256
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,063
Bro, think about this: if we
take him to the hospital right now,

257
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,649
<i>I bet they won't be
able to save him.</i>

258
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,052
<i>I don't even think
that they take him in</i>

259
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:22,824
<i>because he doesn't</font>
have any health insurance.</i>

260
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,530
So, basically...

261
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,659
You are doing him a favor,
right?

262
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,844
Who's there?

263
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,308
What are you doing with me?

264
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,942
Hey! Give me some
water! I'm thirsty.

265
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,043
You don't like the crust?

266
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,841
Where is Emilio?

267
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,720
Is he dead?

268
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,599
Answer me! Yes or no?

269
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,866
I'm a coward.

270
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,012
Where are you, Walter?

271
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,437
Very good, are you smoking weed?

272
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,480
Perfect, bro!

273
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,196
Walter, are you smoking my weed?

274
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,699
Yeah,
that's ok. Make yourself at home.

275
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,702
Take it easy, man.

276
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:27,248
- What did you buy?
- Nothing.

277
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,668
There wasn't any
container big enough.

278
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,211
Not big enough for a body.

279
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,798
You could have bought two.

280
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,268
Legs in one, torso in the other.

281
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:51,522
Do you think that's
funny? Do you?

282
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,983
Your head is messed up, bro.

283
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,365
So what? Have
you done it already?

284
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,034
You didn't do it?

285
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,413
Not yet.

286
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,333
What are you talking about?

287
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,126
I have to leave now.

288
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,752
Where are you going?

289
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,422
Listen, listen, listen.

290
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:20,677
I promise I'll do it
tomorrow. Ok? But now--

291
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,471
I have a doctor's appointment.

292
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,515
- A doctor's appointment?
- Yes.

293
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,016
- We have a deal.
- José...

294
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,644
Don't go to the basement.
The guy is awake.

295
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,396
- He's awake? But--
- He's awake.

296
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,273
What did we play
rock-paper-scissors for?

297
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,193
Walter,
rock-paper-scissors! That's sacred, man!

298
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,487
Shit!

299
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,544
Everything's fine?

300
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,754
Everything's really fine.

301
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,926
Look at its face. Hi, baby!

302
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,845
Smile!

303
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,223
Do you want to know?

304
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,228
- Yes.
- Yes.

305
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,104
It's a girl.

306
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,699
You remember this when she
is 15 and starts going to parties.

307
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:29,828
Let me check the blood sugar,
I'll be right back.

308
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,332
But don't worry,
everything's really fine.

309
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,251
Thank you.

310
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,972
Walter, who's José Miguel Rosas?

311
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,563
- Who?
- Don't play with me.

312
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,898
The guy that
called this morning.

313
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,777
He has a blog about music and it
says he studied at Los Monarcas.

314
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,236
Was he a student of yours?

315
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,242
Yes. He's nobody.

316
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,787
So, why is he looking for you?

317
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,706
Why does he call you?

318
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,667
Walter...

319
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,795
You came home at
two in the morning

320
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,546
and you didn't tell me
where you have been.

321
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,590
You spent the rest of
the night in the bathroom.

322
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:26,427
Can you please tell
me what's going on?

323
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:29,847
What do you have to
do with some junkie?

324
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,476
Nothing. He's a dealer.

325
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,019
What kind of dealer?

326
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,777
Marijuana. He
sells me marijuana.

327
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:43,778
What?

328
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,905
Not a lot, sometimes.

329
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,328
Walter, do you think you're 14?

330
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,833
For God's sake, your brother-in-law
is an anti-narcotics agent.

331
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,795
I want you to do me a favor.

332
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,172
This is a very special favor.

333
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:08,010
Could you stop breathing
down my neck all the time?

334
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:14,350
Please, darling. Seriously,
at least for this time. Just once.

335
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,436
Could you leave me alone?

336
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:24,151
Could you just give me a break?

337
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,863
Darling...

338
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,282
I would really appreciate it.

339
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,967
Just meat.

340
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,930
Just meat, José Miguel,
that's just meat.

341
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,516
Just meat, just meat, just meat.

342
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,643
Just meat.

343
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,856
Just meat, just meat.

344
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,116
Yes, this is the place.

345
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,745
- Can you wait for me?
- Yes.

346
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:42,539
[coughing and
groaning from fatigue]

347
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,918
Hello. José Miguel?

348
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,924
I'm talking to you.

349
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,926
This is private property!
What are you doing here?

350
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,345
- Relax, I want to say--
- No, no, I'm not interested.

351
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,638
Don't you touch me!

352
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,515
Please,
get out of here. Not touching.

353
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,018
Whatever you are selling,
I'm not interested.

354
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,978
Please, leave.

355
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,981
No. I'm here because the secretary
in Los Monarcas is a friend of mine.

356
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,275
She gave me your address.

357
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,735
Who are you?

358
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,738
I'm Cielo Blanco,
Walter Blanco's wife.

359
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,366
And he told me everything.

360
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,661
- Really?
- Yes.

361
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,707
I want you to know that my
brother-in-law is an anti-narcotics agent.

362
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:28,711
And I won't
hesitate to call him.

363
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:33,966
This is the one and only warning
I will give you. Understood?

364
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:38,178
Stop selling marijuana
to my husband.

365
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:41,891
Ok, right.

366
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,937
Ok, do me a favor and get
out of my property. Please.

367
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,191
- I will.
- Ok, everything's fine.

368
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,152
And I'm giving you some advice.

369
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:58,032
Be a musician,
because drugs won't take you anywhere.

370
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,201
Ok, thanks. Leave.

371
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,066
No, no, no. Please.

372
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,402
Shit!

373
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,004
Yeah! Why don't we do...

374
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,091
this shit at home

375
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,761
so I can sleep like
a baby at night?

376
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,813
Moreover, teacher,

377
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:16,318
why don't you send
your psycho wife in

378
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,741
so she can threaten
me in my own house?

379
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,578
That would be really cool.

380
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,415
That would be really amusing,
bro.

381
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:48,308
And why don't we talk about the
psycho you have in my basement?

382
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,186
Yes!

383
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,438
Let him live there, bro.

384
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,361
And don't forget to feed
him three times a day.

385
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,039
Teacher, you know what?

386
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,375
I want to thank you for
this amazing opportunity.

387
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:17,171
This is really amazing.
The truth is that...

388
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,297
I...

389
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,843
I have always wanted
to melt somebody in acid.

390
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,261
I have always wanted--

391
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,336
José.

392
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,422
José.

393
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,184
So you have a brother who
is an anti-narcotics agent?

394
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,394
- What?
- You heard me.

395
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,730
Brother-in-law.

396
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,190
Well, that's better.

397
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:21,026
- How do you know that?
- Your wife told me.

398
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,861
- My wife?
- Yes, your wife.

399
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:27,950
She was here, out there. She
almost caught me moving Emilio, bro.

400
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,493
I see you are the one wearing
the pants in the relationship.

401
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,123
And why the hell did you tell
her that I'm selling you weed?

402
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:37,876
I don't know. Maybe
because that's better

403
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,003
than telling her that
I'm cooking crystal meth

404
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,463
and I killed some guy.

405
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,924
And you have another one pending,
don't forget about that.

406
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,011
Keep smoking that shit.

407
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,680
Yes,
I smoked a bowl. What is the problem?

408
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,725
You can come here
and smoke my weed,

409
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,228
but I can't smoke
a bowl of meth?

410
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,147
No,
man. This is my house and I set the rules.

411
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,940
I do whatever I want to do.

412
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,235
And change that expression,
don't look me like that.

413
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,737
When are you
going to do your part?

414
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,447
I have the worst job to do!

415
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,992
The worst job? Do you want
to know about the worst job?

416
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:15,122
Try dragging 150 pounds
of rotten meat up the stairs.

417
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,458
I barely got him in
the bathtub. Barely!

418
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:20,585
Bathtub?

419
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,462
Yes,
the bathtub. And that's another thing.

420
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:25,108
Why do you make me go to every
store in town to buy a plastic container

421
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,175
when here I have a bathtub

422
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,551
that is perfect
for what we need?

423
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,512
You idiot!

424
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,764
What are you doing?

425
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,239
What were you asking me?

426
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,826
Yes, you asked me why I sent you
to buy that plastic container. Right?

427
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:40,498
Well, the hydrofluoric acid
doesn't eat through plastic.

428
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,792
However,
it will dissolve any other element.

429
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,047
Metal, glass, wood,

430
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,924
ceramic...

431
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,719
That's why I asked
you to buy polyethylene.

432
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,942
I run faster than you!

433
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,494
What is that?

434
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,296
Mom, look what I found!

435
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,176
- What is it?
- I think it's a mask.
