1
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,601
Thirty-seven. Number 37.

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,401
Hi.

3
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,652
Hi.

4
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,446
Here's my resume.

5
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,087
Or curriculum, as you call it,
right? It sounds more professional.

6
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,200
Aha.

7
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,412
It doesn't say it there, but I have a
great background in sales as well.

8
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:38,915
What kind of sales?

9
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:42,126
A great range of products. Yes,
anything, really.

10
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,713
I think in these cases the person
is more important than the product.

11
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:50,509
I really feel I could be a
major asset to your sales force.

12
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:54,472
I'm thinking there's a
little misunderstanding.

13
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,600
This isn't actually a sales job.

14
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:58,726
Then what is it?

15
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,396
This is more like advertising.

16
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:05,858
OK.

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,903
Tell me, Mr. Néstor.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
- Mono? Old José!

19
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,617
Yo, man! What up?

20
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,243
Do you know each other?

21
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,162
- Of course!
- Perfect!

22
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,415
Then you can teach him what he
needs to know about work in the street.

23
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,708
Sure thing! How about that?

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,587
Gimme five.

25
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,632
Come, Mono, give me a break.

26
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,845
Why don't you take off that
helmet? Makes me wanna go pee.

27
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,647
Nice pot, isn't it?

28
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,193
Come on, Monito,
don't get too excited.

29
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,154
This job you've
got is like the worst?

30
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,532
No, my friend,
not with this costume.

31
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,159
The taco costume is worse,
you don't know.

32
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,746
It's much bigger,
much heavier and all.

33
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,999
I get roasted in it, man.

34
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,417
Would you want to do
this lame ass job anyway?

35
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,588
Gotta prove to my
mom I'm rehabilitated.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,149
I told her I wouldn't
do drugs anymore,

37
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,801
weird trades and all that,
you know?

38
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,511
So then what about this?

39
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,395
No, old José,
this is barely a little snack.

40
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,190
To be powerful and feel good
so I can move around and all.

41
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,734
Well, if you say so.

42
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,486
Listen, José, speaking of drugs.

43
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,407
You think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

44
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,326
No, I've been out of the
business for a while, I retired.

45
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,955
That's just a loss for humanity,
José.

46
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,332
That stuff you made...

47
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,085
Unbelievable!

48
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,129
The eight wonder, for real.

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,213
That stuff was hot, right?

50
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,382
Wow!

51
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,760
I had this partner who
was helping me cook.

52
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,596
Complicated dude.

53
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,183
Anyway, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by.

54
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,185
That was getting really tough.

55
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,272
Not so much,
José. Is pseudo the problem?

56
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,069
I can hook you up with some
pseudo. Major pseudo. How about it?

57
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,114
We could partner
up. What do you say?

58
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,949
- Hey!
- No, I don't know, man.

59
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,285
Man, it's getting late for
me. But you know what?

60
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,871
Why don't you get to thinking?

61
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,831
Just think about it, all right?

62
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:30,252
Imagine, partners,
you and me. Gimme five, gimme five, OK?

63
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,088
- Think about it, OK?
- I will, man.

64
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:44,976
Hey, Mono!

65
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,673
Are you sure they said
not to bring a present?

66
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,966
That's what they said.

67
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,650
Wouldn't' it look bad
to bring this thing?

68
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,222
No, honey. They'll love it.

69
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,283
There's still time to go back.

70
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,267
No! Stop it.

71
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,228
You and I deserve a nice time

72
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,232
after all we've been through.

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,484
And despite everything,
I like them.

74
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,212
You've got to take care of friends,
don't you think?

75
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,113
- Friends... Come on.

76
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,632
- Where should I park?
- I don't know.

77
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,950
Everything will be fine,
alright? Over there.

78
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,419
Darn it.

79
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,296
Come on! Nobody will notice.

80
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:00,425
Nobody? I look like
a humble teenager,

81
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,637
badly dressed at a social party.

82
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,306
- There are worse things.

83
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,143
And they said
not to bring a gift.

84
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,271
Should I take your present?

85
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,900
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

86
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,694
This is even worse
than I imagined.

87
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,488
Don't look, here comes Edgar.

88
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,283
Edgar, happy birthday!

89
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,206
- Thanks so much.
- Hi!

90
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,498
Happy birthday!

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,253
Hi! Thanks so much for coming.

92
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,838
- Did Marcela see you? No.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,881
Marcela!

94
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,384
- Hi!
- Hi!

95
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,971
- You look gorgeous! How much longer?
- Thanks!

96
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,058
- Ten more weeks.
- Walter. - How are you?

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,894
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

98
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,149
Edgar, well,
this is history by now,

99
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,902
but it's been a while since
we last saw each other,

100
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,529
and I wanted to congratulate
you for the Calnatur victory.

101
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,618
Appreciate it, Walter. But you
know that without your research,

102
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,536
this would never
have been possible

103
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,040
Come on,
now. Securing that patent was just amazing.

104
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,875
You were brilliant in that one.

105
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,086
I saw in the news not long ago

106
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,504
that it was called the best-selling
product in Latin America

107
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,923
for hepatic diseases.

108
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,591
- Right.
- That's awesome.

109
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:27,012
Can you excuse us?
Lucas just came in. Sorry.

110
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,140
I'll go greet the
rest of the guests.

111
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,309
I'm so happy to
have you my house.

112
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,476
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,108
I think I need a
stronger drink than this.

114
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,667
¡Walter!

115
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,562
- Such a pleasure, man!
- Hey, Alberto, how are you?

116
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,963
- How's it going?
- OK, and you?

117
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,090
Good,
good. Let me introduce you to some friends.

118
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,636
- Walk with me, come!
- Fine, alright.

119
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,805
Gentlemen,
excuse me for a second.

120
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,765
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- This is Walter Blanco.

121
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,059
- How are you?
- How do you do?

122
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,870
- The master of mineralogy.
- No, not so much.

123
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,563
Come on. Look,
when he worked with Edgar,

124
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,441
this man was the mastermind.

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,443
I remember this one time

126
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,778
we were stuck on
this protein problem

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,281
- Yes.
- Remember? For weeks.

128
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:13,493
We worked,
but nothing. This man comes in,

129
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,914
and bam, solves the whole thing.

130
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,833
What was that you used?

131
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,544
Synchrotrons.

132
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,756
They generate purer and
more complete patterns

133
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,675
Data collection takes
a fraction of the time.

134
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,053
- So are you still with Edgar?
- No.

135
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:34,932
No,
it's been a while... I kind of moved on.

136
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,226
So what do you do now?

137
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,518
I teach.

138
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,979
Are you managing
a college department

139
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,107
or something like that?

140
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,902
I'm... Yes,
I'm a teach in a school. Chemistry.

141
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,155
Well, cheers.

142
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,656
Cheers.

143
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,041
It's awesome, thanks.

144
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,461
Edgar,
it's a very special guitar.

145
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,255
Cerati used that one in
his last show in Colombia.

146
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,672
Really?

147
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,759
Wow! Nice historical
piece. Thank you!

148
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,137
Why's he doing this? He
looks like an eight-year-old

149
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,846
opening presents from Santa.

150
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,393
This one's from
Walter and Cielo.

151
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,409
A pack of pasta soup.

152
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,415
Let me tell you a story.

153
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,506
For ten months, this man and I

154
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,216
lived on this while
working on our thesis.

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,885
At breakfast,

156
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,306
at lunch and at dinner.

157
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,108
Thank you for reminding
me where I come from, Walter.

158
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,864
I really didn't know what
to give a man who has it all.

159
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,827
You touched my heart,
brother. Thanks again.

160
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,086
Life has its injustices, man.

161
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,005
Because you can be
whatever you want,

162
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,551
but you'll always be
remembered for your nickname.

163
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,386
Poor guy...

164
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,095
He was a genius in Chemistry,

165
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,515
but nobody ever
called him by his name.

166
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,433
So what did they call him?

167
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,603
- Turkey!
- Right!

168
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,022
Because of the double chin.

169
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,108
But he was great. I
learned a lot from him.

170
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,028
- You know what happened to him?
- Don't tell me he died.

171
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,781
No, no,
no. He was extradited to the US.

172
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,286
He was working in a
crack lab for a mob guy.

173
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,290
DEA caught him, and bam!

174
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,293
Extradited to the North,
brother.

175
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,504
That's impossible.

176
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,340
Anyway,
everything has an upside.

177
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:17,344
The news didn't mention him as
"Turkey" but rather as "The Chemist".

178
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,724
Well,
at least he got his dignity back.

179
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,935
It's amazing how in this country

180
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,647
chemistry can take you
down the narcotic road?

181
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,609
So how would that road be?

182
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,070
No, I mean the 80's,
the 90's... Don't you remember?

183
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,656
When the mob was like
crazy searching everywhere

184
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,950
for chemists to
make crack for them.

185
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,660
Right, right.

186
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,662
You could easily
send your resume

187
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,456
either to Pablo
Escobar or a drug store.

188
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,249
Right, right.

189
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,295
Well, turns out two of our partners
ended up doing the same thing.

190
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,921
They didn't end
up bad like Turkey.

191
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,424
Really? Who?

192
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,134
Vivanco and Montoya.

193
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,220
- The gay couple?
- Right! Now they have these bars,

194
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,599
and are solid businessmen
in the gay rumba.

195
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,893
That's just amazing.
I pay my respects.

196
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,980
Did you ever get the
offer to work for the mob?

197
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,609
No.

198
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:14,652
I did.

199
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,986
Are you serious?

200
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,822
Yes yes. But of
course I said no.

201
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,993
Though I won't deny
that I thought about it.

202
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,328
Really?

203
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,080
Yes,
I had plenty of debts at the time,

204
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,873
and these people
paid tons of cash.

205
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,417
There wasn't really much to do.

206
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,629
Just set up a lab, teach people

207
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,511
and stop by once in a
while to check on things.

208
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,090
Right.

209
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,844
I excused myself thinking
I was only doing chemistry.

210
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,388
But I really couldn't do it.

211
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,643
I understand. It's not...

212
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,270
It must be hard to
control your conscience.

213
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,438
And your fear.

214
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,233
Because if I think about it,

215
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,110
if I'd have said yes to them,

216
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,279
it would've
changed my life a lot.

217
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,534
For sure,
it would've changed dramatically.

218
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,624
We should get
together more often.

219
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,168
Sure! Of course,
let's make plans.

220
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,003
We can go to my place,
have dinner.

221
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,173
But I'm not only talking
about being social.

222
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:22,219
I mean you and I should
work together again.

223
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,429
There will always be a
place for you in this business.

224
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,351
Are you asking me to
come work for you two?

225
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,977
That's right, Walter.

226
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,897
You're brilliant,
you've got a ton of experience.

227
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,983
Thanks.

228
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,279
I wouldn't really
know where to begin.

229
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,532
I mean, I've got classes...

230
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,093
I don't think that
would be a problem

231
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,911
for a man as talented as you.

232
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,083
No, no, it's just...

233
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:01,091
I mean,
right now I'm going through this situation

234
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,842
that's rather complicated.

235
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,389
I know, don't worry.

236
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:10,141
This company has an
excellent health insurance.

237
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,734
Did you try the prawns?
They were amazing!

238
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,778
You know I'm not that
much of a seafood fan,

239
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,780
but they were great.

240
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,951
Is something wrong?

241
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,245
You told Edgar about my cancer.

242
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,622
I can't believe this!

243
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,707
No, wait, it's not like that.

244
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,084
He asked how you were doing,

245
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,087
and I am sorry,
but I don't have the best poker face

246
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,607
- where that's concerned.
- Yes, right.

247
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,049
So what did you
expect me to tell him??

248
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,552
How about you
just said "he's fine,"

249
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,387
Might as well hand
him my medical history.

250
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,808
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

251
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,935
I don't like the way you talk to
people about my private affairs.

252
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,896
What exactly did he
say to get you so mad?

253
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,608
He offered me a job.
Kind of like some fig leaf.

254
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,170
And that he would
pay for my treatment.

255
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,029
So what did you say?

256
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,407
What would you want me to say?

257
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,908
No, obviously!

258
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,358
Give me five minutes to finish up,
and we'll go.

259
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,402
No problem,
a friend is taking me.

260
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,567
José!

261
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,864
José, man!

262
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:29,907
Come on, Mono.

263
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,662
Are those bullet holes, José?

264
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,707
No, no bullet holes, man!

265
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,085
Those are for, like,
you know, ventilation.

266
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,507
So how do you like it? Wow!

267
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,801
Nice set-up? I know.

268
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,344
Yes!

269
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,723
Hey, just look at this bottle!

270
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,976
Bottle, Mono? That's not a bottle,
don't be dumb!

271
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,561
That's a boiling flask.

272
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,688
And this is nothing. We
used to have double that.

273
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,526
We had this full of glass
until my idiot partner,

274
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,487
my ex partner,
messed all this up

275
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,030
and it got broken. But come,
over here

276
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,367
there's a beaker, a volumetric beaker,
Erlenmeyer. And this?

277
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,203
This is awesome!
We had one of these

278
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,331
but it was a
five-thousand-milliliters! Gigantic!

279
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,417
This glass is better
than any other,

280
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,419
it's used to boil.

281
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,630
That's cool, man.

282
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,424
You really know your shit.

283
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:33,511
- We could do great.
- Monito, I'm surprised.

284
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,347
You have to be a professional.

285
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,308
You have to know the business.

286
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,352
Speaking of stuff, Mono...

287
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:48,192
Did you bring the pseudo? I sure did,
bro.

288
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,194
This is where we'll
get the pseudo.

289
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,285
Leave that porn, Mono,
None of that shit.

290
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,958
Good old flu pills, man.

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,459
Great, Monito!

292
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,545
I thought this had
all been taken.

293
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,258
No. Have you not seen when in
ads they say "while supplies last"?

294
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,972
There's still supplies!
It's not sold out yet!

295
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,641
That's a boy, Mono,
that's how I like it, real partying.

296
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,777
Mono, man!

297
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,176
Ha!

298
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,278
What a woman!

299
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,244
Let's sit there.

300
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,328
Here?

301
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,541
Hey, hey, hey! What's with

302
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,044
Already drunk at this time?

303
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,090
Let's give a big
round of applause now

304
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,801
for one of the hottest women here tonight,
this is Alejandra.

305
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,348
Yes, La Terraza Coctelera friends,
get ready, because in five minutes...

306
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,102
Hear me out, in five minutes

307
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,229
we're having the best,
most perfect performance of the night.

308
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,608
Now comes Candy,
sexier than ever.

309
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,652
So welcome! Such a
pleasure to work here.

310
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,861
May the rumba continue!

311
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,030
This is going to be good!

312
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,158
So what are we drinking?

313
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,952
It'll have to be beer

314
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,328
because all the money

315
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,455
went to the
bouncer to let us in.

316
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,960
Hey,
no beer. It's not my fault I'm under age.

317
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,879
But it's your fault to make
plans like this, you pervert.

318
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:55,922
Right?

319
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,509
Turn off the music!

320
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,761
Rodríguez, over there.

321
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,931
This is a routine procedure,
folks.

322
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,433
Please cooperate
handing me your IDs.

323
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,520
Lucho, we're screwed, brother.

324
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,858
Hand me your IDs.

325
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,364
Galvis, thanks so much.

326
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,532
No, sir. You're the boss.

327
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,992
Right.

328
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,248
- What's up, uncle?
- Are you stupid or something?

329
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,083
Be thankful I know Galvis,

330
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,878
otherwise they'd have ended up
taking you away. You know where?

331
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,589
To the police station,
with the transvestites and the homeless.

332
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,758
They eat you alive over there,

333
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,927
and not exactly
with a fork and knife.

334
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,679
Right, uncle, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,431
Why are you doing this?

336
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,600
Hey,
it's not like I killed someone.

337
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,771
Me and Lucho just wanted to
see a hot chick dancing, that's all.

338
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,815
No, I'm not talking about that.

339
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,735
Look, if there's something I
respect that's the sacred right

340
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,279
we men have to
see a naked woman.

341
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,531
- Well, so?
- So what?

342
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,579
Why did you call me?

343
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,497
Why didn't you call your dad?

344
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,636
Go to your room,
young man. You're grounded.

345
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,138
I'll deal with you later.

346
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:45,198
I think you shouldn't tell
Walter about this, you know?

347
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,908
These things happen naturally.

348
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,662
You think it's natural for
him to go to these places?

349
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,958
Well, he's a teenager. He's exploring,
looking.

350
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,003
And he just found out his dad has cancer,
you know?

351
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,464
He's just acting out.

352
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,051
First the pot, and then this.

353
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,845
The pot? What are
you talking about?

354
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:12,642
María, you told me Junior was--

355
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,328
- Because you told me.
- I didn't say that, María!

356
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,313
You told me!

357
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:19,125
Well, you implied that with this
whole story about the neighbor's son--

358
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,443
No, I wasn't talking about Junior,
María,

359
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,945
I was talking about
Walter Senior.

360
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,488
What?

361
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,782
Walter Senior smokes pot?

362
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,075
Walter?

363
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,204
- Well, he admitted it himself.
- No...

364
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,754
Yes, lately,
Walter's been acting really weird.

365
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,396
He actually seems
like he's someone else.

366
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,885
Just think about it.
Don't you find that weird?

367
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,971
I mean,
why would anyone in their right mind

368
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,765
choose not to do treatment
when it's completely paid for?

369
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,643
I think we should do something.

370
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,770
What?

371
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:01,691
What we really need to do is sit
him down and make him. All of us.

372
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,027
You mean an intervention?

373
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,196
Like on TV when
they talk to addicts?

374
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,825
Right.

375
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:14,996
José,
you're a genius! Master of the universe.

376
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,666
This is absolutely unreal!

377
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,751
No, no, no.

378
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,504
I'm gonna burn
that dollar bill suit!

379
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,881
It's not right, Mono!

380
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,331
But José, I think it's perfect.
What more would you want?

381
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,430
It's cloudy. Can't you see that?

382
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,517
It's not supposed to be
cloudy but transparent.

383
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,687
Jose, so what? Cloudy,
not cloudy.

384
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:43,191
It looks good enough to me to blow
your mind out, isn't that what's important?

385
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,277
- Are you out of your
mind? Move over!

386
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,993
Come on,
José! Come on, old José.

387
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,620
Man, don't even think about it.

388
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,706
No,
man! How can you throw that away?

389
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,791
It's not right.

390
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,836
I totally would've smoked that!

391
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:07,173
It's not for you, it's for our customers.
They're gonna demand a certain standard.

392
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,674
So what now?

393
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,301
- We cook more.
- What?

394
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,345
We'll just do it again
until we get it right.

395
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,040
Hi.

396
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,668
Please have a seat and join us.

397
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,034
We can do better.

398
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,373
Come on, José. Three entire
pounds of pseudo wasted! Stop it now!

399
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,501
Man... No!

400
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,004
Did you see what you did?

401
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,465
It wasn't me, José! Why would
I throw away three pounds of

402
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:34,177
Why do you accuse me?
Stop fucking with me already!

403
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,972
What are you doing, Mono?

404
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,730
Stop fucking with me!
You're not getting out.

405
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,986
My eyes,
man! I don't give a shit about your eyes!

406
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,655
Bye, old Mono.

407
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,115
You fight like a girl, man.

408
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,792
Come on!

409
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,753
José, José, dude!

410
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,388
It's all good,
José! Don't leave me here, man!

411
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,681
José, José!

412
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:26,854
Walter,
I need you to share what you're thinking.

413
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,440
Because I really don't
understand anything.

414
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,359
I feel your decision is not
only not in your best interest,

415
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:35,371
it's not in the best
interest of our entire family.

416
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,534
- Cielo...
- Not yet.

417
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,244
Only one person
has the Talking Pillow.

418
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,583
Everybody gets to speak their minds,
and in the end,

419
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:50,253
you'll get your chance.

420
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,422
I'm sorry.

421
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,342
Edgar is willing to pitch
in for your treatment.

422
00:27:56,384 --> 00:28:01,013
Money has always
been an issue for us,

423
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,600
so that would really help us,
Walter.

424
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,769
But you refused,
I don't know why.

425
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,147
I just want to make it clear...

426
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,815
that I don't agree with that.

427
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,904
It's okay to lean on people now and again,
Walter.

428
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,615
You need that.

429
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,157
We need that.

430
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,082
Are you done? Can I answer.

431
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:32,378
No. I think we need to
go around the circle first.

432
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:34,631
Go ahead, Henry.

433
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,180
Well...

434
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,267
This is kind of complex,
it's not a matter of...

435
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:57,820
Well,
I don't usually get the chance

436
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,282
to tell you this kind of stuff,

437
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:04,535
so I'm taking this chance to tell you,
brother,

438
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,539
that I care about you a lot.

439
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,169
You're like a brother to me,
you know?

440
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,923
This cancer thing, well...

441
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,968
It's like the other team scored a
goal when the game just started.

442
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:26,599
But that doesn't mean you lose,
does it? So what do you do?

443
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:30,687
You plan the game again.
You think about the formation.

444
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:34,982
If you're playing with two four-player
lines, you know what you do?

445
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,986
With two fives,
a play maker and two offenses up,

446
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:42,532
With wingbacks-- - What
are you talking about?

447
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,784
It's a metaphor from soccer,
honey.

448
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,203
Walter understands me,
don't you?

449
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:50,414
María, it's fine. Leave him.

450
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,874
That's what this is about. Talk.

451
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,752
And besides,
I have the Talking Pillow.

452
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm going to use an
example we all understand.

453
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,631
Just imagine a
player gets injured.

454
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,841
The guy can't play anymore,
you know?

455
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,635
They need the doctor.

456
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:05,471
He comes, makes an infiltration,
uses that stuff

457
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,307
they use so that the
guys can keep on playing.

458
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,601
He gets help...

459
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,521
You get me,
don't you? What I'm...

460
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,232
No.

461
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,192
You have your pride,
I have mine.

462
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,546
We all have our pride, it's just that
sometimes we should forget about it.

463
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,823
If this Daddy Richy
wants to chip in

464
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,034
I say take the money and run.

465
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,286
Who wants this? I...

466
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,750
I have nothing
else... That's it for me.

467
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,959
Junior...

468
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:40,464
I know you have a lot
on your mind with now.

469
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,633
Now is the time
for you to speak.

470
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,386
- This is bullshit, mom.
- Hey, watch your mouth!

471
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:48,806
Walter, let him talk.

472
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,560
How do you feel? Tell us.

473
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,562
I'm pissed off, mom.

474
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,063
Tell him.

475
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,824
I'm pissed off because
you're being a coward,

476
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,787
a pussy. You're
ready to give up.

477
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,789
What if you gave up on me?

478
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,960
All the stuff I've
been through. Look.

479
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,340
And you're scared of
a little chemotherapy?

480
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,802
Come on, Walter!

481
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,817
Well...

482
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,318
I think, Walter,

483
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:47,197
that you should do
whatever you want to do.

484
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,032
What?

485
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,303
Yes. You told us to be honest
about our feelings. That's what I feel.

486
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,120
You're the one with cancer.

487
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,790
You have the right to
make your own decisions.

488
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,750
- María,
why are you doing this to me?

489
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,585
I'm not doing anything to you!

490
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,188
I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walter,
but now that I'm listening

491
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,089
to you all talk about his future

492
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,884
like he has no say in it...

493
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,053
He's not gonna have a future
if he doesn't get treatment.

494
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,015
First of all,
you don't have the Pillow.

495
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,311
Second of all, I work with X-rays
every day and have a ton of experience

496
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,104
despite my age.

497
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,442
I x-ray people in
treatment every day.

498
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,653
Some of them are
absolutely miserable.

499
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,447
And some of them don't
wanna spend their last days

500
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:32,201
being picked at by doctors
with pills and injections

501
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,787
as if they were lab rats. No.

502
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,039
Could I get the pillow back?
I agree with María on that.

503
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,624
No, Henry!

504
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:42,044
What? Maybe Walter
wants to die like a man.

505
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,047
I don't want him to die at
all! That's the whole point

506
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,341
of all this, for him to live!
We're here to convince him!

507
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,176
So either help,
or leave! Because--

508
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,762
Cielo,
we came here to give our opinion.

509
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,890
As honestly and
respectfully as possible.

510
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,516
No! You know,
this is not debate club.

511
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,434
This is my husband's
life we're talking about!

512
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,603
You just don't like anyone

513
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,064
to say anything against you,
so that's why we don't agree

514
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,206
and get all rattled
up. That's my opinion.

515
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:04,650
No, no!

516
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,586
- You're asking me for my opinion.
- María, please.

517
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,445
You always do this to me.

518
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,807
Why do we agree on something
and then you say the opposite?

519
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,497
All right,
I've got the Talking Pillow now.

520
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,382
I know you're all here
because you love me

521
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,511
and you're worried about me.

522
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,306
I am very thankful for that.

523
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,811
But what I want...

524
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,189
What I really need...

525
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,777
is a choice.

526
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,030
What does that mean?

527
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:56,744
Sometimes, I feel...

528
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:02,541
I never actually had the chance

529
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:06,462
to make any decision of my own.

530
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,548
I always end up giving.

531
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,681
And now,
with all this cancer thing,

532
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:22,102
I particularly feel

533
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:26,231
I should be the one
to make a decision.

534
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,858
Then make the right choice.

535
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,821
You're not the
only one it affects.

536
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,073
Think about Junior.

537
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,619
Don't you wanna see
your daughter grow up?

538
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,040
Of course I do.

539
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,918
It's not just that, Cielo.

540
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,712
There are other
things to think about.

541
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,213
Look, these doctors,

542
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,259
they just say that you...

543
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,763
should live longer

544
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,890
and that it's a
matter of survival.

545
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,060
To live how long?
One or two years?

546
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,105
Like it's the only
thing that matters.

547
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,692
But what about
the quality of life?

548
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,989
What use is it to me to be alive

549
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:18,241
if I am too sick to work,

550
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,829
to pick up the baby

551
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,707
or be able to enjoy a meal

552
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,709
or make love?

553
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,296
You know what I want?

554
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,552
I want to live my last
days in my own house,

555
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,639
to sleep in my own bed.

556
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,142
I don't wanna choke down
40 pills every single day

557
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,853
feel nauseous

558
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:48,105
and so weak

559
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,066
to even be able to lift my head.

560
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,070
And you having to
work twice as hard

561
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:57,406
and cleaning my
puke all the time.

562
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,954
I don't want to be
a dead man living

563
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,875
just to buy myself a
couple more minutes.

564
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,130
That's how you would remember me,
and I don't want that.

565
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,925
I want you to
remember me like this,

566
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,593
not like some old rag.

567
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,942
Alright

568
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,320
Alright what?

569
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,325
I'll do the treatment.

570
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,884
It's gonna be OK.

571
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,324
Are you OK, champ?

572
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,577
Thank you.

573
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:56,043
They say they usually bill the
insurance company directly.

574
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:58,855
But since our HMO is not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

575
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,463
OK.

576
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:04,467
Will Edgar send a check...?

577
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,345
Don't worry,
I will take care of it.

578
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,680
Walter Blanco!

579
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:09,723
Yes, that's me.

580
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,106
See you in a minute.

581
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,872
Edgar, what's up?

582
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,292
<i>... Walter, this is Marcela.</i>

583
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,171
Hi, Marcela, how are you?

584
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,255
I'm good.

585
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,174
<i>You know,</i>

586
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,177
it was really great seeing
you two the other day.

587
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,594
<i>What an amazing party.</i>

588
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,596
Edgar told me about the cancer.

589
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,931
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

590
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:37,102
Well, you know...

591
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,479
It is what it is, I guess.

592
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,982
I don't know what to say
except I'm here for you.

593
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:44,360
You can count on us.

594
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:48,655
Thank you, Marcela,
I really appreciate it, OK?

595
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,865
<i>Edgar also told me</i>

596
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,825
he had offered to
pay for the treatment

597
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,077
and you said no.

598
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,454
<i>I'd like you to reconsider</i>

599
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,308
because as far as we know,
that money belongs to you.

600
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,542
We wouldn't have the
company if it weren't for you.

601
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,835
- Marcela...
<i>- No, listen to me.</i>

602
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:07,549
Did you say no because of
what happened between us?

603
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,887
I appreciate very much
what you're doing for me, OK?

604
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,223
But let me just say it's
no longer necessary.

605
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,726
It turns out the insurance

606
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:23,106
came through after all and is
paying for the treatment. So...

607
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,901
it's all fine,
no problem at all.

608
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:31,281
<i>Anyway,
I really appreciate you thinking about me.</i>

609
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,284
Good, that's good news.

610
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,246
<i>Yes. Well, once again,</i>

611
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,332
it was great seeing you,
and we should do it again.

612
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:44,586
Please, keep in touch,
OK? I'd like to know how you're doing.

613
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,588
<i>Of course.</i>

614
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,883
Hey... Thanks for calling.

615
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,260
Thank you.

616
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,975
Where do you think you're going?

617
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,728
Do you think this is your house?

618
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:48,442
You wanna cook?
