1
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,922
Hurry, princess.

2
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,742
Give me that!!
Give me the money!

3
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,452
- Motherfucker! The money!
- Asshole!

4
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,319
What? What is it, love?
What? Tell me.

5
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,172
Beautiful princess.

6
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,423
Yes.

7
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,801
Yes.

8
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,729
Thanks.

9
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,773
Done.

10
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,050
Ready!
Are you okay?

11
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,317
I'm fine!

12
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,654
So, Saturday 9 a.m. then?

13
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,723
Yes, dad. 9 a.m.
Great.

14
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,559
Dad, can you do me a favor and
pick me up half an hour earlier?

15
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,369
Yes, sure.

16
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,896
I'll be here 8:30.
Great.

17
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,664
Hey, hey.

18
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,068
Congratulations.
You're doing great.

19
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,820
Thanks.
It's okay.

20
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,421
See you.

21
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,760
Hi.

22
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,637
Hi, how was your day?

23
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,748
Fine, fine.
Do you have a minute?

24
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,725
Yes, sure.

25
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,794
Can you keep an eye
on your sister
while I talk with your dad?

26
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,504
Behave yourself!
Sure.

27
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,009
Have you thought
about what we discussed?

28
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,680
"Thought"
meaning reconsidered?

29
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,949
No. No.

30
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,202
What's the problem?

31
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,204
What's the flaw you see here?

32
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,748
It's not a flaw.

33
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,067
Cielo.
Flaws.

34
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:38,112
Plural.
Where do you want me to start?

35
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,672
Walter...

36
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,784
...I don't love
this situation we're in.

37
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,970
But here I am.

38
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,624
We've got to find
the best option possible.

39
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,811
We've got the story.

40
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,922
We start
with the gambling thing.

41
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,008
We've got the money,
the startup capital

42
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,735
to invest it in the car wash.

43
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,680
You know the business.
You've worked there.

44
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,516
And you hire your wife
as a bookkeeper.

45
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,118
And why?

46
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,953
Guess.

47
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,647
Your wife is actually a
bookkeeper.

48
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,084
Anyone would believe that story.

49
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,361
Now, tell me,
what am I am missing?

50
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,629
Look, you don't understand this.

51
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,007
You just get the money

52
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,534
and look the other way.
Pretend you don't know anything.

53
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,678
Listen, if I ever get caught,

54
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,388
God forbid,

55
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,373
it would be much easier for you
to deny everything.

56
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,017
Walter!

57
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,587
My estranged husband
who works as a teacher

58
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,397
and barely

59
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,799
makes ends meet,
all of a sudden,

60
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,343
starts shoveling
money at me.

61
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,679
And when the police
questions me, I'll just say:

62
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,724
"No, I didn't think
anything weird was going on."

63
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,617
Really?

64
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,371
Is that plausible deniability?

65
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,956
Walter!

66
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,167
Come on! The car wash

67
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,986
is the best option
to get out of this situation.

68
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,532
Which already sucks,
and can get worse!

69
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:07,718
Okay, fine.

70
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,412
However, your argument
has a flaw.

71
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,124
Why?
Tell me.

72
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,766
Why your estranged husband

73
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,419
would do that for you
all of a sudden, why?

74
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,189
Because he loves his family

75
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,275
above everything else.

76
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,569
And he'll do anything

77
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,931
to get his wife back,
even if it's impossible.

78
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,867
And knowing him as I do,

79
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,953
he'd try anything.

80
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,041
Yes.

81
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,710
There's still a flaw.

82
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,755
It'd be much more plausible

83
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:48,617
if the husband
were no longer estranged.

84
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,428
Let's say, if suddenly,

85
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,537
he has the chance to sleep
in his own bed again.

86
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,917
This has turned
into a fictional story.

87
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,836
Well, no.
Okay, okay, I admit it.

88
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,729
But...

89
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,547
I want to have dinner
here
every night.

90
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,983
Every night? No. No.

91
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,345
Fine. Six nights a week.
You get a night fee.

92
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,406
Two! Not weekends!

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,116
And you give me a day's notice.

94
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,809
No! Five
nights, with no
notice.

95
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,936
Three nights.
Six hours' notice.

96
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,913
Five, two hours' notice.

97
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,539
Four. Don't insist.

98
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,317
Fine, fine.
And I want the keys
to the house.

99
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,943
No.
Yes! Yes!

100
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,753
Cielo, for emergencies.

101
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,323
I don't know, appearances.
I don't care.

102
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,784
I want to see my
daughter.

103
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,953
I want to help Junior
with his homework.

104
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,748
I want to be part
of this family again.

105
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,059
And that's my condition

106
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,711
to agree to your
fiction.

107
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,296
Professor.

108
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,383
I was thinking that...

109
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,093
...when we're done here

110
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,262
we could go for beers.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,265
No, thanks.

112
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,642
Maybe some other time.

113
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,478
No, listen.

114
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,105
Professor...

115
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,901
I think we should do it today.

116
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,428
So?

117
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,891
What are you doing, moron?

118
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,893
Why did you bring this here?

119
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,045
That's the product we cook,
right?

120
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,688
Take a look at it and tell me.

121
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,903
It's ours.

122
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,154
Put that away!

123
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,850
Where did you take it from?
The lab?

124
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,452
No.

125
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,230
I bought it from the guys
who killed Gordo.

126
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,665
Well, the guys who ordered it.

127
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,819
Those motherfuckers
are selling our product.

128
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,670
That means they're working

129
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,339
for the same man we are, right?

130
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,217
Not necessarily.

131
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,302
They could be reselling it.

132
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,471
Can you prove it?

133
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,957
Look, you shouldn't jump
to conclusions.

134
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,044
I heard it
from the sister of the kid

135
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,605
who killed Gordo.

136
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,675
And yes, you heard me.
I said kid.

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,136
Tomás Cantillo.
An 11 year old kid

138
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,680
was the one who received orders
to kill Gordo.

139
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,641
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

140
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,202
They use kids, man!

141
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,746
Why not?

142
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,415
They are easy to fool.

143
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,459
Easy to manipulate.

144
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,153
And if anything happens,
easy, they take them to rehab.

145
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,963
They get out right away.

146
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,049
And they go back doing

147
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,593
the same they were doing before.

148
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,637
Those motherfuckers

149
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,163
recruit them
when they're young

150
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,665
to have their loyalty
for ever, man.

151
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,226
Those men killed Gordo!

152
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,811
They manipulated a kid

153
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,188
and got my friend killed, man.

154
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,816
Why are you telling me this?

155
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,722
Because I need your help.
How?

156
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,158
I need ricin.

157
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,542
Are you poisoning people now?

158
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,405
Walter, these men...
Listen to me.

159
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,490
No!
These men have to go.

160
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,758
I've planned everything.

161
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,911
No.
Walter.

162
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,121
Listen, the only thing
I need from you

163
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,583
is the poison.
I thought

164
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,334
of the delivery, everything.
I said no.

165
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,004
Walter.
Please.

166
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,106
You won't have to lift a finger.

167
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,525
I guarantee that. I do.

168
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,901
Listen to yourself, goddamn it!

169
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,678
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

170
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,780
Those two men must go.

171
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,032
This is what we have to do.

172
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:23,725
This world would be
a better place without them.

173
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,453
I'm not even talking about that.

174
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,124
Listen.

175
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,502
I know an old woman

176
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,695
who buys drugs
from these two, okay?

177
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,032
She sees them
at lest once or twice a week.

178
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,678
She gives them food.

179
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,913
She indulges them,
gives them hamburgers.

180
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,958
And she gets a discount
on her crystal. It's perfect!

181
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,727
That's my delivery method.

182
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,545
The best thing is
I don't have to be there.

183
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,689
I can be miles away

184
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,757
just checking
everything's perfect.

185
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,717
Get it?
That's worse.

186
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,819
You're trusting a meth-head?

187
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,655
Yes, man.

188
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,724
A meth-head who stood up
to your brother in law,
don't forget it.

189
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,228
He questioned her for five hours
and the woman...

190
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,954
didn't give it up.

191
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,540
How do I know this?

192
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,400
Because you and I
are sitting here

193
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,293
and not rotting in jail.

194
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,046
I'll rot in jail.

195
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,674
In jail or some place worse.

196
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,217
And with you!

197
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,135
This is a ridiculous idea.

198
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,705
Completely ridiculous.
Ridiculous?

199
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,932
Ridiculous.

200
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,517
So, you're already assuming

201
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,102
this won't work?

202
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,338
It was a good idea
when you came up with it

203
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,715
and now it's not a good idea
any more?

204
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,844
You came up with
that plan to kill Tuco, man.

205
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,887
You said it yourself:
"The man eats the ricin

206
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,656
and in two or three days

207
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,142
he gets sick,
a heart attack and he's gone.

208
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:52,022
And there's no way
they track it back to us."

209
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,066
Walter,
they won't track it back to me.

210
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,944
Not even that other scumbag
we work for

211
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,630
is going to ever figure it out.

212
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,741
It was a good plan for Tuco
and it's a good plan now.

213
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,509
Tuco

214
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,219
wanted to kill us.

215
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,305
These guys don't!

216
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,140
Honestly,

217
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,417
do I really need
to explain you the difference?

218
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,269
Gordo

219
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,480
was one of us, man.

220
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,649
He was one of us.

221
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,133
That means nothing to you,
right?

222
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,026
Tell me something.

223
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,095
Why didn't you track them
three months ago?

224
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,889
Because I just found out
about this.

225
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,141
Really?
And what did you find out?

226
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,020
Genius! That is was
a dispute over turf?

227
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,398
That's absolutely obvious,
right?

228
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,151
Wouldn't have been easier
three months ago

229
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,529
when it happened?
Why didn't you do it then?

230
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,631
Shall I tell you why?

231
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,659
Because at the time
you was too high

232
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,869
feeling sorry
for just anything.

233
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,250
So, why now,
after all this time?

234
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,645
Being a murderer is part

235
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,297
of your 12 steps program
in rehab?

236
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,982
Jose, please.

237
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,901
This is not about blame

238
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,820
and make amends, man.

239
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,031
This idea is pointless!

240
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,645
What do you want
to get with this?

241
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,288
You know what?

242
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,650
If you don't see
what I want to get,

243
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,153
there's no point in trying
to explain it to you.

244
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,365
Listen, Jose.
You're no murderer.

245
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,175
Neither am I.

246
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,302
We're no murders.

247
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,514
Jose.

248
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,684
You know what, man?

249
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,186
I'm doing this.

250
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,840
With or without you.
But I'm doing it.

251
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,441
The hell I am.

252
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,727
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> So, who's turn is it</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to steal one?</font></i>

253
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,186
Mine.
Listen, María...

254
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,914
two hours to steal a letter?

255
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,357
No, but I'm organizing my cards.
Bummer.

256
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,253
Diamonds Queen.

257
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,922
I got a trio.

258
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,950
María, you can't say
what you've got.

259
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,869
Why not? That depends
on the player, Henry.

260
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,012
It's the rule, María.

261
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,681
Fine, I'm winning anyway.

262
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,266
Not so fast, aunt.

263
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,584
Look.
Why?

264
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,211
Eight, nine,
Joker, Queen, King.

265
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,813
Straight Flush?

266
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,301
This moron won
three times in a row.

267
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,887
You've been practicing with dad
or what?

268
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,306
No.
No, why?

269
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,533
And your dad, how's he doing?

270
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,827
Is he still teaching?

271
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,564
No, nothing. My mom nor my dad
are working now.

272
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,082
No?

273
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,084
What are they doing then?

274
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,380
Junior, did you know

275
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,090
uncle Henry was released?

276
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,117
He can go back home
whenever he wants now.

277
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,619
Yes? Great!
Yes.

278
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,013
No, it's not advisable yet.

279
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,791
Henry, don't give me that look.
I didn't say anything wrong.

280
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,001
I'm simply repeating what the
doctors said.

281
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,045
Yes? And why did the doctors
say that?

282
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,022
Because they need the room.

283
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,717
To change the sheets
and accommodate the next
cripple.

284
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:10,178
What for?
To get more, kat-ching, money!

285
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,972
Uncle, you look okay to me.
You're feeling better?

286
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,851
Yes? Do I look okay?
Are all of you
in this together or what?

287
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,577
No, my God.

288
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,287
Do you think I'm okay?

289
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm shitting my pants every day.

290
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,983
Henry...
- I'm peeing in pitchers.

291
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,278
And apart from that,
I can't move my legs.

292
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,088
I can't walk.

293
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,758
So? Is that being okay for you?

294
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,803
Uncle, so people in wheelchairs

295
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,680
should be in hospitals?

296
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,933
What about people on crutches?

297
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,377
So, make me some room there.
Make me some room!

298
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,521
Is that what you mean?

299
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,944
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,098
- Okay, deal there.
- I'll do it.

301
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,658
Give me that.

302
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,403
You know I charge by the hour,
right?

303
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,549
He promised he'd be here.

304
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,342
He promised?

305
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,328
So, let's keep waiting,
no problem.

306
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,180
No, I meant it, Walter.

307
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,140
He won't come!

308
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,085
I mean it, he won't come!
Let's forget it.

309
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,229
Any plan B?

310
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,815
No, Saúl. There isn't.

311
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,135
So, let's do some brainstorming.
How about that?

312
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,363
Are you sure he was serious?

313
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,781
Why do you think I'm here?

314
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,578
Judging by the way

315
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,981
he talked to me,
I guess he's doing it.

316
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,917
Or at least he'll try!

317
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,153
Perfect, so we pay him off.
Period.

318
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,338
No, this is not about the money.

319
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,174
Saúl, we need to find the way

320
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,619
to get him off the streets,
getting him to calm down.

321
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,098
Maybe.

322
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,725
I don't know, Saúl.

323
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,561
You can do something.

324
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,354
Why don't...?

325
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,189
Why don't you get him arrested?

326
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,194
You want your partner in jail?

327
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,931
I know!
I know it sounds risky.

328
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,516
But that's it, I don't know,
less dangerous

329
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,659
than him making something stupid

330
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,770
which jeopardize the business
eventually.

331
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,065
Kind of a minor offense,
let's say.

332
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,583
"Minor offense!"

333
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,128
Rosas in jail, I don't know.

334
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,154
I don't think so.
It's not advisable.

335
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,090
Fine, no jail, then. Fine.

336
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,675
What about something like

337
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,262
having him doing community work.

338
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,098
That kind of thing.

339
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,294
No! He's not a minor.
He'll go straight to jail.

340
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,896
I don't know, Saúl.

341
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,731
There has to be a way

342
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,842
to get him off the streets
till he calms down

343
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,069
so we can move on!

344
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,906
Well, I'm guess

345
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,867
home arrest could work.

346
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,286
So, there is a chance?

347
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,665
Sure! That's included

348
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,084
in my Premium Services Package.

349
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,837
But thanks God

350
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,990
you can afford that.
You can afford almost anything.

351
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,159
Don't worry.
I'll call my private
investigator.

352
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,223
Home arrest. Sure.

353
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,856
Guendy.

354
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,925
Do you understand
what you've got to do?

355
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,512
See, you can't tell
no one about this. Ever!

356
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,990
Never ever. Got it?

357
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,410
Yes.

358
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,830
See, I read on line

359
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,316
that this thing takes
three days to kick in.

360
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,003
You only thing you've got to do

361
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,214
is never tell anyone about this.

362
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,965
Just be silent.

363
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,968
If you do that, I swear

364
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,428
there won't be consequences

365
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,305
for you or me, okay?

366
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,183
Guendy, do you agree?

367
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,145
You picture this

368
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,815
as what you always do.

369
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,693
The only thing you've got to do

370
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,846
is taking them the hamburgers
like any other day, that's it.

371
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,641
It's not just
like any other day. Because

372
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,602
we're not talking
about just delivering food.

373
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,258
Guendy, you have a son, right?

374
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,221
- Yeison.

375
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,306
A handsome kids?

376
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,434
Well, see.

377
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,627
Just picture
that these men

378
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,896
have Yeison working for them.

379
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,190
Working as a mule.

380
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,401
And they make him kill people.

381
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,972
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

382
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,934
Of course, I'd do anything
to protect him.

383
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,493
Exactly.

384
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,270
Well, these men
have kids working for them.

385
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,496
They take advantage of them.

386
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,582
They have them working.

387
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,276
We should take care
of these scumbags?

388
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,278
Don't you
think?

389
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,092
Yeah, right?

390
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,010
Fine.

391
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,554
Very well.

392
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,558
Yes, Guendy?

393
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,727
So, we'll do it tomorrow, right?

394
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,714
- Yes, yes.
- Don't back out.

395
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,025
Done. I'll be back.

396
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,031
How are you?

397
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,663
Will give me a second?

398
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,456
Yes? I won't take long.

399
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,512
What are you doing here?

400
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,931
If you need me, call me.

401
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,350
What we need to talk about

402
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,501
can't be talked over the phone,
Walter.

403
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,395
Aren't you inviting me in, man?

404
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,824
She's a beauty!

405
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,493
Tell me what you need, Mario.

406
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,078
Take a seat, man.

407
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,751
I've been talking with Saúl

408
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,962
about your plan for Rosas.

409
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,448
- So?
- I'm not doing it.

410
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,799
Why not?

411
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,468
Basically, because it's stupid.

412
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,704
Saúl told me
you've done it before.

413
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,264
That's not the point.

414
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,183
What's the point?

415
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,436
The boss won't like it.

416
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,063
Saúl?

417
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,857
Your boss, who's my boss too.

418
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,012
Look, take it
as professional courtesy.

419
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,907
No one knows I'm here.

420
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,994
The boss will find out.

421
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,122
If Rosas were arrested,

422
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,650
I'm sure he'll see it
as a problem.

423
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,585
A big one.

424
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,880
Walter, I mean it.

425
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,116
You've got
a very good thing going.

426
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,134
In fact, we both have.

427
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,470
Things are going well.

428
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,931
Think about it.

429
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,918
Is it worth to risk it all
on one junkie?

430
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,731
I do realize you two

431
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,192
have a story and all.

432
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,138
But this kid's been
on the bubble a while now.

433
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,739
This isn't new.

434
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,310
- Don't you see it?
- What?

435
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,605
I used to be a cop
many years ago.
I saw it all.

436
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,125
Stickups,

437
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,694
domestic violence,
street fights.

438
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,670
Anyway.

439
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,340
Every scumbag you can think of.

440
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,051
At the time I knew

441
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,805
a guy I'll never forget.

442
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,223
Pacheco.

443
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,183
He was huge.

444
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:23,254
I guess he weighted
about 240 pounds.

445
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,274
And his wife was small.

446
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,152
Thin. Like a bird.

447
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,569
Well,

448
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,824
the thing is my partner and I

449
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,809
get called out to the house
every weekend

450
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,577
to save that poor woman.

451
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,064
We'd get there, pull her aside
and tell her:

452
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,983
"Come on, do it,
press charges

453
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,736
against this beast
and get rid of him once for all.

454
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,424
But no.

455
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,995
This wasn't one of those setups:
"Deep down

456
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,930
he loves me."

457
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,875
That excuse
is still widely used.

458
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,852
But not this one.

459
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,314
Where are you getting at?

460
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,219
Well, that woman
looked pretty scared.

461
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,155
She'd shiver with fear.

462
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,141
But she didn't have the guts
to report him.

463
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,851
And there's nothing else
we could do.

464
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,620
The only thing

465
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,399
we could do was
putting him in a car,
taking him for a ride,

466
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,585
and then to the police station.

467
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,921
Then, the next day,

468
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,241
out he went,
as if nothing had happened.

469
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,994
He'd get drunk again,
and went back home to beat her.

470
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,097
It was like a vicious cycle.

471
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,560
One day, my partner

472
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,962
was out sick
and I went there alone.

473
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,483
The same fucking call.

474
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,178
I handcuffed the man
and took him with me.

475
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,032
But that day was different.

476
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,452
When we were in the car,

477
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,748
that asshole was singing.

478
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,085
And that made me really mad.

479
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,155
So, instead of taking him
to the station,

480
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,632
I took him to an ally I knew

481
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,867
and was good
for what I wanted to do.

482
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,954
I got him off the car,
down on his knees,
and the gun in his mouth.

483
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,806
"This is it."

484
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,835
He started weeping,
he peed his pants.

485
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,672
With the gun still in his mouth
he was yelling,

486
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,691
swearing he'd never do it again,

487
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,761
he'd leave her alone.
I told him to shut up

488
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,515
because I need to think
what I was going to do with him.

489
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,950
Of course, he was silent.

490
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:45,104
He stayed there, in silence,
not even a word.

491
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,108
He looked like a street dog
waiting for leftovers.

492
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,461
Then, we simply stayed there.

493
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,880
I pretended to be considering

494
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,466
what to do with him.

495
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,994
And he was there,
kneeling on mud.

496
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,679
Shaking.

497
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,348
I waited for a while,

498
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,337
took the gun out of his mouth,
and told him:

499
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,773
"God help you,

500
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,468
because if you ever
touch her again,

501
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,971
you won't imagine,
I'll do this

502
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,990
and that, and also that."

503
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,700
A warning?

504
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,034
Sure.

505
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,856
At the time, I thought
I was doing the right thing.

506
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,919
Two weeks later, he killed her.

507
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,658
He broke her head
with a mixer.

508
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,620
When we got there,
there was so much blood,

509
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,472
it was slippery.

510
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,792
I'll never forget
the smell in that house.

511
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,814
The moral of the story

512
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,900
is that I took a half measure.

513
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,721
When I should have
gone all the way.

514
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,476
I'll never make
that mistake again.

515
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,539
Listen to me, Walter.

516
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,250
No half measures.

517
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,002
I don't get it.
I'm only seeing the kid.

518
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,272
Where are the men, Guendy?

519
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,758
I don't know.
They are always there.

520
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,571
Burgers are getting cold.

521
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,660
Are you sure this is fast?

522
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,538
Yes, Guendy.

523
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,941
Don't you worry.
Act normal, okay?

524
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,820
Nobody's gonna know anything.
Relax.

525
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,339
Can I have another bump?

526
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,825
No, I gave you
what you needed already.

527
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,579
When this is done, I'll give you
all you want, okay?

528
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,183
Where are these guys?

529
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,353
Walk, motherfucker!

530
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,563
What happened?

531
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,648
You get lost! Out of here!

532
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,667
Where are we going, man?

533
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,719
Take a seat.

534
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,065
I understand you have a problem

535
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,860
with two of my men.

536
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,638
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

537
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:53,686
It is possible
they acted rashly.

538
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,898
But, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

539
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,986
The man was selling
on their territory.

540
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,341
There is blame on both sides.

541
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,469
This will go no further.

542
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,749
It will be settled right here,
right now.

543
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,877
You told him, right?
Damn it!

544
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,260
You told him, right?
Damn it!

545
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,467
Now, listen to me.

546
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,012
You have one friend here.

547
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,224
This man.

548
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,546
Those men who just left
are my employees.

549
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:05,232
And I fully trust them.

550
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,613
When I learned about your plans,

551
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,698
if it wasn't for this man,

552
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,158
and the respect I have for him,

553
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,936
I surely would be dealing
with this

554
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,080
in a very different way.

555
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,901
You don't look at him.
You look at me!

556
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,714
I'll tell what will happen now.

557
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,633
My men will come back inside.

558
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,386
You'll shake hands.

559
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,122
You'll make peace.
And that will be all.

560
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,558
The end of this.

561
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,546
- No.
- Jose.

562
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,147
Excuse me?

563
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,654
They use kids, man!

564
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,573
Those assholes you hired

565
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,434
have an 11 year old kid
killing for them.

566
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,813
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

567
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,123
This is how you do business?

568
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,361
And you, what?
Are you okay with this?

569
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,212
You got nothing to say here?

570
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,301
Bring them back.

571
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,033
No more kids.

572
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,327
Got it?

573
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,877
And you,

574
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,921
you keep the peace.

575
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,298
Say it.

576
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,180
I'll keep the peace.

577
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,852
Now, shake hands.

578
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,511
Listen, María.

579
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,706
Why don't you let the people
who get paid to do this

580
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,433
do this?

581
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,836
Because the people who get paid
to do this

582
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,270
do a lousy job.

583
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,880
- Ay.
- Henry, relax.

584
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,613
This is what you want?

585
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,325
Just lying in a hospital bed

586
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,187
getting sponge baths
from nurses.

587
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,081
Listen, María.

588
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,917
Henry, it's time to go home.

589
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,401
How many times
I have to tell you

590
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,920
I'm not going nowhere

591
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,297
till I get better, María?

592
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,387
Hey, hey!

593
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,875
- What are you doing?
- I'm just seeing.

594
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,711
- Seeing what?
- What I'm seeing.

595
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,296
- Listen, María.
- Don't move! Careful!

596
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,592
Hey, hey, what are
you doing?

597
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,137
- María, please.
- Relax.

598
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,764
I'm not at my best
here, Marie.

599
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,491
I think you are.

600
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,660
María, I'm in bed.

601
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,771
There's a reason why
I'm in bed.

602
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,315
You're wasting your
time,
I mean it.

603
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,943
María, what if someone
comes in?

604
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,778
I don't care
if someone walks in.
They can look.

605
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,839
What's into you?

606
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,133
Let's do this:

607
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,093
If it shows up to say hello...

608
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,995
That won't happen.
Get your hand out of there.

609
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,805
I bet it will.

610
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,765
If it will, we go home.

611
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,100
Let's see.

612
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,726
I'm not going to bet...

613
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:12,254
on whether I can get a boner
or no, okay?

614
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,424
- So, no betting.
- Why? Are you afraid or what?

615
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:18,652
María, what's wrong with you?

616
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,821
You're being foolish, you know?

617
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,140
Tell me, what's the point
of all this?

618
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,159
Well, I'm trying to prove

619
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,352
you're not as dysfunctional
as you say.

620
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,663
So? Bet on it?

621
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,233
- Fine, let's bet.
- Okay.

622
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,944
- You got one minute.
- One minute?

623
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,320
That's more than enough
for me.

624
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,864
Let's
see.

625
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,868
This is just sad.
Honestly.

626
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,088
Bad day?

627
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,384
I don't even know.

628
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,512
Anyway.

629
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,514
It's better now.

630
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,359
Tell them you're busy.

631
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,445
Okay?

632
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,998
Hello?

633
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:55,691
Hello, mom.
Mom, slow down. I can't--

634
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,860
Mom...
Mom, what is--?

635
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,571
No!
No, no!

636
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,341
God, no!

637
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,391
What happened?

638
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,584
Tomás!
They killed him!

639
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,524
No! No!

640
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,527
No!

641
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,150

You're 42 minutes late.

Hello.

660
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,563
Jose, it's me.

661
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,857
Look

662
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,927
I hope you're not waiting
for an apology

663
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,737
because I did not rat you out.

664
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,449
On the contrary

665
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,725
I was looking out
for your best interests,
as well as my own.

666

I stand by my decision
100 percent.

So...

668
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,027
Well, at least
I hope we can agree

669

Honey,
we wanted to tell you

696

that your dad and I are thinking
of starting a business together.

697
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,487
Really?
Yes.

698
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,048
A car wash.

699
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,633
Like the place you used to work?

700
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,911
- Exactly.
- Yes.

701
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,556
I've got to go.

702
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,183
Can I borrow your car?

Yes, yes.

704
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,771
See how useful is having a car?

705
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,690
Please, I'm really sorry.

706
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,181
Get lost!
