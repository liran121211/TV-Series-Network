1
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,304
Methamphetamines are an
increasing tendency in our country,

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,181
but we can eliminate it.

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:18,060
And the theft of lab
equipment from your school

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,688
made the national
Police alarms go off,

5
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,858
and is also receiving
our highest attention.

6
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,445
This guy you took in was the
one who stole the gear, right?

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,655
Our guess is it wasn't him.

8
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,741
That's why we're
questioning all the people

9
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,493
who have access to
the material storage.

10
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,789
Could it have been
someone external?

11
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:42,794
Maybe while kids
were having class?

12
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,713
Well, ma'am, at this point we
don't have a precise time or date.

13
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,673
But we're investigating.

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,094
Anyway, we think this is
not an outsider of the school.

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,222
What? So it was
someone who had the key?

16
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,224
Someone close to the school?

17
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,437
We're investigating that at this moment,
so I'm unable to answer.

18
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,690
No, no, no. Wait,
because you always have the same speech,

19
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,334
and then it turns
out you have nothing.

20
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:10,279
Look, what I think we need here

21
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,617
are drug-sniffing dogs.

22
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,286
I raise dogs like
that. If you want,

23
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,874
I can sell you a couple at a
good price because it's this school.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,418
And we should
get metal detectors,

25
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,879
like schools have in the US.

26
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,841
Yes, I agree with that.

27
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,510
What we need
here is a firm policy.

28
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:38,057
Please, let's not wait for our
kids to end up smoking crack.

29
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,601
God, they're our children!

30
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,230
Wait, wait, wait.

31
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,693
Do you at least know
what kind of equipment

32
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,904
was taken from the lab,
or you don't you?

33
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,825
There's someone here who
can enlighten us on that matter.

34
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,201
Walter.

35
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,579
Walter!

36
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,665
Yes?

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,543
Professor Walter Blanco is
chair of the science department.

38
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:09,839
And although he is currently on medical
leave he kindly accepted to be here.

39
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,383
Which I appreciate deeply.

40
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,683
Walter, could you please tell us
about the equipment that was taken?

41
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,061
Yes, of course.

42
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,311
Here's the inventory list.

43
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,107
Ten test tubes, one Erlenmeyer,

44
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,485
one 5,000-milliliter
round bottom boiling flask,

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,113
one 800-milliliter
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask.

46
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,167
Careful, careful, careful!

47
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,128
- I'm sorry.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,886
What was that?

49
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,807
Why was that so good?

50
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,267
Because it's illegal.

51
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,710
I think this house is
an excellent investment.

52
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,297
If you wish,
the agency can help you manage a loan,

53
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,633
and if you make up your mind,
let me know.

54
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,011
Just give me a call as soon as you're sure,
alright?

55
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,721
- Okay, thank you so much.
- Take care.

56
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,126
- See you later.
- See you later.

57
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,577
Do you have an
appointment to see the house?

58
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,603
There's nobody
else on the schedule.

59
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,149
No, I'm here to see the owner.

60
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:56,403
He's in the recreational vehicle
parked just around the corner.

61
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,905
Thanks.

62
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,332
What's up, professor?

63
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,009
What's with this shack?

64
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,844
So the buyers don't run away.

65
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,430
You're selling the house?

66
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,723
Right.

67
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,392
You know, it happens.

68
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,690
How do you feel?

69
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,650
I'll live.

70
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,070
- It still hurts when I breathe.
- Right.

71
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,698
What about you? Got a new wig there,
I see.

72
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,909
No,
just for better air circulation.

73
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,911
Tripa told me

74
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,757
you went to the hospital
while I was asleep.

75
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,044
You wanted Tuco. Are
you planning on visiting him?

76
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,962
I also wanted to know
how you were doing.

77
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,506
Right, aha.

78
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,719
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

79
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,097
No, I did go see him actually.

80
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:08,100
Bullshit. Tell me what happened.

81
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,896
There's your money.

82
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,153
Tuco gave you this?

83
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,073
He had it all here,
the 35 grand in cash.

84
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:28,287
There's your half, plus a bonus.

85
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,456
Are you actually telling
me Tuco gave you this?

86
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,251
I can't believe this.
How did you do it?

87
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,460
We made a deal. We're
doing business with him.

88
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,463
A deal? What do you mean a deal,
professor?

89
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,909
Why would you make a deal
with that scumbag? That's insane!

90
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,052
José, it's good for us.

91
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,654
I think that we can
do business together.

92
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,765
No way,
man! That man's a lunatic, a beast!

93
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,269
Wait a second. Now just
imagine making that every week.

94
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,438
Two pounds a week.
35 grand for each one.

95
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,315
That's more than 17
grand for each of us!

96
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,234
- Two pounds?
- Yes!

97
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,695
You know what that dude could do
to us if we don't make that delivery?

98
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,488
Well,
we just have to get organized

99
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:08,452
and squeeze a bit
our working hours.

100
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,513
What about pseudo,
man? How are we gonna get that?

101
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,332
The drug stores haven't sold that for ages,
man!

102
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,666
So we get it elsewhere!

103
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,543
I did that already!

104
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,522
I had to get a guy almost up to
Venezuela. And it's running dry there too.

105
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,801
And I got to half a pound maybe.

106
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,387
- Didn't you know that?
- No.

107
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,307
How can you know when
you don't ask me squat?

108
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,850
I'd have told you
if you'd asked me.

109
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,023
<i>Well, here we are again.</i>

110
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,608
Yes, sir.

111
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,194
Cielo,
your pregnancy is looking great!

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,613
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

113
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,283
- So how's it going?
- Great.

114
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,702
It's great other than waddling to
the bathroom every five minutes.

115
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,705
Well,
we're having the baby shower soon,

116
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,875
and she'll be the
queen of the night.

117
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,129
Walter,
I see you've committed to the hair loss.

118
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,382
Yes. Well,
one more thing not to worry about.

119
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,092
That's true!

120
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,427
And how are you feeling

121
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,763
Good, pretty good.

122
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,849
Much better than I imagined.

123
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,894
His color is better. You know,
his energy.

124
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,230
He's even got the energy to...

125
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,651
That's got to be a good sign.

126
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,404
Of course!

127
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,116
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

128
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,869
Realistically, it may just mean

129
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:35,080
that we've got the
anti-emetics tuned right.

130
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,791
We'll have this chemo
result after it's finished

131
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,293
and we look at a new PET scan.

132
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,671
I was thinking.

133
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,259
Isn't there anything
else we could be doing?

134
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:51,638
Maybe alternative
medicine. What do you think?

135
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,849
As long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

136
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,354
anything that helps my patient
have a better comfort, is fine by me.

137
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,150
But let's be clear in that we
depend on what we're doing here.

138
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:07,529
So it doesn't make
any real difference?

139
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,991
It's important that we
manage our expectations.

140
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,326
Alright?

141
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,898
What?

142
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,400
Nothing, man.

143
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,573
- What's with this place?
- What about it?

144
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,201
Don't you like the
spot I chose to meet?

145
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,538
Dude you sure saw a
lot of movies in your life.

146
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,416
What's wrong with it?

147
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,211
It's private, just as we need.

148
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,881
This is the kind of place where
Americans think crossovers are made.

149
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,093
Like when in Bogota people get
dressed with a poncho and hat.

150
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,511
That's exactly it.

151
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,598
So where do you transact your
drug business? Enlighten me.

152
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,435
How about a cafeteria?

153
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,312
Nice and public.
Everyone in their thing.

154
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,106
And you can eat
something along the way.

155
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,650
And since it's public,
psychos like Tuco

156
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,237
think twice before
shooting anybody.

157
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,910
Here they come.

158
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,579
I'm getting a stomach ache and all,
dude.

159
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,123
José.

160
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,625
I absolutely
understand you're afraid.

161
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,962
You don't have to be here,
so you can leave if you want.

162
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:54,094
But I'm not a coward. I'm fine.

163
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,264
I'm fine.

164
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,940
The doctor... and Chespirito.

165
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,984
What's up?

166
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,157
Sorry about the other day,
It was pure affection.

167
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,911
So why here?

168
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,706
What,
they close the mall or something?

169
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,792
Or do you think we're
in a fucking movie?

170
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,714
Okay, okay.

171
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,342
Enough chatting.
Let's just get to it.

172
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,520
No, man! Come on, break it out.

173
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,738
This is barely
more than a pound.

174
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,657
We had some production problems.

175
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,285
I don't give a shit! This is
not what we agreed upon.

176
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,204
You said two pounds!

177
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,706
Two pounds, asshole!

178
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,833
Give me that...

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,301
This is what we agreed on

180
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:19,054
minus a fine for
wasting my time.

181
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,305
Let's go!

182
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,890
Tuco!

183
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,475
What?

184
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,727
You got something to say?

185
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,648
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

186
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,066
Thanks for nothing!

187
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,151
I want all of the money.

188
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,987
What?

189
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,324
Did you hear what I heard?

190
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,702
What did you say?

191
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,038
I said give me all the money.

192
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,208
You like this product,
you know it's prime quality.

193
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,253
Consider it a
capital investment.

194
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,214
An advance. And next week
I'll give you back what I owe you.

195
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,717
Okay.

196
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,762
Three daily,
I'll see you next week, then.

197
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,264
What?

198
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,517
It's the interest,
three percent every day.

199
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:06,726
Fine.

200
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,148
Okay...

201
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,445
Here's the money for
the two pounds this week.

202
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,614
The rest, plus interest,

203
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,283
when you deliver the
other four next week.

204
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,868
I hope, four pounds.

205
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,665
That's three pounds.
I just gave you one.

206
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,124
Four pounds!

207
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,460
Two pounds for next Friday!

208
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,545
That's what I said!

209
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,507
Tuco.

210
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,008
Can you handle six pounds?

211
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,691
Don't you get smart on me,
Heisenberg.

212
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,609
Owing me money,

213
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,027
that's not good.

214
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,155
Six pounds?

215
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,537
Let's go.

216
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,543
Professor.

217
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,672
What the hell did you just do?

218
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,466
Come on.

219
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,928
<i>Six pounds.</i>

220
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,598
Six pounds, man!

221
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:30,602
You couldn't get that much
even before they banned pseudo.

222
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,688
We're not going to
need pseudo ephedrine.

223
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,358
What do you mean
we're not using pseudo?

224
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,818
We're going to make
phenylacetone in a tube furnace,

225
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,072
then we're going to use reductive
amination to yield methamphetamine.

226
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,741
So no pseudo?

227
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,784
No pseudo.

228
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,245
My gosh,
professor. I knew you had a plan!

229
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,789
Long live the professor! Long live science,
man!

230
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,958
Here.

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,503
- What's this?
- A shopping list.

232
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,173
Getting some of those
items may be challenging.

233
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,176
One autotransformer.

234
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,679
200 ounces of hydrous methyl...

235
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,681
- Methylamine.
- Methylamine.

236
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,435
Two M&M tube furnaces.

237
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,103
Milliliters.

238
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,916
One 70-millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by.

239
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,443
So 40 grams thorium nitrate...

240
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,486
Thori...

241
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,280
- Thorium.
- Thorium.

242
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,032
I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

243
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,660
That's not even English.

244
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,663
You know what? Count
me out. I'm leaving town.

245
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,332
I'm moving to where Hare Krishnas is,
change my name.

246
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,334
- José! José!
- No...

247
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,755
Calm down, man. Come,
listen to me.

248
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,632
We're already involved in this.

249
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,804
From now on,
our life will change for good.

250
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,556
It's up to you the
kind of life you want.

251
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,101
This could be the most important
day of the rest of your life.

252
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,772
- What is it?
- What'll it be?

253
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,233
A life of restrictions
and lack of things?

254
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,193
Or do you chose to trust?

255
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,697
I don't know.

256
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,327
Here's everything we need.

257
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,413
And only you can
get them for us.

258
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,500
You're the man!

259
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,335
Trust yourself!

260
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,551
There, auntie.

261
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,307
You might be wondering who this
pretty lady is. I'm your aunt María.

262
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,477
And after you're born
I'll become your idol

263
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,456
because when you watch this 20 years
from now, I will look exactly the same.

264
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,691
- Auntie!
- Okay.

265
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,276
Welcome to your baby shower,
Esmeralda!

266
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,611
Esmeralda?

267
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,822
Yes, that'll be your name.

268
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,283
And the first one to know is
your big brother, Walter Junior.

269
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,869
Hey, little sister!

270
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,247
You're all tucked up in there!

271
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,710
Look,
your mommy is all round because of you.

272
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:04,297
Hey, honey, Esmeralda. Relax,
that's not your name, it's Valentina.

273
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,385
We chose that while taking
your aunt to the mental institution.

274
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,930
That's right,
we took her and now she's sedated here.

275
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,432
Daddy's coming! Dad!

276
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,518
Say something to Valentina.

277
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,873
Yes, say something! Something
really funny like those jokes you tell.

278
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,023
Speak like a coast guy!

279
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,358
Coast guy...

280
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,820
Hey, Valentina.

281
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,448
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

282
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,825
And...

283
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,411
I think about you all the time.

284
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,204
Aw! So cute!

285
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,125
Wherever you go,
whatever you do in life,

286
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,879
and wherever you go,

287
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,440
always know that you have a
family who loves you very, very much.

288
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,049
Yes, yes, that's right.

289
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,426
Cheers! Cheers.

290
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,928
To Esmeralda!

291
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,446
Cheers, honey. Valentina,
Valentina!

292
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,431
Valentina, cheers.

293
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,975
You're gorgeous!
Look at that beauty.

294
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,686
Hannah,
I really appreciate it. They're beautiful.

295
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,646
You're very welcome, darling.

296
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,481
Open this one.

297
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,150
- Alejandra's next.
- No, open this one, Cielo.

298
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,653
Well, alright.

299
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,113
Read the card.

300
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,991
From María and Henry, to...

301
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,743
Valentina!

302
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,494
Esmeralda's nicer.

303
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,790
Wow!

304
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,500
Wow. This is...

305
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,712
a...

306
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,422
brag?

307
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,299
It's a tiara. It's called tiara.

308
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,760
Tiara. So it's...?

309
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,887
It's white gold,
with zircon settings.

310
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,639
Wow, thank you!

311
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,098
Wow...

312
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,184
María,
this must have cost a fortune.

313
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,687
You shouldn't have.

314
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,815
Why? You don't like it?

315
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,485
No, I do! I love it! It's so...

316
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,653
sparkly.

317
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,114
Yes.

318
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,365
Thank you, thank you.

319
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,034
Mine now, mine.

320
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,245
No, come, let's not lose it.

321
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,289
Come, I have a surprise.

322
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:11,257
I don't know what's going on with me,
but...

323
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,802
I just can't stand so
much women talk.

324
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,930
Hey, come, I'll show you.

325
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,309
Look at this beauty.

326
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,146
Look.

327
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,356
Look, buddy.

328
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,237
You can drink this, can you?

329
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,448
Whiskey? Yes.

330
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,575
Especially if it's delicious.

331
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,369
Wow!

332
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,706
Where did you get this?
You don't get this in Colombia.

333
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,709
A friend of mine, customs agent,

334
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:50,254
did a raid and found this. He owed me,
so he gave it to me.

335
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,840
Nice!

336
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,634
Well, we should make a
toast. To the illegal drink!

337
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,639
Right.

338
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,142
They say the forbidden
fruit is the tastiest one.

339
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,064
In fact, it's hard to set lines.

340
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,607
On what?

341
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,739
Well, what's legal, what's illegal,
what's allowed or not.

342
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,491
Especially, in things like this.

343
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:23,121
Could you elaborate on that statement,
professor?

344
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,915
This whiskey is wonderful.

345
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,044
Henry,
if we were in the States now,

346
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,837
in prohibition times...

347
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,173
No, no need to go that far.

348
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,467
Saudi Arabia, today...

349
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,678
This is time in jail.

350
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,347
It's an absolute crime.

351
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,558
But no, we're in Colombia.

352
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,019
Not in Colombia, now.

353
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,187
Well, maybe yes,
but just a little bit.

354
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,274
You know what I mean?

355
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,820
I mean there are things
that go from being illegal

356
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,948
to legal, all of a sudden.

357
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,743
Who knows what will
be legal in the future?

358
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,663
What would you like to be legal?

359
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,999
Pot?

360
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,296
Yes. Pot.

361
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,882
I don't know,
maybe some other stuff.

362
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,968
What? Cocaine? Heroin?

363
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,473
No, I guess I'm just saying

364
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:27,518
drug restrictions are arbitrary.

365
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,146
Yes.

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,981
And no.

367
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:36,987
I think there's stuff that
should never be legal.

368
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,532
Like what?

369
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,285
Methamphetamines.

370
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,705
Did you know methamphetamines
were legal in the US?

371
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,666
They sold it in drugstores.

372
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,459
Just like cocaine before that.

373
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,338
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one. No party anymore.

374
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,138
How about another one?

375
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,017
Why not?

376
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,688
That baby shower,
wasn't bad at all, was it?

377
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,064
Hum...

378
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,626
This will be the baby with
more T-shirts on the block.

379
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,360
Well, at least the first month.

380
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,155
- And the only one with a tiara.
- A what?

381
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,074
A tiara, this crown,

382
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,035
- made of gems, white gold.

383
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,453
- That María gave her.
- Right.

384
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,622
She's nuts! How
could she even think

385
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,126
of getting one of those
things to a newborn?

386
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,086
- It must be trendy.
- No.

387
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,629
I know where they sell them.

388
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,631
I've been to the jewelry store.

389
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,552
I mean,
that thing must have cost around 500 bucks.

390
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,387
What?

391
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,806
I'm not lying. I think
I'm going to return it.

392
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,643
You sure? She's bound to
find out and get really mad.

393
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,354
Well, maybe I can explain to her

394
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,482
that we need a Diaper Genie...

395
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,943
I think diapers are more
important than a tiara.

396
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,987
Honey...

397
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,740
Talking about something else,
remember what you said

398
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,576
about alternative
medicine earlier today?

399
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,619
Yes, I do.

400
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,431
Don't worry. I'm not going to mention
that anymore after seeing your faces.

401
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,708
No, on the contrary.

402
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,168
Look.

403
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:19,047
Look at this page I found.
It's a place near Bogota.

404
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:23,176
They do these treatments
with Amazonian plants.

405
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,887
Some kind of vaporizations.

406
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,557
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

407
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,852
Do you want to go?

408
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,438
Well, why not?

409
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,316
I'd like to try it.

410
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,154
Dr. It's All Science I
Don't Believe In Anything?

411
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,408
Well, it's not that costly.

412
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,078
And it doesn't
take long. Maybe...

413
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,955
I could leave on Friday

414
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,540
and come back late on Sunday.

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,252
How about it?

416
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,215
I think it's great to
have an open mind.

417
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,716
<i>An alternative center</i>

418
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,884
to inhale herb vapor?

419
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:08,096
Yes. That's exactly
what I told her.

420
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,556
Dude,
I inhaled herb vapor this morning.

421
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,391
I'll help you with that.

422
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,977
Okay, come help me here.

423
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,104
Hydrogen.
Electrolytically produced.

424
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,688
Alright!

425
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,108
Yes, and all this too.

426
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,488
70-milliliter furnace? Congratulations,
good job!

427
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:29,033
Okay. I got nearly
everything you asked me.

428
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,660
Right, but it wasn't easy.

429
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,203
Or cheap.

430
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,914
I hadn't spent so much
even in the wildest party.

431
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,916
Right, I can imagine.

432
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,918
Where's the methylamine?

433
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,966
Well,
that's why I said I got almost everything.

434
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,052
That's where I ran
into some trouble.

435
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,513
It's hard to buy it. They
got it locked down tight.

436
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,889
Like it were gold or something.

437
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,516
So?

438
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,936
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

439
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,063
But they want 25 grand.

440
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,690
Well, okay.

441
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,066
No, not okay.

442
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,901
We don't have 25 grand.

443
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,070
I already spent almost
the whole wad on this.

444
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,078
So did they say where they
would be stealing it from?

445
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,290
- I believe down South.
- Aha.

446
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,377
But they got guards and security cameras,
big ass steel doors.

447
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,424
What's this?

448
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,758
What?

449
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,968
This.

450
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,847
That's a toy my grandma
used to hide here.

451
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,146
I'm thinking we can steal
the methylamine ourselves.

452
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,274
But how?

453
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,902
With this.

454
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,579
So what's this
stuff called again?

455
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,747
Thermite.

456
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,657
And that will cut through a lock? Because
this is supposed to be one big ass lock.

457
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,718
Do you not trust chemistry?

458
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,053
No.

459
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,722
Let me tell you a story, Jose.

460
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,476
In World War II, the Germans

461
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,853
had the biggest artillery
piece in the world.

462
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,646
It was called the "Gustav".

463
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:28,403
It was capable of
firing a 7-ton shell

464
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,282
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

465
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,577
It was a nightmare
for the Allies.

466
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,026
I mean, you could drop bombs on it every
day for a month without ever disabling it.

467
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:50,591
But you drop a commando,
one man, with just a bag of this

468
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,428
and he could melt
right through a wall,

469
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,223
maybe six inches
thick of pure iron.

470
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,899
Hey! What's with you, man?

471
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:13,614
I think it will cut through
any lock we're likely to find.

472
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,368
You'd like to return this?

473
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,744
Yes.

474
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,413
It's very nice, but...

475
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,998
it's not my style

476
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,791
or the baby's.

477
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,460
It is from the store, isn't it?

478
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,420
Yes, of course.

479
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,340
It's from this store. Do you
happen to have a receipt?

480
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,092
No, it was a gift.

481
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,594
A gift, I see.

482
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,221
Javier, could you do me a favor?

483
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,559
I'd like you to watch this
lady while I phone the police.

484
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,685
Excuse me?

485
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:47,190
You don't have the ticket
because this item was stolen.

486
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,692
No! No, no,
no. That's impossible.

487
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,529
It's possible. Come with us.

488
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,946
No, just a minute.

489
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,490
You have no evidence.

490
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,575
Come on. Sir, please.

491
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,952
Yes, thank you.

492
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,705
And please bring a patrol
unit. I intend to press charges.

493
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,209
Thank you, we'll wait here.

494
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,711
Did you not get this
is a misunderstanding?

495
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,672
I've never stolen
anything in my life!

496
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,176
Do you think I'd return it if
I'd stolen it? I'm not that dumb!

497
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,346
Believe me,
it was a gift for my baby shower!

498
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,056
So who gave it to you, then?

499
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,852
I don't think I have
to tell you that.

500
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,063
You don't have
to tell me anything.

501
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,772
You can talk to the police.

502
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,774
And I can tell them
that there was a woman

503
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,361
who walked right
out the door with it.

504
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,281
Then I can tell the reporters

505
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,618
that without evidence, you illegally
detained an innocent pregnant woman.

506
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,162
And that I'm not getting
enough air back here,

507
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,873
so my baby's health is
surely being compromised.

508
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,958
This is my office.

509
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,002
I don't think I can breathe.

510
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,630
I really can't breathe.
And I'm being held hostage!

511
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,257
I'm being held hostage!

512
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,593
I'm getting sick
and don't feel well.

513
00:27:56,717 --> 00:28:00,054
You know what?

514
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,891
I think my baby
will be born here!

515
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,519
And it'll be premature
because of you!

516
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,521
I'm getting
contractions! I mean it!

517
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,043
My baby will be born here,
and it'll be premature thanks to you!

518
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,365
My water broke! I swear my water
broke! Call an ambulance, damn it!

519
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,701
Call an ambulance,
my baby will be born here!

520
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,960
<i>Voicemail</i>

521
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,712
<i>Leave your message
after the tone.</i>

522
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:38,384
María, I'm walking out of the
store where you got the tiara.

523
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,718
I think we should talk.

524
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:03,909
Where's the guard?

525
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,744
I don't know, man!

526
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,206
- You think he already passed?
- I don't know.

527
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,626
How many, one or more?

528
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,336
I was told it was only one.

529
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,676
Put this on.

530
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,470
Really? There weren't anymore.

531
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,305
Wasn't there amen's one?

532
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,724
Can we not discuss
this? Just put it on!

533
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,979
Here.

534
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,664
- Wait, this doesn't look right.
- Here!

535
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,485
Is this really a good idea?

536
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,944
Do you have any other?

537
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,198
What if we get the pseudo?

538
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,783
Well, well. Where can we get it?

539
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,205
Come on!

540
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:54,585
Sshhhh...

541
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,129
There it is.

542
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,797
Straight. One, two...

543
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:06,930
Okay, there.

544
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,641
Come on, man.

545
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,184
Wait, we'll put this.

546
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,161
Why did he come
back? I have no idea.

547
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,423
<i>Pavón, how's the night shift?</i>

548
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,634
Okay, Gómez, all nice and quiet.

549
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,428
<i>I'll be waiting on post eight.</i>

550
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,155
Give me five minutes
so I can go to the toilet.

551
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,599
<i>Okay, but light a match!</i>

552
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,077
What do we do?

553
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,590
What are you doing?

554
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:24,967
Come on.

555
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,064
Hey, what's going on?

556
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,066
<i>Hey, Gómez,
what's going on out there?</i>

557
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,360
<i>Pavón,
how much longer do I have to wait for you?</i>

558
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,530
What's going on? Hey, hey!

559
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,661
Help! Get me out of here!

560
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,876
There.

561
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,961
<i>You're being caught on tape!</i>

562
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,190
<i>Pavón, come in now,
it's my turn for the shift.</i>

563
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,467
Gómez!

564
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,968
Take two straps.

565
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,182
Here, on the sides.

566
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,190
Will that be loud?

567
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,859
Easy,
in five minutes you'll see.

568
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,738
Step back.

569
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:42,294
Put your gloves on!

570
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,512
Flashlight.

571
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,560
There.

572
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,943
There.

573
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,277
Where are the gallons?

574
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,946
Here they are.

575
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:13,075
No,
you idiot! Those are 55-liter cans!

576
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,326
Light up!

577
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,789
Here, this one. Come on,
this one!

578
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,667
Come on!

579
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,861
Let's go. One, two...

580
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,080
There's a 3-27 in area four!

581
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,542
I think I got a hernia!

582
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,128
Move it! <i>You're
committing a serious crime,</i>

583
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,965
<i>and there are security cameras!</i>

584
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,886
<i>Our monitoring center is
connected to the National Police!</i>

585
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,345
<i>Pavón, man.</i>

586
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,740
Don't push it so much,
you'll flood it.

587
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,913
Don't push it so much,
you'll flood it!

588
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:42,247
Just let me, okay?

589
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,582
Let me do it.

590
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,293
Fine, genius. What'll you do?

591
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,462
You sure are stubborn.

592
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,133
Come on.

593
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,475
There! How about it? When you know,
you know.

594
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,393
You should learn
how to handle this.

595
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,898
Shit. What happened?

596
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,193
When you know,
you know. Lesson learned.

597
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,829
No, man. This time it's screwed.

598
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,956
Whatever happens,
we have to cook.

599
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,792
Right, but we can get caught. We
can't be at my neighbors' window.

600
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,836
No, of course not.

601
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,840
Then what?

602
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:51,441
With the amount of methylamine
that we got we can make eight pounds...

603
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,528
I don't know, maybe for...

604
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,322
enough time for the
foreseeable future.

605
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,330
How long is that going
to be in your case?

606
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:09,710
I mean in your situation.
How much cash do you need?

607
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,297
Much more.

608
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,386
<i>Well, it's quite clear that
the house needs repairing,</i>

609
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,097
<i>but I must also say it has...</i>

610
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,681
Shit, there are people up there!

611
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,429
Darn it! The people who
were going to sell the house!

612
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,645
I completely forgot
about it! What do we do?

613
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:34,443
Please consider this. It's a very
large and comfortable house.

614
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,570
Lots of space, as you can see.

615
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,281
Let's step into the dining room,
please.

616
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,011
- Ssshhh...
- Ssshhh...

617
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,680
<i>You can think about it.</i>

618
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,683
<i>And call me tomorrow.</i>

619
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,519
<i>No problem. Or I
can call you back.</i>

620
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,855
How could you forget they
were showing the house?

621
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,231
But you also--

622
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,378
But you also knew they
were showing the house today!

623
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,862
- Me?
- Yes, you!

624
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,148
I could have remembered.
I'm not the only one to blame.

625
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,117
Go up there and get rid of them!

626
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,494
No!

627
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,294
Listen,
maybe they can leave on their own.

628
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,420
Now!

629
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,465
What a man!

630
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,143
You know you can't
duck me forever.

631
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,229
Cielo, hi. What,
you're following me?

632
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:55,524
No, but you're running away.

633
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:59,111
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way. I called you.

634
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,821
I didn't hear you.

635
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:04,074
I didn't sneak. I was
just going to lunch.

636
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,703
María, you know what? I have
never been so humiliated in my life.

637
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:11,373
They accused me of
shoplifting the diadem.

638
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,209
The tiara.

639
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,710
What were you doing over there?

640
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,421
I was going to return it.

641
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,608
Why would you return it?
Didn't you say you liked it?

642
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,426
Okay,
enough already. That's not my point.

643
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,055
What's wrong with you? Why
would you do such a thing?

644
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,810
What are you talking about?

645
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,397
I'm saying I have no idea
what you're talking about.

646
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,738
María.

647
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:45,365
María, forgive me,
but this is serious.

648
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,327
My God,
we're talking about theft!

649
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,331
You're not going to admit this,
are you?

650
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,210
I can't really
admit to something

651
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,004
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

652
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,758
Miss, how much is this?

653
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,285
Hey.

654
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,411
Hey.

655
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,163
- How was it?
- Thanks.

656
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,332
Good, good,
an interesting experience.

657
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,750
- Really?
- Yes.

658
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,587
What's that smell?

659
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:48,011
That must be the...

660
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:52,975
Like a sacred herbal mix
these shamans make. Awful.

661
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,899
So are you okay?

662
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,196
No, not really.

663
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:08,406
What happened?

664
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,662
You know that diadem,
that tiara that María gave us?

665
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,872
Yes.

666
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,415
She stole it.

667
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,293
What? María?

668
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:25,423
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

669
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,052
My God!

670
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,637
Yes.

671
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,555
Well,
it'll be okay. I managed to get out.

672
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:38,937
But the worst part
is I confronted María,

673
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,274
and she refuses to admit it.

674
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,193
I don't know what to do.

675
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:52,951
Well. People sometimes
do things for their families.

676
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,874
People sometimes do that
kind of thing for their families?

677
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,667
No.

678
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,546
Those herbs damaged your brain
because nothing justifies crimes.

679
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,765
What would you do if it were me?

680
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,184
What do you mean?

681
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:24,691
If it were me,
what would you do?

682
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,318
Would you report me?

683
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,075
You don't want to find out.

684
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,084
Do you want something to eat?

685
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,127
- Thanks.
- I do, I'm hungry.

686
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,475
Fuck me!

687
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,269
Why's this one blue?

688
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:03,439
We used a different ingredient,
but it is every bit as pure.

689
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,983
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

690
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,990
My God, what a hit!

691
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,658
I want more of this!

692
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:19,204
Blue, white, pink,
yellow... Any way you want it.

693
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:27,087
Okay, how much does it weigh?

694
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,338
It's all there.

695
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,387
Money will start raining!

696
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,640
Thanks.

697
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,601
Just remember who
you're working for!

698
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,562
What did you say?

699
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,900
I'm just saying they got
to know who's boss, Tuco.

700
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,069
Like they don't
already know that?

701
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,447
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

702
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,615
That they know I rule
and that they're mine?

703
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,409
No, no. I'm just saying...

704
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,661
Wait, let me get this straight.

705
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,666
So you're not saying that they're
stupid. Are you saying that I'm stupid?

706
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,642
Because I don't make
myself clear with Colombians?

707
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,875
No, no, Tuco...

708
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,877
You're just speaking for me,
fucker?

709
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,981
Like I ain't got the damn
sense to speak for myself!

710
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,298
Tuco!

711
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,049
Why don't we all just relax?

712
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,803
Heisenberg says relax.

713
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,388
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

714
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,849
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

715
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,831
Learn how to shut the fuck up,
motherfucker.

716
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:48,960
Fighting.

717
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,547
Champion.

718
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,755
Gonzo.

719
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,970
Give me that.

720
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,722
Bring him!

721
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,600
See you on Friday, Heisenberg!
