1
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,420
Walter.

2
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,909
Walter, I'm not leaving
until you open the door.

3
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,671
I hear your cell phone,
Walter. Open the door!

4
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,592
This is ridiculous.
He seems silly.

5
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,819
At last!

6
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,596
I've called you like 20 times.
I've left you messages.

7
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,115
Yes, so?

8
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,408
So?

9
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,437
We need to talk
about the car wash.

10
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,815
This isn't a good time.
Let's talk later.

11
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,232
- Agree?
- No. We're talking now.

12
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,526
- No, if--
- Let me in.

13
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,128
What happened to you?

14
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:59,198
Nothing. I hit myself.
Everything's okay.

15
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,518
Tell me exactly what happened.

16
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,648
This is very complicated.

17
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:19,051
I don't want
to discuss it with you.

18
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,573
Are you in danger?

19
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,473
Please, tell me the truth.

20
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,451
Look at me in the eye.

21
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,520
Are you in danger?
I need to know.

22
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,815
No, no, no.
I have plenty of things
to think of.

23
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,776
I can't think
about the car wash now.

24
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,779
Do you understand that?
That's it.

25
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,365
- Let's call the police.
- What?

26
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,827
Yes, we can tell them
that you are a drug dealer,

27
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,745
but you fear for your life
and your family.

28
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,388
They can help us.

29
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,875
- Stop, stop. Ho--
- You said it.

30
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,128
- We're in danger.
- No, Cielo, wait.

31
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,189
Wait! When did I say "danger"?

32
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,094
Did I mention
the word "danger"?
Never. I said "complicated."

33
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,404
"Complicated."

34
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,517
And all of a sudden,
you imagine a full story.
I don't understand it.

35
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,645
What's this?
Is this part of the movie?
Did I make it up?

36
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,024
- What's that?
- Cielo, Cielo...

37
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,568
- Tell me. Tell me what--
- No, no. You're being paranoid.

38
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,074
- Do you really think I am?
- Yes, completely.

39
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,704
I don't answer your messages
for two days. Two.

40
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,999
I tell you
that I have a little incident,
and, all of a sudden,

41
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,794
you tell me to call the cops.
What is it about?

42
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,729
Then, tell me.

43
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,815
What the "incident" was?

44
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,846
- Tell me!
- I had an argument with a man.

45
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,765
He's a coworker.
That's it.

46
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,908
Sure.

47
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,204
Go on. Tell me.

48
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,708
We were at a cafeteria.

49
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,403
We were talking
about business.

50
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,797
Conversation got heated.

51
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,285
And I don't know why,
but he went out of control.

52
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,971
And he hit me.

53
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,432
He hit me with his fist.

54
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,961
I didn't even answer
because he is an old man.

55
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,303
An old man hit you with his fist
in a cafeteria?

56
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,863
Actually, he isn't an old man.

57
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,285
Are you okay?

58
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,914
Yes.

59
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,085
Yes, in fact...

60
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,196
I think it's good
we have talked

61
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,091
and things got to that point

62
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,910
because it was
some kind of catharsis.

63
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,956
Our relationship
is less tense now.

64
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,960
It was a good thing.
Now we know
we have to respect each other.

65
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,520
There's mutual respect.

66
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,567
So? What do you think?

67
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,013
I think it's beautiful.
It's wonderful and big.

68
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,931
It's very bright.
I love it.

69
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,409
It has good natural light.

70
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,561
That's why every room
seems so big.

71
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,524
It was rude of me.
I didn't offer you anything.
Do you want a cup of coffee?

72
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,859
A glass of water
would be fine.

73
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,902
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

74
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,345
It's beautiful.

75
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,462
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
I don't remember your name.

76
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,440
Bárbara Cáceres.

77
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,385
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Bárbara.
I'm Manuela Saldarriaga.

78
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,387
- Nice to meet you.
- As you may notice

79
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:54,933
the house has three rooms,
three bathrooms,
two parking spaces, a warehouse.

80
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,163
At the back there's a room

81
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,024
you may use
as office or guesthouse.

82
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,986
The bedrooms
had wood floors.

83
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,655
The floors
of this area

84
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,715
is Indian green marble.

85
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,384
Yes, it's beautiful.

86
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,222
Are you married?

87
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,516
I separated recently.

88
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,918
I'm so sorry.
Do you have kids?

89
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,380
Yes, I have one.
In May he turned four.
He's Gemini.

90
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,524
He'll be very happy here.

91
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,801
He'll run around the house
and the beautiful backyard.

92
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,179
The architect
who built this house

93
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,448
had a very sophisticated taste.

94
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:38,352
There're very good kindergarten
in the neighborhood.

95
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,704
at would solve you a problem.

96
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,191
My idea
is that Mateo studies at home.

97
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,110
Really?
It's very
interesting.

98
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,989
For me is very important
that he gets full attention.

99
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:55,786
Obviously,
socialization is also important.

100
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,538
- The social part matters.
-Yes.

101
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,725
He took an IQ test.

102
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,129
It's an intelligence test.
It was high.

103
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,466
My priority
is to find a balance

104
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,968
between his left hemisphere
and his right one.

105
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,529
Yes, yes.

106
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,056
That room you mentioned
can be turned into a bathroom?

107
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,741
I work with pottery

108
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,536
I'll need water.

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,398
Sure. We just need
to check on the pipes
in the drawings.

110
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,625
But everything can be solved.

111
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,001
Of course.

112
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,237
- I love it.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

113
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,214
The space is perfect.

114
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,266
I'm home!

115
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,980
My love!

116
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,443
Henry!

117
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,198
Hello.

118
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,700
I had to go to three drugstores

119
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,827
to find your moisturizer.

120
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,038
But I finally got it.

121
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,649
I bought your chips.
Henry.

122
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,699
Look what I found.
Your favorite beer
half it's price.

123
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,038
And... I couldn't resist
myself.

124
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,457
Your favorite magazine.
Last edition.

125
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,435
María, did you buy potato chips?

126
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,938
I wanted sweet plantain chips.

127
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,718
How do I have to tell you
that I want
sweet plantain chips?

128
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:39,764
Do I have to make a drawing
or build a model?

129
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,866
What do you need? Tell me.

130
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,411
Do you know what I need?

131
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,746
That you don't be so rude.

132
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,418
María, they aren't the same.

133
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,614
Potato chips.
Plantain chips.

134
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,008
Okay. I understood.

135
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,202
- Where're you going?
To change it.

136
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,722
You're welcome, right?

137
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,141
María, I already have this.

138
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,518
María!

139
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,659
This is unacceptable.

140
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,769
- What?
- That.

141
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,707
There.

142
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,459
Look at this.

143
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,989
You always thought
this place could be bugged.

144
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,924
Now we know it.

145
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,620
This is different.
I don't like it.

146
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,497
It's a violation
of the work space.

147
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,599
If you say so.

148
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,271
Hey, do you want to go out?

149
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,482
And do what?

150
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,927
- Kart racing.
- Kart racing?

151
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,140
There's an indoor track
in Usaquén.
It's really nice.

152
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:08,687
Jose, thank you, but...
There's a meeting
I have to attend.

153
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,165
It's okay.

154
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,125
Next time we'll go.

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,712
Okay.

156
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,843
Are you okay?

157
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,875
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Is there anything I must know?

158
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,359
How's your bruise?

159
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,611
It's fine.

160
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,597
Is there anything
I must know?

161
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,955
For what it's worth

162
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,442
getting the shit
kicked out of you,

163
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,820
although you don't like it,
you get used to it.

164
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,757
Good luck.

165
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,220
This spoon thing is particular,
isn't it?

166
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,347
They belong
to the construction
company.

167
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,100
The owner say
they're for good luck.

168
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,103
In that case,
he should collect elephants.

169
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,898
According to feng shui,
elephant attract wealth.

170
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm saying it
because he's a businessman.

171
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,960
It's a good idea.

172
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,572
Will these apartments
have warehouses?

173
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,617
No, this building
doesn't have warehouses.

174
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:49,454
It's a shame.
My brother works
in the Peace Corps.

175
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,249
He goes on missions a lot,
and I keep him some stuff.

176
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,184
We have a room

177
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,212
that will be more helpful.
It's a big room.

178
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,216
You can keep things there.
It depends on the size,
of course.

179
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,260
- Sure.
- I can show you the leaflet.

180
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,221
Will these rooms
have enough light?

181
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,474
Many times they're dark,
walls get damp,
and things rot.

182
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,935
Precisely, that's a point
to our favor.

183
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,787
They have very good windows.

184
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,689
That's the reason
that they're more attractive
than warehouses.

185
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,357
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

186
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,118
Can you repeat your name,
please?

187
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,595
Carlota Blandón.

188
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:34,291
Then I said:
"My love, I love you,

189
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,253
but you're fifty years old.
We have to change our lifestyle.
You better quit."

190
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,257
I didn't think
he would listen to me.
But he did it. He quit.

191
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,884
I'm sure it was
a wonderful experience.

192
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,805
I mean, not everybody
can study a degree course
as important as that.

193
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,475
I don't know anybody
who works on that.

194
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,730
Yes. NASA was
like a second family to us.

195
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,442
But we wanted some stability.
We wanted to be
with the family again.

196
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,711
And we came back to Colombia.

197
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,155
He has a good pension,
and I...

198
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,198
I've been hand modeling
for a long time.

199
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,843
Yes. Listen.

200
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,636
Is these real copper?

201
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,346
Yes, I think so.

202
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,416
The best heat transfer medium.
Did you know?

203
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,018
No. Do you have any children?

204
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,772
No, I don't like children.

205
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,842
It's horrible that I say that,
isn't it?

206
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:29,137
No, everybody
has the right to decide
if they want children or not.

207
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,266
Are you sure
they don't sell this house.

208
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,535
No, I don't think so.

209
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,079
It's a shame. I love it.

210
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,983
I'll talk with my husband.
He may speak with the architect.

211
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,669
What I like is the space.

212
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,006
Beauty salon.

213
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,909
It's the ideal business
for money laundering.

214
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,371
It's high volume
cash-preferred business
with a discreet work force.

215
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,916
Mireya, for example,
is an expert
in pretending to know nothing.

216
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,127
And she would help
to keep the other girls
on the right path.

217
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,129
- Listen.
- Would you like
something to drink?

218
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,006
- Coffee, please.
- And you?

219
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,342
- Yes, coffee.
- Saúl, call me Saúl.

220
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,928
We already know each other,
Cielito.

221
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:15,183
For the lady of the house.
Attention, ceremony, drums.

222
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,078
Cleansing, exfoliation,

223
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,649
manicure for life
and for free.

224
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,317
Go ahead, pinch yourself.
It's true.

225
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,903
- No. No. No.
- Isn't it exciting?

226
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:29,072
We aren't buying
a beauty salon or a nail salon.

227
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,175
No. We'll buy the car wash.

228
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,579
I'm sorry.
Am I missing something here?

229
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,708
I don't know.
I thought
you've already tried that.

230
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,893
I mean, Walter told me.

231
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,646
You talked with that man,

232
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,341
Ramiro Clavijo,
and he did nothing,

233
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,887
but mistreating you mercilessly,
and asked
for a big amount of money.

234
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,434
- Is it true?
- Yes, and then he doubled it.

235
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,854
That's business!
It's the business of the year!

236
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,081
Honey, don't worry, you failed.

237
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:08,528
It doesn't matter. Why?

238
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,750
It happens to all sometime.

239
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,628
Because you called me.

240
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,114
You called me.
That means you're intelligent.

241
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:15,076
Don't worry, relax.
Let a professional take over.

242
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,203
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.

243
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,874
- Coming!
- No, no, no. Calm down.

244
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,375
- It's for me.
- Are you sure?

245
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,169
What
happened?

246
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,380
- I'm in an important meeting.
- I have to go.

247
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,815
Why didn't you say it before?

248
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,804
I'm sorry,
may Estiwar use your bathroom?

249
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,572
Estiwar?

250
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,156
Yes, sure.

251
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,744
Where is it?

252
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,082
Straight ahead, on the left.

253
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:53,657
He won't take long.
He has a stomachache issue.

254
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,175
Where were we?

255
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,635
Professionalism.

256
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,289
Yes.
If he doesn't want to sell,
he won't sell.

257
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,125
Yes, but I don't accept that.
I don't accept he doesn't sell.

258
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,048
I think he needs
the right motivation.

259
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,425
- A cookie?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

260
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,928
Motivation.
Motivation, motivation...

261
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:20,058
Are we talking
about real motivation?
Let's agree on that.

262
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:24,813
I mean,
it's like making an offer
he can't reject.

263
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,957
No, no.

264
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:31,361
No. No, don't be so dramatic.
It's just...

265
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,588
Motivation!

266
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,257
An attitude adjustment.

267
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,368
That's great.
"Adjustment of..."
It's a nice phrase.

268
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:42,372
This woman is excellent.
Don't let her go.

269
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:46,584
Well, motivation.
I think of...
I know! An audit!

270
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,252
There's nothing
more motivational than that.

271
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,271
I know a girl in Taxes.

272
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,716
In ten minutes with a client,
and his accountant books,

273
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,843
she causes to rain toads
and frogs.

274
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,177
- Batrachians, anuran.
- No, no, no.

275
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,888
- Why not?
- No, no.

276
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,473
What do you mean?
An audit?

277
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,184
We don't want
to draw attention.

278
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,269
Especially,
of the Tax Office.

279
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,146
- You're right.
- We'll have to deal with them.

280
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,774
Once we have the car wash,
we'll have them on our backs.

281
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,027
We don't want them on our backs.
You're right.

282
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:18,033
I know! A surprise visit
from the Labor Ministry.

283
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,577
It's obvious that dummy
mistreats his employees.

284
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,596
I'm sure they aren't registered,

285
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,457
he pays half the salary,
and makes them work double time.

286
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,377
Why do people accept that?
Out of need.

287
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,462
- No.
- It's the same than auditing.

288
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,815
And we don't want to involve

289
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,984
innocent people either.

290
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,595
Of course.
We'll need them
once the car wash is ours.

291
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,113
They'll work for us.

292
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,599
- You're right.
- Listen, Saúl...

293
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,978
There have to be
plenty of car wash in this city.

294
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,605
- Yes.
- Am I right?

295
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,541
Who said it has to be that one?

296
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,944
- I did.
- Why?

297
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,154
- Just because.
- Okay.

298
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,716
It's crystal clear now.

299
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,592
Listen.

300
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,703
I don't like that man,
Ramiro Clavijo

301
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,581
- Why?
- He was very rude with me.

302
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,307
He was very rude with you.

303
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,793
- With me?
- I don't like him.

304
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,753
What will we do?
I don't like him.

305
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,380
Cielito, nobody likes
passionate woman like you

306
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,941
more than me.

307
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,469
But I must tell you something,
and Walter

308
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,305
won't let me lie.
In this type of business

309
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,600
it isn't good
to take everything personally.

310
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,894
- With all my respect.
Saúl. Saúl.

311
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,913
Rude? How?

312
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,816
With me? What did he
say?

313
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,277
He said you weren't man enough
to face him.

314
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,946
- What? Did he say that?
- Yes.

315
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,240
That you sent me
because you weren't capable.

316
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,577
He's so miserable.
Did he say that?
How can he dare to say that?

317
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,205
I'm sorry. I'm your lawyer.
I have to state it in writing

318
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,458
that I don't think
it's a good idea.

319
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,336
We'll buy that car wash.
Period.

320
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,812
End of story.

321
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,300
Okay.
It's decided then.

322
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,527
We have to find the way

323
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,364
to buy that car wash.

324
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,185
Without violence,
protecting innocent people

325
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,645
as long as it doesn't cost
40,000 million pesos.

326
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,148
- Yes, okay.
- Sure.

327
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,236
Don't speak all at once.
One at the time.

328
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,548
More coffee?

329
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,436
Thanks.

330
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,980
There's no more paper.

331
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,152
Ups! Uff!

332
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,962
Look what I found.

333
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,578
The house
is absolutely gorgeous.
It's beautiful.

334
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,248
Thank you, Margarita.
You're very nice.

335
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,500
- It's European style, isn't it?
- Do you think so?

336
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,795
Yes.
I lived in London many years.

337
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,382
The architecture looks familiar.
It's so nice!

338
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,510
- Doris.
- Yes, madam.

339
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,239
Where in London?

340
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,699
Our son is living there.

341
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,994
We visit him often.

342
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,104
He's downtown,
but we couldn't--

343
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,939
Hi. I need to see
the lady of the house.

344
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,501
My husband is a drawer.

345
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,237
We had to go to Geneva,
United States, France.

346
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,507
The kids were in school then,

347
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,491
and my younger daughter
was diagnosed.

348
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,385
Endocarditis.

349
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,887
My God.

350
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,473
What's that?

351
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,875
Inflammation
of the heart valves.

352
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,643
Mrs. Amparito.

353
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,170
- Yes?
- They need you at the door.

354
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:07,382
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

355
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,113
And your daughter?

356
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,532
Excuse me?

357
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,534
How is she doing? The girl.

358
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,742
Hold on, madam. Wait.

359
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,203
I called the police.

360
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,730
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't okay.

361
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,649
I spoke with every project
and on sale house
in the neighborhood.
They all talked about you.

362
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,735
- We know you robbed us.
- Excuse me?

363
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,904
- Yes. You're a thief.
- What are you talking about?

364
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,531
- You're a thief!
- Be respectful!

365
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,243
How do you dare
to invent such a thing?
Are you insane?

366
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,011
Listen, do you know what?

367
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,497
If you don't want to be involved
in big trouble, leave me alone.

368
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,458
My husband
is an anti-narcotics agent.

369
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,461
It's a shame.
I thought he was a drawer
or an astronaut at the NASA.

370
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,879
You should organize your ideas
before saying them.

371
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,731
What's wrong?

372
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,592
You should thank
I have an appointment,
or you'll be in deep trouble.

373
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,719
You won't leave
until the police is here!

374
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,430
- Don't move!
- Let him go.

375
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,454
Do you need more evidence?

376
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,596
Hello.

377
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,293
What? No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,354
I don't understand you.

379
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,065
Listen. Where are you?

380
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,152
No...

381
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:38,281
Why the hell...?

382
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,266
Why the hell
do you do that, María?

383
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:48,191
No. Listen, listen, listen.
Can you stop crying?

384
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,212
I'll make a phone call.

385
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,257
Calm down, my dear. It's okay.

386
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,925
Where? Where are you?

387
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,391
Okay. I'll call you back.

388
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,978
Okay. Bye.

389
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,444
Son of a b--

390
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,445
Good news.

391
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,473
An agent spoke with the owners.
They won't present charges.

392
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,408
Perfect. Neither do I.

393
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:27,079
Are you okay?

394
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,623
Let's go.

395
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,463
Don't you want to go home?

396
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:44,682
Thank you.
I need to speak
with lawyer Saúl Bueno?

397
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:49,145
Yes. It's Cielo Restrepo.
Tell him is urgent.

398
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:08,289
I'm sorry.
I found the same inside.

399
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,041
You can't close my business
because of that.

400
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,086
I've checked
your waste water,

401
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,273
and all the drainages.

402
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,216
There's more contamination
than inside.

403
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,859
Let me show you.

404
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,781
Acetone,

405
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,408
benzene,

406
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,868
ammonia, nitrobenzene.

407
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,580
This is mistake.

408
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:38,235
Why the engineer
who always does the inspection
isn't here?

409
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:41,614
Alvaro Alzate.
He knows the soap I use

410
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,284
is very good
for the environment.

411
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,094
It's an ecological soap.

412
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,971
You should talk with him, okay?

413
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,332
It has nothing to do
with the soap.

414
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,627
The problem
is your filtration system.

415
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,353
You need to improve it.

416
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,176
Everything is leeching
into the waste waters,

417
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,027
into the ground water.

418
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:07,223
You'll have to replace
your system entirely.

419
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,158
Replace?

420
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,809
Do you know
how much cost that is?

421
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,664
One thousand million pesos.

422
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:19,752
You need to do it.

423
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:23,989
I can give you the name
of an approved vendor.

424
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:27,076
If you get going immediately,
you may be able to be open

425
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,719
in five weeks.

426
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,888
Five weeks?

427
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,598
You're right.

428
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:37,728
I promise we'll be more careful.

429
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,397
We'll keep it clean.

430
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,800
No pollution.
What do you think?

431
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,763
I think it's great,
but it isn't enough.

432
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,866
You know I work with the unit.

433
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,728
We're forced to suspend
all commercial activity
that doesn't meet

434
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,897
the minimum
environmental standards.

435
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,792
Where's Alvaro Alzate?

436
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:03,654
He came every year.
Why hasn't he come this year?

437
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,675
He was transferred.

438
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,036
If you don't agree,
you can file a complain.

439
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,331
No, that isn't the point.
I have done nothing wrong.

440
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:17,501
I don't understand
why you'll shut me down.

441
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,982
What laws did I break?

442
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,593
You're breaking
a lot of laws.

443
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,638
Really?
Tell me which laws.

444
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:31,114
Tell me.

445
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,449
Several laws.

446
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:33,826
Which ones?

447
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:43,961
Health and environmental laws.

448
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,963
Specifically...

449
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,532
Hold on.
Just a second.

450
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,342
Here it is.

451
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,680
Decree 2811 of 1974.

452
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:58,935
Sections 134 to 138.

453
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:03,172
It's related to pollution
control and prevention.

454
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,758
The environment
is a common heritage.

455
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:10,680
It is the duty of the citizen
to preserve it.

456
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:16,686
Section 58 states
property it's a social function.

457
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:20,038
It's a ecological function.

458
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,041
The offender will be fined

459
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:28,405
with 300 minimum wage
per day

460
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,949
or its operation license
would be canceled.

461
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,997
Payment of the fines
doesn't release the offender

462
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,377
from taking the measures
recommended by the authority.

463
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,814
Paragraph one, Section 85.

464
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,318
Act 1333 of 2009.

465
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,737
"Satisfied?

466
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:57,534
Was I specific enough for you?

467
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,490
for you?"

468
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:20,123
What happened with your
lunch?
You didn't touch it.

469
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,851
I'm not hungry.

470
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:27,757
There's a brownie,
in case you get hungry.

471
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,092
What part of "I'm not hungry"
didn't you understand?

472
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,445
Then don't eat it.

473
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,013
You should eat
a mountain of shit.

474
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,915
- Ramón.
- Hi, María. What's up?

475
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,875
- I'm fine, and you?
- I'm fine.

476
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,393
Is there any problem?

477
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,879
No, not at all.
I'm here to see Henry.

478
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,423
I'm glad you're here.
He'll be happy to see you.

479
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,091
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

480
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,823
Henry, you have a visitor.

481
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,410
Look who has arrived.

482
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,814
What?
Did my wife rob a bank?

483
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,289
How are you doing?

484
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,151
I'm well.
I'm getting better every day.

485
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,194
I see.
You're looking good.

486
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,756
I've always been handsome.

487
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,241
Come on. Throw that stuff,
and grab a seat.

488
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,553
Thanks for my wife.

489
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,998
She suffers a lot.
Thank you.

490
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:45,042
You're welcome.
I'm glad to help.

491
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,728
So? Rock collecting?

492
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,589
- Rocks? Which rocks?
- Those.

493
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,483
They're minerals.

494
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,278
It's hard work.

495
00:34:56,303 --> 00:35:00,891
I have to catalogue,
classify and label them.

496
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,659
It's a lot of work.

497
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,870
I imagine.

498
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,624
Well, why are you here?

499
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:13,278
I wanted to say hi,
and ask you for some help.

500
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,114
I'm investigating a homicide
that may be related to drugs.

501
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,550
So, Ramón.

502
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,095
Do you want my help in a case?

503
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,846
How?

504
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:26,208
Do you want me
to chase the criminals?

505
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,851
No.

506
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:31,839
You're an anti-narcotics agent.
You know a lot about it.

507
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:36,802
I did you a favor,
now I can use your brain.

508
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:41,015
Have you heard
of a man called Guido Bermúdez?

509
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,035
Guido Bermúdez?

510
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,162
Let me think.

511
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,084
Let's see...

512
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:57,756
No. Not at all. Why?

513
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,035
Someone came along,
and shot him in the face.

514
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,719
Okay.

515
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,748
No signs of force entry.
No signs of robbery.

516
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,100
Crime of passion.

517
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,769
Where's the drug angle?

518
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,504
We found a notebook
at his place.

519
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,607
I made a copy for you.

520
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:20,596
It looks like it pertains
to some methamphetamine lab.

521
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,405
Okay.

522
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:28,270
There're scientific formulas
and drawings,

523
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:32,482
and chemical products
purchase receipts.

524
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,986
It looks big,
but I don't know about it.
I need your help.

525
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:39,756
Do you think I'm stupid?

526
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,133
What are you doing?

527
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,426
Some kind of charity?

528
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,471
"Let's help poor Henry."

529
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,598
No, I really need your help.

530
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:52,044
I don't know
if you realize my condition.

531
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:55,255
I'm in bed,
and I can't move.

532
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,718
I only do three things:

533
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:02,320
Eating, pooping and sleeping.

534
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,032
I'm not even useful to myself.

535
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,825
Do you want my piece of advice?

536
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,769
Talk with Gómez.
He may help you.

537
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,623
I can't give this case to Gómez.

538
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:17,945
He isn't here.
And you know about the subject.
Look at it.

539
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,906
Take a look,
and tell me what I'm missing.

540
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,094
Whatever.

541
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,961
Ey, ey!
If you want a rock, take that.

542
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,606
Take it easy.

543
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:41,301
Thank you.
I'll stop being hyperactive.

544
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,303
- I'll take this rock.
- Okay.

545
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,573
See you.

546
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,460
It was a good try.

547
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,072
And you, young
lady,

548
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,991
what are you doing
up?

549
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,009
It's time to take a nap.

550
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,703
Shall we
go?

551
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:08,996
Say
goodbye.

552
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,558
Yes.

553
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,479
Pretty girl.

554
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:26,138
The beauty salon
isn't a bad idea, you know?

555
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,352
I think it's promising.
What do you think?

556
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,663
I think we should wait.

557
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,482
Wait. We've been waiting
for five hours. More wait?

558
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,360
He'll call. Don't worry.
He'll call.

559
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,754
I hope so.

560
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:47,325
Cielo, it was a good idea.
It didn't work.
What's the problem?

561
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,469
Let's take it as a learning.

562
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,898
Hello.

563
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,733
Mr. Ramiro.

564
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,235
How are you?

565
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,156
If I'm still interested?

566
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,868
That depends.

567
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:15,145
No, no. What do you mean?
It depends on what?

568
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,857
Well, I know.
That was the original offer.

569
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,502
But it seems high to me now.

570
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,920
What?

571
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:26,115
- I'm offering 900 millions.
- No, Cielo!

572
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,009
Don't do that! No!

573
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,886
Why?

574
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,929
Basically,

575
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,931
you're an unpleasant person.

576
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,558
What are you doing?

577
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,501
- Are you nuts?
- You insulted me.

578
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,463
And you insulted my husband.
You shouldn't do that.

579
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,840
I spoke
with a number of sellers,

580
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,818
and the market seems

581
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,071
much softer than I thought.

582
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,265
My final offer
is 800 millions.

583
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,658
You're talking crazy!

584
00:39:57,146 --> 00:40:00,482
Well, I understand
that you're disappointed.

585
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:04,627
but that's my final offer.

586
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:08,031
I'm sorry
we couldn't make it work.

587
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:10,450
Okay, Mr. Ramiro.
Have a nice day. Good bye.

588
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,303
What are you doing?

589
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,248
- I'm negotiating, Walter.
- Why?

590
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,475
Because I want to pay less.

591
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,087
Less? 200 or 500 millions
doesn't matter.
I have enough money.

592
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,315
That's the very reason.

593
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,509
We need to negotiate.
We don't want
to arouse suspicion

594
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,970
by not trying
to get a good deal.

595
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,763
Everyone here
asks for a lower price.

596
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:35,325
Okay, I get the logic.

597
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:38,603
But it won't work
because you insulted him.

598
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,163
No, I didn't insult him.

599
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,566
I just told him
that he's an unpleasant man.

600
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,987
Whatever.
He won't call again. It's over.

601
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,156
- He will call. I know it.
- No, no.

602
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,660
Do you know what?
I'll take plan B.

603
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:57,373
Better call Saúl.
Where's my phone?

604
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,421
- I'll get it.
- Don't. I'll get it.

605
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,423
- Can you let me? What will...?
- Of... No.

606
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,695
Hello.

607
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,197
Mr. Ramiro.

608
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,871
Nobody is paying attention.

609
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:25,483
But I swear
these things exist.

610
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,918
Yes, mom told me.

611
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,611
I don't mind
if a witch burns me.

612
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:31,531
No, not at all.
Or cannibals eat me.

613
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,926
No! But I'm frightened.

614
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,996
Many people
will want to escape.

615
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,723
There won't be enough room.

616
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,017
How are we going to push?

617
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,419
- How are we pushing?
- Hard.

618
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,587
- Fast.
- We'll all end up

619
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,297
- being Plasticine.
- Mashed potatoes.

620
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,983
Yes, like mashed potatoes.

621
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:54,096
Do you know
what the sad part is?

622
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,348
- We can do nothing.
- Nothing.

623
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,367
Nobody. Nothing.

624
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,602
- Nor you, nor me.
- Nobody. Nothing.

625
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,871
Hit! Come on.

626
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,168
When this situation begins--

627
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,195
- Hey!
- What's up with him?

628
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,589
Everybody up!

629
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,241
Who wants some money?
Let's see.

630
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,134
Money.

631
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,370
Who wants some money?
Let's see.

632
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,163
- That's mine.
- No. It's mine.

633
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,764
Mine. Mine.

634
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,417
- It's mine.
- Go away.

635
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,377
I'm glad
I was awake.

636
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,854
It's mine. It's mine.

637
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,881
Kill yourselves
for that money.

638
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,259
Give it to me.
It's mine.

639
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:37,973
No, come on.
It's mine. Woman.

640
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,597
That's nice.

641
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,938
What do you think?

642
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,233
It smells nice.

643
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,978
To car washing
and money laundering.

644
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,414
- Cheers.

645
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,712
I told you, didn't I?

646
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,756
What? Yes.

647
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,384
It was a perfect job.

648
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,219
It was.

649
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,721
It was impressive.

650
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,623
- Thank you.
- And, Saúl...

651
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,393
He finally came through.

652
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,794
He found the guy,
didn't he?

653
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,729
Yes, he found the guy.

654
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,756
But I told him
what to do and what to say.

655
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,858
You're right.

656
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,527
That's the hard part.

657
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,391
But yes.
Saúl was finally useful.

658
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:03,866
To Saúl.

659
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,620
Cheers.

660
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:13,360
- It tastes better every time.
- It's great.

661
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:14,670
It better be good.

662
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,298
It's 380 thousand a bottle.

663
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,717
What?

664
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:24,287
And I can't even
pronounce the name.

665
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,473
How did you pay it?

666
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:27,974
Cash.

667
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:32,437
No, I mean...

668
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,839
Walter Blanco,
unemployed Chemistry teacher.

669
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:38,176
Where did you get the money
to pay that bottle.

670
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:42,280
Cielo, nobody saw me.

671
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,741
Whoever sold it to you did.

672
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,493
But that's not the point.

673
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:52,207
The point is we're broke.

674
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,817
I didn't pay
some of the bills.

675
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,446
And I canceled our subscription
to magazines

676
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,839
and newspapers.

677
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,909
I even asked for an extension
of the loans.

678
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,623
Theoretically,
we don't have money.

679
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,874
I'm sorry.
You're overreacting.

680
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:14,296
Listen, I won't refrain me
from buying a bottle of wine.

681
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:17,466
And I won't apologize
for wanting to celebrate.

682
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:21,695
We deserve it.

683
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,848
I'm not asking you
to apologize.

684
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:29,894
I'm just asking you
to be smart.

685
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,289
It's a bottle of wine.

686
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:35,567
I pay cash.
That's it.

687
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,753
That's all it takes.

688
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:41,297
Do you remember Watergate?

689
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,717
What?

690
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,968
A microphone on a door

691
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,996
brought down the president
of the United States.

692
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,624
- I'm Nixon now?
No...

693
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,768
No.

694
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:57,547
I want you to understand
the devil is in the details.

695
00:45:57,673 --> 00:45:59,775
One slip-up;

696
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,719
one little mistake in our story
and we'd be ruined.

697
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,474
The devil.
I mean, no. It's okay.

698
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,059
No, no, no. It's okay.
There's no problem.

00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,045

701

00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,049
We have a car wash.
