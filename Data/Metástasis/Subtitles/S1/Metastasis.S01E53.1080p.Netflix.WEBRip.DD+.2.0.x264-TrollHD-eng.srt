1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,613
It's them.

2
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,302
Mario!

3
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,913
1,500 gallons
are missing.

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,472
Where's the rest?

5
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,266
You won't get it.

6
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,019
Why is that?

7
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,670
Who's this man
with that little hat--?

8
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:48,190
I'm the one keeping it.

9
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,842
How come?
What's going on?

10
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,303
Mario, you and I
made a deal.

11
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,905
Where's the tank?

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,473
He doesn't know
where the tank is.

13
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,116
I'm the only one who knows,

14
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,184
so you'll have to
do business
with me.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,062
Why don't you tell me
what you want?

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,164
Over here,

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,191
we just came
to pick what's ours.

18
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,753
Look, methylamine

19
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,321
is worth much more in
my hands

20
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,839
than in yours

21
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,340
or in anyone else's.

22
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,910
I need the
distribution.

23
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,579
- Distribution?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,289
This is my

25
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,416
You forget about
your product.

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,394
You just sell mine

27
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,047
and I'll give you

28
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:30,257
35%?

29
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,147
of my share.

30
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,357
Are you kidding?

31
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,317
They want to give me 35%

32
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,736
for the profits, guys.

33
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,446
That must be---

34
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,657
Come on, dude!

35
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,201
Why would I need you

36
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,828
if I have my own production?

37
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,229
Yes, I know
you do.

38
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,440
I've heard
about your
production.

39
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,819
I was told you get
a 70% purity.

40
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,488
When you're on
a good day.

41
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:57,618
What I do
has 99.1% of purity.

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,138
- So?

43
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,431
It's a cheap fake

44
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,416
versus the original
product.

45
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,018
The product.

46
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,895
Let's see if I got this.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,522
You're telling me

48
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,092
I could kill you right now
and leave you here
in the desert. Right?

49
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,136
Then I'd get
the original product
out of the market.

50
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,238
Do you get me?

51
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,241
Look around you.

52
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,243
There's only us.

53
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,662
I really doubt

54
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,080
you'd want a world

55
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,248
full of fakes

56
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:33,112
when you could access
the original product.

57
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,739
My partner
tells me
that your
crew

58
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,883
switched to P2P.

59
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,201
You're using
colorants

60
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,761
to dye your meth

61
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,287
so that it looks
like mine.

62
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,765
I mean,

63
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,668
you're at doing
imitations.

64
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,336
You've had to do it
several times

65
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,006
to equal my product,
right?

66
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,633
What I'm offering you right
now

67
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,177
is access
to the original
product.

68
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,637
The best
one!

69
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:02,282
Direct distribution.

70
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,243
I'm making no deals with you

71
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,619
to be your errand boy.

72
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,121
Did you get me?

73
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,873
What for?

74
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,442
For a bunch of junkies
to get a better high?

75
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,211
A better high

76
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,863
means consumers
pay more.

77
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,909
More purity
means greater
production.

78
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,678
Millions of dollars

79
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,288
we wouldn't have to
waste

80
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,249
for having incapable
cooks.

81
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,853
I'm the best crystal cook.

82
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,479
No.

83
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,423
You're standing in front
of the two best crystal cooks

84
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,942
in Latin America.

85
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,903
With our skills,

86
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,655
you'll earn more

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,657
from that 35%

88
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,685
than you ever would on
your own.

89
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,206
Now, I have a doubt.

90
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,401
I'm just wondering
why we're so lucky.

91
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,588
Why cut us in?

92
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,574
Mario is retiring from
our crew

93
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,409
so his share of
the partnership
is available.

94
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,453
So if you want
it,

95
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,164
you can handle the
distribution.

96
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,124
Give Mario 5 million
dollars

97
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,126
of the 15 you
brought there.

98
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,044
Just think of it
as a finder's fee

99
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,188
for bringing us together.

100
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:18,592
We have 40 pounds
ready to ship.

101
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,512
I just need to know
one thing.

102
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,656
Are you ready?

103
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:28,244
Who the hell are you?

104
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,454
You know who I am.

105
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,772
Everyone here
knows who I am.

106
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,416
Say my name.

107
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,861
How the hell
would I know your name?

108
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,796
You do.

109
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,132
I'm the cook.

110
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,909
I'm the man
who killed Gustavo
Cortés.

111
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,220
No, that's bullshit.

112
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,222
The cartel killed him.

113
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:52,893
Are you sure?

114
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,171
That's what
I thought.

115
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,132
Now, say my
name.

116
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,072
You're...

117
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,075
...Heisenberg.

118
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,369
Exactly.

119
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,231
You're goddamn
right.

120
00:05:56,232 --> 00:06:00,527
Walter, I have to hand it
to you.

121
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,796
I appreciate the kind words

122
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,506
and all that,

123
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,991
but I'm leaving
too.

124
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,719
Yes, I know.

125
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,429
We'll talk.

126
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,664
Maybe we should talk
about how and when

127
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,725
I'll get my share.

128
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,768
And we'll do that.

129
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,796
I know.
It's that I'm--

130
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,314
Listen, José.

131
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,816
Just give me some time.

132
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,902
I'll need a little help

133
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,887
getting things up and running
during this transition.

134
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,948
Can you at least do that for me?

135
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,772
Let's go now.
We'll talk later.

136
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,483
Walter,
before
splitting

137
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,277
I want to say two
things.

138
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,570
First,
I'll handle the costs

139
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,281
of the men in
prison.

140
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,716
Don't worry about them.

141
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,468
Second,

142
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,953
the bug
in your
brother-in-law's
office.

143
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,330
Anti-narcotics will
de a sweep

144
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,348
in any moment.

145
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,125
You have to get
that out.

146
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,185
Is that all, Mario?

147
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,686
No "Thanks"

148
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,146
for the five million dollars?

149
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,899
Or "sorry for chaining you"?

150
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,760
Walter, get the
bug.

151
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,740
Well, Mario,

152
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,160
I guess I'll see you around.

153
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,021
I don't
think so.

154
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,498
When I'm out,

155
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,916
I'm out.

156
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,376
Yes,

157
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,962
but I'm out too.

158
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,838
Be safe.

159
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,316
Is everything all right?

160
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,526
You tell me.

161
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,570
José, come on!

162
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,699
Go, go!

163
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,744
Stop!

164
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,841
Mrs. Cielo.

165
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,017
Peto Demoliciones.

166
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,505
I know whim
I'd demolish.

167
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,280
José, help me unhook this.

168
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,739
Excuse me.

169
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,205
What's this?

170
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,358
You really want
to know?

171
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,945
Why are you hiding it
in here?

172
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,948
Don't worry about
it.

173
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,466
Who are you hiding it from?

174
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,535
I told you not
to worry.

175
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,180
From the police?

176
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,681
Or from someone else?

177
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,768
Someone would kill for it?

178
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,546
Why don't you go to
the office?

179
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,801
I mean it,
go to the office.

180
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,552
I'll take care of
it
with José.

181
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,626
Ready?

182
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,648
Doctor, how are you?

183
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,066
What did you bring me?

184
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,235
It's just some biscuits.

185
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,388
- Really?
- Yes.

186
00:09:56,514 --> 00:10:01,285
Try them.

187
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,230
- So?
- Absolutely delicious!

188
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,041
I'm not sharing those.

189
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,294
I want them all for me.

190
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,653
No, honey,
they're just

191
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,755
for you.

192
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,655
I brought them just

193
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,866
I knew you'd
like them.

194
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,201
- I love them.
- Really?

195
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,553
So tasty!

196
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,221
Come with me, doctor.

197
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,308
They're wonderful, God!

198
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,712
My colleagues
always criticize me.

199
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,714
They're upset
because I don't share
anything

200
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,274
with them.

201
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,633
They say I'm
selfish.

202
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,694
There, doctor.

203
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,571
Come.

204
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,668
All right, Doris.

205
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,379
So?

206
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,674
How's Alberto?

207
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,992
Don't get me started,
doctor.

208
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,802
I'm so upset.

209
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,539
- Why?
- You know what's the latest?

210
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,308
He wants to buy a boat.

211
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,019
Maybe one of these days

212
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,296
he moves to the sea
or hot land

213
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,856
or the desert.

214
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,841
No, no, no.
Definitely no.

215
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,361
He's not buying a boat.

216
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,737
End of story.

217
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,531
All right,

218
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:21,806
I'll let you
get to this.

219
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,950
See you, Doctor.

220
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,994
Enjoy it.

221
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,855
- Bye
- Thanks, Doris.

222
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,640
Your granddaughter
is going to need a second safe

223
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,309
if you decide to leave her
one more dollar.

224
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,935
How's the rest
of it?

225
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,038
Empty, as usual.

226
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,415
The families are pretty reliable

227
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,626
with the pickups.

228
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,985
Nobody
complaining

229
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,862
abut wanting it all at
once?

230
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,380
No.

231
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,965
No, they get it.

232
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,241
In this country
full of irresponsible people,

233
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,118
they prefer to get paid
little by little.

234
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,678
If not, they go nuts

235
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:11,391
and waste it all.

236
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,893
So I guess

237
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,565
this is it for a while.

238
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,024
Don't worry about the families.

239
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,844
They'll keep getting
their deliveries.

240
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,117

261

270

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and get that--</font></i>

272
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,461
Police!

273
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,464
Search warrant!

274
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:57,165
Open the door!
We have a search warrant!

275
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,142
Coming!

276
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,774
if you want me to read that,

277
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm going to need my glasses.

278
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,235
Come in.

279
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,867
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

280
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,578
This is no longer done
like before.

281
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,763
No.

282
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,723
Everything has changed.

283
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,902
Hey, José!

284
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,012
You're just in
time.

285
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,767
I was about to
start.

286
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,269
Why don't you start get
going
on the setting tank?

287
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:03,941
That would be a huge
help.

288
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,567
We left that stuff in
there
too long

289
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,168
after the last cook.

290
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,696
It needs to be
cleaned.

291
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,448
- Walter--
- For real.

292
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,034
When I say a long time,
it's like an eternity.

293
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,995
It's full of
residue,

294
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,722
dirt.

295
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,541
You know what we need
to invest in?

296
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,309
A power washer.

297
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,544
That's exactly what we
need.

298
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,813
Hey, Walter.

299
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,967
Can we just take a second
and talk about this?

300
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:36,948
Sure!

301
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,351
You know what I think
we need to talk about?

302
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,328
Doubling down.

303
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,898
- Doubling down?
- Yes, I've been thinking.

304
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,400
We're making 99
pounds
per week,

305
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,796
not 50.

306
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:57,702
José, what if...
Just what if

307
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:01,431
we start a second lab?

308
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,541
A second lab
ran by you.

309
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,878
Where you're the
cook!

310
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,438
Why not?

311
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,023
You deserve it.

312
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,443
José!

313
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,136
You're as good as
me.

314
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,365
What do you think?

315
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,119
I think nothing has changed.

316
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,203
I'm out.

317
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,165
I just want to get my money

318
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,875
and get out.

319
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,778
José, when you have
something,

320
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,423
when you do something

321
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,867
that is the
best...

322
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,911
That's not
something
yo get every day.

323
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:43,581
Excellence
is not around the corner.

324
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,142
And you have it.

325
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,517
You have that incredible talent.

326
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,812
Why waste that?

327
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,715
It's like not using
your potential.

328
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,842
Why would you do
such a thing?

329
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,011
I don't
know.

330
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,570
Just tell.

331
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,030
What will you do?

332
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,866
I don't know.

333
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,364
right now.

334
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,977
I'll figure it
out.

335
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,395
No, no, no,
tell me now!

336
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,913
Look at you!

337
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,207
José, please!

338
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,001
Look at you.

339
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,920
You have nothing in your life,

340
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,880
no one.

341
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,757
Yes, yes.

342
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,450
You have video games.
cars--

343
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,495
- Professor--
- Tell me the truth, José!

344
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,874
Think hard and tell me
what will happen

345
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,002
when you get tired
of doing nothing.

346
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,021
How soon would you start

347
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,522
using again?

348
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:36,734
Just tell me.

349
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,987
I know you're upset

350
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,847
about what happened
to that boy.

351
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,323
I'm just as upset as you are.

352
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,783
Are you?

353
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,326
Are you really upset?

354
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,454
How can you say that to me?

355
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,790
How do you dare!

356
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,818
I'm the one
who's the father here.

357
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,336
The only who can feel--

358
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,754
What do you want me to do?

359
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,698
Curl up in a ball
and cry?

360
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,533
Do I have to get locked
in a room

361
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,093
and get high

362
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,096
to prove it to you?

363
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,710
José, what happened
was horrible. It was...

364
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,022
It tears me up inside!

365
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,275
But what can I do?

366
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,943
Am I supposed to just lie down

367
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,362
and die with him?

368
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,201
It's done!

369
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,833
It makes me sick!

370
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,829
that it happened.

371
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,793
Just like everyone else

372
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,295
who died in our wake.

373
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,615
What Peto did
was infamous.

374
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,134
But let's be honest, José,

375
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,578
you and I
have done things

376
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,055
that are just as bad.

377
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,514
Yes.

378
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,226
Believe me I know.

379
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,462
Guido's death
and all the others'.

380
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,717
I don't know
if there's a hell,

381
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,403
but if there's,

382
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,323
you and I are into it.

383
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,991
Right?

384
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,409
But I'm not lying down

385
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,827
while that happens!

386
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,621
So you think

387
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:12,939
just because I don't cook
meth

388
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm lying down?

389
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,002
Is that what you think?

390
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,755
Tell me, Walter.

391
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,241
How many more people
are going to die

392
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,509
because of us?

393
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,595
None.

394
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,413
José, you and I
are in control now.

395
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,890
No one else gets hurt.

396
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,726
That's bullshit!

397
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,586
You've told me
that

398
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,630
once and
again

399
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,465
and it's always
been a lie.

400
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,443
Always.

401
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,304
- Of course not
- Of course it has!

402
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,892
And you know
what?

403
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,329
I'm done.

404
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,956
I mean it.

405
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,541
So please,

406
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,943
give me my
money

407
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,279
and this is it for
us.

408
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:09,346
Fine.

409
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,181
Why?

410
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,057
Why do you want that money?

411
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,185
Why?

412
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,544
Because it's
mine.
It's my cut.

413
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,147
No!

414
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,606
No.

415
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,734
It's filthy blood money.

416
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,030
Where's your transparency?

417
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,990
Your moral?

418
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,992
Where's the pure José?

419
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,286
You shouldn't touch a dime

420
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:37,248
because it's dirty money!

421
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,583
You know what I'll do?

422
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,919
I'll save you from that.

423
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,298
I won't let you touch it.

424
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,968
Is that what you want?

425
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,596
Why can you be honest with me?

426
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,542
Tell me you want it
as much as I want it.

427
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,770
It's not wrong to want it.

428
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,232
José, stay.

429
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:06,069
Let's cook as usual.

430
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,154
I assure you

431
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,680
we'll earn
10 times more.

432
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,991
No, 20 times!

433
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,328
I promise!

434
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,231
You know what,
Walter?

435
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,318
Do whatever you want,
bitch.

436
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,070
You don't want to pay
me?
Don't.

437
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,339
I don't care.

438
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,367
- You do care.
- I don't care.

439
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,121
It's on you.
I'm done.

440
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,349
You're not done!

441
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,126
If you leave,
you get nothing!

442
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,769
José, listen to me!

443
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,921
I won't give you a dime
if you leave!

444
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,898
José!

445
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,281
Excuse me.

446
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,782
Boss!

447
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,684
You're the boos
now, Henry.

448
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,353
No, sir, you'll always be
the boss for me.

449
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,396
Thanks.
So how are you doing?

450
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,357
I just have a little
flu,
but I'm fine.

451
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,400
I thought you were
in the Caribbean, on a
yacht,

452
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,960
with some chicks,

453
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,695
your wife
preparing lunch.

454
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,364
The way it should
be,
right?

455
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,923
I'd have loved that,

456
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,758
but I've had too many farewells.

457
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,451
Besides, you know
that among high ranks

458
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,204
every moment is a good moment
to take some whisky.

459
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,748
Sure.
Sit and talk to me.

460
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,710
Speaking of high ranks,
they asked me to come

461
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,561
and talk to you.

462
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,506
What?
Did I screw it up?

463
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,136
Henry, just take it
as a piece of advice.

464
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,222
Any advice coming from up
there

465
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,781
is an order.

466
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,099
Talk to
me.

467
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,909
In any case, Henry,

468
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,453
you know I want you

469
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,230
to do a good job
in this office.

470
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,789
Yes, sir.

471
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,749
I think you're a great worker,

472
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,793
but I want you to know, Henry,

473
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,530
your job is no longer
a filed job.

474
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,284
You're in charge
of the anti-narcotics office

475
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,246
and that brings along
some responsibilities.

476
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,581
For instance,
reports, Henry.

477
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,917
You have to fill in reports
in a timely manner.

478
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,044
We're working on
that, boss.

479
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,812
Why spend so much time

480
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,647
and money

481
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,732
in a practically over case,

482
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,401
such as Gustavo Cortés'?

483
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,861
I understand

484
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,512
everything you're
saying

485
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,014
and I hope you'll
understand

486
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,615
what I think.

487
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,934
You have to
believe in me.

488
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,518
If I'm making these
decisions

489
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,771
is because I have evidence
that the blue meth

490
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,731
is back in the
streets.

491
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,400
I know Gustavo
Cortés' team

492
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,084
is working again.

493
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,070
And Mario Arboleda
has a lot to do with
that.

494
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,115
I believe you, Henry,
I do.

495
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,632
But?

496
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,176
What is it?

497
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,995
It's just one case
among hundreds.

498
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,597
You can have no preferences.

499
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,583
- I know. But I think--
-Henry, no preferences.

500
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,061
There's just one job now

501
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,046
and that's the one
that has to be done.

502
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,399
One more thing.

503
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,568
Why are you personally executing

504
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,027
the search warrants?

505
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,929
- What's that?
- Yes, I know.

506
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,098
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

507
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,116
You're damn right it won't.

508
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,452
From now on

509
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,163
there's no budget

510
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,957
to go after that guy.

511
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:10,211
Understood?

512
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,670
All right, Henry.

513
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,632
Don't take it personally.

514
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,759
This is the way it is.

515
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,261
Get better.

516
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,788
- Thank you, boss.
- I'll be in touch.

517
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,182
Goodbye.

518
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,708
- Boss!
- Hi, Gómez.

519
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,252
I'm glad to see
you around, boss.

520
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,962
- Goodbye.
- Bye..

521
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,652
What was that?

522
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,529
That visit.

523
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,239
You know what I think?

524
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,698
The boss likes you.

525
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,200
There's something there.

526
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,435
He asked me for
your number.

527
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,063
- Take a seat.
- What happened?

528
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:49,584
Tell me.

529
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,085
We can't continue

530
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,362
going after Mario
Arboleda.

531
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,947
We have no budget
for that.

532
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,007
Let's put it this way.

533
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,509
Mario Arboleda

534
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,969
hasn't left his house.

535
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,829
He takes care
of his granddaughter.

536
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,247
He hasn't made us
lose track of him

537
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,723
or anything like that.

538
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,476
So what's the problem?

539
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,045
Has any of Gustavo Cortés'
men

540
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,505
talked
already?

541
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,964
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

542
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,341
Nothing, they're not saying
anything.

543
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,526
We have to make them talk.

544
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,512
Just make up
some sentence
reduction,

545
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,489
a trip to Cartagena.

546
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,059
Chicks, offer them chicks,
lots of chicks.

547
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:26,203
No, they're not saying anything.

548
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,581
It's so strange.

549
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,441
After so many
years

550
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,942
working for the
police,

551
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,777
this is the most
loyal group
I've seen.

552
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,921
Those people

553
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,156
must be getting a
monthly fee.

554
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,716
Have you checked

555
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,176
their bank accounts?

556
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,578
Sure.
They're not spending a cent.

557
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,120
No one's living
beyond their means.

558
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,394
These nine guys

559
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,796
are being represented
by one lawyer?

560
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,858
Yes, by Marín.

561
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,777
Marín.

562
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,180
Can we find out
more

563
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,699
about this guy?

564
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,562
We might get
something there.

565
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,040
You want me to trace a...?

566
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,497
to trace him?

567
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,192
Like the shit ain't deep enough
for you already?

568
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,378
Antonio said

569
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,280
we couldn't follow
Mario Arboleda.

570
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,740
HE didn't say anything
about anyone else.

571
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:24,136
Do it.

572
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,829
- Are you sure?
- Do it!

573
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,809
All right, boss.

574
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:55,084
Shall we get started?

575
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,212
Yes, sir.

576
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,281
Peto, I know
everything you'll see today,

577
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,950
all the processes,
the equipment,

578
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,468
will be absolutely strange

579
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,304
and unknown for you.

580
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,847
Well, not completely.

581
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,891
I guess you had basic chemistry

582
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,018
at school.

583
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,213
- No.
- No?

584
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,690
That's all right.

585
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,610
I'll go slowly,

586
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,430
I'll explain
everything in detail.

587
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,115
I promise you

588
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,351
I won't overwhelm you
with all the information,

589
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,436
knowledge, formulas
and all that.

590
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,396
- All right.
- Thank you..

591
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,248
I don't need you

592
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,708
to become Antoine Lavoisier

593
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,193
from one moment
to the other.

594
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,795
Who?

595
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,548
The father of modern chemistry.

596
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,675
What matters here, Peto,

597
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,260
is that I need

598
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,889
all your energy and attention.

599
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,250
Listening, Peto.
Listening.

600
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,227
That's the key for learning.

601
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,687
Do you get me?

602
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,231
And if you do so,

603
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,818
I'm sure you'll be ready soon.

604
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,653
Let's get started.

605
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,667
It's used to measure.

606
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,485
Erlenmeyer,
precipitation.

607
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,055
Gently, gently.

608
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,102
Careful, careful.

609
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,482
That one

610
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,551
and this tank
too.

611
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,903
Adjust.

612
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,071
No spilling.

613
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,502
Come on!

614
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,921
Pressure is important.

615
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:07,090
Are you ready?

616
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,926
Transparent.

617
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:36,019
Now the CO2 freezes the
liquid, crystallizing it,

618
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,939
which gives us
our finished
methamphetamine.

619
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,275
Now all that's left
is breaking it up,

620
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,026
weight it
and we're
done.

621
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,716
This is complicated.

622
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,451
It's going to take me
a few more times

623
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,052
to get a grasp on it.

624
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,204
I'm absolutely sure
about it.

625
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,666
You'll have to go over
this
many times.

626
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,142
Yes, sir.

627
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,353
How did I do?

628
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,022
Fine, Peto. Fine.

629
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,442
You applied yourself.

630
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,469
That's as much as I can
ask.

631
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,070
Yes.

632
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,430
You want us to discuss
money?

633
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,056
No, no, no,
don't worry.

634
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,158
I have to learn first.

635
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,077
We'll then talk about that.

636
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,827
Hi, Doris.
Good morning.

637
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,288
Guess what I
brought you?

638
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,290
It's tangerine
cake.

639
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,268
You'll love it.

640
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,103
Thank you, Doctor.

641
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:52,262
Doris, it has a happy
face

642
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,223
so that you have
a happy day.

643
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,704
- How are you?
- What's up?

644
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,664
Are you all
right?

645
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,060
Come with us.

646
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,838
- No, what's going on?
- Please.

647
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,084
I didn't tell
you.

648
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,878
I'm working
with a new guy.

649
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,922
I think it could
work.

650
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,173
he's a guy
that's interested in
learning

651
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,317
and also...

652
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,921
Brother, I've tried it.

653
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,714
I mean...

654
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,992
I swear I've tried it
as hard as I could

655
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,927
and it's all

656
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,428
like bumping

657
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,804
into a wall.

658
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,305
It's like...

659
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,016
It's as though I didn't exist.

660
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,852
That's bad, dude.

661
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,629
And I know
she's not happy.

662
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,564
I know it.

663
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,400
I try to help her.

664
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,218
But I don't know
what else to do.

665
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,737
I just don't...

666
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,196
I can find no way.

667
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,949
I'm so screwed!

668
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,271
I don't know when everything
got so fucked up, Henry.

669
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,315
- Coffee?
- Yes.

670
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,400
- Two sugars?
- Yes, yes.

671
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:11,861
And what
else?

672
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,236
- Cream, right?
- Cream.

673
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,755
Lactose free.

674
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,133
I'll be right back.

675
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,968
God!

676
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,707
Walter.

677
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,126
Your coffee.

678
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,377
Man!

679
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,713
Buddy, for real,

680
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,365
if I'm taking
too much of your time...

681
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,993
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

682
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,452
Don't worry.
I also feel--

683
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,829
It's a nightmare.
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,622
Don't worry.
No.

685
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,183
Thanks.

686
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,227
No problem.

687
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:11,895
Buddy, I really don't know

688
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,255
what to do.
I just--

689
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,631
Gentlemen

690
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,067
Gómez, how are you?

691
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:18,385
Excuse me,
please.

692
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,904
Sure, go.

693
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,447
What?

694
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,891
Tell me you have
good news.

695
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,118
I sweated the guy for 14 hours.

696
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,661
A record.

697
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,187
I'll give you your
medal then.

698
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,231
Tell me.
What happened?

699
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,233
- He'll do it.
- He'll do it?

700
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,860
He's giving us Mario
Arboleda?

701
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,503
Is he

702
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,948
- We're getting him.
- Good!

703
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,950
So what are you
waiting for?

704
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,869
Go and get me
that fucking Mario Arboleda!

705
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,790
[laughing
]

706
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,435
Grandpa!

707
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,772
I'm coming!

708
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,239
Hello?

709
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,698
Can you talk?

710
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,516
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">There's a small situation</font>

713
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,064
I can come in a few
hours.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, I can't meet you later.</font></i>

716
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,069

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Where exactly?</font></i>

Hold tight.

723
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,066
That's it, girl.

724
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,692
Hello?

725
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,360
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mario, they're coming for you.</font></i>

726
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,947
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They're coming right now!</font></i>

727
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,389
Slow down, Walter.
Who?

728
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,950
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Anti-narcotics!</font></i>

729
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,077
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Somebody flipped.</font></i>

730
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,269
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They have some kind</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of bank surveillance.</font></i>

731
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,871
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know.</font></i>

732
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,248
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Something about some lawyer.</font></i>

733
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,292
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Someone is talking</font></i>

734
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,527
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and they're coming for you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">right now.</font></i>

735
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,497
God!

736
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,999
How could Mario

737
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,584
use that clown of a lawyer?

738
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,003
"Doctor Marín",

739
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,796
That's bullshit.

740
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,631
Always consult with me

741
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,675
before using outside counsel.

742
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,302
All right, Saúl.

743
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,929
This is nonsense.

744
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,681
What can we do?

745
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,499
Besides pray
that he gets away?

746
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,101
I don't know.

747
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,294
Because if narcotics
catches him,

748
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,937
he'll flip

749
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,397
and it'll be the end.

750
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,091
- We're so screwed!
-No, no, no.

751
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,009
Mario would
never flip.
I'm sure.

752
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,677
He'll never open
his mouth.

753
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,238
Never say never.

754
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,656
This is the second time

755
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,074
anti-narcotics takes his money.

756
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,060
No, Saúl,
he won't flip.

757
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:14,661
He won't,

758
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,121
but his nine guys will.

759
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,040
Wait.

760
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,214
Hello?

761
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,090
It's him!

762
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,159
Wait, Mario,
I'll put you on speaker

763
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,845
with the brain trust.

764
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,348
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The what?</font></i>

765
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,208
Walter and José Miguel
are here.

766
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,352
I don't want Walter and José.

767
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,754
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I want you.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I need you to help me.</font></i>

768
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,233
Sure, better call Saúl.

769
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:45,650
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I've got a bag</font></i>

770
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,152
at the airport.

771
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,570
Passports, money, everything.

772
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,097
But there're eyes
everywhere now.

773
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,449
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I can't get close.</font></i>

774
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,950
I need you to pick that bag

775
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,894
and get it to me
as soon as possible.

776
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,537
Mario,

777
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,815
do you know
how thick the crap storm

778
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,666
is out there because of this?

779
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,027
I told you not to use
that lawyer.

780
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,171
He's a hack!

781
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,630
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Shut up, Saúl.</font></i>

782
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,116
I need that bag.
Get it!

783
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,492
Mario, it's
José.

784
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,094
I can do it.

785
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,411
Just tell me where the
bag is

786
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,013
and what to do.

787
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,581
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, José,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I pay Saúl.</font></i>

788
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,475
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He can do it just fine.</font></i>

789
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,227
Yes, you pay me

790
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,644
and anti-narcotics knows

791
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,397
I represent you.

792
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,814
They're probably out there

793
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,233
waiting for me to move

794
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,068
and so something stupid.

795
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,527
Mario, I can go.

796
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,887
It's not a
problem.

797
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,406
No, José, no!

798
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,351
No, José.
I'll do it.

799
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,021
Besides, remember,
you're out.

800
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,940
I'll do it.
Tell me where the bag is.

801
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:32,048
Walter.

802
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,659
Before I hand this
over,
I need something from
you.

803
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,303
And what's that?

804
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,913
The names of your
nine men.

805
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,515
Why?

806
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,124
You're never
going to pay them off.

807
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,002
They affect me and
José.

808
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,895
We deserve to know.

809
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,897
The only thing left now

810
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,316
is get out of here.

811
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,633
Maybe you can
leave,

812
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:54,137
I can't just

813
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,235
can't.

814
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,237
leave.

815
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,972
I have a family,
people depending on me.

816
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:57,533
Hum.

817
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:04,373
You're welcome!

818
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:05,874
What?

819
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,150
I need those names,
Mario!

820
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,710
You owe me that.

821
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,112
I don't owe you
a damn thing!

822
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,696
All this falling apart like this
is on you.

823
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,673
So it's on me?

824
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,367
That's some kind
of logic
right there.

825
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:16,993
You're followed
by anti-narcotics

826
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,554
and it's on me?

827
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,456
- How's that?
- Asshole!

828
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,474
We had a good thing!

829
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,794
We had Gustavo Cortés,
we had a lab,

830
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,146
we had everything we needed

831
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,381
and it all ran
like clockwork!

832
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,816
Yes, sure!

833
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,385
You should have
shut your mouth,

834
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,054
cook and make as much money
as you ever needed.

835
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,655
It was perfect.

836
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,492
But you just had to blow it up.

837
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,520
You, your pride
and your fucking ego!

838
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,080
You just had to be the man.

839
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,398
Nothing else would be
good enough, right?

840
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,375
If you'd done your job,

841
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,627
known your place,

842
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:52,045
we'd all be fine right now

843
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,005
and everything would be great.

844
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,319
Damn!

845
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,610
I've just realized

846
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,612
Lidia has the names too.

847
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:47,035
I'm so sorry, Mario.

848
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,828
This could have been avoided.

849
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,208
Shut the fuck up, Walter.

850
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,298
Let me die in peace.
