1
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,961
The thing is the zebra

2
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,587
got stucked

3
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,198
and the lions came
and killed it.

4
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,117
The worse part
was that the zebra

5
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,661
was not dead yet
and they ate it.

6
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,455
You should have seen
how the zebra was doing.

7
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,432
That's more sanguinary

8
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,834
than any movie I've
seen.

9
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,045
Imagine watching that
while queuing at the bank

10
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,421
at noon.
No!

11
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,440
I understand

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,009
that nature is
nature

13
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,844
and it's cruel
and all that shit,

14
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,804
but that should be
censured.

15
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,764
After all,
it's a murderer

16
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,659
during day time.

17
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,895
Hey, are you alive?
is everything okay?

18
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,581
Yes, I'm fine.

19
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,234
You know what?
I've been thinking

20
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,111
and there's
something
I don't understand.

21
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,779
I mean, we're
supposed

22
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,407
to be doing this
like the bests,
right?

23
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,951
We're doing it
with all the equipment,

24
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,511
all the budget,

25
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,455
we're the major league,
right?

26
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,641
Then why don't we have

27
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,959
some equipment
maintainer guys?

28
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,419
Wouldn't it be
better

29
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,921
if we had some maintenance
team

30
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:53,024
come and clean this shit?

31
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,425
No one does it better
than we do.

32
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,301
Yes, but having some
slaves

33
00:02:56,427 --> 00:03:00,056
wouldn't be that bad,
would it?

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,075
Are you done there?

35
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,853
Get down
and start with the condensers.

36
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,090
Since we have 15 hours,

37
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:22,036
I'm going home
and I'll come back later, okay?

38
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,956
These numbers
just don't add up.

39
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:28,184
What is it?

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,170
These numbers
make no sense.

41
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,730
Told you.

42
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,606
They're boning us.

43
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,525
They're burning our heads.

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,611
It's not that, José.

45
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:43,474
The inputs, the waste
and the production don't match.

46
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:48,537
We're 14% off.

47
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,039
What does that mean?

48
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:55,903
It means we're missing
between 7 and 10 ounces.

49
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,005
That's weird.

50
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,050
What about the spillage?

51
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:05,913
- No, nothing gets spilled.
- No?

52
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,624
What about
evaporation?

53
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,226
They're practically none.

54
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,795
The materials
aren't out that long.

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,982
It can't be that.

56
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,844
And the opposite to
that?

57
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,696
The drops,

58
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,740
like on cold beer.

59
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,017
- Condensation?
- That's it!

60
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,826
No, neither.

61
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,870
Neither?

62
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,043
What about the gank

63
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,087
we scrape out of vats?

64
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,115
That's got to add up
to a lot.

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,717
Vestiges.

66
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,537
- Could be that.

67
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,931
You see?

68
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,750
Science has an answer
to everything.

69
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm leaving.
Bye.

70
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,815
450.

71
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,596
- Professor...

72
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,282
Are you sure you're okay?

73
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,951
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

74
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,619
Aren't you coming?

75
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,063
I'm staying five
minutes

76
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:15,274
to solve something
and then I'll leave.

77
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,001
Whatever.

78
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,044
See you.

79
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,053
No, no.

80
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,139
Yes, sure.

81
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,582
Of course everything
is under control.

82
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,684
It's all cool.

83
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,187
Fine, cool.

84
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:39,173
That was José.
He couldn't make it.

85
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,899
Really?

86
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,943
Then let's go and get a beer

87
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,903
since we have the day off.

88
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,280
No, you know what he said?

89
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,739
To start working

90
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,700
and he'll come later.

91
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,769
I think he'll revise
our account

92
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,829
or whatever.

93
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,981
Our
account?

94
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,833
Did you sell anything?

95
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,111
No,
I'm doing really well.

96
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:04,589
I've sold...

97
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,550
I haven't sold shit.

98
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,937
Víctor, this is the schedule

99
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:23,775
for next week.

100
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,904
And...

101
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,765
What did you want
to talk to me about?

102
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,644
About this.
This is our product.

103
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,371
So?

104
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,688
Someone in the street
we don't know

105
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:40,292
is selling it.

106
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,569
There're dealers everywhere,
Victor.

107
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,214
This is not any dealer.

108
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,033
It's selling it for less
that we do.

109
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:59,686
Let's not do anything for now.

110
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,882
But keep your eyes
and ears open.

111
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,776
I will.

112
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,678
Excuse
me.

113
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,173
What time is José coming?

114
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,552
Like in ten minutes, dude.

115
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,554
We still have time, right?

116
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,180
We should take that time

117
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,224
and if a client comes,

118
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,227
we should sell some meth.

119
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,087
No, Tripa,
José told us

120
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,441
not to sell anything.

121
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,484
Besides, he told us to wait

122
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,846
until he finished
that meeting.

123
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,931
I'm not doing well
with my stuff but...

124
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,908
You know what?

125
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,119
He's given us some rules.

126
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,021
No, no, man,
you have to be proactive.

127
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,939
That's how you accomplish
big stuff.

128
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,441
If he asks
for our numbers,

129
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,376
he won't catch us unaware.

130
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,336
You're doing shit!

131
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,838
You see?

132
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,882
Dude, you were selling

133
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,659
this shit in the streets,
weren't you?

134
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,719
You think I'm so fool?

135
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,179
How do you think

136
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:25,267
I paid for yesterday's beer?

137
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,545
What if José comes
and finds us selling?

138
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,172
In the middle of
the transaction.

139
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,508
Monito, just look
where we are.

140
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,318
This is a hole, dude.

141
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,346
We'll tell him
we were buying pot.

142
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,932
Why not get
some?

143
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,995
Yes, dude.

144
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,373
What's wrong with you?

145
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,376
Dude, I killed it!

146
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,649
Do I look familiar or have
you lost something?

147
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,071
He's coming back, dude.
He's coming back.

148
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,498
What's up?
What do you want?

149
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,311
Hey, I know this guy!

150
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,979
You won't get him!

151
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,339
- Get out!
- Calm down, man.

152
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,525
Go away, bitch!

153
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,010
Dude, you were lucky
I recognized them

154
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,028
before they sold you shit.

155
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,614
I know them.

156
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,616
They sell the worst shit.

157
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,284
Are you looking for good stuff?

158
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,687
I know some people.
Come, I'll take you.

159
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,622
Come on!

160
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,065
You know
I don't do that shit anymore,

161
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,501
but I keep my contacts.

162
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,070
Whatever you want.
What do you say?

163
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,672
No, thanks.

164
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:44,048
Anytime, du

165
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,092
That's fine!

166
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,039
What the hell is wrong
with you two?

167
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,499
Did you sell
him anything?

168
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,875
Did you show him the
product?

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,669
No, man, nothing.
Chill out.

170
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,856
No, dude, we didn't.

171
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,216
I've just saved your asses,
bitches.

172
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,218
it's miracle you're
alive.

173
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,346
Why can't you do
as I say?

174
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,072
I've told you

175
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,849
this would be where
and when I told you to.

176
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,201
That's all!

177
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,828
Yes, yes, sir.

178
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,605
You see, Mono?
I told him not to.

179
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,708
He insisted.

180
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:45,302
What's up, Tripa?
What happened?

181
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,947
Yes, yes, just let me...

182
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,365
I'll call you back.

183
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,409
I'm in the middle of something.

184
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,411
All right.

185
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,007
Hurry!

186
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,508
Close!

187
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,969
What's going on?

188
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,972
I feel like in a plane, dude.

189
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,956
- It's positive pressure.
- What?

190
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,793
- You'll fuck my ears.
- Just move your jaw around.

191
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,436
That helps.

192
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,129
I'm moving it.
It's not working.

193
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,148
Just yawn or something.

194
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,967
Stop acting like
such a baby!

195
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,989
What the hell is going on?

196
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,225
I've turned the ventilation up
to keep the outside out.

197
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,576
There's been a contamination.

198
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:21,815
What?
Hold up.

199
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,860
Something got in
the lab.

200
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986
So do we evacuate?
Do we put the masks on?

201
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,698
- They're here.
-No, no, no.

202
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:33,201
It's not that kind
of contamination.

203
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,619
In fact, it's not
dangerous

204
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:38,222
to us.

205
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,143
What the hell is that?

206
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,812
I made it.

207
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,940
Walter, be more specific.

208
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,092
What kind of contamination
are you talking about?

209
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,362
What are you talking about?

210
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,447
A housefly.

211
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,075
A housefly?

212
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,119
Like one fly?

213
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,940
- No, man!
- Yes.

214
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,109
And I'll get it
out of the lab.

215
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,485
You scared the shit
out of me!

216
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,587
How could you say

217
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,030
there's contamination in the lab
just like that?

218
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,116
I thought like getting
a boob,

219
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,676
a third eye.

220
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,637
like peeling off.

221
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,872
What are you talking
about?

222
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,515
Yes, like in the movies!

223
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,833
You know,
people mutate

224
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,794
and they peel off
and--

225
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,253
How could you scare
me like that, Walter?

226
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,130
Look, that third eye
and boob stuff,

227
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,590
I really don't think
that's possible.

228
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,525
But the skin stuff is possible.

229
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,988
But not in this case.

230
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,349
So you're chasing around
a fly in the lab

231
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,577
and I'm the idiot.

232
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,854
When I say
"contamination",

233
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,289
I'm being very precise.

234
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,126
Exact.

235
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,069
If we want a clean
product,

236
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,697
we have to eliminate
that fly.

237
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,842
You get me?

238
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,165
Hey, did you by
chance

239
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,268
try our product?

240
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,149
This might sound weird, José.

241
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,401
But you have to understand.

242
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,721
In a highly controlled
environment

243
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,099
any risk of contamination
could mean--

244
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,248
Could mean...

245
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:34,089
Professor...

246
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,826
You didn't hit your head,
did you?

247
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,078
Is it because you didn't sleep?
You stayed here
and didn't sleep.

248
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,596
It must be that, right?

249
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,414
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

250
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,933
All that matters now

251
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,977
is to get to work.

252
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,879
We've already lost
enough time.

253
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,982
Freaking, finally.

254
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,572
What are you doing?

255
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,950
It's time to alkaline.

256
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,394
Have you not heard
a word I said?

257
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,914
No cooking

258
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,233
until this fly is dealt
with.

259
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,193
Have I been speaking
to myself?

260
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,795
You know what I heard?

261
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,114
An alarm telling us
the load is ready.

262
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,075
How long is this batch
going to be good for?

263
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,035
Two, three hours top?
We can't waste it.

264
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,453
The batch will be
good for nothing

265
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,874
if we don't clear
the contaminant.

266
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,770
The contaminant is a fly!

267
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,106
We're making meth here!

268
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,925
That burns people's
brains,

269
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,651
do you get me?

270
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,569
A fly in the lab

271
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,847
won't change
the product.

272
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,448
Do you get me?

273
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,936
No cooking
until the fly is dead!

274
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,855
What fly?
What are you talking
about?

275
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,815
I haven't even
seen a fly!

276
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,584
I know it's here.

277
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,546
I'm sure it's over here.

278
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,550
It's your call, José.

279
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,870
You either help me find it
or just get out of the way.

280
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,680
We're not cooking

281
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,499
if there's risk
of contamination!

282
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,023
Let's hunt then.

283
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,850
Any news regarding
Walter's personal life?

284
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,912
He looks better.

285
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,915
Has he been reckless again?

286
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,775
I think he's got used
to this reality

287
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,836
and not living with his wife.

288
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,380
What happened with the trucks?

289
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,574
A truck going
from Peru to Ecuador

290
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,510
was robbed.

291
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,929
What did you do about it?

292
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,330
We've retrieved
the product

293
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,415
and punished the
guilty.

294
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,336
The problem is they saw what
was on the truck.

295
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,423
And they're
spreading the info.

296
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:02,012
Would the Mexicans realize
we're exporting?

297
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,949
I think it's a matter of time.

298
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,576
We have to be prepared then.

299
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,453
I need to get more men.

300
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:14,315
Hire whoever you need,
the best ones.

301
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,210
People ready for combat

302
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,669
and ready to act

303
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,464
in case of an attack.

304
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,467
Excuse me.

305
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,735
Walter, come.

306
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,280
I have a proposal.

307
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,390
Why don't we take
a five-minute break?

308
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,975
Let's go get some air,
freshen our minds,

309
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,310
come back here
and get that fly.

310
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,330
You don't understand

311
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,956
how important this is, do you?

312
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,525
I'm not telling you
not to catch it.

313
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,710
We can't make no mistake!

314
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,488
Not with the kind of people
we're dealing with.

315
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,007
Do you get that?

316
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,508
I know! I know!

317
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,535
I'm not asking
something nonsense!

318
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,122
I'm just asking
for five minutes.

319
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,415
Five minutes,
that's all.

320
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,517
We deserve it.

321
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,520
Okay? Come on.

322
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,610
Fine.

323
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,864
Good, thanks.

324
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,308
- Five minutes.
- Yes, five minutes.

325
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,076
You have the keys?

326
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,561
I left mines
on the desk

327
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,664
and I don't want to--

328
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,543
What are you doing?

329
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,070
give me my keys,
mother fucker!

330
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,947
If you're not helping me,
stay out of my way!

331
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:48,759
Walter, open up!

332
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,761
Walter!

333
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,276
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,079
Be quiet.

335
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,289
Don't you move.

336
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,292
You're so fucked!

337
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,076
So you think a fly
is the problem, bitch?

338
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,096
You'll see now.

339
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:40,270
What happened?

340
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,147
Damn it!

341
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,791
What's up?
You need anything?

342
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,545
No, no, no,
I'm just kidding!

343
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,647
I want peace.

344
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,650
I have a proposal.

345
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,363
Done.

346
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,058
I think this is the best
option.

347
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,700
It's got pheromones

348
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,161
to attract the fly.

349
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,063
The fly
will stick to it.

350
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,023
Since it's not an
insecticide,

351
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,707
you'll stop talking

352
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,193
about the contamination
in the lab.

353
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,195
This is all
green-friendly.

354
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,173
You know that trend?

355
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,116
We have to make
permanent rounds.

356
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,660
We have to be alert
to see if this bitch

357
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,137
falls in the trap.

358
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,182
Ready.

359
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,434
Hey, Walter...

360
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,337
Did you get some
sleep?

361
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,398
Why do you keep asking me that?

362
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,233
Because I never know

363
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,110
with you.

364
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,013
I'm just asking because I
was heating up some coffee

365
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,848
and maybe you wanted
a cup.

366
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,267
But if you want
to fall asleep

367
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,477
and miss the fly dying,
that's up to you.

368
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,312
No, no, I want some.
I need a coffee.

369
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,315
- Fine.
- Thanks.

370
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,018
- Thanks.
- No problem.

371
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:17,034
Cover his arm,
please.

372
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,930
Cielo...

373
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,832
I'm really thankful
to you and Walter

374
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,168
for the economic help
you're giving us.

375
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,685
For real.

376
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,563
Thank you.

377
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,565
It's the least we can do.

378
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,609
Come.

379
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,156
What?

380
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,768
Please, I don't want
to talk about this again.

381
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,397
Remember it's a secret
between, you, Walter and me.

382
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,358
- Yes.
- For real.

383
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,085
Where's Walter?

384
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,672
At home with Junior.

385
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,173
Hoe come?

386
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,801
Wasn't Junior at Luis's?

387
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,704
I mean, Walter
went home

388
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,166
to wait for Junior
and rest.

389
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,644
Doesn't that scare you?

390
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,145
What?

391
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,230
I mean, with Walter's problem,

392
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,008
maybe he takes the chance
and goes to a casino.

393
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,890
No, I'm not
scared.

394
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:27,104
With all this Walter
stuff

395
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,523
I've learnt not to
worry

396
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,901
about things I can't
control.

397
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,778
It'll be whatever it
has to be.

398
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:53,690
Walter, how have you been?

399
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:58,969
With what?

400
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,149
what?

401
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:59,069
Your illness.

402
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:06,018
I went to see the
oncologist last week.

403
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,330
I'm still in remission.

404
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,233
So probably
I won't die soon.

405
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:16,195
That's good.
Congratulations.

406
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,880
You want more coffee?

407
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,532
- What?
- More coffee?

408
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,635
Yes, thanks.

409
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,706
Thanks.

410
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,671
José...

411
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,455
I want to tell you something
that seems weird to me.

412
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,223
Weird?

413
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,084
After today noting
seems weird to me.

414
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,565
What have you been

415
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,551
thinking about
lately?

416
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,679
I think I've missed
the perfect moment

417
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:27,600
to put an end
to this story.

418
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,326
Part of it

419
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,061
was because I hadn't gathered
enough money for my family,

420
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,624
but that doesn't matter.

421
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:40,045
The thing is

422
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,364
I should have
finished all this

423
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:47,511
before Cielo found out.

424
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,372
What do you mean
by "finish all this"?

425
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:54,293
Leaving the business
or drop dead?

426
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,507
I'm saying I've lived too
long.

427
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:04,111
No, don't say that.

428
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,973
You know what's ideal
when you die?

429
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,185
The ideal thing is
that people miss you,

430
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,288
have memories of you.

431
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:18,375
Have good memories.

432
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,737
But that's impossible
for me now.

433
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,782
No matter
how I explained Cielo

434
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,327
that this is what I had
to do,

435
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:33,249
she doesn't understand
it, she doesn't want to.

436
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:37,503
I should have
definitely die

437
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,423
before Cielo
found this out.

438
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,660
I'm sort of dizzy.

439
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:56,622
Why don't you sit?

440
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:07,742
I should have died
long ago.

441
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,161
You know
what the question is?

442
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:15,683
Which was the right moment?

443
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:19,353
After Valentina was born,

444
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,314
so I could at least meet her.

445
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,743
I know what that moment was.

446
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,541
It was the night Jane died.

447
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:48,031
What are you
saying?

448
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,909
I went to your place that night
to take you some money.

449
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,287
- Remember?
- Yes.

450
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,124
When I left
and on the way back home.

451
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,185
I stopped for a beer.

452
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,756
It was odd.
I never do that.

453
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,901
But there I was.

454
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,573
I never told you.

455
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,992
That you went for a beer?

456
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:19,413
That's not odd.

457
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,900
I ended up
engaging in a conversation

458
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:27,797
with a complete stranger.

459
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:31,659
But he turned out to be
Juana's father.

460
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,995
Diego.
He was called Diego.

461
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,597
Hold on.

462
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,290
What are you talking
about?

463
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,042
I didn't know
he was Juana's dad

464
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,019
at that time.

465
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,562
I didn't have a clue.

466
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,230
I didn't put it together

467
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,692
until after the crash

468
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,779
when he was all over the news.

469
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:55,532
I then understood

470
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,811
I had been talking to him
that night.

471
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,581
Juana's dad?

472
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,625
You're insane.

473
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,944
Think of the odds
of me going in,

474
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,362
sitting down that night
in that bar

475
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,256
next to that man.

476
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,216
Once I tried to calculate them,

477
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:17,429
but they're astronomical.

478
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,349
I left your house

479
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,376
and got in that place
to take a beer

480
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,479
and run across him, there.

481
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,939
That's incredible.

482
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,398
But it's even more incredible

483
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,900
that him and I

484
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,903
ended up talking.

485
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:40,227
What did you talk
about?

486
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,334
Water on Mars.

487
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,633
And family.

488
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:58,220
Family?

489
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,807
What about family?

490
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,142
I told him that I had a daughter

491
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,731
and he told me he had one too.

492
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,777
And he told me

493
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:17,990
that you can never

494
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,491
give up on family.

495
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,312
That you have to fight
until the end.

496
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:33,213
And that's what I did.

497
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,925
You know?

498
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,718
The universe is totally random.

499
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:42,056
It's simple chaos.

500
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,641
It's subatomic particles

501
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,685
in endless aimless collision.

502
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,589
That's what science
teaches us.

503
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,051
But what about
that encounter?

504
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,430
What about
this extraordinary meeting

505
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,699
between this man and me?

506
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,785
What does it mean?

507
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,605
What does universe
teach us with this?

508
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,249
How can that be random?

509
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,209
Is it fate?

510
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,636
Are you all right?

511
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,680
It's okay.

512
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,585
I was trying to establish
the perfect moment

513
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:31,688
I should have died.

514
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:37,153
It was that night.

515
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,156
I should have died that night.

516
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,574
I should never have left home.

517
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,535
Never go to your house.

518
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,572
Maybe things
would have been different.

519
00:35:56,697 --> 00:36:00,034
I was at home
watching TV.

520
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,702
I don't know
whether I made it up,

521
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,762
but I think I heard Cielo

522
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,765
talking to Valentina.

523
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:12,713
In my mind...
I can hear her singing.

524
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,636
If I had just lived
right up to that moment,

525
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,615
it'd have been perfect.

526
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,433
It's not coming down, is it?

527
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,936
No.

528
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,521
Must be Thailand-hot

529
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,523
up there.

530
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,776
Must be worse than Africa.

531
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:03,280
Africa's hot, right?

532
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,767
- Yes.
- Then that's why.

533
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,812
It's not coming
down.

534
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,773
It's staying up there
forever.

535
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,833
Just wait and see.

536
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,565
What are you doing?

537
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,217
I'm going to
get that bitch.

538
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,986
I'm getting that fly.

539
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,139
Just forget about that
fucking fly.

540
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,598
No, no.
just let me do it.

541
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:51,728
No, you're going to break
your neck.

542
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:54,873
Take it easy.

543
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,277
Seriously,
it's not worth it.

544
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,421
Just let me, will you?

545
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,448
Just listen to me.
You'll kill yourself.

546
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,008
You know what?

547
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,885
Just stop talking

548
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,307
and grab this, okay?

549
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,935
Be careful.

550
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,896
I'm really sorry.

551
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,356
Sorry for what?

552
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,943
Being a lunatic?

553
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,406
I'm sorry about Juana.

554
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:38,625
Yes, me too.

555
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,586
I mean I'm very sorry.

556
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:53,265
It's not your fault.

557
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,978
It's not mine either...

558
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,522
it's not even hers.

559
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,691
We were two junkies

560
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:07,070
with a duffel bag full of cash.

561
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:11,074
You said so yourself.

562
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,912
We both would've been dead

563
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:20,959
within a week.

564
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,544
Things just moved ahead

565
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:26,131
for one of us.

566
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,092
And that's what saved me.

567
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:37,475
But I miss her, though.

568
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,477
Pretty much.

569
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,521
Anyway...

570
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,426
Here it
goes.

571
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,944
Just leave her!

572
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,905
It's not worth it.

573
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,492
What about the contamination?

574
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,746
It's all contaminated.

575
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,607
Just get down
and let's cook.

576
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,129
I definitely scared it.

577
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,048
It'll stay out of the way.

578
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,976
Walter.

579
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,582
Yeah!

580
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,484
Damn it!
Fuck you, bitch!

581
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,990
You see?
I killed it.

582
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,093
Walter, the fly is dead.

583
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,683
Bins are packed?

584
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,143
All of them.

585
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,145
Is production complete?

586
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,465
- Complete.
- Good.

587
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,508
See you
tomorrow.

588
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,553
Don't you want me
to take you home?

589
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:58,183
No, you've already
put up with me enough.

590
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,518
See you
tomorrow.

591
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,662
Whatever.

592
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:24,084
José...
One more thing.

593
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,169
I couldn't chance
saying it inside.

594
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:29,506
For all I know, the lab's
wired for sound.

595
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,192
I'm not accusing you,

596
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,194
but that missing product,

597
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,612
the one I told you about...

598
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,531
José pay attention!

599
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,933
If you had something
to do with this

600
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,351
and these people
find out--

601
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:43,661
I didn't take shit.

602
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,121
I don't have it, all right?

603
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:47,082
Just listen to what I'm saying.

604
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:49,192
If you did have something
to do with this

605
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,835
and these guys find out,

606
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,654
I won't be able
to protect you.

607
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,172
You know what?

608
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,216
No one's asking you

609
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,035
to look after my ass,
all right?

610
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,949
No way.
