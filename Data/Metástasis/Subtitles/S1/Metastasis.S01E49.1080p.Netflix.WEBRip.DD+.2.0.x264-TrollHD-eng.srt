1
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,615
What's going on?

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,784
Some meeting with your lawyers.

3
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,060
- Me?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,163
They're waiting for you.

5
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,591
Hi, Jairo.

6
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,594
Come with me.

7
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,526
Did you hear about Carlitos?

8
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,512
People say he escaped
to Venezuela.

9
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,074
He's dead.

10
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,784
It wasn't me.

11
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,521
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

12
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,482
It was a mistake
made by a third party

13
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,959
who has since been dealt with.

14
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,586
Is that clear?

15
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,254
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,756
The second point.

17
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,200
The deal you had
with Gustavo Cortés

18
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,761
is still in place.

19
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,788
- Okay.
- Don't "okay" me.

20
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,973
Let's speak clearly.

21
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,059
Do you have something to say?

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,877
No, Mario.
I'm keeping my mouth shut.

23
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,337
I didn't say a
word.

24
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,380
The laundry
was right above the lab.

25
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,883
There's no way
I could say I wasn't in on it.

26
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,443
I'm looking

27
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,262
at eight years
minimum.

28
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,431
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

29
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm no rat, and you
know it.

30
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,269
I'm doing my part in
the deal.

31
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:46,024
Good.
The deal is the deal.

32
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,651
What I don't understand is
how
the other party is paying
me.

33
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,628
They seized all my money.

34
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:54,907
How am I supposed

35
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,421
to live in here?

36
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,007
to provide for my family?

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,286
I knew the risks.
We all did.

38
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,832
But the police
and anti-narcotics
left me broken,

39
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,792
and that wasn't
part of the deal.

40
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,628
And I know for a fact they
got Enano and Mugre
yesterday.

41
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,354
They're getting all of us.

42
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,983
All of us with no money.

43
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,759
Now, it's not going to be
me,

44
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:16,154
but remember this.

45
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,180
Absent the hazard pay,
sooner or later,

46
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,598
someone's going to
flip

47
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,284
and will ruin us all.

48
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,620
No one's flipping.

49
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,123
Everyone gets their hazard pay.

50
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,691
I appreciate
what you're saying and
all,

51
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,250
Mario,

52
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,294
but the man is dead.

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,864
The lab's a hole in
the ground.

54
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,241
Where will you get
the money from?

55
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,178
There's something new starting.

56
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,763
It's going to make you whole.

57
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,640
Something new right now?

58
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,559
With the police looking at you?

59
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,436
How?

60
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,856
"How" is my business.

61
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,066
Hanging tight

62
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,318
is your business.

63
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,697
Your family is going to be fine.

64
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,907
You have my word.

65
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,910
Do you need more?

66
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,546
Okay.

67
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,964
Who's next?

68
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,423
That's your choice.

69
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,592
Enano is across town.

70
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,011
Mugre is in Medellín.

71
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,929
Unless we take a plane,

72
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,389
I don't really think

73
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,100
we can visit them all today.

74
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,543
We have to visit
them all today.

75
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,962
We have
to do it.

76
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,010
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So they made me</font></i>
a job offer

77
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:22,613
and...

78
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,474
And here I am.
In action.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,355
I think the best way to
describe what happened to me

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,773
is to say that I
opened my eyes

81
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,900
with a poem
written by William Blake,

82
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:38,003
the English poet.

83
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,881
Recite it.

84
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,241
[laughing
]
No, no.

85
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,576
No, please.
That would be pathetic.

86
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,013
No, please, come on.

87
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,681
Go on.

88
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,959
Basically, there are three
verses of the poem called

89
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,062
"Proverbs of hell",

90
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,423
and it

91
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,401
"The road of excess

92
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,322
leads to the palace of wisdom.

93
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,741
Prudence

94
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,160
is a rich ugly

95
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:12,579
old maid

96
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,067
courted by
incapacity.

97
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:19,319
He who desires
but acts not,
breeds pestilence".

98
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,843
"We are compelled

99
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,637
to consume our lives

100
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,223
today".

101
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,043
I have always thought
if the best thing to do

102
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,213
is to be a good
person.

103
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,648
Because, finally,

104
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,676
nobody is going to applaud
you
for that.

105
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,053
But I think
that this is

106
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,989
the only way to feel

107
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,740
the real pleasure

108
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,826
in life.

109
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,245
And we have to allow ourselves

110
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:57,041
before it's too late.

111
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,044
It's now or never.

112
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,577
- Walter.
- Hi.

113
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,996
What are you
doing?

114
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,098
I'm unpacking.

115
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:16,101
I'm moving back in.

116
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,274
I'll keep the condo for now,

117
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,842
selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

118
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,320
I'll keep it a little longer

119
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,821
to see what happens.

120
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,014
Do you think
this is a good idea?

121
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,532
Yes, yes.

122
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,577
Of course.

123
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,514
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know, my friends,</font></i>

124
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,208
but do you really think
it's necessary

125
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,310
to bring scary Mario here?

126
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,562
You are an amazing pair,

127
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,922
like Batman and Robin,
two friends.

128
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,258
Why do you want to be
the three musketeers?,

129
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,859
Huey, Dewey, and Louie?

130
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,803
You're going to look
like the three stooges.

131
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,321
Okay, okay, Saúl,

132
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,739
we get your idea,

133
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,616
but we need Mario.

134
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,119
You know how this works, Saúl.

135
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,329
Mario knows the distributors

136
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,915
and how to manage them.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,000
I must remind you

138
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,653
he said he was going
to break my legs.

139
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,713
Let's be honest here.

140
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,257
All of us wanted

141
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,867
to break your legs
some time.

142
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,410
- And we didn't.
- Very good!

143
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,453
Thank you very much
for your calming words.

144
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,097
Listen, listen.

145
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,681
Don't take it personal, bro.

146
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,434
Mario threatened me,

147
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,893
he threatened the teacher,

148
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,212
he probably
threatened someone

149
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,547
before breakfast this
morning.

150
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,107
It's what he does.

151
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,385
And that's why we need
them.

152
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,903
Okay, okay.

153
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,947
Let it be noted

154
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,740
that I do this under duress.

155
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,701
Okay. Duly noted.

156
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,383
Tell Mario he can come in.

157
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,690
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">All right, Mario.</font></i>

158
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,900
I want we raise our white flags

159
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,277
and that we don't--

160
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,862
Yes, yes, yes.

161
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,224
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules.

162
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,659
Division of labor.

163
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,854
I handle the business.
You cook the meth.

164
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,457
I don't tell you

165
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,317
how to mix your
chemicals

166
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,861
and you do not tell me
how to take care of
business.

167
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,988
Is that absolutely
clear?

168
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,631
Sure.

169
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,824
All right.
Let's take the tour.

170
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,426
Of course.

171
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,844
Please, Mario, have a seat.

172
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,346
Very good, gentlemen.

173
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,123
Clearly, we're talking
about renting,

174
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,724
not buying.

175
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,642
You need an ongoing business

176
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,353
someplace you can slide in,

177
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,105
do your thing, and remain

178
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,107
anonymous.

179
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,736
That said,

180
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,780
show time.

181
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,205
This is your best bet.

182
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,165
Got machines running,

183
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,209
forklifts,

184
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,752
people coming and going.

185
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,530
You're going to stay
way under the radar.

186
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,384
And the owner's solid.

187
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,995
He can't wait to throw up
a curtain wall,

188
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,205
stack some boxes,
give you the space you need.

189
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,057
Regarding privacy,

190
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,502
he's got his business,
you've got yours

191
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,520
and never the twain shall meet.

192
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,754
Like the successful marriages
do.

193
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,482
The ones that work.

194
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,900
What do you think?

195
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,318
Machines like this

196
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,819
need to have

197
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,530
a lot of power, right?

198
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,056
- That's good.
- Yes.

199
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,575
What about the smell?

200
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,119
More good news.

201
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,146
I've been there
when it's up and running.

202
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,664
This place stinks already.

203
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,500
You'll blend right in.

204
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,461
How many employees?

205
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,878
Good question.

206
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,838
I knew you'd ask.

207
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,882
Sixteen poor people.

208
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,342
They provide for their families

209
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,802
with their earnings here,

210
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,745
so they'll be deaf,
blind and dumb.

211
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,914
Of course you can
investigate them all you want.

212
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,542
If there's somebody
you don't like, we fire him.

213
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,103
What does the alchemist say?

214
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,922
Wait a minute.
Is that a corrugator?

215
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,317
That's an antique.

216
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,635
This machine works
with steam and salt.

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,971
They use it to mould
paper.

218
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,531
And it's really noisy!

219
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,865
It's perfect, right?

220
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,367
Of course not!

221
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,311
Steam and
salt.

222
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,104
When this thing is
running,

223
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,831
it's like a jungle in there.

224
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,249
There's a lot of humidity.

225
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,042
It'll ruin the product.

226
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,752
Can't you just get

227
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,321
a couple of
dehumidifiers

228
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,114
in some construction
store?

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,467
No!

230
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,884
Okay.

231
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,179
Moving on.

232
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,557
Spacious, isolated location,

233
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,392
a lot of light

234
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,060
and , the best of it

235
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,256
you get all the free tortillas
you want.

236
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,774
Sorry.

237
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,234
What's that Saúl?

238
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,611
No, that's my cousin.

239
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,779
Forget about it.

240
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,658
Let's move on.

241
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,618
The problem with that

242
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,495
is that it'll make the tortillas

243
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,455
smell like cat piss.

244
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,040
Somebody's bound to notice that.

245
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,400
There's have to be some kind
of workaround, right?

246
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,084
It's a technical problem.

247
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,028
You guys are technical guys.
Be creative!

248
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,588
No, Saúl.

249
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,840
Anything food-related

250
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,800
is going to have unannounced

251
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,260
government inspections.

252
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,596
We don't want any risk.

253
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,056
Okay, fine.

254
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,474
Gentlemen,

255
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,975
all I'm asking

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,478
is that you keep an open mind

257
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,022
and think real good

258
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,715
before answering
about the next option,

259
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,777
my favorite option.

260
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,279
This one.

261
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,557
- No!
- Not even close!

262
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,158
What's that place?

263
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,744
Don't ask him

264
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,521
because he will end
selling it to you.

265
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,046
Do we have any other option?

266
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,302
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know it's a long shot.</font></i>

267
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,721
But you lose nothing.

268
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,723
We were around here, anyway.

269
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,250
All I can say
to recommend this one

270
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,727
is we're talking about an owner

271
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,729
who is highly amenable

272
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,981
for dirty business.

273
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,611
Gentlemen, here you have it.

274
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,179
If you're going
to break my heart,

275
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,281
please, do it now.

276
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,534
I'll start.

277
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,910
This is way too small.

278
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,370
Saúl, we have no space.

279
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,539
What do we do with the smell?

280
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,040
That thing rolls up,

281
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,375
and we're open to the world.

282
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,876
It's useless.

283
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,878
I don't know if anybody noticed,

284
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,989
but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

285
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,116
It's like being
inside the wolf's mouth.

286
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,427
Okay, so let's go have lunch.

287
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,597
Saúl, what is this for?

288
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,015
That's a protection mesh.

289
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,184
Like a safety net.

290
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,003
They use it to cover
the constructions

291
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,880
or destructions,
like this company,

292
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,923
and to avoid debris
fall over the people

293
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,442
who pass by.

294
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,070
This is perfect!

295
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,947
Didn't you hear him?

296
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,908
What do you mean "perfect"?

297
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,081
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is interesting.</font></i>

298
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,651
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When they're going</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to demolish some place,</font></i>

299
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,737
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">they cover all the front</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of the building with this,</font></i>

300
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,546
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and that lets the house isolated</font></i>

301
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,089
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">from the exterior.</font></i>

302
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,201
Nobody goes in there
because there's nothing
valuable.

303
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,994
But couldn't the neighbors
suspect anything

304
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,013
if they see movements?

305
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,389
No, not at all.

306
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,016
Not at all

307
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,209
because there is always
some kind of watchman.

308
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,019
There is the watchman

309
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,771
and the workers.

310
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,189
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The watchman also prevents</font></i>

311
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,649
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">people to go in with drugs</font></i>

312
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,400
or to look for something else.

313
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,052
And the construction market
is rising,

314
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,887
so we have houses like this
everywhere.

315
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,739
We have places to choose from.

316
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,240
Okay.

317
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,950
And what do we do with smells?

318
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,369
We have to look for houses

319
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,078
or buildings

320
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,106
near those places
that send horrible smells out.

321
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,025
I don't know,
near the river

322
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,127
or some tannery.

323
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,587
Listen, bro.

324
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,047
Speak clear to me.

325
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,757
What the hell is a tannery?

326
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,743
It's a place where the
leather
is processed.

327
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,471
You will smell them.

328
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,891
I think it's an option

329
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,893
we could use.

330
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,394
The problem

331
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,878
is that we have
to move in and out

332
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,605
for every cook.

333
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,591
Set up the lab, cook, and then
take everything down?

334
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,968
- That's terrible, awful.
- No, no, no.

335
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,486
It's challenging but doable.

336
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,946
Take it as a challenge.

337
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,223
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Saúl, did we investigate</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">these people?</font></i>

338
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,283
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, Mario told me</font></i>

339
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,269
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">their contacts in jail</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">know them</font></i>

340
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,829
and we can be relaxed.

341
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,205
This is a family business,

342
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,749
they're three brothers.

343
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,442
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Roberto, the bigger brother,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">he's the owner.</font></i>

344
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,377
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That over there, he's Fernando.</font></i>

345
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,113
And the younger there,
he's Peto.

346
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,531
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They live by this demolition</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">company,</font></i>

347
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:10,009
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">buy they have an extra job.</font></i>

348
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,720
What kind of job?

349
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,955
They are experts
in demolitions,

350
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,415
so they're
magicians

351
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,417
disassembling doors and
locks.

352
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,586
So they rob other
near houses

353
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,772
that they see are empty.

354
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,132
They study the
houses
while they're
working.

355
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,192
And how do you know them?

356
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,678
Because they have
had
legal problems,

357
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,096
they called Saúl
and Saúl helped them.

358
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,407
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">With the right amount of money,</font></i>

359
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,784
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">they can keep their mouths shut</font></i>

360
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,410
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">in a real loyal and clean way.</font></i>

361
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,647
Because hygiene
comes first.

362
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,332
Good energy,
brothers!

363
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,646
Do you think so?

364
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,063
Tripa, bro,

365
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,107
we sound great.

366
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,300
What do you think?
It's out of tune.

367
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,944
Good, boys.

368
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,303
I have some discounts
in guitars,

369
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,722
- if you're interested.
- No, man.

370
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,181
We're looking
for something else.

371
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,809
How do you call
those big cases

372
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,269
where you put all
the equipments?

373
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,704
It's something really big.

374
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,247
Yes, sure.

375
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,607
What size are you
looking for?

376
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,693
- Big.
- The biggest you have, man.

377
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,295
Come, I'll show you.

378
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,532
Recessed hardware, foam
lining,

379
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,259
German wheels.

380
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,053
This is very resistant.

381
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,972
You'll say.

382
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
Man, I have
one question:

383
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,976
How much weight--?

384
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,602
How much weight will this hold?

385
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,480
It's rated for 900 pounds.

386
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,715
So unless your band
plays lead bricks,

387
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,650
you should be okay.

388
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,677
Hey, man, hey!
Enough, enough, stop that!

389
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,154
Let the grown-ups work.

390
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,614
Don't worry about him,

391
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,617
he has some mental problems.

392
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,161
I'm going to need four of them.

393
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,188
- Credit card?
- Cash.

394
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,583
Man, cash.

395
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,045
Cash, bro.

396
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,629
Okay, friends,

397
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,531
I'm going to give you some gift.
I'll throw in stenciling.

398
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,634
What's your band called?

399
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,015
How are you, Tripa?

400
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,291
- Is everything okay?
- How are you?

401
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,626
How's everything
going?

402
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,394
So what?

403
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,021
Are you back?

404
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,731
I'm really back, bro.

405
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,190
Awesome! Good!

406
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,051
Here you have what I
promised.

407
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,655
The boss is loaded, man.

408
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,515
Listen, bro.
If you need something,

409
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,617
anything, just let us know.

410
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,119
Okay. You know it, bro.

411
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,854
If you need references,
let me know.

412
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,497
Mono, why would he?

413
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,774
He has already worked
with us.

414
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,375
Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,695
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

416
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,339
Okay. We better hit it then.

417
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,384
See you later.

418
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,959
Okay, it is the same
job
as always.

419
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,644
You arrive, isolate the house

420
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,087
or the
building

421
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,341
the same way as when you
are going to demolish
it.

422
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,177
Everything's the same
except for one important detail.

423
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,196
No stealing

424
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,615
the houses around.

425
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,033
Exactly!

426
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,701
No stealing.

427
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,995
Not a toothpick,

428
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,605
not the spare change
in the floor.

429
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,315
Nothing

430
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,668
From now on, the houses

431
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,071
around the place
are out of bounds.

432
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,632
Understood?

433
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,301
From time to time,

434
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,328
you're going to see
these two

435
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,013
in the house isolated.

436
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,875
As far as you're
concerned,
they are ghosts.

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,711
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

438
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,921
You don't say
"good morning".

439
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,882
You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

440
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,341
If they tell you to
jump,

441
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,468
you don't ask what
for,

442
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,904
you jump.

443
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,430
Now, you need a name for
them?

444
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,407
You have them.

445
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,268
You call them "yes,
sir"

446
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,371
and "no, sir".

447
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,902
If you have any problems,
you come to me.

448
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,212
That's all.

449
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,009
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Here's the deal.</font></i>

450
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,618
The finishing tank
is a tight fit.

451
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,303
So...

452
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,664
With this motor
you've got here on top...

453
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,708
- The agitation motor.
- The agitation motor on top,

454
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,434
the tank's not going to fit

455
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,394
in the box.

456
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,896
It's just too tall.

457
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,590
Besides, the biggest
equipment's cases

458
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,150
we have

459
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,819
will finish here.

460
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,237
- Right?

461
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,905
Now, I thought

462
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,074
we'd put a collar on the tank

463
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,435
and carry the motor in
separately, alongside
the condenser.

464
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,895
On the day,
we just twist it

465
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,814
into place
while we're setting up.

466
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,085
Yes.

467
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,295
Very good.

468
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,839
Yes, sir.

469
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,033
Do you think the old man
and his guys

470
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,676
can build it up?

471
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,036
Yes, yes.
I know they have bought

472
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,328
a new welder
for the aluminum work.

473
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,014
So...

474
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,874
And if they can pull off
the magnet,

475
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,626
- they can handle this.
- Of course they do.

476
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,144
Now, listen,

477
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,063
about the smell

478
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,965
I was thinking on doing
something I saw in Mexico.

479
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,275
They put some tents

480
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,985
and install several tubes

481
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,678
because there--
Shit.

482
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,263
- Hello!
- Hello.

483
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,408
Hi.

484
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,247
Sorry I'm interrupting.

485
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,706
No, not at all.

486
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,833
We were just wrapping up.

487
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,378
He is Walter.

488
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,613
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

489
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,174
I'm a friend of Jose.

490
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,301
This little man is Byron.

491
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,220
Byron, hi!

492
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,597
I've heard a lot about you.

493
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,266
Pleased to meet you.

494
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,892
Do you know what I've heard?

495
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,019
That you were in the hospital

496
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:56,147
and you were very brave.

497
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,399
I'm sorry, he's really shy

498
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,677
and he mostly just wants
to play his game.

499
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,386
I know them well.
I have two of my own.

500
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,155
And...

501
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,449
Well, I should go.

502
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,767
Don't you want to stay
for dinner?

503
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,227
No, I have...
I have to...

504
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,746
I have several things to do.

505
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,314
No, I mean it.
Stay with us.

506
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,874
At least for a beer.

507
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,626
Okay, yes, thank you.

508
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,778
I'll help Andrea
and bring you the
beer.

509
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,923
Go, please.

510
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,965
Sir.

511
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,468
Gentlemen.

512
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,206
The house has
security cameras.

513
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,474
Don't go to the backyard.

514
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,477
What's your name?

515
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,480
They call me Peto.

516
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,360
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You're listening modern jazz</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">in JMFA.</font></i>

517
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,627
I have to say,
seeing you with
Andrea and that
little boy...

518
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,689
It was nice.

519
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,733
It's good, perfect.

520
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,051
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

521
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,220
Yes, I know.
I like it too.

522
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,197
I feel good. It's nice.

523
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,158
You two look right.

524
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,494
And the way she looks at you?

525
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,079
She looks at you

526
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,482
and I see she wants
something serious with
you.

527
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,208
Do you think so?

528
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,902
And do you want
it?

529
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,505
Well, bro...

530
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,840
That wouldn't bother me at all.

531
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,510
You know?

532
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,620
Of
course.

533
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,973
And what's the plan?

534
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:26,210
What plan do
you mean?

535
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,728
I mean this.

536
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,272
Work.

537
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,967
Are you going to tell her
all the truth?

538
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,611
I don't really have a plan.

539
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,471
I don't even know
what's going to happen tomorrow.

540
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,988
But...

541
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,740
Well, I...

542
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,267
I think she knows
I'm into something,

543
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,952
something weird,

544
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,412
but...

545
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,829
She's not stupid.

546
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,373
But she doesn't ask me

547
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,000
and I didn't tell her anything.

548
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,835
I don't think that changes.

549
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,779
- I'm not going to tell her
anything.
- No, okay.

550
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,781
That's my secret, you
know?

551
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,576
- I'm not telling her that.
-I know, I know.

552
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,077
I believe you,
Jose.

553
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,079
I can't pretend
that this doesn't
affect me.

554
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,390
It does.

555
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,749
You
know?

556
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,518
This is our job.

557
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:10,020
But...

558
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:13,441
I trust you completely.

559
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,444
This has to be your decision.

560
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,571
I mean, you've earned that.

561
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,072
Seriously?

562
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,491
Are you really saying so?

563
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:25,202
I really mean it.

564
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:28,606
Listen, Jose,
I'm speaking from experience.

565
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,166
I can tell you

566
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,626
that secrets

567
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,296
transform and, finally,

568
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,781
create barriers
between people.

569
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,259
All that you've done,

570
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,679
it's a part of you.

571
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,555
That's the truth.

572
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,056
If you choose to spend

573
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,833
the rest of your life
with this person,

574
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,794
then you'll have to
decide

575
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,399
how much of that truth

576
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,777
you'll share with her.

577
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,822
Let me understand.

578
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,141
Let me check
if I'm getting

579
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,743
what you're telling me.

580
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,187
Are you saying
I should tell her everything?

581
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,541
Every little detail?

582
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,250
Like what happened with Guido?

583
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,669
I'm not proud of that.

584
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,086
No, no, Jose, Jose.

585
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,463
I'm just telling you

586
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:21,091
that I trust you

587
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,827
and that I know you're
going
to take the right call.

588
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,348
If she loves you,

589
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,351
she'll understand.

590
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,818
Cielo, no.

591
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,696
I don't like the work

592
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,447
that washing expert

593
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,907
is doing in my car!

594
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,643
He's polishing it
horizontally,

595
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,935
and you're
supposed
to do that in
circles.

596
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,812
I don't mean to tell
him

597
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,872
how he has to work,

598
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,957
but it's simple quality control.

599
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,459
That's called

600
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,044
"processes standardization".

601
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,005
Let's change the subject.

602
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,091
Guess what.

603
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,326
- What?
- Guess what?

604
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,843
No, María.

605
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,345
Now I can't be--

606
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,347
Henry's back at work.

607
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,873
That's
wonderful.

608
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,392
We are happy.

609
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,894
But I don't forget

610
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,130
they laughed him
out of the office

611
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,981
when he told them

612
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,484
about that chicken man.

613
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,679
They said he was crazy.
They didn't believe him.

614
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,238
But he was right.

615
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,198
And he loves his job.

616
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,867
Clearly, if it were me,

617
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,787
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

618
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,855
But it's what he
wants, right?

619
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,315
- He's fine.
- It was moving.

620
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,834
To see him going to work,

621
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,502
with his cane, but walking.

622
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,879
He's alive again.

623
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,423
And I...

624
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,949
I want to thank you
for that, really.

625
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,760
You and Walter.

626
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,161
We couldn't have done it
without your help.

627
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,973
We are really grateful.

628
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,376
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

629
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,018
Yes.

630
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,562
Speaking of husbands,

631
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,089
have you thought about what
you're going to do?

632
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,924
- About what?
- What do you mean "what"?

633
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,719
Walter's birthday
is coming. Did you forget it?

634
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,236
Whatever you need,

635
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,697
I'm here.

636
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,725
I don't
think

637
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,560
we're going to do
anything this year.

638
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,870
What are you talking about?

639
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,813
He was diagnosed around his
birthday, right?

640
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,191
So it's been a whole hard year,
specially for him.

641
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,942
Listen, I've had my problems
with him.

642
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,363
I'm still angry with him
because what he did

643
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,741
when Henry was threatened
and we went home,

644
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,158
all of us protected
by the police,

645
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,118
but I'm trying to forget
all of that

646
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,995
because there are
more important things in life.

647
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,414
- María!
- I really mean it.

648
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,931
At his age, a new birthday?

649
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,350
Cielo, this is really important!

650
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,226
After all he's been through,

651
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,728
you have to celebrate.

652
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,548
We're talking
about another year of life.

653
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,901
What are you doing?

654
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,319
You don't smoke.

655
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,904
You are a grown-up also.

656
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,515
You can't be doing that,
you have to take care
of yourself,

657
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,158
and you can't do this

658
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,560
around Valentina.
I hope you don't.

659
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,978
And you can't smoke
around your employees.

660
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,523
- I know that that is illegal.
- Shut up!

661
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,249
Why do you talk to me like that?

662
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,210
I'm trying to help you.

663
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,945
- I'm' trying to--
- Will you shut up?

664
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,905
- What's wrong with you?
- Shut up!

665
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,657
Shut up! Shut up!

666
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:12,789
Shut up! Shut up!

667
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,889
Shut up!

668
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,572
Cielo.

669
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,784
Cielo.

670
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,000
Done. 1.45 and 1.50.

671
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,963
1.45 and 1.50?

672
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,382
Yes.

673
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:53,679
49 pounds.

674
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,472
Good yield, right?

675
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,975
Excellent.

676
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,918
And now?
What do we do?

677
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,254
- We leave.
- Just like that?

678
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,856
Peto and his people

679
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,608
will destroy this place.

680
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,652
Okay.

681
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,271
- Hi.
- Hi, Walter.

682
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,873
How are you?

683
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,374
I called you ten times.

684
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,818
- I left you messages.
- Yes.

685
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,377
- Hi.

686
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,654
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

687
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,171
I saw your calls,

688
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,132
but I was really busy.

689
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,034
I have a thousand
things going on.

690
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,887
Something happened with you?

691
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,430
Not me, Cielo.

692
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,082
¿Cielo? What?
What happened with Cielo?

693
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,893
Now she's fine,

694
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,352
she's resting,

695
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,630
but she had a
breakdown.

696
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,356
She's very depressed.

697
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,151
¿Very depressed?

698
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,361
And that...?

699
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,155
Who diagnosed her?

700
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,824
I did,

701
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:58,227
because I don't know
what else to call
what happened today.

702
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:01,438
- But, what happened today?
- She started screaming like
some crazy woman.

703
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,940
What did she say
when she was yelling?

704
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,150
She was talking to
me,
she was shouting to
me.

705
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,904
She just yelled, "Shut up,
shut up," over and over again.

706
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,672
And then she started crying.

707
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,114
I don't
know.

708
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,783
What happened?
Are you gambling
again?

709
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,384
No, no.

710
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,703
And how is she?
Is she fine?

711
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,304
Yes. She's sleeping now.

712
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,622
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

713
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,641
Did you know she's smoking?

714
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,100
Yes.

715
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,560
Occasionally, maybe.

716
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,938
It's not a regular thing.

717
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,381
Is it the
cancer?

718
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,508
No, this has nothing
to do with the cancer.

719
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,968
Well, something
happened.

720
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,387
I know Cielo,
she's not like that.

721
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,347
I don't mean to point
the finger,

722
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,057
but I need to know
the truth.

723
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,475
- Tell me!
- María...

724
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,327
You can tell me now.

725
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,621
Okay.

726
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,998
All right, I'll tell you.

727
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:53,090
You heard about Ernesto Silva?

728
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,466
Ernesto, her boss?

729
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,968
Yes, her boss.

730
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,386
No, what happened to him?

731
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,288
- You didn't?
- No, tell me.

732
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,391
To make a long story short,

733
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,810
he fell a couple of weeks ago.

734
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,086
- An accident?
- Yes.

735
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,797
- He died?
- No, no.

736
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,398
Almost.

737
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,650
He gave himself a concussion,

738
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:15,095
and fractured
a couple vertebrae.

739
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,823
He may never walk again.

740
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,282
You can imagine.

741
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,701
Yes, but...

742
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,494
That couldn't explain

743
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,771
why Cielo is in
this situation.

744
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,732
Couldn't that?
Of course it can.

745
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,626
I can understand her feelings.

746
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,504
What?

747
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,340
Don't you know they...?

748
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,009
Didn't she tell you?

749
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,761
Tell me what, Walter?

750
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,954
María, you talk
about everything.

751
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,347
Tell me!

752
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,041
Don't you...?
I messed it up!

753
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,144
I'm a stupid!

754
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,130
Wait a
minute.

755
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,257
She was having an
affair

756
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,817
with Ernesto?

757
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,235
Yes, yes. No.

758
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,195
Yes, but not now.

759
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,655
Not at present.

760
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,032
But, they did?

761
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:03,119
Yes, yes.

762
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,620
Cielo and I

763
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,163
are trying to get back together

764
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,249
and move on.

765
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,047
Walter, I'm sorry.

766
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,506
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

767
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,659
I swear I didn't
know it.

768
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,995
We have been trying to put
things back together,

769
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,472
and then the accident happened.

770
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,015
I understand

771
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,917
this is a lot of pressure
for her right now.

772
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,518
María,

773
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,772
I'm begging you,

774
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,899
please, keep this to yourself.

775
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,901
I'm really asking you.

776
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,820
Please, don't tell

777
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,279
this to Henry.

778
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,364
You know he's a chauvinist,

779
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,950
and I...

780
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,685
I don't want him to think less
of Cielo.

781
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,203
Walter, I'm really sorry.

782
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,663
I'm really, really sorry.

783
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,439
Do you promise me
not to tell him?

784
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,249
I promise, yes.

785
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,070
I'll leave.
I have to
leave.

786
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,089
I'll walk you out.

787
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,381
No, relax, you don't have to.

788
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,010
I'm sorry.

789
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:03,929
Thanks.

790
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,790
- Say hi to Henry.
- Yes.

791
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,602
Tell Cielo to call me.

792
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,547
Yes,
yes.

793
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,401
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Once upon a time,</font></i>

794
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,387
there was a princess
with big green eyes

795
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,989
who was recognized

796
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,682
because she had
a diamond here.

797
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,202
She's beautiful, right?

798
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,937
The princess lived
in her castle

799
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,454
in the top of the mountain,

800
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,457
that had 15 rooms.

801
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,504
The princes lived far, far way.

802
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,509
Are you okay?

803
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,304
Yes, I'm okay.

804
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,516
Are you sure?

805
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,561
Yes.

806
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,034
Where were we?

807
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,577
Okay, once upon a time,

808
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:09,895
there was a princess
with big green eyes

809
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,815
who lived far away
in the mountain.

810
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,307
What about that?

811
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,375
Look at that, dad!
My favorite gun!

812
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,395
M60.

813
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,398
Okay, okay, okay.

814
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,987
Hi.

815
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:47,032
Have a seat.

816
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,288
Argh!

817
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,443
That's
awful.

818
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,843
Okay, this is our share.

819
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,679
80.000 dollars each.

820
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,266
No, wait a second, Mario.

821
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,184
After the payroll,

822
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,004
the dealers,
the
demolishers,

823
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,731
we should have 270.000.

824
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,984
I don't understand it.

825
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,053
You're forgetting
about the mules.

826
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,570
30.000 for them.

827
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,030
30.000?

828
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,531
All that money?

829
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,559
They are taking a risk.
We have to pay them.

830
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,328
Yes, but...

831
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,730
What did Gustavo pay his
mules?

832
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,816
Gustavo didn't use mules.
He didn't need them.

833
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,376
He spent 20 years

834
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,087
building his own distribution.

835
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,906
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

836
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,175
And you know where they are now?

837
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,635
Government impound.

838
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,305
You don't like paying the mules?

839
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,290
Maybe you shouldn't have
killed him.

840
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,184
Hey, hey, hey.

841
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,501
There's still a lot
of money here,

842
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,295
and just from one
cook.

843
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,106
Relax.

844
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,066
I'll be good this time,

845
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,594
since you're putting on
the green eyeshade.

846
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,181
My supplier and I
came to an agreement.

847
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:12,101
The methylamine was free
this time.

848
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,663
But brace yourself,

849
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,081
because the next barrel

850
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,877
is going to cost big.

851
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,379
Can we continue,

852
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,654
or you have anymore
burning questions?

853
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,989
No, no, no.
Go on.

854
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,549
Okay.

855
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,510
Only José and me

856
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,746
had the money to start
the business,

857
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,639
so you owe us that, Walter.

858
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,433
Jose, thanks for that.

859
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,476
Good.

860
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,937
We have to pay

861
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,690
the old man and his guys

862
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,318
because they built

863
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:49,321
the portable lab.

864
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,326
This is Saúl's cut.

865
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,538
Legacy cost.

866
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,440
Legacy?
What's that?

867
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,042
There are nine guys

868
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,069
that were part
of the previous operation.

869
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,879
They are in jail

870
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,381
and they know a lot.

871
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,074
This is the cost
of their silence.

872
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,800
Police and anti-narcotics

873
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,595
seized their hazard pay,

874
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,205
so we are going to make
them whole.

875
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,848
Poor guys!

876
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,167
But why are we paying
them?

877
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,310
These were Gustavo's employees.

878
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,338
They might have been
Gustavo's employees,

879
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,606
but they're my guys.

880
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,066
Really?

881
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,525
So what are they doing

882
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,278
to further our interests?

883
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:31,471
The cops are looking at them
very closely.

884
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,073
We don't want them

885
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,309
furthering our interests
before the cops.

886
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,868
We want them far from us.

887
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,870
So why are we paying them?

888
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,538
Because it's what you do.

889
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,165
No, it's what you do.

890
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,193
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.
We make them whole.

891
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:45,861
- As simple as that.
- Not that simple.

892
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,696
It sounds like a simple
shakedown.

893
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,172
We're paying for their silence.

894
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,673
That's blackmail.

895
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,450
This is what we do
in this business.

896
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,994
- End of story.
- No, sir!

897
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,553
Hey, hey.

898
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,055
This is your problem.

899
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,390
It should come out of your end.

900
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,058
Okay, okay.

901
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,252
If it's that important,
just take it out of mine.

902
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:03,920
I don't care.
Here you have.

903
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,440
No, Jose, it's okay.

904
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,400
I'll pay my share.

905
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,777
Don't worry.

906
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,321
Let me tell you something.

907
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,931
This is how it's going to be
from here on out.

908
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,267
My guys are ongoing expenditure,
Walter.

909
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,203
Take it as it is.

910
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,372
35.000 dollars.

911
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:23,832
That's less

912
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:26,042
than with Gustavo.

913
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,086
Listen, Walter,

914
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,922
just because you shot the boss

915
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,883
don't make you the boss.

916
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,110
Jose, are you okay?

917
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,364
Yes, I guess.

918
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,723
Are you
sure?

919
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,684
You are not
the same.

920
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:02,745
Well...

921
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,832
Bye.

922
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,421
Broke it off with Andrea.

923
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,964
She told me

924
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,799
she's going to tell Brock today.

925
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,301
I'm thinking about that.

926
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,678
I'm still going to take care

927
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,138
of the rent and stuff.

928
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,973
But the working situation--

929
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,475
I meant this.

930
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,185
What happened inside.

931
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,463
The money
distribution.

932
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,980
And I'm telling you

933
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,399
my personal problems.

934
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:31,900
Thanks for asking,

935
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,761
I'm going to be fine.
Bitch.

936
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:39,324
So what?

937
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,783
About the money,

938
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,869
you're looking at it wrong.

939
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,329
You know?

940
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,789
We cooked for Gustavo

941
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,208
about 220 ponds a week.

942
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,335
And now, despite it's good,

943
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,795
we have 50 pounds.

944
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,256
We maybe cleared less money,

945
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:55,782
but we have a bigger piece
of the pie.

946
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,759
It's like you said,

947
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,554
now we're owners, not employees.

948
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,180
That's the thing.

949
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,599
I've been thinking

950
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,225
about Victor.

951
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,543
- Víctor?
- Yes.

952
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,103
Not Víctor himself,

953
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,797
but the moment
Gustavo

954
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,400
cut his throat.

955
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,177
Why are you thinking
about that, man?

956
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,594
- Are you insane?
- I don't know.

957
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,155
Maybe because...

958
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:20,657
All this time I was sure

959
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:21,975
that Gus did what he
did

960
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,453
to send us a message.

961
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:25,954
And now?

962
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,564
Maybe there's another
reason.

963
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,900
Víctor decided to cook
that batch on his own.

964
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,402
Do you
understand?

965
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,904
He took liberties
that weren't his to take.

966
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,673
He went too far.

967
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,783
- No.
- What Gustavo did

968
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,495
was just a business
measure.

969
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,789
Listen, Walter,
I will tell you this just once.

970
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,918
Forget those ideas
you have, Walter.

971
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,838
I know Mario very well
and he's a good guy.

972
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,984
He knows what his place is.

973
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,320
I hope so.

974
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:01,097
Because I know very
well what my place is.
