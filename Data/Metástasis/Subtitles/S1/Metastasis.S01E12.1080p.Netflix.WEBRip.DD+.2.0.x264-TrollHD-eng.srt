1
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:35,553
Look what I found, babe!

2
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,179
Tell me how they look on me.

3
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,654
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, we've come a long way,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walt.</font></i>

4
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,505
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We're at the end of round one.</font></i>

5
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,073
Now I'm going to recommend
cautious optimism.

6
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,287
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded

7
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,848
and decide our next move.

8
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,417
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

9
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,978
Yes.

10
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,674
Try to think of this
as good timing,
you'll start feeling better

11
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,342
and your hair
should start to come back.

12
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,386
I got used
to the old cue ball look.

13
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:37,640
It's a new look!
A lot of people use it.

14
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,062
So, no more confusion?
Nothing?

15
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,330
No.

16
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,999
Absolutely none.

17
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,902
And, Walter,
how are you two holding up?

18
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,882
Fine, fine.

19
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:02,581
We're busy, but we're good.
Absolutely.

20
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,045
- How are you?
- How are you, Mr. Walter?

21
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,129
So, we're not going through
an insurer, right?

22
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,551
No, but it's okay.
Make the invoice out to me.

23
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,528
Okay. I'll print it out for you.

24
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,954
Here.

25
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,819
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

26
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,630
Absolutely. It's included.

27
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,423
See? There it is.

28
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,536
Just a reminder, Walter.
Here at the Institute

29
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,539
we have a payment plan
adapted to the needs
of every patient.

30
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,141
In case you are interested.

31
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,645
Mr. Walter!

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,523
The hope pin.

33
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,470
- Thanks.
- God bless you.

34
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,923
Then, what about the MRI?

35
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,289
Then what's the difference
between diagnosis
and treatment?

36
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,627
But his doctor ordered it.
It should be covered.

37
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:38,844
I'm sorry you couldn't be
of more help, too. Okay.

38
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,155
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,282
Bitch.

40
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,745
Hey.

41
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,987
Been around someone
who smokes?

42
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,172
No.

43
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,175
The hospital bill came.

44
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,053
That was fast.

45
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,805
Twenty million.

46
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,044
We could pay Junior
a year of college with that.

47
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,215
Is this something that Marcela
and Edgar might cover?

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,650
'Cause we've got no money.

49
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,515
I'm sure they will. Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,991
Okay.

51
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,813
Henry.

52
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,819
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry.</font></i>

53
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:09,513
Five minutes?
I'll see you in my office.

54
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,738
Bring me up to speed
on Tuco Salamanca.

55
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,824
- Dead.
- Still?

56
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,885
More than yesterday.

57
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,386
Okay, then.

58
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,348
Thanks for stopping by.

59
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,599
That's how the DA spoke!

60
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,462
Okay. All right, then.
What happened?

61
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,024
Let's see, what can I tell you?

62
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,346
Things are suspiciously quiet
out there.

63
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,265
Not a lot of blue crystal
on the streets right now.

64
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,367
That's good.

65
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,663
Although, with Tuco's death

66
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,234
I'm waiting to see who rallies
the roaches now that his turf
is up for grabs.

67
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,587
Yeah, right. No takers so far?

68
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,714
Are there?

69
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,344
We keep hearing a name.

70
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,579
"Jaisenber"
or something like that.

71
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,789
Every dime-bagger we come across
name him.

72
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,392
Jaisenber or Heisenberg?

73
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,810
That one. A gringo.

74
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,671
Heisenberg,
the Nobel Prize in physics.

75
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,093
It must be
some kind of an alias.

76
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,196
Like a smokescreen they use.

77
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,032
Maybe he doesn't even exist.

78
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,076
All I know for sure

79
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,479
is that somebody somewhere
is still cooking

80
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,873
blue crystal meth.

81
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,125
You know why sharks

82
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,278
are at the top
of the food chain?

83
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,115
'Cause they have
three sets of teeth, I guess.

84
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,453
And also because
they pursue their prey
along thousands of miles.

85
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,637
Yeah, I think I heard that.

86
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,348
You, my friend

87
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,184
are a great white.

88
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,878
That's right.
A great white.

89
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,965
That's why we want
to send you to do some training

90
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,943
with the Mexico Border Police.

91
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,904
And with the DEA.

92
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,989
How does it sound?

93
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:23,647
Well, sir
it's a great opportunity.

94
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,332
Of course it is!

95
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,626
But you deserve it.

96
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,462
It was you who opened our eyes

97
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,990
about all this business
of methamphetamine.

98
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,828
And that's why
we've gone so far.

99
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,805
I am honored, sir.

100
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,125
- Thank you very much.
- My friend

101
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,310
you deserve it.

102
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,425
You already thought
what you gonna do without me?

103
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,719
No?
Come on, Gómez. Gómez.

104
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,515
Are you gonna miss me?
Tell me the truth.

105
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,225
You know what I'm gonna do?
Celebrate.

106
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,826
What? How's that?

107
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,480
Not having to see you every day
is like a reward.

108
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,399
Very funny.
You know why they send me

109
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,586
and not any of you?

110
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,363
Because I did understand
that in this job

111
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,948
what you need is...
Gómez?

112
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,285
- Sensitivity.
- Yes.

113
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,078
- That's right.
- No, no.

114
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,747
This isn't only
about the brains and the brawn.

115
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,584
So you should take your chance
and learn.

116
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,463
I'm surprised his head
still fits through the door.

117
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,340
Hey, listen,
you wanna grab lunch?

118
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,343
Let's have a beer
to celebrate. Nice.

119
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,345
You got promoted,
so it's on you.

120
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,363
Sure, it's on me.

121
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,517
You better not start crying
and writing letters, desideratas

122
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,368
and all that stuff, okay?

123
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,869
All right?

124
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,356
Okay, see you later.
All right.

125
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,669
See you.

126
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,962
Hello.

127
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,381
Mr. Ricardo.

128
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,846
Congratulations, my major.

129
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,764
Thank you!

130
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,808
Good morning, major.

131
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,502
Congratulations!
You're going to Mexico?

132
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,755
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Órale</font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> !</font>
See you later.

133
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,785
How much are they paying him?

134
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,105
There're players here, buddy.
No, no, no.

135
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,484
What took you so long?
It's a Colombian lunch,
not a Mexican one.

136
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,027
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Move, move.

137
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,798
Where are we going?

138
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,365
Hey, dude.

139
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,435
You got some nerve
coming back here.

140
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,203
Or you're dumber than I thought.

141
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,122
Maybe both, yo.

142
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,582
Look.

143
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,084
Here you are.

144
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:02,741
Balance for the tow, the
repairs and extra for damages

145
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,384
to the toilet door, bro.

146
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,953
Look, like I said,
my word is my bond.

147
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,416
It's in full.
Count it.

148
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,585
- All right.
- Okay?

149
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,146
Dude, I need another favor.

150
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,424
What would you charge me
to store this bus here?

151
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,860
Five hundred million.

152
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,780
Come on, yo. Are you nuts?

153
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,824
Dude, I'm being cool.

154
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,575
I kept my word.

155
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,477
We could negotiate.
But five hundred million?

156
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,858
- Five million, then.
- A month?

157
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,110
- A week.
- For real?

158
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,254
Go. Get off now.

159
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,281
All right, buddy.
A week. Okay.

160
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,509
Twenty million a month.

161
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,469
But then you'll give me a key.

162
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,914
- What for?
- What do you think?

163
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,291
For twenty million,
I should get in and out

164
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,352
as I please.

165
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,339
- Okay.
- Good.

166
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,841
Month to month.
Cash up front.

167
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,219
- All right.
- But I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

168
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,029
Fine. Understood.

169
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,114
There's something else.

170
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,659
You selling that? How much?

171
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,077
Thirty million.

172
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,797
What about that one?

173
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,343
Serious?

174
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,116
Your name's Juana, right?

175
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,410
Yeah.

176
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,787
I had an entire house before

177
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,706
detached and all.

178
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,443
But all the lawn care
and upkeep.

179
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,754
I was just tired.

180
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,323
The blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

181
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,884
And utilities are included.

182
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,469
Okay.

183
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,972
Hey, and you got cable?

184
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,334
Yes. Internet too.
You have to call to activate it.

185
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,046
I like the main bedroom
very much.

186
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,634
And the bathroom has tiles.
Awesome.

187
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,946
There are three rooms, then?

188
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,390
If I got drunk,
I wouldn't use

189
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,033
these stairs, for sure.

190
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,162
So? You're interested?

191
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,623
Definitely.

192
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,584
And you're good with NPNS?

193
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,836
Sorry. What?

194
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,129
No smoking, no pets.

195
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,448
You want to smoke,
you do it outside.

196
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,800
It's cool. No worries.

197
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,093
Okay.

198
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,013
I need the last income statement

199
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,749
a labor certificate,
the last payslip

200
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,752
a guarantor with real state
and former address.

201
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,604
The usual drill.

202
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,314
Get me all the papers.

203
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,257
If it's all copasetic,
I'll call.

204
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,651
Okay.

205
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:13,031
See, I could pay in advance.

206
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,492
Unbelievable.

207
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,729
I'm currently
in-between situations.

208
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,606
- Please.
- No. I'm not renting like that.

209
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,458
I got all the money.

210
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,985
I'll always pay on time.
Please.

211
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,279
My dad's not really
a "make exceptions" kind of guy.
Trust me.

212
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,990
- Your dad?
- Yes, he owns the place.

213
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,384
I help him manage it.

214
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,704
Look, if you can fill
in the papers

215
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,789
you do it
and get me the rest.

216
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,291
If not, go run your game
somewhere else.

217
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,686
I got nowhere else to go.

218
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,146
And I got no game.

219
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,732
Really, I just need a chance.

220
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,734
Please.

221
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,362
I'll be honest with you.

222
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,990
My folks, they kicked me out.

223
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,492
I'm a disappointment.

224
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,828
Now I'm like Cain for them.

225
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,873
I swear, I'm a good person.

226
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,233
And I work hard.
I will pay you on time.

227
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,653
Please, help me.
Come on.

228
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,285
Rent just went up.
Two hundred thousand more
a month.

229
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,912
- Cash price.
- Okay.

230
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,914
You won't regret it.
Thank you!

231
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,500
Two months upfront,
nonrefundable.

232
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,462
- Okay.
- You mess this up, I leave you

233
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,047
- like Barbie's boyfriend.
- Gotcha.

234
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,275
Like Barbie's boyfriend?

235
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,028
With no balls.

236
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,222
I see.
- I live next door.

237
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,534
Really?

238
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,036
Yes.

239
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,440
So, if you blow this my friends
will have your skinny ass out.

240
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,358
- Okay.
- Fill this in.

241
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,444
Just sign your name.
I'll take care of the rest.

242
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,046
It's José, right?

243
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,593
Jose. Jose what?

244
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,301
Mercado.

245
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,247
Mercado, like the name
of the supermarket.

246
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,668
Yeah.
Thanks for the explanation.

247
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,940
Here too.

248
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,516
Ta-da.

249
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,604
Let's see.

250
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,575
What are you doing?

251
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,744
What's it look like, honey?

252
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,023
One of the two things
I like most in life.

253
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:13,653
Brewing.
Come on, taste this one.

254
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,531
The fermentation process
is much more elaborate.

255
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,908
- It's a lager. Taste it.
- No.

256
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,801
And tell me if you liked it.

257
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,495
No, it'll give me a stomachache
this big.

258
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,972
Okay, your loss.

259
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,516
It's a "Henry Special."

260
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,977
So, let me get this straight.

261
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,728
You called in sick today.

262
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,190
They're making you an offer

263
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,025
to go to Mexico.

264
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,219
We both know
that means a promotion

265
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,863
that is, more money.

266
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,348
And you, not only
didn't give them an answer

267
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,450
but prefer to stay home

268
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,978
brewing beer
like a retired cop

269
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,897
- Okay, all right.
- who is growing

270
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,565
- a pot belly.
- Relax.

271
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,291
Don't tell me to relax!

272
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,211
Don't you ever tell me to relax.

273
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,379
Sorry.

274
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,118
David said I should express
what I feel

275
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,386
especially, if it upsets me.

276
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,831
María, what's wrong
with me staying here

277
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,267
taking a day off?

278
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,962
I want to work and to think.
What's the matter?

279
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,758
Why don't you go back
the way you came

280
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,070
so I can see your beautiful ass?

281
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,405
Yes or no?

282
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,589
That's it.

283
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,799
ll right, then!

284
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,384
All right.

285
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,434
Mother fucker!

286
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,987
Okay, so what's the plan
now?

287
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,630
Which plan?

288
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,881
This plan.

289
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,302
The plan is we cook.

290
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,095
We produce.

291
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,265
To sell it to whom exactly?

292
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,250
How much do you think you
can sell on your own?

293
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,460
Say if I cooked during the days
and you worked the nights.

294
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,104
Dude, come on.

295
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,589
What? Prior to Tuco, that
was your plan, wasn't it?

296
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,925
I know we'll produce
much less than before.

297
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,860
But still, what do we do?

298
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,905
What do we do?

299
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,201
First of all, there's no "we."

300
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,036
There's no "us" here.

301
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,565
You're talking me,
selling product here and there

302
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,734
in personal doses
on the streets.

303
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:01,154
I got profile now, bro.
Don't forget that.

304
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,881
Anti-Narcotics already know me.

305
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,534
I'm not risking my ass
for chump change.

306
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,995
- Then what do you suggest?
- No way!

307
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,456
You want us to jump into bed
with another crazy one
like Tuco?

308
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,933
Hell, no.

309
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,394
I got bills too, man!

310
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,546
- Responsibilities.
- You've got bills?

311
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,173
- Yeah.
Poor thing.

312
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,800
I've got rent
and services to pay.

313
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,470
I've already lost
more than I have made.

314
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,989
And to be honest

315
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,142
I am tired of dicking
around out here.

316
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,103
- You know how much I've lost?
- Tell me.

317
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,896
You want to know
how much I've got left?

318
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,664
After paying for treatment

319
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,317
and financing
our weekend alibi?

320
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,127
Zero! Zip! Nothing!

321
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,046
Nothing for my family

322
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,699
which, as you might remember,
was the damn point!

323
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,349
Listen to me, Jose.

324
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,584
Throwing in the towel
is not an option here.

325
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,313
That leaves us with two choices.

326
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,924
We go into business
with a homicidal lunatic

327
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,443
or you and I...

328
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,071
You selling whatever you can.

329
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,409
Well, no.

330
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,745
There's a third way.

331
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,788
What would that be?

332
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,292
We got to be Tuco.

333
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,821
Cut out the middle man.
Run our own game.

334
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,240
Right.
So you're going to, what?

335
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,633
Snort meth off a bowie knife

336
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,594
with some Texan boots on?

337
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,205
You gonna beat your homies
to death when they dis you?

338
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,083
For once in your life,
listen to me!

339
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,685
Look, I know some guys.

340
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,978
We can create a network.

341
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,356
What we should do

342
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,301
is to control distribution
and production.

343
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,927
That way,
we stay off the streets

344
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,780
while moving some serious glass.

345
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,682
We start to make money,
sky-high stacks.

346
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,558
- That's the point, right?
- No. No.

347
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,770
- Why not?
- I am not willing to do that!

348
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,315
- I don't agree.
- You don't agree?

349
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,317
- No!
- I have bad news for you.

350
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,069
- You don't get to vote.
- Listen to me.

351
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,364
I don't want to get anyone else
involved in this organization.

352
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,991
You know what, yo?
I'm so sorry.

353
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,284
- I beg your pardon?
- Yes.

354
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,719
This is a partnership, remember?

355
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,206
And we had a division of labor
at the beginning.

356
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,043
Remember?
You cook, I sell.

357
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,170
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

358
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,855
Because if it had been like that

359
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,091
I wouldn't have found myself
locked in a trunk

360
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,859
or humiliated

361
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,154
or with a gun to my head

362
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,989
or behind bars.

363
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,933
All that happened
after you came along.

364
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,206
All right.

365
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,735
I will admit I made mistakes
because I was overly ambitious.

366
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,820
But it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

367
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,949
Damn straight.
You're damn right.
You know why?

368
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:57,621
'Cause we do things my way
this time, or I walk, bro.

369
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,267
You need me more

370
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,478
than I need you, Walter.

371
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,937
Think about it.

372
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,021
- All right.
- Come on.

373
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,647
- Quick.
- Thanks.

374
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,363
- El Tripa.
- What's up, brother?

375
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,864
- What is it, dude?
- You okay?

376
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,451
- Oof.
- My...

377
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,828
- Duplex and stuff.
- It's awesome, bro!

378
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,347
Yep.

379
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,207
Welcome to my humble abode,
bitches.

380
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:46,587
This is cool.
It echoes and everything!

381
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,173
- Hello, hello!
- Hey, hey!

382
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,260
Let me quickly give you
a virtual tour.

383
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,390
My room is upstairs.
Look, on this wall

384
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,851
a huge HD screen,
fifty inches, buddy.

385
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,245
The biggest one.

386
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,374
Buddy, you should buy 3 D!

387
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,985
Homo, porno 3 D!
3-D ta-tas right in your face.

388
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,003
Easy, jerk.

389
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,589
And here, right where you are

390
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,592
a pair of big trendy chairs

391
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,410
reclinomastic whatever,
like a cinema.

392
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,929
That's what I'm talking about!

393
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,706
I'm gonna leave the rest
as it is

394
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,725
empty, a minimalist style.

395
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,103
That's the new craze now, right?

396
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,271
Listen, buddy.

397
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,423
Use some Feng Shui stuff.
It rocks!

398
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,149
No, I mean it!

399
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,511
It's for the energy
and what not.

400
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,321
And I'm thinking of putting

401
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,474
just a bunch of candles
for relax.

402
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,310
- A massaging bed.
- The ladies like that.

403
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,980
The candles
and all that spiritual stuff.

404
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,318
This homo is setting up
a motel, buddy.

405
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,002
You see?

406
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,654
- The reclino--
- Let's get down to it.

407
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,407
There's some refreshments
over here
if you want to partake.

408
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,134
You got any other refreshments?

409
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,387
Yeah, don't you have some?

410
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,180
It's been days I don't smoke.

411
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,999
- No, not here.
- I'm in, dude.

412
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,560
No beer, no weed and no bomb.

413
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,004
We're talking business here,
okay?

414
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,257
So listen up.
This is how it goes.

415
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,735
I front each of you an ounce.

416
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,472
You sell it for five million.
I keep four

417
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,617
you keep one. No cutting it.

418
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,228
Five million an ounce?
That's too much!

419
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,188
- He's nuts!
- Yeah, dude.

420
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,023
Three and a half
so we can sell it quick.

421
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,126
You don't get it.

422
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,362
You have never tasted a
product of such quality. Ever.

423
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,714
And it's dry out there.

424
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,408
Or who else is selling
right now?

425
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,118
- No, nobody else.
- Okay.

426
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:45,831
So you point it how you want.
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

427
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:50,086
But I make what I make.
Four million. No exceptions.

428
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:53,648
Cut it, you're out.

429
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,552
Short me, you're out.
Understood?

430
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,804
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

431
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,490
We'll make money big time.

432
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,183
All right?
Badger, what is this?

433
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,451
What am I giving you?

434
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,499
A big opportunity.

435
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,444
- Exactly.
- That's right, bitches!

436
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,029
This is the ground floor.
How far you go

437
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,215
is up to you, gentlemen.

438
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,675
All right?

439
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,260
Now, I got mad volume.

440
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,012
So bring out the product, yo.

441
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,499
No, not here, all right?
Not ever.

442
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,376
I'm not risking our necks
like that.

443
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,478
We're doing blind drops.

444
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,214
I will let you know
when and where.
But never here.

445
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,717
All right?
Let's get on to work, dude!

446
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,994
It's an armpit.

447
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,814
The border between the US
and Mexico is horrible.

448
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,208
And cartels are worse than here.

449
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,777
There they open up dead bodies
and take their hearts out.

450
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,238
They cut them here
so their tongue sticks out.

451
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,240
They hang them.
Those things don't happen here.

452
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,660
Pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

453
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,163
But I thought
they would send you to D.F.

454
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,666
If they want you
to train with the DEA

455
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,167
why don't they send you
to Washington?

456
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,393
Why sending you to that armpit?

457
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,895
Or if it's Mexico, fine.

458
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,298
But a weekend in Acapulco,
at the very least!

459
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,858
Just a weekend!

460
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,234
Cielo?

461
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,361
I'm just saying.

462
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:07,014
- You finished, Walter?
- Yes, thank you.

463
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,661
You do this.

464
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,912
And then you take it.

465
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,086
Uncle, what's the name of that?

466
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,881
"Sineruto."

467
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,666
I saw some beautiful hotels
in D.F.

468
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,643
Such a pity!

469
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,144
I would've loved to go.

470
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,090
All that Mexican culture
of the flowers

471
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:45,052
the food and the colors
seems amazing to me!

472
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,071
I was talking to Merlinda

473
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,573
Henry's boss's wife.

474
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,116
The one with the helmet hair

475
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,018
- and the permanent brow--
- Shh.

476
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,329
Shh.

477
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,165
Apologize.

478
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,000
What?

479
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,237
I will not listen
to one more word
until you apologize.

480
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,548
For?

481
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,966
You know perfectly well.

482
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,494
Obviously I have no idea
what you're talking about.

483
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,348
Because you lied to me!

484
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,333
Because I almost ended up in
jail 'cause you robbed a store.

485
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,770
For everything, María.

486
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,962
Do you really think
you can go on like that?

487
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,147
As if nothing had happened?

488
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,634
If you hadn't tried
to return it--

489
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,485
Apologize!

490
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,447
Now or never.

491
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,867
Cielo

492
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,119
why are you punishing me?

493
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,709
If you don't respect me enough

494
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,446
to apologize,
to tell me the truth...

495
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,560
I need my sister back.

496
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,196
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,205
Uncle, I want the gory details

498
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,124
like you always tell me.

499
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,667
No, you don't.

500
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,698
Not this time, buddy.
It'll keep you up at night.

501
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,701
- So was it scary?
- Hell, yeah.

502
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,369
But you were
way faster than him.

503
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,622
I'm here telling you
the whole story, aren't I?

504
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,849
You're right.

505
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,184
But the stiff was another.

506
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,979
Junior.

507
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,564
Nah, it's fine.

508
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,608
You know what it is?

509
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,178
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge.

510
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,723
You see it
and you don't think about it.

511
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,158
You just go and...

512
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,453
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">C'est fini.</font></i>

513
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,331
Where do they come from?

514
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,279
Those guys, those crooks
like the one you dealt with.

515
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,340
What makes them who they are?

516
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,928
No.

517
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,596
I don't know.

518
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:22,418
All I know
is they're like the roaches.

519
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,589
You don't know
where they come from.

520
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,485
But there's a whole armada.

521
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,408
Be right back.

522
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,089
What up, man?

523
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,843
Okay, get off.

524
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,247
What's up, man? Sold.

525
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,075
Just joking, buddy.

526
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,216
Cops. Cops! Run!

527
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,411
Son of a bitch!
It's the cops! Run, buddy!

528
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,221
Fucking cops.

529
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,415
They can't leave you alone,
mother fuckers. Run.

530
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,876
Run! Come on!
Hurry up!

531
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,169
Over here, buddy!
Come on!

532
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,465
- Look. Look at him!
- The money.

533
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,468
- Asshole! You fell for it!
- Easy, man.

534
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,403
What else have you got?

535
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,932
- I can't believe it!
- I've got no more.

536
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,934
- Asshole.
- He's got no more.

537
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,103
- Bye, dude. Bye.
- Let's go. Let's go.

538
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,795
Open!

539
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,464
Bitch!

540
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,883
I wasn't sure it was you.
New car?

541
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,944
You know I go for the classics.

542
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,556
- Great ride! Congratulations.
- Thanks.

543
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,433
And this one doesn't bounce
like the other?

544
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,704
It works fine for now, yo.

545
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,819
Your half.
Thirty three million.

546
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,546
Yeah, you're welcome.

547
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,382
What a prick.

548
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,243
Help me understand the math,
okay?

549
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,345
I gave you one pound, correct?

550
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,166
It's 15 million
for every three ounces.

551
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,959
That's seven million
and a half each.

552
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,103
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

553
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,047
Five times seven million
and a half
it's 37 million and a half.

554
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,815
Not thirty three!

555
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:42,052
Wow, apart from a chemist,
now you're a mathematician.

556
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,322
Something came up.

557
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,574
Something came up?

558
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,438
Tripaseca got held up
by a couple junkies.

559
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,499
Lost an ounce and some money.

560
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,819
But it's cool, okay?
Shit happens.

561
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,130
Sorry?

562
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:04,533
Your guy got robbed
or, rather, you got robbed

563
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:08,245
- but it's cool?
- Walter, they're incidentals.

564
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,456
Any business considers them
in the percentages.

565
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,143
Even supermarkets consider

566
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:17,754
their employees may drop bottles
by accident, right?

567
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,175
- So it's normal.
- These things happen!
It's breakage.

568
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,053
You're sweating me
over five million?

569
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:26,138
No, sorry.
You're right.

570
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,448
I'm just the chemist here.

571
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,494
I'm not the street guy, yo.

572
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,438
But it seems to me
that what you call "breakage"

573
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,900
is just you
making a fool of yourself.

574
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,236
No! I've got
another technical term for you.

575
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,989
"Non-sustainable
business model."

576
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,659
Have you noticed,
Walter, you only

577
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:51,621
focus on the negative?
Really, dude.

578
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,017
We're making ten millions a day.

579
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,603
What's your fucking problem?

580
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,980
Tell me something, Jose.

581
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,523
What?

582
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,361
What happens when word gets out?

583
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,988
When those morons you hired

584
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,224
pluck up courage?
No, tell me.

585
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,393
What happens
once everyone knows

586
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,230
"that José Miguel Rosas,
the drug lord

587
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,399
that moron
can be robbed with impunity"!?

588
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,750
That's not gonna happen.

589
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:21,902
- No?
- No.

590
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,087
You think Tuco had breakage?

591
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:30,535
And if he happened to have any
he handled it himself.

592
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,095
Tuco.

593
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,832
Are you really comparing me
with Tuco?

594
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,127
You want another five million?
Is that it?

595
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,562
Jose, that's not the point!

596
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,731
Take it. There.

597
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,092
- It's not that!
- Then what is it?

598
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,027
What is it, then?

599
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,930
You have almost
thirty eight million

600
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,407
that you didn't have yesterday.

601
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,367
We're making bank!

602
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,518
And the rest, well!
Shit happens, yo.

603
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,704
What do we do?

604
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,606
Look, the guys I've got
are okay.

605
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,318
They get
what they're up against.

606
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,070
And they're careful.
So am I.

607
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,713
What do you do?

608
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,382
You're at home

609
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,492
all tucked in at night
with your family.

610
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,371
So why don't you just
give me a break for one day?

611
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,458
You've made
the division of labor
very clear, right?

612
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,673
So what the hell
do you want me to do, Walter?

613
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,010
Tell me! What the hell
do you want me to do?

614
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,675
Hey.

615
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,329
- How are you?
- Hi.

616
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,264
Didn't even know you were home.

617
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,516
You snuck in.

618
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,483
What you eating?

619
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,991
Pizza.

620
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,184
Thought we wouldn't buy
frozen food any more.

621
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,912
Wouldn't we?

622
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,248
No, you said so yourself.

623
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,483
Aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

624
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,710
I had a craving.

625
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,878
Once is no big deal.

626
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,511
So where's Junior?

627
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,928
Out.

628
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,972
With whom?

629
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,141
Lucho.

630
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,934
Out where?

631
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,172
I don't know. Somewhere.
He'll be back by 9:00.

632
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,650
Somewhere?

633
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,720
I just thought you might have
a clue where your son is.

634
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,532
Why don't you?

635
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,769
Why am I the only one
who needs to keep track
of our son?

636
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,580
You want to know where he is?

637
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,566
Just pick up the phone
and ask him.

638
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,293
Like I do all the time.

639
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,372
Perhaps you might know
something about this.

640
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,604
Perhaps.

641
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:32,526
Perhaps I don't.

642
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,678
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

643
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,115
I'd like an explanation!

644
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,700
Give me a break, Walter!

645
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,744
Sorry?

646
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,063
Why would you do this?
You're pregnant!

647
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,565
Three and a half cigarettes
won't harm the baby.

648
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,292
I'm glad you're so sure, Doctor!

649
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:51,320
Three and a half!
That was it!

650
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,213
I tossed the rest!

651
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,573
And you'll be very glad
to hear that I feel ashamed.

652
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,786
Cielo, I don't get it.
This is so unlike you.

653
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,579
- What happens?
- How would you know?

654
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,068
What was
that?

655
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,291
Henry, wait.
Where do you...?

656
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,184
Shh.

657
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,956
Wow.

658
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,402
What do you want, bro?

659
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,929
You asked me
what I want you to do.

660
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,241
I want you to handle it.
