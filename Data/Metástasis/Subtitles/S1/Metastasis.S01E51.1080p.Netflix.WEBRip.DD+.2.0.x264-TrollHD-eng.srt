1
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,400
Walter.

2
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,947
Yo, I wanted to tell you

3
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,865
that I liked your idea in there.

4
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,826
I think it's pretty much

5
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,830
how things should be done.

6
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,873
Thanks.

7
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,755
Dude, wait.

8
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,908
I remember you told me
it was your birthday.

9
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,801
So I...

10
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,220
Here.

11
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,205
The slip's inside
if you want to change it

12
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,265
for other you like more.

13
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,353
Happy birthday, bro.

14
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,729
Hi.

15
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,594
I was at Henry and María's,
visiting the kids.

16
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,472
I talked to Junior
for quite a while.

17
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,574
And he's fine, he...

18
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,869
He's continuously asking

19
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,480
what happens
'cause he can't quite get it.

20
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,749
He is obsessed with knowing

21
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,626
but he's fine.

22
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,670
How about you?

23
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,714
How are you?

24
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,431
Big money is coming in

25
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,209
in a couple of days.
Are we okay with that?

26
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,071
Let's go to bed.

27
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,410
Good night.

28
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,802
I wanna show you something.

29
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,179
Look.

30
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,015
Do you like it?

31
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,835
It's peculiar,
but it has something to it.

32
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,315
Above all, what it has

33
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,068
is that it's a birthday present.

34
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,737
And the person who gave it to me

35
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,557
not long ago,
wanted to kill me.

36
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,478
It's true.
Not many days ago

37
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,232
he had a gun
pointed at me here

38
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,818
and he was this close
to pulling the trigger.

39
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,171
And I don't know why he didn't.

40
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,007
But, suddenly, as if by magic

41
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,009
he changed his mind.

42
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,346
And he doesn't hate me anymore.

43
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,707
Now he has
a very different opinion
about me.

44
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,270
Weird, right?

45
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,022
And just now when I was

46
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,649
on my way there

47
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,027
I thought maybe you'll feel

48
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,112
exactly the same.

49
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,114
I don't know why

50
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,141
but I feel that soon
you'll have

51
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,410
another opinion of me.

52
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,371
You'll think different of me.

53
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,918
See you later.

54
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,099
My baby.

55
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,771
Sorry, sir.

56
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,981
Reporting a missing child.

57
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,067
Hey.

58
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,927
- That is a real surprise,
Walter!
- What's up, buddy?

59
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,762
- How are you?
- Fine. Very good.

60
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,655
All right.

61
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,557
Listen, I'm sorry to drop
in on you out of the blue.

62
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,243
No, never mind, man.

63
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,519
- You sure?
- Sure.

64
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,162
Aren't you too busy?

65
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,648
If you have things to do,
we can take a rain check.

66
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,817
No, no.
I'm just settling

67
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,278
into the new digs
here.

68
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,922
But it's cool, isn't it?

69
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,867
It's very spacious
and you have a hell of a view.

70
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,285
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's cool.

71
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,886
At least, it's better

72
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,846
than the boxes we have, right?

73
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,166
What will I do
with the proletariat here?

74
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,767
Henry.

75
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,227
I want to congratulate you

76
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,503
on this appointment.
Very good.

77
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,921
- No, Walter.
- Yes, yes.

78
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,340
Well, thanks.
Thank you.

79
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,900
Although I must confess

80
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,194
I need to be out there.

81
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,472
That thing
of chasing dirt-balls

82
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,474
is like an addiction,
brother.

83
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,311
Of course, being a
boss

84
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,770
also has its appeal,
right?

85
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,499
Yes, sure.

86
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,774
- See you later, boss.
- Bye.

87
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,335
Gómez, thanks.

88
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,112
- Bye, Walter. Good day.
- Later.

89
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:11,283
Hey. Whoa.
Look at that.

90
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,094
No way!

91
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,096
Is that new?

92
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,373
- Yes, it is.
- Really?

93
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,099
Yes, I mean, it's...

94
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,919
That's beautiful.
So classy.

95
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,712
Was it a birthday
present?

96
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,006
Yeah. Well, I mean,
not-- not really.

97
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,192
I bought it for myself.

98
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,509
Look at
you.

99
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,888
New car, new
watch.

100
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,823
You're treating yourself.

101
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,325
What?

102
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,785
Am I acting like a gangster now?

103
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,562
No, no, no,
you know what that is?

104
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,148
Boosting one's
self-esteem.

105
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,734
With all the curve balls
that were thrown at you

106
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,237
this year, brother,
you deserve it.

107
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,905
- Hell yeah, right?
- Sure!

108
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,240
As long as you
got the money

109
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,800
to spend, that is.

110
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,119
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

111
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,678
Come on, sit down.

112
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,996
- Thanks.
- How's it going?

113
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,557
Fine, everything in order.

114
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,932
So how's Cielo?

115
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,519
Um...

116
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,587
I think she's getting better,
you know?

117
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,257
She went
to the car wash this morning.

118
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,384
She said
she needed to, you know

119
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,319
keep her mind occupied, and--

120
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,720
That's good.
Great.

121
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,847
- Yeah, she went back to work.
- That's good, yeah.

122
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,557
I mean,
as long as you're all
right

123
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,143
with her being on her
own and--

124
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,744
No, no, in fact

125
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,439
I'm right there with her
most of the time.

126
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,234
And the guys there
keep an eye on her when I'm not.

127
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,568
Good. That's
good.

128
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,254
Yes, right.

129
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,948
And what about
the whole idea of seeing

130
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,574
a professional,
a psychologist

131
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,160
or one of those
shrinks?

132
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,095
Remember I told you

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,038
María was happy
with the one she's
seeing?

134
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,640
Says they come in

135
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,183
like zombies, brother

136
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,836
and come out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

137
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,088
Actually,
she already found someone.

138
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,191
A Pedro or something...

139
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,612
Pedro...

140
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,764
I don't know why I'm drawing
a blank on his last name.

141
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,366
He's an expert.

142
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,076
He's supposed to be top notch.

143
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,744
You must've heard of him.

144
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,204
Well, the thing is--

145
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,997
I'm glad you're on it.

146
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,526
That's not something
you wanna let fester.

147
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,487
No. No, way.
You can't risk it.

148
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,924
Henry, um...

149
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,453
I really just wanted
to thank you

150
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,639
for having

151
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,082
Valentina and Junior
at your house

152
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,684
for watching them--

153
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,419
There's nothing to
thank, buddy.

154
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:28,979
Yes, there is.

155
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,631
We're glad to have
them home.

156
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,984
No, but it's a burden

157
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,360
and you have your own problems.

158
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,778
No burden at all!

159
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,096
Those kids are so
sweet.

160
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,990
We love them, buddy.

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,619
Thanks.

162
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,999
I'd like to come and see them.

163
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,001
Tonight's all right?

164
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,046
What do you mean?

165
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,615
You are asking
for my permission

166
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,159
to go see your own
kids?

167
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,928
Are you nuts or what?

168
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,972
You go tonight

169
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,790
and we'll have
a scotch together, okay?

170
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,351
Thanks.

171
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,353
Unbelievable.

172
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,358
Walter.

173
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,176
Something else
on your mind there?

174
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,888
Remember
what I told you, right?

175
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,892
Whatever I need,
I'm here.

176
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,021
If you need to talk,
if you're in trouble

177
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,023
I'm here,
all right?

178
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,615
I think Cielo
doesn't love me anymore.

179
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,634
And I don't know what to do.

180
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,415
She says
that I'm a bad influence

181
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,932
on the kids and--

182
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,434
How can she say so?

183
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,420
That I'm not good
for them--

184
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,860
She thinks I'm a bad father.

185
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,722
You're a bad--?
No, no, no, that--

186
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,850
Being a bad father
is one thing

187
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,227
Having marital problems
is a different story.

188
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,854
Every couple has
problems.

189
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,458
It's like, um...

190
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,001
I mean, I...

191
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,780
I'm not
an expert on parenting

192
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,992
and you know it,
but if you ask me

193
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,496
from where
I'm sitting, brother

194
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,748
I think you're great
with the kids.

195
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,627
You're a provider,
aren't you?

196
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,212
You provide them
with food and a home.

197
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,980
You're no drunkard.

198
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,342
You're not--
You're at their beck and call.

199
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,594
There's no doubt
you love them.

200
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,928
- Yes.
- And you know--

201
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,972
You know
what?

202
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,017
The guts you showed
going toe-to-toe
with cancer

203
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,355
the way you got over
that illness, buddy

204
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,649
that's an example
to your kids.

205
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,653
That's an inspiration to me,
you know?

206
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,547
Really.

207
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,006
I've made mistakes, Henry.

208
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,077
Everybody makes
mistakes!

209
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,764
That's life, brother.

210
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,081
- Want something to drink?
- Okay.

211
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,642
Yeah? You want a coffee?

212
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,101
Yeah. Okay.

213
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,878
- I'll order it.
- No, no, no!

214
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,938
Henry, please.

215
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,216
Buddy, I don't want them
to see me like this.

216
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,052
Relax, I'll go
for it.

217
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,112
How do you like it?

218
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,430
- With...?
- Two of sugar.

219
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,099
Two of sugar.
Relax, buddy.

220
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,852
Just take a moment,
think about it

221
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,104
and get it together.
I'll be right back.

222
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,856
- I'm sorry, brother.
- Feel at home.

223
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,816
And there's no need
to be sorry.

224
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,418
No way!

225
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,753
I'll be right back, okay?

226
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,797
Thanks.

227
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,234
Walter.

228
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,096
Here's your
coffee.

229
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,895
You two
are really great together.

230
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,791
Congratulations.

231
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,838
Take it from me.

232
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,340
Remember, buddy

233
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,619
it's always darkest
just before the dawn.

234
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,499
I really appreciate
your help, buddy.

235
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,355
Mario, what are you doing?

236
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,107
I can't be here.

237
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,425
- Keep still!
- Let go of me!

238
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,985
Why did you bring me here?

239
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,846
I've got to get my daughter
from school!

240
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,681
What am I doing here?
What is this place?

241
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,140
- Shut up!
- Why are we here?

242
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,975
- Sit down.
- Let me go!

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,977
- I can't be here!
- Sit down, damn it!

244
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,900
Let me go, I don't see
why I have to be here.

245
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,528
Why did you bring me here?
I don't have to be here!

246
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,447
Sit the fuck down!
Give me your phone.

247
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,638
Let's get to the point.

248
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,389
Here's your script.

249
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,808
You have about 30 seconds to--

250
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,309
What are you talking about?

251
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,086
I'm gonna dial
the Anti-narcotics
chief

252
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,730
Henry Navarro

253
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,341
and you're gonna pass
along
this information.

254
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,359
Listen to me, Lidia.

255
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,570
If you yell for help

256
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,889
I am gonna pull out
my pistol

257
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,658
and shoot you in the head.

258
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,242
And the same goes

259
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,020
for panicking
or breaking down into
tears.

260
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,401
Look at me,
not at them.

261
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,819
If you make Navarro
suspicious in any way

262
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,821
what's gonna happen
next?

263
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,464
You'll shoot me.

264
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,758
Where?

265
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,118
- In the head.
- With what?

266
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,762
With your gun.

267
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,165
It's a pistol actually,
not a gun.

268
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,709
All
right.

269
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,226
Computer's set?

270
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,228
Yeah, it's all set.

271
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,455
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Anti-narcotics.</font></i>

272
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,043
Hi, I'm Lidia Barrera.

273
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,528
I need to talk
to agent Henry Navarro

274
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,463
please.

275
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,825
Tell him it's regarding
Madrigal Electromotive.

276
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,343
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hold the line, please.</font></i>

277
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,638
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll put you through.</font></i>

278
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,264
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mrs. Lidia, how are you?</font></i>

279
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,725
How can I help you?

280
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,019
Mr. Navarro, how are you doing?

281
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,546
I just wanted
to report something.

282
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,066
I was in our warehouse

283
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,218
supervising
a shipment of methylamine

284
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,846
when I noticed a device
on one of our barrels.

285
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,366
What kind of device?

286
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,019
It looks like some kind
of a tracking device.

287
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,707
So I was just wondering

288
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,942
if maybe your people
put it there

289
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,919
when they were here.

290
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,170
You very well know

291
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,531
that Madrigal's willing to help
with the investigation

292
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,092
we don't want to interfere.

293
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,744
Maybe you could
give me some guidance?

294
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,554
Well, I'll tell you

295
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,014
what we're gonna do.

296
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,474
Set that barrel aside for me

297
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,670
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I'll look into it</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and get back to you.</font></i>

298
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,256
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

299
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,692
Yeah, thank you.

300
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,652
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay, thanks for the call.</font></i>

301
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,574
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Gómez.</font></i>

302
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,225
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What is</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">it?</font></i>

303
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,103
Hey, you don't know anything
about GPS trackers

304
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,165
on a Madrigal barrel, do you?

305
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,027
No. Nobody from my team
planted anything.

306
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,795
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Why?</font></i>

307
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,571
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I don't know.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I figured as much.</font></i>

308
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,256
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Thanks.</font></i>

309
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,492
No, I know nothing,
but I didn't do it!

310
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,302
I didn't plant that thing!

311
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,704
Believe me!
It wasn't me!

312
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,081
I didn't do it, Mario!
I'm not so stupid!

313
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,001
Mario! Let me go!
Mario!

314
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,019
Shut up!

315
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,729
Like I told you.

316
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,590
That old hag
wanted to make fun of us.

317
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,151
So now what?

318
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,652
We're fucked up.

319
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,970
We can't get close
to the warehouse.

320
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,280
His look-in authorization

321
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,599
is gonna be due
in around twelve hours.

322
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,019
We'll use Lidia's security code
to gain access

323
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,688
and we take every barrel
we can get our hands on.

324
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,957
Well, what about her?

325
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,775
You two drive the barrels
back tonight.

326
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,376
I'll deal with her.

327
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,112
No! No, no, no.
Please!

328
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,364
This was not me!
I didn't put no GPS!

329
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,299
You've got to believe me.

330
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,911
Mario, you know me,
I'm not so stupid.

331
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,141
Yo, honestly, I believe her.

332
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,710
It sounds like
she's telling the truth to me.

333
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,561
Kid, you still have learn

334
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,523
a lot about women, trust me.

335
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,275
I'm sorry, Jose.

336
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,569
No, no, please!

337
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,030
Mario, you can't do this!

338
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,739
I swear I didn't do anything!

339
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,908
I put no GPS on that barrel!

340
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,493

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">All of</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">them.</font></i>

353
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,127
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That's why</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">we ran out of time, sir.</font></i>

354
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,378
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay, buddy. Okay.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Never mind.</font></i>

355
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,798
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Next time,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">a little communication,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">all right?</font></i>

356
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,482
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, sir.</font></i>

357
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,718
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I mean it.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">We've got to work on</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">that.</font></i>

358
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,278
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It won't happen again, sir.</font></i>

359
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,822
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay. You may go.</font></i>

360
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,867
I told you, it wasn't me.

361
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,436
We can't touch
any of those barrels.

362
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,080
As regards her, it's the same.

363
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,815
You can't keep
with the idea of killing me.

364
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,457
Don't be idiot. I saved you!

365
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,652
If I hadn't spotted
the tracker on the barrel

366
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,503
we'd all be in jail right now!

367
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,172
She's right.

368
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,532
She'll turn a badge on us
the first chance she gets,
trust me.

369
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,701
Once, the woman
put a hit out on me.

370
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,303
Seriously?

371
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,679
You still need methylamine

372
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,139
and I can help you.

373
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,640
But you've got to promise

374
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,669
your partner
will stop threatening me.

375
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,187
Let's talk.

376
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,672
About
what?

377
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,298
All of those
barrels
are already marked.

378
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,383
Who said anything
about barrels?

379
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,303
I'm talking about
an ocean of methylamine.

380
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,702
Leave me alone with her.

381
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,666
Mario.

382
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,988
Let's go.
The man knows what he's doing.

383
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,132
Asshole.

384
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,540
So, let's
hear it.

385
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,458
What do you
have to say?

386
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,336
Not without a guarantee
that I won't be killed anyway.

387
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,939
You have my word.

388
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,298
Not good enough.
I need a guarantee.

389
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,134
There's no guarantee
here.

390
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,012
You'll have to trust,
like the rest of us did.

391
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,725
Is it true
that you put a hit
out on Mario?

392
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,409
I was scared

393
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,687
about what they
could say,
he and those men

394
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,064
he has in custody.
They're nine of them.

395
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,982
They know everything
about me.

396
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,750
Probably about you too.

397
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,610
Assuming
you're the master chemist

398
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,671
they're always talking about.

399
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,119
How much methylamine
are we talking about,
literally?

400
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,499
Then we'll discuss
my commission.

401
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,059
No shit!

402
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,061
First things first.

403
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,190
Methylamine tankers usually

404
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,050
go through this road,
the main one.

405
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,052
But now it's blocked
because of a strike.

406
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,903
Those poor people usually do.

407
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,889
The miners
or the coffee growers.

408
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,141
Now we're using
this secondary road.

409
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,851
This is
a particularly secluded area.

410
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,911
That's where you do it.

411
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,663
Where we do what?

412
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,748
What do you mean, exactly?

413
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,209
Get your product.

414
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,127
"Get your product" meaning what?

415
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,586
Robbing the methylamine?

416
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,005
You said so.

417
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,756
You do what you have to.

418
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,633
I only tell you where it is.

419
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,510
How many in the crew?

420
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,970
Just the conductors.

421
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,205
We'll have to
kill them.

422
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,057
Fuck, yo.

423
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,792
Why do we always
have to kill people?

424
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,518
Calm down, Mario.

425
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,254
I have done this
long enough to know

426
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,505
there are
two kinds of heists.

427
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:04,259
Those where the guys
get away with it
and those that leave
witnesses.

428
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,018
Come on,

429
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:18,081
Say "anti-narcotics."

430
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,832
Honey, don't teach her that.

431
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,360
She'd better learn to
say
"aunt María."

432
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,003
But she just said

433
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,256
"an-ti-nar-co-tics."

434
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,574
Yeah, sure,
I'm sure she did.

435
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,201
Then take her
to work with you.

436
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,719
You wanna go?

437
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,179
Catch crooks out there?

438
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,181
Yes? You do?

439
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,766
Hey, what about Junior?

440
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,377
He's all depressed
and melancholic?

441
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,878
Yeah, poor
thing.

442
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,297
He feels
his parents
treat him

443
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,232
like he's a baby there.

444
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,816
No wonder.

445
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,551
They treat Valentina
much better than the poor kid.

446
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,012
- Shut up.
- No, really.

447
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,905
Shut it, honey!

448
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,141
Junior, sweetie,
do you want me

449
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,076
to fix you a sandwich

450
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,686
or you prefer
to order some pizza?

451
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,521
- No, thanks, auntie.
- You sure?

452
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,082
Kid, come here.

453
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,750
Come and sit here with us.

454
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,168
Let's have a chat.

455
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,586
What is it?

456
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,588
Wanna watch a movie?

457
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,911
No. And you
can keep talking about me now.

458
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,099
Sweetie.

459
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,226
Junior.

460
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,644
I think we should focus

461
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,438
on the local market.

462
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,897
Work with customers from Bogotá

463
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,857
and go one step at a time.

464
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,760
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

465
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,555
It's a backward step.
It's going back.

466
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,031
You're the chemist.

467
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,574
Admit it.

468
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,643
It's gonna cut down
on our output.

469
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,354
Changing
the production system

470
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,980
means losing
what we invested

471
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,623
in our new lab equipment.

472
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,192
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

473
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,319
Yeah?
Excuse me

474
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,254
but why don't you tell us why?

475
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,074
Why is making nothing
not an option?

476
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,286
Because, considering
the risk we're taking

477
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,455
I'd rather stay put
and do nothing.

478
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,332
Here you go again.
I know where you're going.

479
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,975
So let's go there.

480
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,002
It's because
of your nine guys in lockup?

481
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,271
Whose silence we have to buy?

482
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,690
You broke it, you pay for it!

483
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,050
And we've talked about this
plenty already.

484
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,760
We better talk about it
a little more.

485
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,345
Because what it sounds
like you're telling me

486
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,280
is that, from now on

487
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,099
we have no choice
but to do this pseudo cook

488
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,683
and give
whichever profit we make

489
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,185
to your
guys.

490
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,937
What's next then?
Say it.

491
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,813
We embark
on that risky operation

492
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,566
suggested
by the least reliable woman
in the world?

493
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,526
We kill
a bunch of innocent people

494
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,045
only to follow your scheme?

495
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,547
Let's call a spade a spade.

496
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,115
It's your plan better
than mine?

497
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,883
And yours is better than mine?

498
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,260
Okay, stop it!

499
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,288
What if we
can rip off that train

500
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,207
and no one ever knows
it got robbed?

501
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,191
This may be it.

502
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,652
This might be the place.

503
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,180
Trucks will come
from that direction.

504
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,225
I checked it out
and there are no farms
or businesses.

505
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,701
I think we can fake the accident

506
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,161
here on this crossroads.

507
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:06,457
Yes.

508
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,414
Shall we measure it?

509
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,044
Twenty, ten feet.

510
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,462
Here's the first tanker.

511
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,922
Each tanker

512
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,783
- is sixty feet.
- Gotcha.

513
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,844
I like these slopes.

514
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,513
There'll be no escape route

515
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,515
for the tankers.

516
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,086
Around here it'll be
the end of the first tanker.

517
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,188
Okay.

518
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,689
Distance...

519
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,692
Here's the next one.

520
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,326
Fifty, fifty-two

521
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,539
fifty-six, sixty.

522
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,915
Exactly here it's the end

523
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,542
of the second tanker.

524
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,570
- Sounds fine, right?
- Yes.

525
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,448
- Okay, let's do it here.
- This is the place.

526
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,096
There you go, perfect.

527
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,514
Keep straight, straight.

528
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,083
- Slightly to the right!
- To the right!

529
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,311
- There!

530
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,505
- This way, this way!
- That way, that way!

531
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,607
Right there! Let go!

532
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,761
- Right there! Let go!
- That's perfect!

533
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,933
- That's perfect!
- How does it look like?

534
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,077
Good.

535
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,407
All right, Peto,
open it up!

536
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,576
Come one, Peto, move it!
You're very slow.

537
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,286
Listen to me:
the day of the operation

538
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:43,954
I need that hose down
in fifteen seconds.

539
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,473
Will you be able to do it?

540
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,932
Yes, sir, of course.

541
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,292
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,128
- Boss, can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

543
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,797
I get why we want
the tank for the methylamine.

544
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,174
But why
this other one
for the water?

545
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,151
Jose, it's your idea.

546
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,528
You wanna fill him in?

547
00:27:58,553 --> 00:27:59,987
All right.

548
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,572
It's very simple.

549
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,558
We're stealing the methylamine
from the tankers

550
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,909
but they can't leave empty.

551
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,728
If on their way
they run into a weigh bridge

552
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,606
the train company's gonna know
it got robbed.

553
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,732
So while we steal
the methylamine

554
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,626
we fill the tankers with water

555
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,404
so the guys won't realize
until they reach base.

556
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,115
Anyway, they'll know
we robbed them

557
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,699
'cause they'll get water
instead of methylamine.

558
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,385
No, that's the point.

559
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,078
They won't get water,
but watered-down methylamine

560
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,638
which is a different thing.

561
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,997
So the guys from Madrigal
will think

562
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,332
it was the providers
who ripped them off.

563
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,892
Shit happens.

564
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,919
I've heard stories like
that.

565
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,546
They buy some machinery
and what they get

566
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,964
it's a lot of
stones.

567
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,466
- That's right.
- Exactly.

568
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,842
That's why it's important
to keep it a secret.

569
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,444
Some guys who work for us

570
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,513
don't know
all these details.

571
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,073
So mum's the word, okay?

572
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,643
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey! "Yes, sir."

573
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,745
Yes, sir.

574
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,287
So kid, show me you have guts.

575
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,815
We have to change the weight
with nobody noticing it

576
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,233
- and very quickly.
- Understood.

577
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,693
Jose, we have to be
very accurate.

578
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,361
Methylamine
is lighter than water

579
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,879
so we'll have to replace

580
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,590
just nine-tenths of it.

581
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,633
And check out the hose nozzles

582
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,327
'cause there'll be some spillage
we'll have to account for.

583
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,120
I'll be paying attention
to that.

584
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,746
Damn, you guys
thought of everything.

585
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,848
That's how we work.

586
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,360
Junior, open the door.

587
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,891
Dear, please.
Just come out and talk to me.

588
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,728
I'm staying!
That's all I have to say!

589
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,164
What's going on?

590
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,984
You got what you wanted.
Congratulations.

591
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,305
Junior, open up.

592
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,130
Come on, Junior.
I'm not gonna ask twice.

593
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,885
- What?
- You know what.

594
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,262
In fact, I have no idea
of what's happening.

595
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,682
But you do know
what you have to do.

596
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,142
Are you kicking me out
of my own house?

597
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,477
- No, Junior.
- You seriously doing that?

598
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,103
Whatever makes you
think that?

599
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,705
Junior, we love you.

600
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,233
And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

601
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,942
But I talked to you
and explained

602
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,070
your mom and I
need some time alone.

603
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,072
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did!

604
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:24,365
- You haven't explained shit.
- Junior.

605
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,342
Why can't I stay here?

606
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,619
This is not gonna be a debate
nor a negotiation.

607
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,206
Dad, explain to me.
I want one good reason--

608
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,957
Because we're your parents,
damn it!

609
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,643
And we're asking you to!

610
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,313
That's reason enough right now!

611
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,132
Now, come on!
To your uncle's house!

612
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,874
He's hopping mad,
but I'm sure

613
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,935
it'll pass soon.

614
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,353
So don't worry.

615
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,731
Walter.

616
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,634
Stop trying to play peacemaker
with me.

617
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,595
I won't change my mind
about you.

618
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,098
I don't accept
that.

619
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,575
You're my wife.

620
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,201
No.

621
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,161
I'm not your wife anymore.

622
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,248
I'm your hostage.

623
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,653
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned

624
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,340
I'll make you a deal.

625
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,386
I will launder your money

626
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,389
I'll keep your secrets

627
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,502
but the kids will stay
at Henry and María's

628
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,420
where they have a chance
of being safe.

629
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,299
Think you've seen
too many movies.

630
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,803
I don't know how else
to explain it to you.

631
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,448
Our children are not in danger.

632
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,975
Walter, a couple of days ago,
you told me

633
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,102
that a man
held a gun to your head.

634
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,621
You said it with pride.

635
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,372
So there's nothing you can say

636
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,583
that'll make me change my mind.

637
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,084
I know there'll come a day

638
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,820
that somebody
will knock on that door

639
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,490
looking to harm you
or me or all of us.

640
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,009
And when that day comes

641
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,805
the children cannot be here.

642
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,265
You agree to that.

643
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,126
Agree
and I promise I will be

644
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,590
whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

645
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,734
Okay.

646
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,321
By the way

647
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,806
you're seeing
a therapist.

648
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,033
Name, Pedro.

649
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,701
Last name, up to you.

650
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,787
And where were you?

651
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,457
Out burying bodies?

652
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,319
No, organizing
a truck robbery.

653
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,815
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah?</font></i>

654
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,942
I've got the data we need.

655
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,944
Write this down.

656
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,450
Come on, forward!

657
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,869
Go on, go on!

658
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,912
There!

659
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,044
Fernando, take the bike.

660
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,531
Around sixteen
feet ahead.

661
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,283
Around there!
Leave it there!

662
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,869
And now lie down
with your head that way

663
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,387
towards the back!

664
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,389
That's it!

665
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,375
There
you go!

666
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,479
All right, you ready?

667
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,799
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

668
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,859
Mario!

669
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,318
Ready?

670
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,720
All clear!
Ready!

671
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,681
Jose, Peto,
you ready?

672
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,125
There they come! Hide!

673
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,501
The trucks are coming!

674
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,503
Places, everyone! Go!

675
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,819
Stop, please! Stop!

676
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,863
Stop, stop!

677
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,867
What happened?

678
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,786
A guy on a bike got in my way

679
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,579
and I ran straight into him.

680
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,523
- Please, help me!
- What do you mean?

681
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,792
Let me see.

682
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,696
- He was thrown up to there?
- Yeah, I hit him bad.

683
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,406
Joaco, come here, move!
Help me out here.

684
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,008
What is it?

685
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,384
Buddy, help me, please.

686
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,844
What happened?

687
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,763
A ran into a guy on a bike.

688
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,122
- You killed him?
- No.

689
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,666
Okay, relax, buddy.
How you feeling?

690
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,225
Let's go!

691
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,311
Guys, let's go!

692
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,490
- It's okay, dude.

693
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,933
Calm down.
How are you feeling?

694
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,661
I ache all over.

695
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,247
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">How are things going there?</font></i>

696
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,249
Good.

697
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,311
I ache all over!

698
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,688
Okay, let's pick him up.

699
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,607
No, no way!

700
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,942
He must have internal bleeding.

701
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,485
Murderer!

702
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,262
Why don't we take him
to a hospital?

703
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,864
I already called an ambulance.

704
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,807
- We'll have to wait.
- Wait?

705
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,684
You heard him?
The trucks are there.

706
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,244
We can use one of them.

707
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,704
My car's blocking the way.

708
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,064
Then move it,
remove it from there.

709
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,440
- It won't start.
- What's the problem?

710
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,358
I don't know.
It just won't start.

711
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,966
How's everything there?

712
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,384
We're connected already.

713
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,344
We're gonna start emptying.

714
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,125
This guy

715
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,877
did you give him anything?

716
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,403
- Give him water.
- I have some.

717
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,130
No, wait, don't worry.

718
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,840
I'll get it.

719
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,742
Let's pick him
up.

720
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,307
Come on, I'll help you.
There you go.

721
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,684
Let's pick him up,
dude.

722
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,160
There you go.

723
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,748
No, buddy, he's in bad shape.

724
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,251
You hurt him, bro.

725
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,710
No, no.

726
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,987
Move a little, come
on.

727
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,089
I can't, I can't.

728
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,609
What's with the water, dude?

729
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,111
Coming, coming!

730
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,572
Hurry up!

731
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,455
Give me a status.

732
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,192
Good. We're at 500 gallons
and counting.

733
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:43,130
Water is going in now.

734
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,174
Jose!

735
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,517
Emptying starting.

736
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,070
Come on, come on!

737
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,571
Calm down, brother.

738
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,448
I've got kids. Help me!

739
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,725
Yes, I know.
Calm down.

740
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,327
I'm good at mechanics.

741
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,895
Let's wait
for the ambulance.

742
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,454
I'll remove the truck.

743
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,898
Come on,
let's go.

744
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,333
Don't leave me alone!

745
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,876
He knows, he'll help you.

746
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,695
I'll show you
where's the problem.

747
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,469
Lift it up, lift it.

748
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,971
It's there, right there.

749
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,539
Go to the other side,
come on.

750
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,392
Yes, go to the other side.

751
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,311
You can check there first, okay.

752
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,318
Right on!

753
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,904
Hold him, hold him.

754
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,973
All
right.

755
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,949
Okay, it worked.

756
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,660
See? I told you.

757
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,687
A jeep's coming
from the other way.

758
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,748
Buddy, a jeep's coming.

759
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,001
We're not done yet.

760
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,045
Sir, please, we need help.

761
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,738
This guy's hurt,
we need to take him

762
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,298
to a hospital.

763
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,658
There's no
chance.

764
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,201
If they get
the victim
into the jeep

765
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,329
the tankers' drivers
will go back to their positions.

766
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,390
I need more time!

767
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,772
He can take the victim!

768
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,357
Come here, buddy.

769
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,050
He's arguing
with the driver
about what to do.

770
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:28,885
They're getting
the victim
into the jeep.

771
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,487
Then let them take him!

772
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,473
If they take him,
our whole plan fails.

773
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,725
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When they reach</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">the hospital</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and see he's not wounded</font></i>

774
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,702
they'll call Highway Police

775
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,455
and report the accident.

776
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,730
That's why we have
an ambulance.

777
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,832
Then send the ambulance in!

778
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,170
You're in bad shape, buddy.

779
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,072
Cooperate a little.
Come on, get up.

780
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,966
Guys, wait a minute!

781
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,326
It's best
if the doctors
move him.

782
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,969
Yes, you may hurt me worse.

783
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,745
No, he's gonna bleed to death.
No, no.

784
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,789
Wait, look at his leg.
Look how it is.

785
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,391
He'll die on us.

786
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,876
Wait,
we can't move him.

787
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,420
The ambulance's here!
Everybody calm down!

788
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,063
The ambulance's here.

789
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,940
Don't worry, brother.

790
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,401
You'll have to be patient.

791
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,095
He almost
didn't make it.

792
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,491
Look at this man's leg.

793
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,810
I'm not sure
if it's safe to move him.

794
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,454
So we let him bleed to death?

795
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,898
Does he have
health insurance?

796
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,624
I don't.

797
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,543
I can't take him then.

798
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,003
But that's inhuman.

799
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,738
Wait a minute.
With or without insurance

800
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,340
we'll take him.

801
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:34,009
But I may get into trouble.

802
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,618
What?
I'm gonna get this on video.

803
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,762
If you let this guy die

804
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,582
your face will be
all over the news.

805
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,505
- Come on.
- Come on, do it.

806
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,549
- Whose car is that?
- Me.

807
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,385
- Can you move it?
- Sure, dude.

808
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,902
Let's go get a stretcher.

809
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,612
Can we be of any help?

810
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,198
We'll bring a stretcher.

811
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,682
They're getting
the victim
into the ambulance.

812
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,242
We have to beat a retreat.

813
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:00,518
We're not done yet.
I need more time.

814
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,204
We're out of time.

815
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,398
- We're almost there!
- No, there's no more time.

816
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,234
Thank God we could help
the guy from the bike.

817
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,069
But now we'll have
to remove that truck

818
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,004
so that we can go through.

819
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,282
It's not gonna be easy
'cause it won't start.

820
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,742
No, the guy with the jeep
can pull your truck

821
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,660
so that we move it
and unblock the way.

822
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,371
Right, we can give it
a shot with a winch.

823
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,705
- You sure?
- That's the point, yes.

824
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,307
Come on, dude.

825
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,666
It's so heavy!
It's overloaded.

826
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,519
It has a soul of its own!

827
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,087
- Let's do it.
- You've got leeway.

828
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,132
- I'll tell you.
- There you go.

829
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,800
They're heading
to the truck.

830
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,718
It seems
they're gonna tow it.

831
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,785
Go, go.

832
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,747
Go, go, pull, pull.

833
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,125
Go, go.

834
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,693
Now backwards,
backwards.

835
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,154
Hold it!
Hold it steady!

836
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:53,489
Walter, they already
moved the truck.

837
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,090
We've got to flee.

838
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,325
We're near
the nine thousand gallons.

839
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,468
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, now!</font></i>

840
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:01,471
Come on, come on.

841
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,791
Okay, buddy.
I think we're all set here.

842
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,921
Thank you very much
for all your help.

843
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,982
Hope that guy gets well soon.

844
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,445
See you.

845
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,639
Sir, can I help you
with anything else?

846
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,308
You need a ride
somewhere?

847
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,159
No, I'll stay here.

848
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,578
I called Highway Police

849
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,037
so I'll wait for them.

850
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,397
Thanks, anyway.
Good luck.

851
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:28,873
Get off now!

852
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,292
No! One more second!

853
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,751
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, now!</font></i>

854
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,296
Jose, that's it, get off!

855
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,737
Get off!

856
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,056
- Yes.
- Now!

857
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,078
- Hell, yeah!
- We did it!

858
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,914
- Son of a bitch!
- Well done!

859
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,834
- Bravo!
- Very good, Peto!

860
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,353
Well done, Peto.

861
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:34,272
Fuck!

862
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,815
You almost didn't jump!

863
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,594
Let's flood this town
with meth, goddam it!

864
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,046
Peto, what are you doing? No!
