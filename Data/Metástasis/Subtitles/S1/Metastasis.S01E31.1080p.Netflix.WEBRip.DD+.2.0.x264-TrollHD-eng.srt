1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:19,244
THREE MONTHS AGO

2
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,230
I thought
I was going to see some nudes.

3
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,651
I didn't say
she painted nudes.

4
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:27,445
I said it was
an erotic exposition.

5
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,156
If this is eroticism,
I'm the Pope.

6
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,413
This painting isn't only
about the human body.

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,765
It is about daily life.

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,459
And if you look at it
with an ironic perspective

9
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,753
it is about
all the prejudices

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,964
and taboos about sex.
There it is.

11
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,524
If you wanted to get new ideas

12
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,094
trust me, I have
much more imagination than this.

13
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,698
Really, this artist had health

14
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,200
problems, so to speak.

15
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,912
It's a door.

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,274
- A door?
- Yes.

17
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,611
Any other doors
we can check out? Like...

18
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,880
the exit door, for example?

19
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,631
Yes?

20
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,054
No?

21
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,278
[Jose snorting)

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,098
I did like
the cow skull pictures.

23
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,450
Those were cool.

24
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,828
But a door?

25
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,039
I will say it again: a door.

26
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,627
Sometimes, you simply

27
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,738
get fixated on something
and do not even get why.

28
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,576
You open yourself up
and go with the flow

29
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,219
and go wherever the universe

30
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,721
wants to take you.

31
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,974
So the universe took this lady

32
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,767
to a door

33
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,002
and she got
all obsessed with it

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,628
and just had to paint it
once and again

35
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,313
until it was perfect.

36
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,383
No, I wouldn't say that.
Nothing's perfect.

37
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,593
- No?
- No.

38
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,530
You know what? I don't agree.

39
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,099
I do believe
there are perfect things.

40
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,327
That was so sweet.

41
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,980
I think I threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

42
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,359
You can't admit just
for once that I'm right.

43
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,295
Come on, Miss Curator.

44
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,965
What happened is very clear.

45
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,925
The old lady saw a door

46
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,036
and got so obsessed
that she painted it

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,454
a thousand times
until it was perfect.

48
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,807
No.

49
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,600
I believe that

50
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,477
the door was her home

51
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,771
and she loved it.

52
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,274
In my opinion

53
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,677
that's about making
that feeling last forever.

54
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,347
Give me a step.

55
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,391
Just one step, Henry, please.

56
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,962
I can't, I can't!
That's it. Take me up!

57
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:32,922
Come on, honey.
- You can do this. Try.

58
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,924
Just imagine
that pain is weakness

59
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,775
leaving your body, honey.

60
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:40,096
Pain is my foot
in your ass, María!

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,764
Okay.
Listen to me.

62
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,557
If you can get your leg up,
go for it.

63
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,017
I can bear it.
Let's see.

64
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,744
Take me up! No!

65
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,438
Take me up, stop pulling me!
Take me up! Take me up!

66
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,398
We're gonna let you rest
for a minute

67
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,358
and in some minutes
we're gonna try it again.

68
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,444
- Okay, Henry?
- No fucking minutes!

69
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,822
Take me up.
I'm done! I can't!

70
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,158
Take him up.
Easy. All right.

71
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,994
Come on, uncle Henry.
You can do it.

72
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,745
How else are you going
to get out of here?

73
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,597
Don't you have any friends?

74
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,099
Find something better to do

75
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,250
than staying here
being a pain in the ass!

76
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,129
Watching me hanging here
like the balls

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,673
of an old man in a Turkish bath.
Fuck!

78
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,482
Henry, calm down.

79
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,094
Junior just wants
to be supportive,
like the rest of us.

80
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,430
- Let's go.
- Never mind, mom.

81
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,490
Breathe.

82
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,202
I'm breathing, don't you see?

83
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,546
Cielo.

84
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,714
We got our first bill.

85
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,326
Baby, do me a favor.
Get ahead.

86
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,220
I've got to talk to your aunt.

87
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,812
Jesus, María.

88
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,339
Remember this is a secret
between Walter, you and I.

89
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,508
- Be careful, okay?
- Sorry.

90
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,568
Can you help us?

91
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,362
Yes, María, we can.

92
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,973
Prepare yourself
for the figure. Look.

93
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,060
They're gonna start
coming in weekly.

94
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,353
- Okay.
- You're sure you can do this?

95
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,663
Yeah.

96
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,357
- Relax.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,783
I'll do that.

98
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,995
What the hell, man?

99
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,332
What, I can't work a scale now?

100
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,833
Just say the words.

101
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,294
Say you think I'm stealing.

102
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,307
Move.

103
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,070
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> The phrase was</font></i>

104
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,974
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"You have to learn</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to walk with who you are."</font></i>

105
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,103
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It was repeated</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">over an over again by somebody</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">who was close to me</font></i>

106
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,746
and helped me a lot.

107
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,067
He was my sponsor when I
started coming to meetings.

108
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,919
And I like it because

109
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,113
it involves
something very important.

110
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,340
And that is

111
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,533
that we have to learn
to accept ourselves

112
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,261
the way we are.

113
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:54,332
But this idea of "walk"
is also interesting

114
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,751
because it tells me
to advance, to go on

115
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,312
to move forward.

116
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,106
Welcome, Jose.

117
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,941
And I think that

118
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,678
it's an important concept
to bear in mind.

119
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,364
I see we have

120
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,852
new people, a couple new faces,
which is good.

121
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,770
Maybe we can introduce
ourselves. Why don't you

122
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,272
raise your hands,
the new ones

123
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,332
so everybody knows who they are?

124
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,042
You, okay.

125
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,087
All right. Very good.

126
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,325
And you, okay.
Who wants to start us off?

127
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,119
How about you?
What's your name?

128
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,473
My name is Andrea.

129
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,541
Feel free to say
whatever you want

130
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,851
what you're thinking or feeling.

131
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,799
Honestly,
I don't want to be here.

132
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,221
It's good for you
to feel that, this rejection.

133
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,141
I invite you,
if you don't want to be here

134
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,535
to go out, take a walk, okay?

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,646
Talk to people.
Draw your own conclusions.

136
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,734
What matters here is that nobody
is forced to stay, okay?

137
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,836
Anybody else?

138
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,120
What's up?
My name is Jose.

139
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,582
Nice to meet you. Mauricio,
but everybody calls me Mono.

140
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,392
And this is

141
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,045
- I believe, Pedro?
- Right. I'm Pedro.

142
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,646
Nice to meet you, bro.

143
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,382
What's up, man?
How are you?

144
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,551
- I'm sorry, guys.
- No, go ahead.

145
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,069
It's for everybody.

146
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,248
I wanted to give you a heads up.

147
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,692
It's gonna get a little slower
smuggling product

148
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,694
with Grandpa Anus
breathing down my neck.

149
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,713
He's watching every move I make.

150
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,823
But don't worry.
I'll keep it flowing.

151
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,451
- Great.
- So?

152
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,619
How's it going?
How's it selling?

153
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,221
Mad volume?

154
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,972
Yeah! It's...

155
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,809
You know, bro, it's, um...

156
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,354
It's not so good.

157
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,481
What do you mean?

158
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,858
How much have you sold, bro?

159
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,985
Me? I sold a tenth.

160
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,029
One tee--?

161
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,114
One tenth?

162
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,617
To who?

163
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,287
To him.

164
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,832
You must be joking!

165
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,669
Man

166
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,755
I couldn't resist it.

167
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,925
Look, buddy, you know what?

168
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,369
It's not so easy
selling to these people.

169
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,845
Look, look at them.

170
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,332
They're trying
to better themselves

171
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,167
and we're trying
to get them back to a hole.

172
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,294
Yeah.
I agree with el Mono.

173
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,521
Here, you can sense

174
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,842
you can breathe
some positivism, man.

175
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,512
They're here
opening up their hearts

176
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,888
telling about their fam--
I feel remorse.

177
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,724
"I feel remorse."
You're kidding me, right?

178
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,269
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two

179
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,995
for you to come with this shit?

180
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,190
Now you're guardian angels
and can't sell?

181
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,749
Pussies!

182
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,318
You know what?
I want it back. All of it.

183
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,835
I'll sell it myself.

184
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,070
Come on, man.
Don't be like that, Jose.

185
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,673
But it's true, yo.

186
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,616
Selling to these
people is like...

187
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,744
like shooting a baby
in the face.

188
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,096
Yeah, man.

189
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,041
- It's not easy like you think.
- It's not easy?

190
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,834
I'll show you
exactly how easy it is.

191
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,593
Check this out.
Fucking pussies.

192
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,446
I told you.

193
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,497
Excuse me.

194
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,481
Hey. Sorry!
- No. Go ahead.

195
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,791
It's Andrea, right?

196
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,735
- Yeah.
- Pleasure. I'm Jose.

197
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,465
Wanna know something?

198
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,367
I don't really want to be here,
either.

199
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,413
- Shall I join you?
- Okay.

200
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,934
Smooth talker.

201
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,466
- Hi, mom.
- Hey.

202
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,235
Aunt's coming to dinner?

203
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,612
No.

204
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,532
Your dad is.

205
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,907
For real?

206
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:27,787
Hey.

207
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,482
How'd you get her
to sleep so quick?

208
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,710
Are you that boring?

209
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,629
I'm comforting.

210
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,131
I'm a comforting presence.

211
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,745
Look, Walter,
this is the certificate

212
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,375
of physical and mental fitness
signed by a doctor.

213
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,545
This was the only requirement
I needed to get

214
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,089
my driver's license.
So now

215
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,301
- I can drive my way.
- No way. Not yet.

216
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,844
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

217
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,681
I'm almost there.
We need to have
everything ready.

218
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,408
What do you mean "ready"?

219
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,203
Well, you know our old car

220
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,996
isn't so convenient for me.

221
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,023
And now
that I'll have my license

222
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,042
it'd be a good idea

223
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,779
to buy a new one.
I'd like a convertible.

224
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,575
Don't you want
some mango lemonade too?

225
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,119
We might also buy one of
those which have mini fridges

226
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,012
for the champagne bottles.

227
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,832
Who told you
we were going to buy you a car?

228
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,975
I heard you two talking

229
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,462
about my problems
with public transport.

230
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,006
Since when do you eavesdrop
other people's conversations?

231
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,567
This country is not prepared

232
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,694
to deal with people

233
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,279
who have reduced mobility.

234
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,783
Just listen to this manipulator!

235
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,310
I don't know how people
get to manage without a car.

236
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,062
- Are you talking about me?
- Yeah, maybe.

237
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,898
Mom doesn't let you
get even close to the car

238
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,917
so why don't you buy one?

239
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,570
Look, Junior.
That's not so easy.

240
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,548
Money doesn't grow on trees.

241
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,592
Besides, it's a decision

242
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,719
that can't be taken overnight.

243
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,871
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

244
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,332
We should probably leave
this discussion for later.

245
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,975
Now your dad and I

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,044
have a couple things
we need to talk about, so--

247
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,589
The most important thing
is that it is aerodynamic.

248
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,524
I like red very much

249
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,486
and, if it's not convertible

250
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,846
at least,
it should have a roof hatch.

251
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,323
That should do for me.

252
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,808
Perfect! I'll write it down
so I don't forget.

253
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,687
- Leave her in the crib?
- Okay.

254
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,257
Well

255
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,720
here you are.

256
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,170
Ice Creams and Popsicles
Little Fridge Inc.?

257
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,605
What's that?

258
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,482
It's a loan-out.

259
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,093
- It's fine.
- Whose loan-out?

260
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,069
Listen, Walter.

261
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,223
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in this country?

262
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,476
There's very specific paperwork
that has to be submitted

263
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,077
and declared.

264
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,163
Yes, relax.

265
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,148
He's a qualified guy.
Completely qualified!

266
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,900
Who is he?
What's his name?

267
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,195
What are his qualifications?
What's his experience?

268
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,883
Walter, please, understand.

269
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,912
This money
has to be unimpeachable

270
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,764
when it reaches Henry and María.

271
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,016
And it is. It will be!

272
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,143
But how do I know that?

273
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,089
You can't even tell me
the man's name!

274
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,842
Really?
Do you really want to know?

275
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,302
Do you want me
to tell you the name?

276
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,945
Yes.

277
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,285
Welcome!
Mrs. Cielito.

278
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,413
I'm just gonna call you Cielito
from now on.

279
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,723
I like my customers

280
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,625
to feel comfortable.
To get familiar.

281
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,960
Besides, it's a lovely name.
"Cielo."

282
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,187
It's pretty obvious.

283
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,091
Walt never told me
how lucky he was.

284
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,569
Clearly, Walter's taste in women

285
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,387
is the same
as his taste in lawyers.

286
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,281
Only the very best!

287
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,684
With just the right amount
of dirty.

288
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,478
to do it more...
Sorry, no.

289
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,564
I like to joke
and it's patently obvious

290
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,275
that you are very classy.
Please, sit down.

291
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,630
Cielito.

292
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,965
All right.

293
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,258
Well...

294
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,177
Look, Cielito

295
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,539
so Walt tells me
that you have some doubts

296
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,848
and concerns

297
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,834
and I'm the right guy
to alleviate them.

298
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,769
Yes, I do have some concerns.

299
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,505
And if we're going
to go down this road

300
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,466
it's for the sake
of my brother-in-law.

301
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,385
Your brother-in-law.
I've heard about him.

302
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,429
An upright, correct
and faultless man.

303
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,114
And ruthless too.

304
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,017
There are no heroes
like him anymore

305
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,769
nowhere,
not even in the police.

306
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,245
At any rate

307
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,705
I need some assurances

308
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,859
that we're gonna go about this
in a safe

309
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,210
and, above all, cautious manner.

310
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,196
Of course.
Fair enough.

311
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,881
That's how we're gonna do it.

312
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,702
I'll walk you
through the process.

313
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,705
First step is something
we call money laundering.

314
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,348
How does it work?

315
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,084
Take your money,
represented by, say...

316
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,603
This. Here.

317
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,022
This is your money, all right?

318
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,607
Let's imagine these pencils--

319
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,467
I'm a
bookkeeper.

320
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,262
I actually know
what money laundering is.

321
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,055
You're a bookkeeper?
No way!

322
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,907
So?

323
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,075
And, as with most things

324
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,369
the devil is in the details.

325
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,897
So to begin with,
what are we saying?

326
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,107
Which will be the source
of this money?

327
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,250
That's simple.

328
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,405
Walt here actually
came up with a great story.

329
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,007
Brilliant, I'd say!

330
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,092
Ht thought gambling winnings.

331
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,677
Blackjack, right?

332
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,954
- Am I right?

333
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,263
- Yes.

334
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,163
- Some card counting?

335
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,209
Well, actually,
that was Cielo's idea.

336
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,672
- Really?
- Yes.

337
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,482
Cielito!

338
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,718
You grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

339
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,738
Well, there you have it.

340
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,182
What I'm gonna do
is generating

341
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,059
some false currency
transaction reports

342
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,145
as well as
the necessary W-2Gs.

343
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,622
I know a couple casino managers

344
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:47,208
who will jump at the chance

345
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,045
to report false losses.

346
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,671
It's a win-win for everyone.

347
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,424
Yeah, but you can't...

348
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,409
You can't sell that
for very long.

349
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,163
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Way ahead of you. We declare

350
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,582
just enough
so as not to arouse suspicion.

351
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,642
Then Walt's one-time winnings

352
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,920
will become seed money
for an investment.

353
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,313
Investment in what?

354
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,818
Drum roll please.

355
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,823
Exactly!

356
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,075
What do we have?

357
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,913
A theme park!

358
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,202
for the whole family!

359
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,190
Or, at least,
a business inside the park.

360
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,401
7,000 square feet
of rollicking fun for everyone!

361
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,989
- I've already seen
the premises.
- An amusement park?

362
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,283
- A theme park?
- It's the latest fad, Walter.

363
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,218
It's always been in the market

364
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,454
although it hasn't been seen
in the market.

365
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,665
But it will be a revolution,
we will all enjoy.

366
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,626
All the family will have fun.
It's the latest craze!

367
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,921
What does it have to do
with Walt?

368
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,091
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Look, Cielito

369
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:57,595
it makes more sense
than you two being together.

370
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,697
I'm still trying to figure out

371
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,977
how did you do to get
such a beautiful sweet lady.

372
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,788
Do you even know Walt?

373
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,942
Tell me why
Walter, of all people

374
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,878
would buy such a business.

375
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,031
- It doesn't add up.
- It adds up perfectly.

376
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,283
Why?
Walt's a scientist.

377
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,261
And every scientist

378
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,456
inside, deep inside,
are like little kids.

379
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:29,127
Kids who love magic,
sleight of hand, illusion

380
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,104
tricks, the lab.

381
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:36,801
Walter has every right to
set the kid he has inside free.

382
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,030
Sure.

383
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,724
And I'm gonna meet
with my family

384
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,184
and tell them:
"Haven't I told you?

385
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,186
Overnight Walter
decided to invest

386
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,023
- in a business for kids."
- And teenagers.

387
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,457
You really think

388
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,276
I'm telling that
to the people who know him?

389
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,236
"Sure, that's always been
Walter's wish

390
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,505
he just kept it for himself."

391
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,117
Really? That's what we're
supposed to tell our family

392
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,952
our friends,
the government?

393
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:07,206
All right. Let me bottom line
this for you.

394
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,726
You don't need to be involved.

395
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,129
Why? Because I'm the one
doing this job.

396
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,047
I've been doing this
for a lot of years

397
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,634
successfully and without your
help, believe it or not.

398
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,344
So, we can call it a day.
Thank you very much.

399
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,099
It's been a great pleasure,
Cielito.

400
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,325
Thank you for stopping by.

401
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:45,954
You want a beer
or something?

402
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,956
Or something.
What do you mean?

403
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,600
Like beer.

404
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,727
I'm clean out of anything else

405
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,771
you may be thinking about.

406
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,466
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

407
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,237
Yeah. I know, I know.

408
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,306
It's the only thing
I hear lately.

409
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,659
Over and over again.

410
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,288
No, no and no.

411
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,274
Don't you think
it's ridiculous

412
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,544
that society says beer is okay

413
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,530
and a little hit
of something sweet is wrong?

414
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,991
what's the point of shutting
yourself off

415
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,369
from something
that lifts you off the ground?

416
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,040
You can't imagine
how much energy I spend

417
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,309
fighting the urge not to use.

418
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,461
And I feel like crap
because of it.

419
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,440
I know. It's just...

420
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,303
- What? What is it?
- It's just...

421
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,032
I can't get caught using again.

422
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,788
See, that's exactly the thing.

423
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,666
Not to get caught again.

424
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:03,865
You ever try that
blue stuff that's going around?

425
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,216
No?

426
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:08,345
It's the bomb.

427
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:17,837
Just a little gas in the tank
and suddenly life

428
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,549
gets much more interesting,
all's worth it.

429
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,362
Things look so different.

430
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,447
And it's so little

431
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,144
that is very unlikely
that you get hooked.

432
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,397
Like I said,
I got nothing here.

433
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,292
What if

434
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,653
I could get some?
You wanna try it?

435
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,801
Kiss to mommy.

436
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,054
Mommy! Mommy!

437
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,624
Your Nana
brought you home early.

438
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,810
Mom, I thought we said

439
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,754
you picked up Byron from school
and kept him.

440
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,939
I was, but I passed by

441
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,884
and saw you were here.
So I stopped.

442
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,862
I thought you had a meeting.

443
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,031
I did, but we changed the time.

444
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,159
Mom, this is Jose.

445
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,895
He's from the meeting.
He's like a sponsor.

446
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,315
- Jose, this is mom.
- Hi.

447
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,733
Baby, don't forget
to wash your hands, okay?

448
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,002
Come here.

449
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,005
Have you no shame?

450
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,383
I can't believe it, Andrea!

451
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,009
I can't believe it!

452
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,095
Go up right away!

453
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,892
Jose, this is Byron.

454
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,478
You have a kid?

455
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,881
What's up, buddy?
Byron?

456
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,609
That's a cool name.

457
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,278
Here. Give it up.

458
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,490
Right on!

459
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,285
Byron is almost six.

460
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,079
You okay with kids?

461
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,897
What? Kids?
Yeah, I like them!

462
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,191
- He's cool.
- Well

463
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,566
Byron is gonna
go play in his room

464
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,210
while the big people talk.

465
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,905
- Say "Bye, Jose."
- Bye, Jose.

466
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,257
Bye, Byron.

467
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,010
How was school today?

468
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,762
Fine.

469
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,014
Safe and cautious.

470
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,808
That's all I'm asking.

471
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,086
And that lawyer of yours
is neither.

472
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:25,131
Yeah, at first sight, he may
come across like a circus clown.

473
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,108
At second too.

474
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,676
But he actually knows
what he's doing.

475
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,113
Safe and cautious

476
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,932
is you not being involved
in this at all.

477
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,076
It's late on that.

478
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,703
This is what happens when you

479
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,247
decide to pay our bills

480
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,582
with money from drug business.

481
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,486
Cielo, this isn't
just about what happened before.

482
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,073
My involvement in this
is ongoing. Understand?

483
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,510
I can't just quit.

484
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,454
I have something of a contract
with them.

485
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,083
It's all very safe,
structured and professional.

486
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,294
I can't simply go there
and say "I quit."

487
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,548
What do you do?
Where are you going?

488
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,219
Walter, if you're gonna
launder money

489
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,447
at least, do it right.

490
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,546
You worked here four years.

491
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,714
It's a business you understand.

492
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,118
It's a story
people will believe.

493
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,138
This is what we buy.

494
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,807
No theme parks nor shit.

495
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,919
I mean, you.
This is what you buy.

496
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,881
You heard what the man said,
buddy?

497
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,691
Yeah, man. It touched my soul.

498
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,736
Yeah, because it's true, pussy.

499
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,201
Hi.

500
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,911
Jose, right?

501
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,022
This is Pedro and I'm el Mono.
How's everything?

502
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,707
You've been waiting long?

503
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,085
Why are you so stupid?

504
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,128
Easy, buddy.

505
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,572
I thought we had to keep
the story until the very end.

506
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,840
How's that, man?

507
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,342
So you and that girl

508
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,744
- you do the deed yet?
- Do what, yo?

509
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,055
Sell her our top product.

510
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,249
What are you two
even doing here?

511
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,185
What do you mean?

512
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,212
You can't get
your nut up to sell.

513
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,713
What's the point of even
coming?

514
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,233
Homie, I'm on step five.

515
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,052
I no longer use and I admit
my mistakes before others

516
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,680
myself and even you,
if you want.

517
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,308
Really, man. Me too.
I'm also on step five.

518
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,742
You must be joking, right?

519
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,353
No, we're being serious.
Step five

520
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,356
is harmony, dedication,
discipline and perseverance.

521
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,316
You know what?
See you later, bitches.

522
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,254
You see that, Tripa?

523
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,033
Yeah, man. He gave in
to the worst of the vices.

524
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,221
We have to get him back.

525
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,599
Yes.

526
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,810
Byron.

527
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,296
You know?
I have magical powers.

528
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,509
Look.
Look at my thumb. Ready?

529
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,943
One, two and...

530
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,014
- That's not real.
- It is real.

531
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,850
All right, do you want
to see something that's real?

532
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,622
You see this piece of paper?

533
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,544
Look, it looks like a worm.

534
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,155
- Do it again!
- Let Jose eat his dinner.

535
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,590
No, it's okay.

536
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,300
Want to see it again?

537
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,660
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

538
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:43,721
Firecrackers?

539
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,207
I don't have
any firecrackers on me. Why?

540
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,708
Who does tricks
with firecrackers?

541
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,379
Tomás.

542
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,479
And how are those tricks?

543
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,314
Who's Tomás?

544
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,883
- He's my kid brother.
- I see.

545
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,361
And we don't talk about him.

546
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,987
Eat your pizza.

547
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,068
You're can't be serious!
That's what you want to buy?

548
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,503
Yes.

549
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,364
Saúl, people will believe it
at least.

550
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,924
I worked here for four years.

551
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,621
Yeah, with a green overalls
and a cap, right?

552
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,056
Hey, how come you guys

553
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,041
always get
with the air freshener?

554
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,168
Although you say
you don't want it.

555
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,129
Me, for example,
I'm allergic to that.

556
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,798
I end up sneezing
and smelling of strawberry.

557
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,734
You should respect customers.

558
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,011
It they don't want
air freshener,
they don't want it. Period.

559
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,014
I don't know, but I think
this makes a better story.

560
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,310
Much better
than your theme park, Saúl.

561
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,538
Is that you talking

562
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,898
or the "cielito"
you have back home?

563
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,042
Saúl, let's admit it!

564
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,835
Cielo has a point.

565
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,447
It makes more sense
investing my capital

566
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,964
right here, you know?

567
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,242
Based on her long years
of experience

568
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,219
in money laundering, I suppose.

569
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,764
Let me tell you something.

570
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,558
If you're committed enough

571
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,851
you can make any story work.

572
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,061
You see?

573
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,479
I once

574
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:16,939
convinced a woman

575
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,567
that I was a famous TV star.

576
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,761
And it worked. Why?
Because I believed it.

577
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,280
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Capisci</font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> ?</font>

578
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,699
Besides, I don't know.

579
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,867
This dump isn't gonna work

580
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,061
because it doesn't have
a Daniel.

581
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,622
There's no Daniel here.

582
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,957
What in God's name is a Daniel?

583
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,501
Daniel runs the theme park.

584
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,837
The guy who had the idea.

585
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,714
The one who had a vision.

586
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,340
That man saw

587
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,384
where others saw a dirt lot

588
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,303
the possibility of a park

589
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,872
with lights, rubber aliens
and magic.

590
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,083
You see? How do you think
Las Vegas was invented?

591
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,519
Because there was a dreamer.

592
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,921
Some Daniel that dreamed of it.
And when Daniel

593
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,132
had financial problems,
what did he do?

594
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,136
He went searching for
exactly the type of
situation we're offering.

595
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,322
Daniel will look the other way

596
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,224
to keep his great project,
his dream afloat.

597
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:13,688
In other words Daniel
can be trusted completely.

598
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,315
But this guy here?!
Just check him out!

599
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,234
You can't trust
someone like him.

600
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,628
Listen to him!

601
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,491
You buy this place, all you got
will be some hoses

602
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,035
water jets and nothing else,
why?

603
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,638
You got no Daniel here.

604
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,389
Move!

605
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,569
Early still.

606
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:48,514
If you're holding,
we can do something.

607
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,033
You know

608
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,686
that stuff we talked about
the other day?

609
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,438
That blue stuff
you told me about?

610
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,080
What?

611
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,124
What kind of mother are you?

612
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,459
What kind of mom gets wasted

613
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,278
with a little kid
to take care of?

614
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,078
- Listen.
- What do you know about me?

615
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,914
I take care of my baby
and I'll do anything for him!

616
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,893
And I strive every day

617
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,462
for him not to follow
Tomás' steps.

618
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,338
You're right.
Sorry.

619
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,864
They made him kill somebody.

620
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,726
Some dealer
from some outside crew

621
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,561
who was sticking his nose
in the neighborhood.

622
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,982
Some fat guy
who was selling there too.

623
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,086
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yo, they killed Gordo.</font></i>

624
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,004
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Shot him dead.</font></i>

625
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,424
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">El Gordo called me before...</font></i>

626
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:52,035
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Before that. There were two men</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">acting funny.</font></i>

627
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,581
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Why didn't we go sell</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to a different place?</font></i>

628
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,919
- When was this?
- A few months back.

629
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,943
What else did he tell you?

630
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,778
He shot him dead.

631
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,555
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

632
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,034
I won't let my boy

633
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,661
go through something like that.

634
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,631
Guess what.

635
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,472
People who say "Guess what"

636
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,000
and then actually
expect you to guess.

637
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,228
I hate those people.

638
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,023
I just heard

639
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,217
about a certain patient,
last name, Navarro

640
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,110
first name, Henry

641
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,596
who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

642
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,114
You like the news?

643
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,074
It's fantastic.

644
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,602
Are they planning on rolling me
out the front door

645
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:03,482
or they'll put me
on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

646
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,151
- Honey, why do you say that?
- You know what?

647
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,529
I don't care what the insurance
company thinks.

648
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,740
I'm not leaving here
until I'm well.

649
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,675
Henry, this has nothing to do

650
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,134
with insurance.

651
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,746
All the doctors agree
in that you're healthy enough

652
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,289
- to go home.
I'm healthy enough?

653
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,252
Honey, you get stronger
every day.

654
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,922
You're fine.
You don't need
to be in a hospital.

655
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,631
María, I don't know
if you realize

656
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,942
the condition I'm in.

657
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,069
And in this condition...

658
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,431
I do need
to be in this hospital.

659
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,907
Okay?

660
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,476
Baby, you'll have
all the same equipment--

661
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:40,995
What?

662
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,163
What do you mean?

663
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,983
You'll do the same PT
you do here

664
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,068
but at your house,
which will be great

665
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,504
because you'll be home.

666
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,798
It's always better to be home.

667
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:56,493
Besides, I renovated our room.
A complete renovation.

668
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,345
Guess what?

669
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,639
I had them move the plasma in.

670
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,474
You'd always asked me to hang

671
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,627
the TV on the wall
and I'd always said no.

672
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:08,213
You only had to get shot
to get it, right?

673
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,148
I got you a new bed.

674
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,175
- You got a bed?
- Yes.

675
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:15,012
- A hospital bed?
- Well Henry, since--

676
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,697
Henry my ass!

677
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,725
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

678
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,103
- Baby.
- Baby my ass!

679
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,149
You take that shit out of my
room right away, María!

680
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,568
- Henry, come on.
- "Henry, come on"?

681
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,545
"Henry, come on"?!

682
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,116
I leave this hospital
when I walk out of here.

683
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,718
You understand?

684
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,704
- You understand?!
- Yes.

685
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,629
A Daniel?
What's that?

686
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,522
An accomplice.

687
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,733
Someone who's in on the scheme

688
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,860
who knows about laundering

689
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,137
and who's simply paid
to play dumb

690
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,948
and look the other way.

691
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,034
Look. Fine.

692
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,895
I agree with you
the theme park is a hard sell.

693
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,789
But without a Daniel

694
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,750
the car wash isn't feasible.

695
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,127
It isn't really an option.

696
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,753
What about me?

697
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,823
- What about you?
- I'll be Daniel.

698
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,075
No. No way.
No, no!

699
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,327
I'm perfectly capable
of managing a small business!

700
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,846
A legal business, not this.

701
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,807
Who else could we trust?

702
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:27,001
- No!
- Walter, for God's sake!

703
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,087
- I'm in this already!
- Sorry?

704
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,922
And if I'm in it,
I'm going to do it right.

705
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,941
You are not in this!

706
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,718
How am I not in this?
We're married!

707
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:38,178
We are not married, no.
We're divorced.

708
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,699
Right?

709
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:49,231
I never actually filed
the papers.

710
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,401
Married couples
can't be compelled

711
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,420
to testify against one another.

712
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,446
Jose! Respirator.

713
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,724
Hello.

714
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,769
Yes?

715
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,273
Yes. All right.

716
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,612
Okay. I'll be there.

717
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:10,163
What was that?

718
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,663
An invitation.

719
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,501
Walter.
You're right on time!

720
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,298
- Please, come in.
- Thanks.

721
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,950
I hope you like bouillabaisse.

722
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,435
In short, it's nothing more
than a fish stew

723
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,313
with a fancy name.
It sounds like a cliché

724
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,126
but indeed, it's just exactly

725
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,502
like my mother used to make it.

726
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,971
Do you like to cook?

727
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,932
You can help me.

728
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,020
Do you mind?

729
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,592
Would you slice the garlic?
Very thin, please.

730
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,680
This is a French dish
that I love.

731
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,408
Why did you invite me here?

732
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,664
We're working together.

733
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,484
I thought it was important
that we spent

734
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,837
some time out of the office.

735
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,756
Now the garlic.

736
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,403
It always amazes me the way

737
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:10,057
the senses work
in connection to memory.

738
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,938
This stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

739
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,249
If I took them separately

740
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,360
they don't remind me
of anything.

741
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:27,407
But this way
the smell of this stew

742
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,993
instantly brings me back
to my childhood.

743
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,639
How is that possible?

744
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,542
It all takes place
in the hippocampus.

745
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,130
The senses make the neurons
express signals

746
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,381
that go back
to the same part of the brain

747
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,692
where memory is stored.

748
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,527
Smell, for example

749
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,972
can be related
to a childhood memory.

750
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,474
That's something
called relational memory.

751
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,784
But don't quote me on that.

752
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,995
I'm rusty on my biology.

753
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,748
That's very interesting.

754
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,212
Walter.

755
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,923
I would like to help you.

756
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,966
Help me how?

757
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,386
When I first started out

758
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,179
I made a lot of mistakes.

759
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,266
Maybe more than I care to admit.

760
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,253
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me.

761
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:29,261
This life of ours
it can be overwhelming.

762
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,738
You are a wealthy man now.

763
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,200
And one must learn to be rich.

764
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:42,482
When a man is by himself
he can manage to be poor.

765
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,901
But being rich
is a totally different story.

766
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,045
What advice do you have for me?

767
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,700
Never make
the same mistake twice.

768
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,426
You Tomás?

769
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,388
Heard you were the man.

770
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:40,098
Yeah? What you want?

771
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,476
Meth. I need a tenth.

772
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,060
Three hundred.

773
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,229
For a tenth?

774
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,772
No, yo.

775
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,025
Hey, easy, buddy.

776
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,376
So what's up?

777
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:14,550
Hey!

778
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,593
Hey!

779
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,976
Bounce, bro!
Bye!
