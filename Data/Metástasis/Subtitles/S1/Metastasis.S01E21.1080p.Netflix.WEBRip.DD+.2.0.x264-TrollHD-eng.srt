We've received several calls

what seems to be an air crash.

5
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,911
Possibly two aircrafts collided

6
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,313
in Bogotá's sky,
in Teusaquillo area.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It seems these aircrafts</font></i>

00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,475
were being re-routed or vectored

through the airspace,

17
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,562
which is standard procedure

25

bound to the Caribbean.

26
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,941
I thought it was
just hail falling.

27
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,234
But no, they were
heavy hailstones.

28
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,920
I was so scared.

29
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,280
And I didn't know
how my neighbors were.

30
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,991
- Do you live near here?
- Yes, madam.

31
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,118
I live in the house
next door and...

32
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,661
How long did the
authorities
take to get here?

33
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,079
Did they find
survivors?

34
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,931
Well, they came here gradually.

35
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,916
But I'm worried
about my neighbors,

36
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,559
if they are okay.

was a fateful mistake
by an air traffic controller:

56
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,938
Diego Maldonado.

of the air traffic
control center in Bogotá.

62
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,992
The engineer Maldonado

63
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,409
had recently returned to work

64
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,411

that four weeks ago,

67
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,795
Maldonado lost a daughter

146

148

150
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,947
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I mean, more than half</font>

163

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Because people forget</font>

169
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,028
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Thanks a lot.</font></i>

170
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,929
On my first meeting
with my clients,

171
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,973
I always tell them
I'm so sorry

172
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,766
for the situation
they're in.

173
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,952
Tell me something, Cielo,

174
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,562
Does your husband
go along with this?

175
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,748
Does he know we're here?

176
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,526
I don't know, I guess,
we're not separated.

177
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,546
Has he moved out?

178
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,590
He must be moving out right now.

179
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,409
I hope he'll be out
by the end of the day.

180
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,411
In the meantime,
my kids and I are staying

181
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,247
with my sister
and my brother in law.

182
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,750
So, you're the one
who moved out?

183
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,893
Well, yes, temporarily.

184
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,355
Only so he could pack his stuff.

185
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,966
In fact, he was supposed
to leave last week,

186
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,987
but then came the plane crash...

187
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,072
No, God.

188
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,350
You had to go through
that?

189
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,201
Yes, the house is located

190
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,162
right beneath the flight path.

191
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,247
But, well, anyway,

192
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,525
it's time for us
to go back home

193
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,335
because I don't want to trouble

194
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,944
my sister and my brother in law
any more,

195
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,239
I'm sure we're driving
them up a wall.

196
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,575
I don't want to drag them
into this any more.

197
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,369
I think it's better
for everyone.

198
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,928
Well, as I see it,

199
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,331
you want to maintain
residency

200
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,750
in the house you've lived
all your life.

201
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,559
Yes.

202
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,878
It puts you in a better
position in regards to custody.

203
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,980
Two children, right?

204
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,066
Valentina and Walter Jr.

205
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,677
He's a teenager,
he's in high school.

206
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,404
Valentina and Walter.

207
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,658
They need to stay with me.

208
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,561
How long have you
been married?

209
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,414
Sixteen, almost seventeen years.

210
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,401
I understand
it's not an apartment,

211
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,194
it's a house that
you live in?

212
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,713
Do you own it or rent it?

213
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,422
We have maybe 15 years on it.

214
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,508
Definitely mortgage.

215
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,159
What about other
debts or assets?

216
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,345
Well, I mean...

217
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,793
I'd like you to describe
for me, briefly,

218
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,837
your husband's
financial situation.

219
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,939
No, look, in fact...

220
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,399
I'm not trying to get

221
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,301
any economic benefit
from all this.

222
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,985
No, no, no, it's not that.

223
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,431
I just intend that every one
of my clients gets

224
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,309
detailed accounting
of what they owe

225
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,645
and, well, what belongs
to them.

226
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,647
Let me be honest
with you, Cielo,

227
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,566
no stone will be left
unturned.

228
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,655
You'd be amazed with how
many things husbands hide,

229
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,616
and the wives
never find out.

230
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,794
Walter!

231
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,632
Walter!

232
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,681
Hey, buddy.

233
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,625
Cielo gave me the keys
so...

234
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,545
...I could help her,
you know...

235
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,274
This is it?

236
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,029
What a week!

237
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,613
You know what?

238
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,599
It reminds me when Pablo Escobar
brought the plane down.

239
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,308
There's a kind of
uncertainty,

240
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,977
people doesn't know
what to think of this.

241
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,229
Don't you feel
it?

242
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,607
I think this week
should be named

243
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,166
by the Guinness Book of Records

244
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,445
as the weirdest week
in the world, right?

245
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,447
Hey, am I talking too
much?

246
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,865
Yes, yes, I
know I am.

247
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,009
You know what?

248
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,953
I don't know how to deal
with this situation
between you and Cielo.

249
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,704
It's none of my
business,
you know?

250
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,624
I don't want to tell you
what to do, or anything.

251
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,041
Here's an idea!
For example,

252
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,501
there's something we

253
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,269
a tactical retreat.

254
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,771
You know what I mean?

255
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,548
You regroup, you get
your act together,

256
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,135
so what you'll get
is Cielo to feel your absence

257
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,154
and that is what...

258
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,867
Forget it, man.

259
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,685
No, no, no,
I'll take this one with me.

260
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,286
Take it with you?

261
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,063
No, man, you're nuts.
Give me that.

262
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,666
Holy cow...!

263
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,251
What do you have here?

264
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,170
Holy sh--

265
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,991
A thousand million pesos
in cash.

266
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,513
You crack me up, man!

267
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,935
That's the spirit!

268
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,312
A thousand million, ha, ha, ha!

269
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,356
Man!

270
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,214
Hi, there!

271
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:09,417
So this path takes us
to the question,

272
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,520
the big question.

273
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,815
Who of everyone here,

274
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,277
is here for self-improvement?

275
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,945
Yes?

276
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,990
Anyone else?

277
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,287
Many of you want to be better.

278
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,540
That's your first mistake.

279
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,443
Let me ask you
a different question.

280
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,156
You want to be better or worse
for whom?

281
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,798
Or for what?

282
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:44,243
I'd say, the question we should
ask ourselves is:

283
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,306
why can't we accept ourselves?

284
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,520
Some more chocolate?

285
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,402
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi, you reached the Blancos.</font></i>

00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,221
Hello, yes.
What's up, dad?

306
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,657
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

307
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,852
Will you tell me
what's going on?

308
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,688
Nobody's telling me
jackshit around here.

309
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,456
Morgan!

310
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,416
No, whatever.

311
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,482
Let me help you.

312
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,694
There you go.

313
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,891
Hey, tell me,
your aunt...

314
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,061
how's she taking
all this?

315
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,163
Fine, I guess.

316
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,526
You make sure you say hello
to her for me, will you?

317
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,544
Why don't you do it yourself?

318
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,213
It's your house.

319
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,467
No, I'd better not.

320
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,910
Things are going
to be like this...

321
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,512
for good?

322
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:18,041
What do you
mean?

323
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,351
Dad, please, don't play dumb.

324
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,521
You know what I mean.

325
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,049
Will you keep acting as
if you were not a member
of this family?

326
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:29,719
Junior, I'll always be part
of your family.

327
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,613
Yeah, but...

328
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,866
...I feel I had a dad...

329
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,577
...hired by the hour.

330
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,565
Well, take it as a kind
of modern service.

331
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,293
It's not funny.

332
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,794
I've got to go now.

333
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,405
No, no, wait, please.

334
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm sorry.

335
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,867
Everything's going
to be fine.

336
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,705
I just need you
to give us some more time.

337
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:01,600
Bye.

338
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:10,134
He dropped him in
and left in the taxi.

339
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,892
- How's tricks?
- How's what?

340
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,187
Tricks. It's an expression
you guys use.

341
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,746
Hi, honey.

342
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,149
How was your
day?

343
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,736
Why do you have to treat him
like this?

344
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,796
You don't even talk to him!

345
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,674
Hey, cool down, okay?

346
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,718
Sorry.

347
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,567
Don't speak ill of his dad.

348
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,469
Don't turn him
against his dad.

349
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,820
Walk in his shoes for a second.

350
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,489
He has no idea what's going on.

351
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,865
He's dying of curiosity.

352
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,410
He doesn't know why

353
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,936
his mom is not speaking his dad
overnight.

354
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,438
- María, please.
- I mean it.

355
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,232
If you don't talk to me,
I can't help you, Cielo.

356
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,691
Do you want to help
me?

357
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,652
Don't poke your
nose into this.

358
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,028
I'd appreciate
that, honestly.

359
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,963
What do you mean?

360
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,175
You're calling me "nosey"?

361
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,302
Hey, I just want to help.

362
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,803
Cielo.

363
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,514
I just want to help,

364
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,474
which is very different.

365
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,856
So now,

366
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,110
facing this purifying fire...

367
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:38,014
...we'll listen to the voice
one more time.

368
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:44,020
Not a voice from the outside,
but the voice...

369
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:48,232
...each one of us
has within ourselves.

370
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,985
That voice that talks to us
all the time?

371
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,464
It drills us, it points at us,

372
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,299
it questions us.

373
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,801
How good are we?

374
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,704
Am I good enough
to be a businessman?

375
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,458
To be the president
of the republic?

376
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,351
Maybe these days

377
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,712
that's not the best example
but...

378
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,423
What I mean is that the voice
is there...

379
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,734
...talking to us.

380
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,429
And there comes a time when
you have to answer yourself.

381
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,392
What am I good at?
How good am I at it?

382
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:27,313
Am I good enough
to accept myself?

383
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,415
Just the way I am?

384
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,988
Simply me,
who I am.

385
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,715
I don't know, I say yes.

386
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,011
I say yes to myself.

387
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,788
But what does
the voice tells you?

388
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:55,508
What do you answer
to that voice?

389
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,694
You, Jose, for example?

390
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,513
What do you answer
to your voice?

391
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,615
Can you hear it?

392
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,911
Come on, man!

393
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,497
Use this!

394
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,566
If you feel like telling me
all I'm saying

395
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,277
is stupid,
that I'm full of shit,

396
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:18,297
Say it!

397
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,157
You know that,
bro?

398
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,829
I feel like
asking...

399
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,516
What makes you the expert?

400
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,353
I never said I was that.

401
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,854
No, you didn't,

402
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,881
but you're the one
sitting there

403
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,300
telling us to be
happy,

404
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,009
to learn to accept
ourselves,

405
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,928
and blah, blah, blah,
blah,

406
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,931
and to be honest,
I feel I'm at church, bro.

407
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,949
At mass.

408
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,284
Why? Because of the sermon?

409
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,331
You know why?

410
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,874
Because I'm sick

411
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,734
of the people who like
giving sermons

412
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,361
and think they are better
than anybody else,

413
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,213
and look down on people

414
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,240
simply because you
are different.

415
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,841
I understand.

416
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,994
Religious people,
vegetarians,

417
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,663
even sportsmen are
like that.

418
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,123
They can't wait to rub it
on your face

419
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,001
and that makes them
feel better persons.

420
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,177
See, I've got
this friend...

421
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,096
I've got a friend
who says...

422
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,224
...you only need
one had habit

423
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,036
to be given to vice.

424
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,647
But if you're not
given to vice,

425
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,732
that doesn't make you
virtuous.

426
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,875
Right?

427
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:43,800
So, I wonder, Camilo, if...

428
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:47,828
...if you're really
one of us

429
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,430
or you're just there

430
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,458
watching us
from the cheap seats.

431
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,770
You know what?

432
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,397
I've got news for you.

433
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,357
I am one of you.

434
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,235
You are?

435
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,265
Have you ever
really hurt anyone in your life?

436
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,409
And I don't mean just

437
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,187
I don't know, letting your mom
or wife down.

438
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,983
but did you ever really
hurt someone

439
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,544
you really love?

440
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,088
I killed my daughter.

441
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,596
No, well...

442
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,122
Bro, I didn't want
to...

443
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,893
No, no, don't worry.

444
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,337
That's what
we're here for, right?

445
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,609
Talking about these stuff.

446
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,680
June 18th, 1999,
my birthday.

447
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,977
I wanted to celebrate myself,
I deserved it.

448
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:58,023
I was alcoholic back then,
and a cocaine addict.

449
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,670
I was using a lot and...

450
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,238
The night before
I'd bought 3 grams,

451
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,632
three good, heavy grams?

452
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,593
Good old school cocaine.

453
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,598
Cocaine wasn't an issue,

454
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:18,018
I had enough.

455
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,438
But I was out of vodka.

456
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,846
So I decided to start
an argument with my wife

457
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,865
demanding her to go get me

458
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,616
a bottle of vodka

459
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,536
because I deserved it.

460
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:40,524
I had worked a lot
and I was celebrating.

461
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,460
"No, no, you go!"

462
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,879
Unfortunately, at the time

463
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,296
there were no delivery service.

464
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:50,217
So, well, I was pissed.

465
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,745
Without thinking,
I took the car keys,

466
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,389
jumped in...

467
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,208
...put it in reverse
and hit the gas.

468
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,230
I didn't notice Carolina,

469
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,690
my 6 year old daughter,

470
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,510
playing at the end
of the driveway.

471
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:15,058
How do you not
hate yourself?

472
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:18,270
To be honest, I don't hate
myself as much as before.

473
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,792
I hate myself less and less.

474
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,376
For a long time

475
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,862
the only thing I did,
you know what was it, Jose?

476
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,130
Precisely that.

477
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,505
I blamed myself, hated myself.

478
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,132
And that only led me

479
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,994
to go on drinking and using,
and destroying myself.

480
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,580
And destroying
everything around me.

481
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:41,502
I was more devastated and sad
every day.

482
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,983
Woe is me!

483
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,986
But you know what?

484
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,304
One day I decided
that I couldn't go on like this,

485
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,600
that I couldn't live my life,
what was left of it,

486
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,662
feeling so miserable.

487
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:04,817
And I decided
that I had to do something,

488
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:08,754
I had to find a new way.

489
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,633
What way?

490
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,593
The way to change, Jose.

491
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,849
That way.

492
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,717
Cielo!

493
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,552
Can we talk?

494
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,971
Yes, sure, come in.

495
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,399
Honey.

496
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,615
Do you want to start?

497
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,578
Yes.

498
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,638
Are these the divorce documents?

499
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,724
Yes.

500
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,771
Why are you doing this to me?

501
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,148
When did we get to this point?

502
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,608
What is this?

503
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,068
Is it to punish me?

504
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,427
No, I am not
punishing you.

505
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,446
Yes, you are punishing me!

506
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:58,906
Cielo.

507
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:02,409
We are happily married.

508
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,228
I'm happily married--
I'm happy.

509
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,998
It's just we are...

510
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,417
I love you, you know that.

511
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,046
And I would do anything for you.

512
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,839
Would you even consider...?

513
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,215
Telling the truth?

514
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,259
Would you?

515
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,555
Are you calling me

516
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,099
a liar again?

517
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,558
So we're going down that road?

518
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,960
You bring me
the divorce documents.

519
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,378
You come in here,
as if nothing has happened,

520
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:32,464
and both of us
should be solving this,

521
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,024
together.

522
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,692
We're a team, Cielo.

523
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,569
You haven't heard my side yet.

524
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,304
You haven't heard
any of it at all

525
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,559
- No, I've heard enough.
- No.

526
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,535
You're a drug dealer?

527
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,413
What?

528
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,832
Drug dealer?

529
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,708
Yes.

530
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,210
I've been thinking

531
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,404
and I can't find
an explanation.

532
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,365
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money

533
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,093
in such a short time?

534
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,848
Marijuana.

535
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,625
You're dealing marijuana
with that boy,

536
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,769
Jose Miguel.

537
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,608
No?

538
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,613
Is it worse?

539
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,657
Cocaine?

540
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,286
It's methamphetamine.

541
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,649
That's what Henry
mentioned to you the other day,

542
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,401
that they're beginning
to produce it here.

543
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,612
But wait a second.
I'm just a manufacturer.

544
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:40,699
I'm not a dealer.
There's a big difference.

545
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,342
What does that mean?

546
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,827
That you do it but you
don't sell it?

547
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,470
Yes, exactly.

548
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,930
And you think that doesn't mean

549
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,457
you've got blood in
your hands anyway?

550
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:49,975
No, Cielo, wait.

551
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,434
Cielo, please, don't go.

552
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,936
Please, wait a second.

553
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,212
Cielo, this is
much more complicated

554
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,856
than what it seems.

555
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,091
There are a lot of angles
to this, okay?

556
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,692
So please,

557
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,343
let's just sit back down
and talk it through.

558
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,487
Please.

559
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:09,311
I'm going to make you
a deal, Walt.

560
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,938
I won't tell Henry,
or your children

561
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,499
or anybody else.

562
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,359
Nobody will hear it
from me.

563
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,279
But only if you grant me
this divorce

564
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,865
and stay out of
our lives

565
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,717
once for all.

566
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,343
No, Cielo.

567
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:29,039
Let me get the hell out of
here before I throw up.

568
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,622
Jose, take care.

569
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,898
Thanks for
everything.

570
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:57,901
- Camilo.
- Walter.

571
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,523
Come in.

572
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,907
You know what it is?

573
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,367
Little friction.

574
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,369
Couples in general...

575
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:35,289
Besides, it's recent.

576
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,149
Strictly temporary.
We're just...

577
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,317
We're just taking
a little break.

578
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,378
That's you, over there.

579
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,675
Jose, mm...

580
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,410
Saúl is keeping
your money for you,

581
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,995
so as soon
as you're feeling better...

582
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,763
I'm better.

583
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,350
You're better? Really?

584
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,809
So, therapy,

585
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,519
the rehab, it helped?

586
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,379
Yes, I'm not using.
I'm clean.

587
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,524
Good!

588
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,443
That's very good.

589
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,279
Congratulations.

590
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:10,199
Look, I think we should

591
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:11,767
stop thinking
about how bad things got.

592
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,394
I mean, the consequences
of it all.

593
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,646
Let's focus,
let's be optimistic

594
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,023
and try to get our lives
back together again

595
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,708
and on the straight and narrow.

596
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,819
You been following
this airplane crash?

597
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,380
Yes.

598
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,448
Did you know
it was Juana's dad

599
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,091
who crashed them together?

600
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,660
The man was so torn up
after what happened
that--

601
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,079
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

602
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:35,415
You are not responsible
for this whatsoever.

603
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,042
I am very up-to-date
on this thing,

604
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,269
probably far more

605
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,770
than you are.

606
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,105
Look, there are many factors

607
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,565
at play here.

608
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,983
Yes? For instance?

609
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,443
I mean, for example

610
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,070
the collision radar on the jet

611
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,529
didn't work.

612
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,031
That's public record.

613
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,390
You can look that up on line
if you want.

614
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,909
But it goes deeper than that.

615
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,185
It's the whole
technological system

616
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,912
that is completely obsolete.

617
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,330
You know who's responsible?

618
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,789
The government.

619
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,817
Look, Mr. Blanco,
you...

620
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,819
... You either run from
things or you face them.

621
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:07,214
That simple.

622
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,466
What do you mean by that?

623
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,369
It's something I leaned
in the rehab center.

624
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,054
In fact, it's pretty brief.

625
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,555
It's not about changing,

626
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,375
it's about accepting
who you really are.

627
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,519
I accept who I am.

628
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,398
And who are you?

629
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,401
I'm the bad guy, bro.

630
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,614
Gentleman, is everything okay?

631
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,308
Everything's great.
Thanks a lot. Very good service.

632
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,452
Very well.

633
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,148
Are you enjoying
yourself, sir?

634
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,832
A lot.

635
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,943
It's good to see you
here again, Walter.

636
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,278
- Thanks a lot.
- May I?

637
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,422
Please.

638
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:58,999
I have an offer that will be
of interest to you, Walter.

639
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:02,227
I actually am not here to...

640
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,853
I mean...

641
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,397
I'm here

642
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,007
because I think I owe you
the courtesy

643
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,634
and respect to tell you
personally...

644
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,513
...that I decided
I'm leaving this.

645
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,824
I'm done.

646
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,367
Please, know

647
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,311
this has nothing to do
with you personally.

648
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,954
On the contrary.

649
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,815
I find you
extraordinarily professional.

650
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,609
I appreciate
the way you do business.

651
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,211
In fact, this decision

652
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:32,341
only has got to do with me.

653
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,511
I feel...

654
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,080
...I have to make a change
in my life.

655
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:41,875
I don't know, I'm at something
of a crossroads...

656
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,585
and it's brought me
to the realization

657
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,545
that I don't what
to be a criminal.

658
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,757
No offence
to any people who are.

659
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,443
That's simply not who I am.

660
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:52,944
Notwithstanding,

661
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,764
I'd like you to hear my
offer.

662
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:58,367
Sure.

663
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,952
But it won't change my mind.

664
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:06,775
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

665
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,130
Dollars?

666
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,049
May I take this as a "yes"?

667
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,762
I have money.

668
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:23,583
I have more money
than I know how to spend.

669
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,478
What I don't have is my family.

670
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,439
The answer is still no.

671
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,362
Fine.

672
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:38,615
Then...

673
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,658
...enjoy your evening.

674
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,520
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

675
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,070
Welcome to Colombia!

676
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,347
You come from Mexico,

677
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,408
I can tell for the suitcases.

678
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,564
You're kind of
rockers?

679
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,874
Like in... rock!

680
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,340
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">English?</font></i>

681
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,342
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I speak English.</font></i>

682
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:24,262
It's so hot, bro.

683
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,182
It's been hot these days?

684
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,545
Very well, sirs,
this is your hotel.

685
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,506
It's only 40
thousand pesos.

686
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,891
Yes, well, the thing is
the airport surcharge

687
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,409
is not included

688
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:49,229
and the Sunday night
fee, either.
