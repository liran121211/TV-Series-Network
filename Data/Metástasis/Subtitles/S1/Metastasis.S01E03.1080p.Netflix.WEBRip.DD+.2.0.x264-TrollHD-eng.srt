1
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,529
<i>If we tore apart the human body,</i>

2
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,907
<i>if we took all the
chemical elements</i>

3
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:16,577
<i>and components it's made of,</i>

4
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,955
<i>and put them in a recipient,</i>

5
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:24,502
we'd find out that body
is made of the following:

6
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:29,674
63% of hydrogen.

7
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,636
26% of oxygen,

8
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,349
9% of carbon.

9
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,685
Nitrogen.

10
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,356
The calcium of the bones.

11
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,697
Iron.

12
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,789
Sodium.

13
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,051
Don't worry. I'll spare
you the calculation.

14
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,636
This adds up to a total of...

15
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,565
What happens here?

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,569
What's missing to complete 100%?

17
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,989
<i>What's the human body made of?</i>

18
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,415
It's the most disgusting thing
that ever happened to me!

19
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,542
That's because you
don't do things right.

20
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,378
You know what,
professor? I tried!

21
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,213
What? What's wrong?

22
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,591
- There, next to your mouth.
- Where? What?

23
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:07,396
[sound of brush
cleaning the floor]

24
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,174
I hate these shoes.

25
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,426
They seem to be a manicurist's.

26
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,804
Or of one of those women
whose names begin with "Y",

27
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:46,393
like "Yenny",
or "Yuly" or "Yulitza".

28
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,688
A woman's dignity is
definitely in her shoes!

29
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,816
Then what do you wear them for?

30
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:58,030
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

31
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,074
You know nothing about women,
do you, Junior?

32
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,451
Get this.

33
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,704
I'll be right back.

34
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,415
- What happened?
- I'm going to make a call.

35
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,918
And why don't
you call from here?

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,586
Is it a girl?

37
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,672
No, mom, it's not a female.

38
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,175
Honey, please,
don't say that word.

39
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,343
Don't call women that way.

40
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,220
"Female".

41
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,516
You missed a spot right there.

42
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,104
Should you be up on that ladder?

43
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,124
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

44
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:35,609
No, no,
no. Walter should be helping you.

45
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,611
I know.

46
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,910
- María?

47
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,209
You've smoked your fair share
of pot in college, didn't you?

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,584
Why are you asking me that?

49
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,798
Because there's a neighbor that thinks
her son is smoking, but she's not sure.

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,843
- Which neighbor?
- Not even once?

51
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,525
You used to go out
with an anthropologist.

52
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:06,557
He smoked in front of
me two or three times top.

53
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,685
Do you remember if he changed?

54
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:13,647
Did his personality
change or something?

55
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,358
Well,
he sort of got on a bad mood.

56
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,279
When he smoked,
he got serious and quiet.

57
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,782
Walter Junior is on pot?

58
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,701
What? No!

59
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,953
No,
no. How could you think Walter--?

60
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,997
Not that I know at least.

61
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,875
Parents are the
last ones to realize.

62
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,752
That's why he didn't
make that call here.

63
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,712
He'd talking to his dealer.

64
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,298
María, María, María,
come here. No.

65
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,175
I'm just asking
because of my neighbor.

66
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,719
Stop making things up, please!

67
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:47,056
Junior is not on pot,
did you get me?

68
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,099
Yes.

69
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,975
I mean it!

70
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,352
Is it clear to you?

71
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,397
Yes, it's all clear.

72
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,991
Look at me.

73
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,244
Look at me!

74
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,580
You shouldn't do this to anyone.

75
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,624
This here I wouldn't do
this to my worst enemy.

76
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,588
I'm really sorry.

77
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,841
Kill me.

78
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,050
Kill me or let me go.

79
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,094
Just do some shit
but get this off me!

80
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,433
Walter,
you'll have to do something.

81
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,147
How do you know my name?

82
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,275
Because of José.

83
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,279
When he came by to sell your meth,
he told me a lot about you.

84
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,407
He said you're his
chemistry teacher.

85
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,035
You have a son who's retarded.

86
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,953
My son has a motoric condition.

87
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,332
That partner of
yours has a big mouth

88
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,458
and that's not good for the business,
you get me?

89
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,756
You seem to be a
good man. Don't do this.

90
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,051
What do you want me to do?

91
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,262
Let you go as though
we were best friends?

92
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,224
Either that or...

93
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,851
You know.

94
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,021
Do you want me to tell you
what's your real problem?

95
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,691
Your real problem
is sitting upstairs.

96
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,651
It even has a name.

97
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,244
What the hell, man?

98
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,995
He told me my
name! Where I work!

99
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,538
You even told him about my son!

100
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,374
And it's all
because of this shit!

101
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,251
Damn junkie!

102
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,211
This is going down the toilet.

103
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,380
No, don't throw it. That's
worth a lot of money.

104
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,924
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

105
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,385
Get off!

106
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,012
What are you doing?

107
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,435
What's wrong with
you? That stays here!

108
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,604
No, no!

109
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,901
José!

110
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:47,903
Come here!

111
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,424
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

112
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,859
- You're not going anywhere!
- Stop!

113
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,760
Get off the car!
We've got work to do!

114
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,429
We?

115
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:17,766
We? Not we,
bitch. You've got work to do!

116
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,351
I did my part! I'm done!

117
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,937
You? Who helped
you clean that shit?

118
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,772
- If--
- I did! And that was your job!

119
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,399
I didn't want to
be part of this!

120
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,252
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

121
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,028
Because you didn't
follow my instructions!

122
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,696
Just think whatever
you fucking want,

123
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,783
but we played rock-paper-scissors
and that's sacred.

124
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,167
Just keep your word!

125
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,429
Sure, girl.

126
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,097
Didn't I tell you
what Carlos told me?

127
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,766
He says he's nothing
to do with Johanna.

128
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,976
So now--

129
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,062
Excuse me,
do you have these in purple?

130
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,315
She's a nurse, so she'll do

131
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:09,234
all the dirty things he
tells her to do at night.

132
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,529
No, sure.

133
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,532
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

134
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,409
I'm sorry,
baby. I'm sort of busy.

135
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,744
<i>There's something important
I want to talk to you about.</i>

136
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,539
<i>- The thing is that--</i>
- What's up?

137
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,665
What's up,
fucker? Against the wall!

138
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,334
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

139
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:26,418
<i>So?</i>

140
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,130
Henry,
don't do that. You scared me.

141
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,299
<i>- You're talking to me.</i>
- Search him.

142
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,842
Thanks, Gómez.

143
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,179
All right. I'm free now,
honey. What is it?

144
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,324
There's something serious
going on with Walter Junior.

145
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,599
How come?

146
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,268
He's doing drugs. He's on pot.

147
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,855
Walter Junior? Come on, María.

148
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,773
María, who told you that?

149
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,068
Cielo. Well, she didn't tell me,
she sorts of thinks so.

150
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,237
She thinks so?

151
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,407
It's just like when a
man goes to the doctor

152
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,618
and says he's got a friend who
suffers from erectile dysfunction.

153
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,412
So I want you to talk to him.

154
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:05,082
No, hold on. Not me.
That's not my responsibility.

155
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,292
Walter should. Let him do it.

156
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,297
Henry, it'd be much better if
you talked to him. He respect you.

157
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,466
Show him something horrible,
I don't know.

158
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,470
An autopsy from an overdose,
for instance.

159
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:22,974
Honey, there exist no pictures
of autopsies for pot overdose.

160
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,936
Henry, don't fool me. You
know what I'm talking about.

161
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,730
Show him horrible things,
something that scares him.

162
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:32,734
Like the consequences
of drug addiction.

163
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,529
No, I don't know.

164
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,114
Honey!

165
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,658
I need you to talk to him
because you can help him.

166
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,160
And if we don't do it,
no one will.

167
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,289
I love you, honey. Bye.

168
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,632
I'm not good at having
open relationships.

169
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,384
I'm so fool that I
end up falling in love.

170
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,597
So are we going out? Wait.

171
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,682
Madam, I'm sorry.

172
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,810
You need to be wearing
footies before you try those on.

173
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,647
I'm extremely clean.

174
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,232
I'm sure you're clean,

175
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,234
but if my boss
comes and sees you

176
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,194
trying those with no socks,

177
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,072
you'll get me in trouble.

178
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,782
All right.

179
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,576
No, it's just that...

180
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,663
Will you try the gray shoes?
I have them at the back.

181
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,248
Don't hang. Hold
on. I'll bring them.

182
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,862
Let's see, boy.

183
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,865
Have you ever been
in a place like this?

184
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,785
No,
uncle. I've just seen it in the news.

185
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:51,122
They rob with guns and knives
and kill people as well, but that's all.

186
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,542
In the news? They
call me from the news

187
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,168
to interview me and stuff.

188
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,004
But don't get distracted.

189
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,757
No, uncle. I'm paying attention.

190
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,841
You're paying attention?

191
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,679
So if you're paying attention,
what do you think of this place?

192
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,931
What do you mean what
do I think of this place?

193
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,934
Yes. What are your conclusions?
How does it make you feel?

194
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,438
- It's ugly. It's dirty.
- Dirty.

195
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,982
Would you move
to a place like this?

196
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,485
No.

197
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,153
- No?
- No.

198
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,281
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

199
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,074
Why not?

200
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,660
Because I prefer
my home. It's better.

201
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,830
It's good that you
value what you have.

202
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,457
You have to value your house

203
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,710
and value your parents
because they sacrifice for you.

204
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,463
Uncle, why did we come here?
Weren't we going to eat hamburgers?

205
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,758
Yes,
but I took a detour for you to check out

206
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,138
how the other half lives.

207
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,556
Do you get me?

208
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,058
Why didn't we just go
to the hamburger store?

209
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,437
Because that's
not so educational.

210
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,898
- Educational?
- Yes. Pay attention.

211
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,068
You know what they
call this place? Eden.

212
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,447
You know why?
Because it's the paradise

213
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,907
of drug and heroin addicts.

214
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:13,079
And also of the ones that
are use methanpheta...

215
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,332
- Mine?
- "Mine", good.

216
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,916
I like it. You're
paying attention.

217
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,418
Remember I told
you at your house

218
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,796
that a new drug has
just hit Colombia?

219
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,840
Look, just to put it short.

220
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,467
All these people you see here

221
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:30,263
would sell their
grandma's coochie for a hit.

222
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,727
You think that's funny?

223
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,521
Tell me, what's funny about it?

224
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,397
The coochie part,
uncle. That's all.

225
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,899
Is it?

226
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,067
How do you think
they got started?

227
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,653
You know that? Tell me,
with what?

228
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:45,863
With brandy?

229
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,698
No, brandy, bro! With marijuana!

230
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,533
Marijuana! You know marijuana?

231
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,870
Why couldn't they just
begin with brandy or--?

232
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,414
Because that's something
else. This is different.

233
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,958
All right - All right.

234
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,921
Uncle,
why are you telling me all this?

235
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,174
I love you very much, son.

236
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,343
I worry about you.

237
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,763
I don't want anything to happen to you,
OK?

238
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,560
Do you get what
I'm trying to tell you?

239
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,770
Yes, sort of.

240
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,940
"Yes,
sort of." You don't understand shit!

241
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,984
That's the thing with the new
generations. You don't understand anything.

242
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:29,030
You're audiovisual,
multimedia, viral,

243
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,991
so you don't get shit!

244
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,078
Look.

245
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,538
I'll show you.

246
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,289
Wendy!

247
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,959
Come!

248
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,252
Uncle, do you know that girl?

249
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,628
Princess! Hey!

250
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,672
Do you know that girl?

251
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,466
No,
it's not that I know her. I do-- I don't--

252
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,385
It's not that-- Not closely.

253
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,554
- Uncle, let's go.
- Wait, wait.

254
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,514
Come, come here.

255
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,808
What's up, Wendy?

256
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,728
I'm not doing anything wrong,
all right?

257
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,105
I know. Come here.

258
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,566
This is my nephew. Say hi.

259
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,944
Do I fuck him?

260
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,337
- Let's see...
- No, no, no, uncle.

261
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,239
Oral, manual or full?

262
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,300
- It's $40 half an hour both.
- Wendy, Wendy, Wendy!

263
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,743
We're not here for that.

264
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,828
We're here for him to
learn about other things.

265
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,162
Uncle, why don't we just leave?

266
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,582
Other things,
all right? Do you get me?

267
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,042
What do you put in?

268
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:27,881
And I'm not talking of dicks.

269
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:31,301
Are you on the
pipe or the needle?

270
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,053
My only drug is God.

271
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,473
Really? And I have milk teeth.

272
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,558
Speaking of teeth,
let me see yours.

273
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,813
Check out those pearly whites.

274
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,314
Check that out.

275
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,358
That's for smoking meth.

276
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,861
Come on,
ask her whatever you want.

277
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:50,407
No, no, no.

278
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,322
Take the chance and
ask her whatever you want.

279
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,240
- Let's go, all right?
- Ask her!

280
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,242
- What do you want to ask her?
- Nothing, uncle.

281
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,996
Do you know how she started?

282
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,998
- Smoking pot.
- No.

283
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,625
I began drinking brandy.

284
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,878
Yes, but... But bran--

285
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,172
You mixed that, didn't you?

286
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,008
You like pot, don't you?

287
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,634
- Don't you?
- Why, you got some?

288
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,552
- What? No.
- Uncle.

289
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,095
Are you smoking a joint?

290
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,222
Smoke what? No one is smoking here,
all right?

291
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,768
You brought him to get him high.

292
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,812
What are you talking
about? Get out of here!

293
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,522
Get out!

294
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,524
Get out or I'll call the police!

295
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,733
Uncle, you're a cop.

296
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,152
Yes, I know. I know.

297
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,322
Get lost!

298
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,205
I hope you've learnt the lesson.

299
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,002
Let's go.

300
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,504
Let's eat some hamburgers.

301
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,101
Close, close that!

302
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,145
Who the hell was that?

303
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,899
A cop and a boy.

304
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,377
What did they want? They asked
you about me? What did you tell them?

305
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,654
They didn't even
know what they wanted.

306
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,323
I don't like this
shit. It's so weird.

307
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,493
José, just stop fucking around.
Did you bring it? Get it out.

308
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,705
What's the hurry?

309
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,208
Come on.

310
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,644
KILLING HIM

311
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,400
LETTING HIM LIVE

312
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,579
I'M NOT A MURDERER

313
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:14,047
KILLING IS BAD

314
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:27,144
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH IT

315
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:43,326
IF I LET HIM LIVE,
HE'LL KILL MY FAMILY

316
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,967
- Hello?
- Honey, hello.

317
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,928
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
call you before.</i>

318
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,848
<i>I've been working a lot and...</i>

319
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,265
Well, it's pilled up

320
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,143
and you know how
thing are at the car wash.

321
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,505
I don't have a
single free moment.

322
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,439
I know perfectly well
it's my fault because...

323
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,650
You know what?
You were totally right.

324
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,820
I have to make them
comply with my schedule.

325
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,530
I'll do it. I swear.

326
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,701
Hello? Cielo.

327
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,871
Are you at the car wash?

328
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,583
- Yes.
- I seriously doubt that.

329
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,003
You quitted two weeks ago.

330
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:38,006
<i>I called asking about you and Ramiro,
your ex-boss,</i>

331
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:41,218
told me everything.
Even that you insulted him.

332
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,678
Honey, I know it sounds
weird. Just let me get home

333
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,765
and I'll explain everything to you,
all right?

334
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,351
No, I have a better idea.

335
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,853
Stay where you are.

336
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,732
Darling,
what a sec-- Hello? Cielo?

337
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,575
<i>Walter!</i>

338
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,786
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

339
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,789
<i>Walter!</i>

340
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,613
Are you all right?

341
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,786
I thought you were dead.

342
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,001
How long was I out?

343
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,381
About fifteen minutes.

344
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,406
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

345
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,930
What happened?

346
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,433
You breathe in the same
thing you used on me?

347
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,570
I have lung cancer.

348
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,077
I'll make you another sandwich.

349
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,771
It's safe. It's not poisoned.

350
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,899
So you're thinking
of killing me?

351
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,318
I mean,
if you've already made a decision.

352
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,738
It's a chance.

353
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,949
Of course it's a chance.

354
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,993
It's quite an obvious chance
since you're a chemist.

355
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,871
You decide whether
you eat it or not.

356
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,501
No, I will...

357
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,046
I've eaten worse
things in my life.

358
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,357
Loco?

359
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,401
They've always called you that?

360
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,568
Yes.

361
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,654
I guess you have a real name.

362
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,284
Domingo.

363
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,289
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

364
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,666
It sounds more... I
don't know... Human.

365
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,211
I've never liked that name.

366
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,797
It's some old guy's name.

367
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,550
Just call me whatever you want.

368
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,556
So, Domingo, where are you from?

369
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,309
Do you always ask
so much bullshit?

370
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,654
What do you want to know me for?
So that you can't kill me afterwards?

371
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,191
You keep on repeating
I wouldn't kill you.

372
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,319
Maybe I wouldn't.

373
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,029
Maybe I would.

374
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,368
The truth is I'm looking for a
single reason not to kill you.

375
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,453
Any reason. Any.

376
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,165
Persuade me!

377
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,916
Help yourself!

378
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,252
Fine.

379
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,172
If you let me go,
it'll all be all right.

380
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,674
No deaths.

381
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,220
Let's just pretend we never met.

382
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,765
Anyone in your
situation would say that.

383
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,061
That's just survival instinct.

384
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,022
Maybe you're right.

385
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,774
But I'm telling the truth.

386
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,110
I don't know what
else to tell you.

387
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,281
If you don't convince me,
I'll leave you tied there.

388
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,825
So just think a little
bit! Help yourself!

389
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,329
Walter.

390
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,418
- Sit down. Let's talk.
- What for? Will it be any good?

391
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,379
Look, I'm not from here.

392
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,257
I'm from Medellín.

393
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,385
I've been living in
Bogotá for years.

394
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,179
I don't know anything,
not even Cartagena.

395
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,432
But I have lots of
friends from there.

396
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,683
I didn't finish high-school

397
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,894
but I would have
liked to go to college.

398
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,398
I'm really good at Math,
you know?

399
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,233
I guess that's useful
for your business.

400
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,362
In some situations it is,

401
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,322
but in others, it's not.

402
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,823
Sure.

403
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:25,371
You never wanted to study?

404
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:29,292
When my dad's restaurant closed,

405
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,586
I had no option but to work.

406
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,254
Did you have a restaurant?

407
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,881
Yes, it was famous.

408
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:39,093
It was called "<i> El
Escondite del Tragón</i> ".

409
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,680
It sounds familiar.

410
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,682
I told you it was famous.

411
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,936
Wasn't there a commercial
during the matches?

412
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:53,107
Yes,
it was always the same old one.

413
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,651
My dad used to tell me:

414
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,360
"Son, remember...".

415
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,946
No, wait. Don't say it. Wait.

416
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,031
It was...

417
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,662
"A full stomach makes
for a happy heart

418
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,413
at the<i> Escondite del Tragón,</i>

419
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,499
where you'll have
the best chicharrón!".

420
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,501
Yes, sure!

421
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,272
Pretty moronic. But it did
tend to stick in your head.

422
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,381
No,
besides the music was cheerful. It was...

423
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,384
- Yes.
- I think I've been there.

424
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,012
Didn't you make...?

425
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,181
You made some figures

426
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,766
with the sausages.

427
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,645
Yes. The most famous
dish was the Eiffel Tower.

428
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,146
That's right!

429
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,814
I was there.

430
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,275
What's more,
I met your dad. Did he manage the business?

431
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,586
He's called Domingo,
just like me.

432
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,320
A fat guy with a hairy beard?

433
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,864
That's him.

434
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,744
And did you help him?
Did you work with him?

435
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,373
I worked there for some time

436
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,834
until they closed it

437
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:57,463
But if you went there long ago,
we probably met.

438
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,049
I used to clean
every day for my dad.

439
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,722
It's incredible where life will take you,
isn't it?

440
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,431
The world is...

441
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,561
It's a small world.

442
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,770
Exactly.

443
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,609
You want another one?

444
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,475
Does José know you have cancer?

445
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,604
No one but you.

446
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,522
Just you.

447
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:59,316
You're kidding. Not
even your family?

448
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,901
No one.

449
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,653
Why not?

450
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,828
Not a conversation I'm
even remotely ready to have.

451
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,500
So you're cooking meth to leave them money,
I guess.

452
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,128
If that's so, I have money.

453
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,714
I can buy my freedom.

454
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:26,218
Walter,
you seem to be a nice man.

455
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,178
Good.

456
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,514
Don't ruin your life, man.

457
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,105
I don't know what to do.

458
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,023
You do know what to do.

459
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,192
You know what's right.

460
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,285
I'll get the key.

461
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,147
No.

462
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,194
Can't be.

463
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,739
Can't be.

464
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,189
You're doing the right thing,
Walter.

465
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,577
Would you mind turning around?
The lock is on the other side.

466
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,549
Aren't you angry?

467
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,887
Why do you ask?

468
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,601
I don't know. After what happened,
it'd be normal for you to be angry.

469
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,940
Yes, but we said we'd let this go,
right?

470
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,069
Yes, that's right.

471
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,363
Besides, I just want to go home.

472
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,701
Me too.

473
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,830
Come on, Walter.

474
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:43,666
Let me go.

475
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,426
The moment I do are
you gonna stick me

476
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,762
with that broken piece of plate?

477
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,513
I'm sorry.

478
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,181
I'm sorry.

479
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,915
What's this shit?

480
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,792
Dude, what's up?

481
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,546
I'm all bitten, damn.

482
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,885
It must have been the fleas
because the hotel is full of them.

483
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:20,054
Do they bite you too?

484
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,682
Not any more. I
must be out of blood.

485
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,893
I think I still have them on.

486
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,895
Check me out.

487
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,897
Wendy!

488
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,649
Shake it out so you
don't take it with you.

489
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,944
I'm taking a shower
to get this shit off.

490
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,613
Hey, José!

491
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,617
Don't get in there. I don't
even shower myself in it.

492
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:44,745
Then I rather shower at home?

493
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,080
You bet.

494
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,507
Good luck.

495
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,817
Hi, José.

496
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,402
Did I scare you?
- Rosita, just a little bit.

497
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,404
- How are you?
- Fine, madam.

498
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,200
When are you taking
me for a ride in this car?

499
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,701
Whenever you tell me.

500
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,870
All right. We just
have to set a date.

501
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,331
- Yes, madam.
- Is there something wrong?

502
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:33,085
- No, it's all right.
- Let me know if you need anything.

503
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,087
- Yes, madam.
- See you. Bye.

504
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,018
Hello?

505
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,886
Damn.

506
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,656
Settle down, please.

507
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:46,449
Pay attention!

508
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,165
Professor Walter
Blanco called this morning

509
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:56,252
to say he's feeling
under the weather today.

510
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,963
So the class will be different
today. We'll watch a movie.

511
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,841
It's about carbon.

512
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:05,510
It's an interesting
and educational movie,

513
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,513
so I suggest you pay attention

514
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:12,392
because he'll ask you
questions next class.

515
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,520
Enjoy it.

516
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,873
<i>What's the human body made of?</i>

517
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,709
What's missing to
complete that 100%?

518
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,836
I can't give you a
scientific answer.

519
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,799
You have to find
out. All I can tell you

520
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,343
is that it's not a
chemical element.

521
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,428
It's something that
goes beyond that.

522
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,348
And you're totally free

523
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,558
to decide what that is.

524
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,685
The soul?

525
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:59,273
<i>Or is it just emptiness?</i>

526
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,108
<i>Just that.</i>

527
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,039
What's up, Gómez?

528
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,499
Let's see what you think.

529
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,376
This is quite weird.

530
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,587
For me this is not a matter
between drug buyers and dealers.

531
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,756
Nobody came way the
hell out here just to buy.

532
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,925
You know what I think?

533
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,303
It's a cook site.

534
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,471
No,
that's not possible. This is too small.

535
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,431
Who would cook
cocaine here? No one.

536
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:37,186
No,
there are not just cocaine labs.

537
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:41,273
A meth lab fits
perfectly in this van.

538
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,649
No.

539
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,319
No what? Stop
saying no to everything.

540
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,154
It's been searched
already. There's nothing.

541
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,114
No pipes, no tubes, no nothing.

542
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,949
- Is this Loco's car?
- Yes.

543
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,659
Who searched it?

544
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,330
Let's go then!

545
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:59,708
Do you want me to show
you how to search a car?

546
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,168
Stand there.

547
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,379
Be careful. Be careful.

548
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,838
You know what's
the thing with this?

549
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,257
You do it the wrong way.

550
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,426
This is not simple. No.

551
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,720
You have to touch, bro.

552
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,724
With sensitivity.

553
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,851
- Sensitivity.
- Yes, sir.

554
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,770
Just like my masseuse,
with sensitivity.

555
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,856
That's it. With
sensitivity. Look.

556
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,567
You have to let the car
talk. You have to touch it

557
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:29,238
and it'll start talking. For example,
check this out.

558
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,531
This is supposed

559
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,701
to get here.

560
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,120
Look.

561
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,832
Yes!

562
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:44,544
Look, dude, what's this?

563
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,755
Excuse me, what's this?

564
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,340
Methamphetamine.

565
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,175
Methamphetamine!

566
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,388
You can't teach me
how to do my job.

567
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,309
You know what is needed
in this job? Sensitivity.

568
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,478
I've never seen it in this size.

569
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,313
This is not produced
in Colombia.

570
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,065
You know what I'm thinking?

571
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,692
That they killed this guy

572
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,446
and who knows
where they took him.

573
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,990
- There's no corpse.
- And there will be no corpse

574
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,909
because they made him disappear.

575
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,455
So we have no
snitch. We're fucked.

576
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,917
Hey, what did you find?

577
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,171
Show me.

578
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,884
What did I tell you, Gomez?

579
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,179
Cielo.

580
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,893
We have to talk.
