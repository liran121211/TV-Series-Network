1
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,130
- Good morning.

2
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,923
Hello.

3
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,617
You're not thinking
of going to work today, are you?

4
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,845
Yes.

5
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,248
You should take
the rest of the week.

6
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,891
I'm fine.

7
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,335
That inhaler
seems to be doing the trick.

8
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,923
Yes, honey.
But you shouldn't push it.

9
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:55,384
I want you well
for the weekend.

10
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,779
Mom wants to party.

11
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,990
It's just a little get-together.

12
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:04,560
Just the family
and a few friends.

13
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:10,691
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

14
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,710
Yes, sure. Sounds good.

15
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,753
Walter.

16
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,998
- Do you want something else?
- No, I'm fine.

17
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,808
What are you doing today?

18
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,811
Nothing.

19
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,272
You changed your mind.

20
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,315
Yes.

21
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,243
If you take a good nap,

22
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,204
you'll have your reward tonight.

23
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,166
Have a nice day.

24
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,210
Thanks.

25
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,501
Are you busy?

26
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,130
Can we meet?

27
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,547
I actually thought

28
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,466
you were gone for good.

29
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,326
I mean,
that you have passed away.

30
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,803
I was even checking the obits.

31
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:49,723
No such luck.

32
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,226
So how are you?

33
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,978
Are you still coughing up blood

34
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,755
and saying you don't deserve it,
and you're an asshole?

35
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,108
A little bit of both.

36
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,385
I still think the same
about me.

37
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,597
And the cough
is there.

38
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,284
What did the doctor say?

39
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,328
Which are the studies results?

40
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,271
- Radiation pneumonitis.
Shit.

41
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,648
Actually, it isn't as bad
as it sounds.

42
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,317
- Yes, sure.
- Really.

43
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,045
It's part of the process.

44
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,132
The treatment is simple.

45
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,410
These are mild side
effects.

46
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,012
And the cancer?

47
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,472
There's good news.

48
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,683
Is it what I'm imagining?

49
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,168
The tumor isn't smaller,
is it?

50
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:38,063
Yes, it is smaller.

51
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,107
Really?

52
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,693
I'm not cured,

53
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,054
but there's been a significant
size reduction.

54
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,240
I know you aren't cured,

55
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,850
but how significant
is the reduction?

56
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,369
Eighty percent.

57
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,895
Eighty percent?
That's a lot!

58
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,873
It's like three quarters.

59
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,416
No.

60
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,610
Three quarters would
be 75 percent.

61
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,586
So it's a little bit more.

62
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,088
Even better!

63
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,632
Cancer is still there,

64
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,094
but I have options now.

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,871
That's the word they used
"options."

66
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,015
It's great, man!

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,476
I know you aren't an optimist.

68
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,171
But you have
plenty to celebrate.

69
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,190
I know why I'm saying it.

70
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,483
I rather be prudent.

71
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,345
My grandmother
didn't even make it

72
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,322
to the phase you are now.

73
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,324
We never thought

74
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,850
that the tumor
could be reduced.

75
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,937
In my case, it's smaller.
Unbelievable.

76
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,997
But I have to admit it.

77
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,582
It's much smaller now.

78
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,209
You did it, man!

79
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,169
You should be celebrating!

80
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,962
Let's have some brandy.

81
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,381
Easy, easy.

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,757
Now what?

83
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:52,288
No, no,
hold on, hold on.

84
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,539
That's your part
from the selling

85
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,375
of the production
while you weren't here.

86
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,835
Do we still have
stock?

87
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,838
Yes, we do.
But it won't last much.

88
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,757
- It sells like hotcakes.
- Great.

89
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,863
Considering this big news,

90
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,907
what are we going to do?

91
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,642
I don't want you to think
I'm pushing you.

92
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,577
Not at all, but--

93
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,664
Yes, yes. I know.

94
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,359
I think
we should stay cautious.

95
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,461
Let's sell off what we have.

96
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,506
Then, we'll...

97
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,450
Say it, man.
Don't worry.

98
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,703
Jose, you know
I got into this

99
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,539
because I was dying,
because I was very bad.

100
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,125
I had nothing
to leave to my family.

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,144
You aren't dying now, are you?

102
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,896
I hope so.

103
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,631
I think it would be
very irresponsible

104
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,966
if we stay in
this business,

105
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,567
which is too risky.

106
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,611
Circumstances have changed.

107
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:55,684
You know you may disappear
in this business overnight.

108
00:07:55,726 --> 00:08:00,564
Then, you're saying
you made up your mind.

109
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,291
I think it's the best.

110
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,695
Let's sell what we have,
and we're done.

111
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:15,620
The first thing they do
is to cool the glasses.

112
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,291
Then, they add
some salt here

113
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:22,019
to improve the taste.

114
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,062
Look! It's done!

115
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,923
- How...?
- The salt...

116
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,733
Sorry to interrupt.

117
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,303
Can I make a toast
with a non-alcoholic beverage?

118
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:36,725
If you're carrying
quintuplets, you can.

119
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,498
Let's make a toast, then.

120
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,277
I know one party
can't begin to repay

121
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:51,198
all the love and support
you've given us.

122
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,533
Therefore,
we have a bartender

123
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,219
who came from Mexico.

124
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,720
Bravo!

125
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,763
He learnt to prepare margaritas.

126
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:03,210
If there's sadness,
fill up your glass.

127
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,646
In case of happiness...

128
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,941
- Your glass fill up!

129
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,069
Okay!

130
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:17,766
I really want to thank you,
all of you.

131
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:24,606
These last few months
have been... hard

132
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:31,213
to put it mildly.

133
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,741
Walter has come through it
like a champ.

134
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,843
Honey, I'm proud of you.

135
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,845
Thank you.

136
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,890
We all are.

137
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,754
For the first time,
we look at the future

138
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,940
optimistically.

139
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,610
I want to thank two persons

140
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,695
who couldn't be here today.

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,242
They are Edgar and Marcela.

142
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,145
For those of you
who don't know them,

143
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,248
they're very generous people.

144
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,027
They paid
for Walter's treatment.

145
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,670
Without them,

146
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,489
I don't know
what we'd have done.

147
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,591
They're our angels.

148
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,009
To Edgar and Marcela.

149
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,054
- Cheers!

150
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,765
We want to hear the king!

151
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,392
Tell your father!

152
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,395
Come on, Dad. Speech.

153
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,772
I'm not good at this.

154
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,817
Come on!

155
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,282
Well, what can I say?

156
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:45,454
When I got my diagnosis,

157
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:51,318
the first thing I thought
was "Why me?"

158
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,254
Now that I got the good news

159
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,965
that I'm much better

160
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,244
that I'm getting better
every day,

161
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:04,164
I wonder the same thing:
Why me?

162
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,131
Thank you for coming.

163
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:15,942
Cheers!

164
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,803
Those were inspiring
words.

165
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,810
He's as cold
as ice.

166
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,500
I have to admit it.

167
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,959
They are original.

168
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,461
Pay attention:

169
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,088
They made a mercury switch bomb,

170
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,132
add it a 9-volt battery,

171
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,286
and use
less than eight ounces of C-4.

172
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,845
And there's more.

173
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,472
They take the man's head,

174
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,726
and put it on a turtle.

175
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,686
Don't say they aren't original.

176
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,187
Why a turtle, uncle?

177
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,689
That's the best part.

178
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,092
They use the turtle
as... not a metaphor,

179
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,361
not an analogy either.

180
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,889
What's the word
I'm looking for, Walter?

181
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,616
Well, whatever.

182
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:07,018
The point
is that the man we had there,

183
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,646
our snitch,
was called Tortuga or Turtle.

184
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,149
I don't know why.
He resembled a mandrill

185
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,167
more than a turtle.

186
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,986
That was
the beginning of everything.

187
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,213
Can I have one?

188
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,949
I know what the word
I've been looking for is.

189
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,593
Poetic!

190
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,996
They use the turtle
in a poetic manner.

191
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,098
Do you understand?

192
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,358
Cheers!

193
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,859
Come on, drink it.

194
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,637
Wait until your mother
doesn't see you.

195
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,739
Drink it, drink it.

196
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,691
No, uncle.
It's too bitter.

197
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,917
Let me see.

198
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,919
He's growing a beard.

199
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,504
You have some down here.

200
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,742
It was about time
you became a man.

201
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,885
No, uncle.

202
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,078
Uncle,
is there a worm there?

203
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,722
No, no, no.

204
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,457
Mezcal is the one
that has a worm.

205
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,833
This is tequila,
not mezcal.

206
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,560
It gives you a hangover.

207
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,353
I went to Cartagena once

208
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,814
for a practice,

209
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,882
and after the practice,
the instructor

210
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,259
takes a bottle of mezcal,
and we started drinking.

211
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,304
By my fourth mezcal,
I couldn't even think.

212
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,682
But the man didn't stop
until he ate the worm.

213
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,726
Come on,
poor me some.

214
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,064
He didn't stop.
He ate it.

215
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,625
Hey, Walter!

216
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,085
What are you doing?

217
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,363
What do you think
I'm doing?

218
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,214
He's only fifteen.

219
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,034
Do you want to be
the father of the year?

220
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,249
Why do you look at him.
We're celebrating.

221
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,360
All of it.

222
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,398
It's okay.
Don't worry.

223
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,901
Hey, hey, no, no, no.
It's enough.

224
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,489
- Walter!
- Drink all of it!

225
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,430
I wouldn't have drunk that.

226
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,816
I think people

227
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,317
are drinking too m--

228
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,387
Henry, give me the
bottle!

229
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,474
Do you know what?
No!

230
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,017
These are my house,
my son, and my
bottle.

231
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,394
Give it
to me!

232
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,539
Calm down. Easy.

233
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,653
You've heard me.
Give it to me.

234
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:10,134
Everything is okay.

235
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,597
What happened?

236
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:21,672
My dear, my dear.
It's okay.

237
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,442
What happened?

238
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,303
- I can't believe it.
- What?

239
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,617
It's okay, honey.

240
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,479
- Water?
- Yes.

241
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:42,417
What did you drink?

242
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,236
You bring him in,
I'll get the water.

243
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,284
Ups!

244
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,270
You weren't supposed to
wake up.

245
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,956
Ever?

246
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,858
No, I was just
thinking

247
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,234
I'd bring you breakfast
to bed.

248
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,110
Do you want me
to go back to bed?

249
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,987
No, it isn't
worth it.

250
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,547
Can I help you?

251
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,008
No, I got it.

252
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,844
Just have a seat over there.

253
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,913
- Here?
- Yes.

254
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,749
Let's see how it tastes.
Is there any coffee?

255
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,712
Coffee!
I knew I was missing something.

256
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,229
It'll be right there.

257
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,690
No, I'll do it.

258
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,550
No!
You won't do anything.

259
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,844
- Just stay there.
- Okay. I'll stay here.

260
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,154
Let's see how it tastes.

261
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,514
What did you
cook?

262
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,935
You'll see.
It's a surprise.

263
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,979
- Surprise.
- Let's see.

264
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:06,777
It's<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> huevos rancheros</font></i>
with sausage.

265
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:12,115
Yes, there're many
sausages.

266
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,675
Try them.

267
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,012
Can I have a fork?

268
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,790
It's hard to eat them
without a fork. Right.

269
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,964
Do you have to
work today?

270
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,132
Whatever that means
to you.

271
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,552
- No.
- No?

272
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:38,366
Today, I'm all yours.

273
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,578
Really?

274
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,663
Yes.

275
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:47,333
They're simple.

276
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,904
But delicious.
Thank you.

277
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,595
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after the signal.</font></i>

278
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,865
Hi, my love.

279
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,644
Look...
I wanted to tell you
something.

280
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,440
Well, I don't know. Perhaps
we should talk tonight,

281
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,877
once you're home.

282
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:16,114
I wanted to say
that I'm not exactly sure

283
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,492
who that was
yesterday.

284
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,427
But, definitely,

285
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,097
it wasn't me.

286
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:28,309
I'm feeling bad

287
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,504
for everything,
and I wanted to apologize.

288
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,360
I love you.

289
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,363
See you. Bye.

290
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,003
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I wanted to say</font></i>

296
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,014
- Hi.

297
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,582
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

298
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,350
Ups, who brought brownies?

299
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,478
I did.

300
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,213
If I leave them at home,
I eat them all.

301
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,923
Go ahead,
please.

302
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,691
Thank you.

303
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,719
I cooked them for a party
I organized for Walter.

304
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,263
Really?
Was it his birthday?

305
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,491
No, er...

306
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:12,830
He's battling cancer.

307
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,959
We're really optimistic.

309
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,236
We got good news
last week.

310
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:22,757
That's great!

311
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,259
Bring these any time.

312
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,719
I love it.

313
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,996
- Okay?
- Okay.

314
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,141
Take care.

315
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,436
We have storage tanks,

316
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,422
tankless water heaters,
electric tanks.

317
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,968
The best ones are
the ones with C3 technology.

318
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,302
All of them
are cistern tanks?

319
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,946
No, not all of them.

320
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,739
We have tankless heaters.

321
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,199
They're really good.

322
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,742
But they have a problem.

323
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,311
They can't be used
for two showers
simultaneously.

324
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,398
The good ones are continuously
increasing their prices.

325
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,500
Let me show you this.

326
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,485
This works
with high and low pressure.

327
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,129
That's really important.

328
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,631
It has a built-in safety system

329
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,967
for fumes evacuation

330
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,635
and for overheating.

331
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,262
It has a surge suppressor,

332
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,015
and a temperature display.

333
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,167
It also has
automatic activation.

334
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,559
It's very simple to install it.

335
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,061
I see.

336
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,023
It costs 1,159,000 pesos.

337
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,570
The price is fine.

338
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,615
Wonderful.

339
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,987
Do you want
the installation service?

340
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,049
No, I'll do it myself.

341
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,553
There you go.

342
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,417
Is this like a skater
without his board?

343
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,894
No, that's Hover-Man.

344
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,354
Okay.

345
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,855
The man can skate,

346
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,757
surf and glide
without a board.

347
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,052
He always has
a 6-inch cushion of air

348
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,863
under his feet.

349
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,850
That's cool.
I like the idea.

350
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,104
Let's see what else I can find.
What's this?

351
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,289
Kanga-man!

352
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,525
Half-man and
half-kangaroo?

353
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,169
Exactly.

354
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,612
- And this one?
- That's Pocho.

355
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,256
He's his assistant.

356
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:31,077
He always travels there
and fights crime.

357
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,038
Then Kanga-man
isn't a man.

358
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,681
It's a female.

359
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,625
Females are the only ones
that have that pouch.

360
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,685
Did you know that?

361
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,771
Obviously.

362
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,257
But Kanga-man
is definitely a man.

363
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,068
He's the result

364
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,986
of an unsuccessful experiment.

365
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,030
It wasn't that unsuccessful.

366
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:54,017
It has good legs,
and a good ass.

367
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,604
An this?
What's this?

368
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,982
That's an R
for Retarder.

369
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,666
No, not for Retarder.

370
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,336
Rewindo.

371
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:08,156
He can make
everything go in reverse.

372
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,258
He walks backwards.

373
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,343
Does he travel in time?

374
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,787
No, no, no.
He just walks backwards.

375
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,497
No.
- Yes.

376
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,291
- Is that a superpower?
- Of course!

377
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,477
He does it really fast.

378
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,019
Okay.

379
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,546
Imagine he's walking
down the street

380
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,423
and there appears a man
with a knife.

381
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,967
The man walks backwards
away from him.

382
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,344
It's really easy to escape,
do you understand?

383
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,222
Sure, yes. Why not?
If you say so.

384
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,825
I draw all of these

385
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,287
when I was a child.

386
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,398
But all of them
look like you.

387
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,402
- What?
- Yes, they're cute.

388
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,986
They all remind me
of you.

389
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:50,089
- Really.

390
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,284
I don't want to
imagine

391
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,636
what would a shrink think.

392
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,621
Sure.
You never wanted superpowers.

393
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,349
But...

394
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,045
- What happens?
- What's that?

395
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,922
- What?
- Is that your door or mine?

396
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,731
I don't know.

397
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,968
It's mine.
- What are you doing?

398
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,529
I have to go.

399
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,597
Why?
Where are you going, Juana?

400
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,699
What are you doing?

401
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,707
Juana! Juana!

402
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,096
Juana...

403
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,558
What's wrong?

404
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,001
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, my dear.

405
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,045
What happened?
I've been knocking for a while.

406
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,439
I was drawing

407
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,191
with my headphones on.

408
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,692
Sure.

409
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,110
I have the afternoon free.

410
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,529
I'd like you to join me.

411
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,306
Let's have something
to eat.

412
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,057
Yes, yes, yes.
Sure. Let's go.

413
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,867
Okay.

414
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,285
What do you want to eat?

415
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,562
I don't know.
A hamburger?

416
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,164
What do you want?

417
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,399
Yes, yes.
A buffalo burger.

418
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,502
Hi! Is this your father?

419
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,028
- Diego.
- Jose.

420
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,131
He's the new tenant.

421
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,970
Did you need something?

422
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,625
- No.
- Shall we go?

423
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,504
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Nice to meet you.

424
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,517
- Dad, are you there?
- Yes! I'm down here.

425
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,358
- Hello.
- Hello!

426
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,167
You're home early.

427
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,545
No.

428
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,072
A new heater,
isn't it?

429
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,992
Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

430
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,094
It was about time.

431
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,012
We'll finally have hot water

432
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,265
whenever we want to!

433
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,624
So what?
Shall we try it?

434
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,226
Sure!

435
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,854
Okay. I'm coming.

436
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,811
Go to the kitchen.

437
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,773
Open the kitchen faucet.

438
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,317
Yes, yes.

439
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:18,762
Let me know
when there's water running.

440
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,182
- Ready?
- Ready!

441
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:26,103
- Okay!
- It's open!

442
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,247
Coming!

443
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,532
It's 117,000 BTU,
corrosion resistant,

444
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,451
draught reducer,
automatic pilot.

445
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,052
Wonderful!

446
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:46,098
It also saves energy.

447
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,043
What are you doing?
Be careful.

448
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,212
- Did you burn?
- No, dad. I'm fine.

449
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,172
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm fine.

450
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,133
We have to adjust
temperature.

451
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,142
Junior, about
yesterday,

452
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,827
I'd like to--

453
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,871
Er, dad.

454
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:12,041
Dad, I'm sorry about the pool.

455
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:19,156
No, not at all.
It isn't your fault.

456
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:25,680
It was my fault.

457
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,165
Your old man
embarrassed himself.

458
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,209
I'd like you to
know

459
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,170
that I'm not proud
of my behavior.

460
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,856
Just the opposite.

461
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,527
I feel very foolish.

462
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,096
Henry and you
seemed pissed off.

463
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,641
No, it's okay.
Everything is fine.

464
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,200
We're fine.

465
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,102
I called him
to apologize.

466
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,063
I owe you an apology
most of all.

467
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,483
What I did was
terrible.

468
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:59,363
Forcing you to drink
was very bad.

469
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:03,133
I'm really sorry.

470
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,553
But I did it okay, didn't I?

471
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,722
Because I kept up with you.

472
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,541
I had almost
as much tequila as you.

473
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,757
Er... I have some
tools to put away.

474
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,407
- Hello.

475
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,535
Do you want to watch a movie?

476
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,038
Hey.

477
00:30:56,063 --> 00:31:04,154
- What?

478
00:30:56,063 --> 00:31:00,292
- Explain it.

479
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:04,254
- About your father.

480
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,631
There's nothing to explain.

481
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,907
- Really?
- No.

482
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,467
So what?

483
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,135
I misread your attitude.

484
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,054
I was doing you a favor.

485
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,472
A favor? Really?

486
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,683
My father is an ogre.

487
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,852
He seemed cool to me.

488
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,478
It's all yours.

489
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,146
What happened, Juana?

490
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,382
I was protecting you,
okay?

491
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,652
How's that?

492
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,429
I let you smoke in here.
Do you remember it?

493
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,489
I bought a filter,

494
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,449
my lady.

495
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,685
The less my father knows,
the better.

496
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,787
Juana, you acted

497
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,707
like you didn't even know me.

498
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,166
So?

499
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,211
What do you mean?

500
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,213
What did you want me to say?

501
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,073
"Dad, meet my lazy
neighbor.

502
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:52,119
All he does is fuck me
all the time."

503
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,931
That's all we do,

504
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,974
don't we?

505
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,797
Why do you care
what my father thinks?

506
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,757
I'm not talking
about your dad!

507
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,233
Then what are we talking about?

508
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,735
I'm talking about us!

509
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,512
- About us?
- Yes, you and me.

510
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:13,616
Yo and me what?

511
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,445
- Do you know what?
- Look, Jose, don't...

512
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,365
- I'm out of this.
- No, come.

513
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:38,207
- Jose!
- What?

514
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:42,044
Don't react like this.
It isn't worth it.

515
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:47,090
What isn't worth it?
That you're embarrassed of
me.

516
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,734
It isn't that.

517
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,737
So what is it?

518
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,250
Dad?

519
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,156
- Dad?
- Down here!

520
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:53,150
What are you doing?

521
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:56,070
It's rotted.

522
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,781
What?

523
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:04,478
Look at this.
Do you see it?

524
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,564
Yes,
yes.

525
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,900
- Wood?
- Wood.

526
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,335
Wood with strange bodies.

527
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,337
Bodies?

528
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,799
Fungus.

529
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:20,260
They're everywhere.

530
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,537
I don't see
anything.

531
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,056
But there they are.

532
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:29,962
You have to know
where to look.

533
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,882
Give me the lever
and the hammer.

534
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:36,969
Yes, I'm
coming.

535
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,972
We have to cut it out
and start fresh.

536
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,725
Is the house
going to collapse?

537
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,326
No.

538
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,563
While I'm here,
put that out.

539
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:51,792
Okay.

540
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,611
The hacksaw!
Give me the hacksaw again.

541
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,048
Do you think you'll have
a better salary

542
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,150
if you stay working late.

543
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,387
- I'm going.
- Okay.

544
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,390
May I ask you
something

545
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,601
about Ferreterías
Don Fabio?

546
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,687
Ferreterías Don Fabio?
Yes.

547
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,565
It's listed as a current
asset on this balance sheet,

548
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,318
but the invoice was never
presented to accounts.

549
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,420
God.

550
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:41,825
I need time to analyze
my dad's stuff.

551
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,054
He did business by saying:

552
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,914
"Don't worry.
Pay me on Friday."

553
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,765
He thought small companies

554
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,393
deserved that chance.

555
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,462
Tomorrow,
after having some rest,

556
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:57,649
we'll talk about it.

557
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,469
- Okay.
- Don't stay longer.

558
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,037
Cielo, I'm serious.

559
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,206
I don't want to leave you here.

560
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,700
What happened?
Are you okay?

561
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,205
Ye's, I'm fine.
Don't worry.

562
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,706
It's the
hormones.

563
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:33,043
It happens all the time.
You can go.

564
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,730
No, I won't leave you here.

565
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:45,072
What's the matter?

566
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:50,477
I think I don't see
the difference.

567
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,246
I don't understand.

568
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,249
After the good news

569
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,295
about Walter's health,

570
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,115
I thought things would
change.

571
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,760
But it's all the same.

572
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,371
I thought I was going
to find the light

573
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,914
at the end of the tunnel,
but...

574
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,811
The tunnel goes on.

575
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,295
- Look, I...
- I'm sorry.

576
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,799
I shouldn't be bothering
you.

577
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,902
Don't worry.

578
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,404
I understand you.

579
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,241
I went through a very hard time.

580
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,244
It was a virus.

581
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,288
Once my father

582
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,690
was at the clinic,
before dying.

583
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:41,611
When he finally was dismissed.
I got sick.

584
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,213
It was a very strong virus.

585
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,257
I couldn't move from bed.

586
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,467
I couldn't stop thinking "why?"

587
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,911
He's at home.
Why I can't be with him?

588
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,581
Why was I there,
and not with him?

589
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,309
I think some time,

590
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,812
when I could relax,

591
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,190
my defenses went low.

592
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,717
When you're the strongest
at home,

593
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,778
you're more tired than anybody.

594
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,007
Aren't you going to work?

595
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,703
No, there're
fungi.

596
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:58,540
There're fungi everywhere,
rotting everything.

597
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:09,176
I have to
continue.

598
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,851
Okay. Bye.

599
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,806
I'll call you.

600
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:25,287
My God!

601
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,147
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

602
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,732
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, hold on.

603
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,835
I'll take that.

604
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,376
Thank you.
It's a shame.

605
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:44,407
You shouldn't buy those matches.

606
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:45,950
What?

607
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,895
These matches
are the wrong kind.

608
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,106
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips

609
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,957
not in the matches themselves.

610
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,459
Get some boxes

611
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,962
that guarantee more surface.

612
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,464
Something else.

613
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,241
Don't buy everything
in the same place.

614
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,842
Buy in different places

615
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,912
so that
we attract less attention.

616
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,831
- Are you following me?
- Yes, sure.

617
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,422
I ran away.

618
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,298
You're so silly.

619
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:44,217
We don't have time

620
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,594
to waste in silly things.

621
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,597
That's the man.

622
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,234
Stay out of my territory.
