1
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,668
What did you say to Gustavo?

2
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,421
Why is he on to us?

3
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,673
What do you mean he's on to us?

4
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,618
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.

5
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,746
He looked around
and then turned back.

6
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,833
What, does he have
some kind of sixth sense?
What did you say to him?

7
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,169
Could I ask my own question
right now, Walter?

8
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,422
Tell me you don't have a bomb
in that diaper bag.

9
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,399
How do you bring a bomb here?

10
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,177
What? Was I supposed
to leave it on his car?

11
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,720
You're supposed
to bring it into a hospital?

12
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,305
- Jose.
- Are you out of your mind?

13
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,808
Where can we find Gustavo?
Name a place.

14
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,993
Name me just one place

15
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,245
where I could surprise him.

16
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,147
- I don't know.
- Not the restaurant

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,774
nor the laundry,
nor the factory farm.

18
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,334
They're all wired with cameras.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,462
Jose, think.

20
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,991
Give me one place
where I can get him.

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,827
- I don't know!
- Please!

22
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:01,873
Because if you can't tell me,
we are dead.

23
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:05,043
- Well, maybe--
- José Miguel Rosas.

24
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,379
I'm Juan Osorio.
He's Detective Adrián Franco.

25
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,339
We're from the Department
of Special Investigations

26
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,650
and we need to talk to you.

27
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,593
Could we have
a few minutes of your time?

28
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,863
About what?

29
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,141
- I didn't catch your name.
- About what?

30
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,603
It concerns
Andrea Cantillo's son, Byron.

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,915
How about you come with us?

32
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,317
We just want to clear
a few things up. No big deal.

33
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,812
- Am I under arrest?
- No, you're not under arrest.

34
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:10,816
We're just talking.
A friendly
conversation.

35
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:14,028
So if I get tired of talking,
I may get up and leave?

36
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,006
We'd prefer you didn't.

37
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,492
- You'd prefer?
- Yes.

38
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,302
José Miguel, tell us.

39
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,581
Why did you tell Brock's mom
that the boy had been poisoned?

40
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,391
Look...

41
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,797
You say it like that
and it sounds...

42
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,940
It sounds weird, overblown.

43
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,985
I just asked Andrea

44
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,739
if doctors had considered

45
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,808
that Byron
might have been poisoned.

46
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,560
You know, in a cover-all-bases
kind of sense.

47
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,271
I were doing nothing
but simply trying to help.

48
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,984
And I'm sure doctors
appreciated you helping
them out like that

49
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,027
especially
with how specific
you were.

50
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:57,963
Ricin.

51
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,450
Nobody talks about ricin.
You don't see that every day.

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,761
So when doctors hear that

53
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,512
they take it very seriously.

54
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,457
- As do we.
- Yeah, all right.

55
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,711
And nice, you trying to
help out like that and all.

56
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:16,590
Sharing your knowledge
and expertise.

57
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:21,929
I ain't go no expertise.
I was just trying to help.

58
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,432
You just guessed
this one rare poison
might be the thing

59
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,559
that put this kid
in the hospital.

60
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,828
Congratulations!

61
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,606
His doctors
are beginning to think
that you might be right.

62
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,066
But come on,
tell us.

63
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,755
Why ricin?

64
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,425
How did you come up with that?

65
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,247
I must've saw it on a TV program
about doctors and stuff.

66
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,708
No, you know what?
It was the science channel.

67
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,627
Sometimes your brain
makes these connections.

68
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,146
Your brain?

69
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,064
Yeah, mine does.

70
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,608
That's interesting.

71
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,136
Look, buddies,
I've really got to get back.

72
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,722
But why?
We're still talking.

73
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,661
So I'm not under arrest

74
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,872
but I can't leave.

75
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,358
So, then, I guess I should
call my lawyer. Right?

76
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,195
We're just
chatting,
José Miguel.

77
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,446
Why can't we keep
talking
as friends?

78
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,342
Keep it light?

79
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,785
Man, you know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

80
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,747
Things change,
it's not the same.

81
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,749
A serious breach
usually opens up.

82
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,334
And, in the end,
somebody gets angry.

83
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,936
It turns adversarial.

84
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,397
Then we gotta book you.

85
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,425
There's no need!
You've been around the block.

86
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,430
Look, José Miguel,
let's be straight here.

87
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,868
You're no boy scout.

88
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:56,415
Saúl Bueno.

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,193
So do you call him,
or I gotta do it?

90
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,870
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

91
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,789
I need Saúl.
Right now!

92
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,768
So you break into the place?

93
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,211
You've got to go
the hard way?

94
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,130
You didn't bothered
answering the phone

95
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,966
or the door.
What else could I do?

96
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,692
You know? Forget it.

97
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,469
Where's Saúl?
Goddamn it!

98
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,780
Why would he be here?

99
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,266
You know where he is!
I need a number!

100
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,479
Look. Let me explain
something to you.
My partner and I--

101
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,149
You don't say!
Are in danger, right?

102
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,234
No shit!
Why do you think he's not here?

103
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,737
What idiocy did you two
do this time?

104
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,448
And what gives you the right
to break down my door?

105
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,827
Look, for God's sake,
give me the number.

106
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,389
You are such a pain in my ass.

107
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,042
You're the reason
I've got to go on unemployment.

108
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,836
I've already taken that in.
And I was ready to leave,
but no!

109
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,922
Now I've got to wait
for a plate glass guy
to come and fix this door

110
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,591
for who knows how long.
And who pays for this?

111
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,695
Look, here I have

112
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,099
more than
one and a half million pesos.

113
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,977
That will more than cover it.
Now, I apologize profusely.

114
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,022
I didn't want to do this,
but I need Saúl urgently.

115
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,291
Please, the phone number.

116
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,668
You think this will cover it?

117
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:09,198
Door like this
is going to cost
way more than that.

118
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,410
I bet you
it winds up costing...
Forty million pesos.

119
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,969
What?

120
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,472
Are you insane or what?

121
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,709
Who the hell is going to charge
forty million?
No reputable vendor could.

122
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,894
Right.

123
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,257
Now I'm thinking
fifty million pesos.

124
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,572
I'll be right back.

125
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,578
Fuck!

126
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:02,478
Hi, Rebeca, how are you?
It's Walter Blanco,
your neighbor.

127
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,730
Yes, madam.
Look, the thing is...

128
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,251
Fine, fine, thank you.

129
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,487
Yes. Growing up
by leaps and bounds.

130
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,407
Rebeca, Cielo and I
are out of town.

131
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,510
Yes, yes.

132
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,763
Way deserved. Thanks.

133
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:27,127
Junior's with us and,
you know how he is,
he just told us

134
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,881
that he thinks he may
have left the burner on and...

135
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:35,344
Yes, God forbid there's a fire.
Exactly!

136
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,404
That's why I'm calling.

137
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,975
Do you still happen to have
the key we'd left you in case--?

138
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,353
Exactly, that's right.
Would you do me that favor?

139
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,581
Yes, madam.

140
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,250
I'll await your call.

141
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,169
Thanks, Rebeca.

142
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,557
Rebeca.

143
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,266
Yes, go ahead.

144
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,102
That's good!

145
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,590
That's a relief.
Really, you took a weight
off my mind.

146
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,608
Yes.

147
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,860
I owe you one, big time.

148
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,406
Yes, same to you.

149
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,849
I'll tell her, thank you.
Bye.

150
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,520
So how's he doing?

151
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,650
You could at least say

152
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,177
instead of being
a couple of dicks about it.

153
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,140
José Miguel, prove it to us
that you really care
about Byron.

154
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,285
Tell us what you fucking know.

155
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,813
Yo, man!
I already told you what I know.

156
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,583
Tell us again.

157
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,943
What are you,
like broken records?

158
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,130
I was trying to be helpful.

159
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,660
Period. End of story.
Nothing else happened.

160
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,179
If that's gonna be it

161
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,749
we'll have to wait and see
what the tox screen says.

162
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,793
This like a hollow!
Not cozy at all.

163
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,227
What did you tell them?

164
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,129
I told them they were
a couple of dicks.

165
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,425
You see?
My client, he's a wordsmith.

166
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,719
All right, gentlemen.
You've been so nice

167
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,681
and so polite
it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go.

168
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,810
Pretend. Make like you respect
the rule of law.

169
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,020
You've never studied law
at all, right?

170
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,122
How do you need me to say it?

171
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,776
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Au revoir, auf widersehen,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">arriverderci.</font></i>

172
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,836
Get the hell out.

173
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,045
Come on!

174
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,676
That's it. Right on!

175
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,303
Close it, please.

176
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,600
What am I gonna do with you two?

177
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:40,547
If I ever get anal polyps,
I'll know what to name them:
"-" and "Aha".

178
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,566
You gonna get me out of here?

179
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,718
No.
Not even if I could.

180
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,682
We're gonna let them
look into this ricin thing
and meanwhile

181
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:53,017
you stay here
for as long as necessary.

182
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,830
You're a lot safer in here.

183
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,442
They just tried to get
your partner in his own home.

184
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,794
Jesus! Is he okay?

185
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,656
Well, he's okay
like a fruit fly's okay.

186
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,910
He says the only option's
to cut Gustavo down.

187
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,932
Shit.

188
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,584
I thought we did this
for money's sake

189
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,463
not for us to kill one another.
That's disgusting!

190
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,717
You two want to stick
your wangs in a hornet's nest,
it's a free country.

191
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:31,264
But how come I always gotta get
sloppy seconds?

192
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,560
Why? It's my fault.
Nobody forced me! My bad.

193
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:40,940
Your partner wants to know
if you've got anything for me.

194
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,084
I hope so.

195
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,488
Tell me I didn't poke my head up
for nothing.

196
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,091
Yeah. I've been thinking.

197
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,745
- Casa Tranquila.
- What's that?

198
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,207
It's an old folks' home.
Our boy tells me that Gustavo

199
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,417
took him there
to visit one of the patients

200
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:03,213
- who, he says,
you'll definitely remember.
- Who is he?

201
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,717
Héctor Salamanca.
Old guy in a wheelchair.

202
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,219
Doesn't talk, rings a bell.
Does<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> that</font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> ring a bell?</font>

203
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,806
Yes, I know.
I remember him perfectly.

204
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,141
It's really possible
to communicate through a bell?

205
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,201
Listen, Saúl.

206
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,397
How often does he go?
How often does he visit him?

207
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,608
Gustavo goes and visits
an old cartel associate
in an old folks' home.

208
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,486
That information
doesn't help me much.

209
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:31,324
I can't hide out
in a nursing home for six months
waiting for Gustavo.

210
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:36,621
It's not even like
they're friends.
According to José Miguel

211
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,916
Gustavo was torturing
the old guy.

212
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,976
What? What does that mean?

213
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,129
He went there to tell him
the last of his family was dead.

214
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,231
And as per José Miguel words

215
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,509
Gustavo seemed to enjoy
telling him.

216
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,778
Rosas asked him about it

217
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,947
and all that Gustavo would say

218
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,907
was that this Uncle Héctor

219
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,977
once murdered someone
close to him. To Gustavo.

220
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,647
Wait. Héctor murdered
someone close to Gustavo?

221
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,567
I know it sound
not particularly fruitful.

222
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,028
- Sorry, that's all I got.
- It is. Of course it is.

223
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,922
They're not friends.

224
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,632
They're enemies.

225
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,097
Well, gentlemen.

226
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:23,501
Your next number
in this coverall game is...

227
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,855
B number 3.

228
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,274
B as in baby, bike

229
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,652
or bed.

230
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,612
Followed by O.

231
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,447
Four, seven.

232
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,118
On the other side of your card.

233
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,250
I know you despise me

234
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,946
and I know how badly
you want to see me dead

235
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,908
but I know a man
whom you hate even more.

236
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,126
I'm here to offer you
an opportunity for revenge.

237
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,463
Héctor, you need something?

238
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,925
You need to go poopie?

239
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,371
Want me to get

Ring up.

Who do you want us to ring up,
Héctor?

267
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,531
How's everything?

268
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,308
No news, sir.
Everything's under control.

269
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,951
Good.

270
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,279
- So what, buddy?
- How's it going?

271
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,907
- Come here, look at this.
- What's up?

272
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,201
- Look.
- No kidding!

273
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,911
Again with the laundry?
You buying it?

274
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,763
No, no, no, hear me out.

275
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,599
See this electricity panel?

276
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,142
See what it says?

277
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,562
It's is a 7,200-amp service.

278
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,940
This place has two of them.

279
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,177
Laundry this size typically
has only one, okay?

280
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,471
So what's with the extra panel?
In case the other fails?

281
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,531
No way. Now what?

282
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,100
You're some kind
of an electrician?

283
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,060
- Thomas Edison.
- No, no.

284
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:13,314
I looked on the Internet.
Freakin' Internet!
Find anything on it these days.

285
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,942
I went into something
called chat rooms

286
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,444
and asked
a bunch of electricians.
We started talking

287
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,089
panels, amps, plugs

288
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,532
and ground.
You name it!

289
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,909
It was great!
I can give you the blog's name.

290
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,538
So let's pop over,
have another look-see?

291
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,041
- What do you say?
- Maybe we should wait.

292
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,670
Meantime, let me tell you.
I think we may have a lead
on something.

293
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,191
A lead? On what?

294
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,136
Look, I have this guy
down at the office.

295
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,488
Says he has some information.

296
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,141
The thing is
he'll only give it to you.

297
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,160
Really?

298
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,563
Let's see.
Remember that friend of yours?

299
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,608
Héctor Salamanca.
Sounds familiar?

300
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,527
The old cripple guy
with the bell?

301
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,739
Rather crap on our floor
than talk to us?

302
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,966
No, I don't remember him at all.

303
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,385
Well, he's the guy.

304
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,096
His nurse calls us.

305
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,057
Says he wants to powwow.

306
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,335
We have this guy
at the office for three hours.
You know him already, right?

307
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,729
Can't talk, can't communicate.

308
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,632
And he still just wants
to talk to you.

309
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,677
Do not even think
about going down there, Henry.

310
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,013
- María.
- I mean it.

311
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,557
This is clearly a trick
to get you out into the open!

312
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,269
That old man's bait
to have you killed.

313
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,329
That's what we thought, but--

314
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,080
That's all this is!

315
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,002
Well, listen.

316
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,904
We were checking up
on Héctor Salamanca

317
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,823
and it's been years since
this guy's been a player.
He only had Tuco

318
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,217
his nephew, who's gone.

319
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,494
Doesn't have anybody.
The nurse checks out.

320
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,555
And let me tell you

321
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,959
there's not safer place
for Henry than the office.

322
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,102
Of course, if he wants to.

323
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,504
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

324
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,940
Uncle, don't go there.

325
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,969
There is no way
you are going to do it.
You're not leaving home.

326
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,571
End of story.

327
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,947
Hi, Henry.

328
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,891
- Hey, boss.
- Thanks for coming down.

329
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,020
No problem. Let's see
what he wanted to tell me

330
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,663
our friend here.

331
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,000

SUCK MY

353
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,413
All right, that's enough.

354
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,123
Thank you.

355
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,966
Sorry, gentlemen.

356
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,926
I am just so, so sorry.

357
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,916
At least this time
he didn't shit himself

358
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,709
and leave the place
stinking of poop, right?

359
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,479
Guess that's progress.

360
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,875
- Yes.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- We may have a problem.</font></i>

361
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,628
I've got eyes on Anti-narcotics
and they just had a visitor.

362
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,923
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Who?</font></i>
- Héctor Salamanca.

363
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,030
I don't even know
what to say to you.

364
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,492
How far you think that kind
of behavior is going to get you?

365
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,997
You just sit here
and think about
what you've just done.

366
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,167
It's not getting you far,
let me tell you.

367
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,518
You heard me?

368
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,583
Any second thoughts?

369
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,090
Then let's get to work.

370
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,334
I've missed you a lot.

371
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,199
I'm knitting a scarf for you.
It's beautiful!

372
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,342
My dear son.

373
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,739
Look. Come here, son. Look.

374
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,659
It's a beautiful scarf!

375
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,828
I did it for you!

376
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,667
I've thought of you a lot.

377
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:21,612
So you don't get cold
when you go out.

378
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:01,878
Rosas.

379
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,843
You're free to go.

380
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,053
Why? What happened?

381
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:14,081
Tox screen came back.
No ricin poisoning.

382
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,811
Surprised?

383
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,273
No, why should I be?

384
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,361
Your cap!

385
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,615
Till we meet again.

386
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:36,729
Hey, Andrea,
I'm just checking on Byron.

387
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,957
Hey, it sounds like-- Taxi!

388
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,737
Listen, just call me
if you can, all right?
I'm headed back over.

389
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,367
Buddy, can you tell me
how to get

390
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,345
to 145 and 85-80?

391
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,973
Get him in, get him in!

392
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,603
Close the door. Quick.

393
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,982
Hi.

394
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,051
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's done.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">We picked up Rosas,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">no witnesses.</font></i>

395
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,070
What about Héctor?

396
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:15,852
I've checked inside and out.
No wires, no camera,
no surveillance.

397
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,856
A police cruiser rolled
through about an hour ago.
Seemed routine.

398
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,566
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's just him,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">alone in his room.</font></i>

399
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,629
I'm on my way.

400
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:30,282
Maybe it's better
if I do this myself.

401
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,343
No. I do this.

402
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,607
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's all clear.</font></i>

403
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:08,213
What kind of cartel man
talks to Anti-narcotics?

404
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,028
No man.

405
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,321
Not a man of honor!

406
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,418
A crippled little rat,
that's what you are!

407
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,631
What a reputation
to leave behind.

408
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,810
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

409
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,158
Last chance to look at me,
Héctor.

410
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:51,043
Aah!

You wanna cook

All right.

424
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:37,900
What, you got a problem
with stairs?

425
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,936
Gustavo is dead.

426
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,193
We've got work to do.

427
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,933
Out!

428
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,351
Everybody! Get out!

429
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,270
Out!

430
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,563
There's a fire, go out!

431
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,477
- He's going to pull through.
- Yeah?

432
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,275
It looked
kind of touch-and-go there

433
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,859
but it seems
he's gonna make it.

434
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,628
Thank God.

435
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,323
I'm glad to hear that.
Don't know how much, really.

436

That's good.

00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,845
Yo.

438
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,998
They still saying
it wasn't the ricin.

439
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,892
I don't understand.

440
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,919
If it wasn't ricin,
then what was it?

441
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:30,006
Saying it was most likely
a flower called
lily of the valley

442
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,842
or something. Like it's common
'cause it's sweet

443
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,345
and little kids eat them
and wind up poisoning
themselves.

444
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,519
So Gustavo didn't poison him
after all.

445
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,819
Still he had to go, right?
We had to get rid of him.

446
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:54,823
You're damn right.
He had to go.

447
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,299
Yeah.

448
