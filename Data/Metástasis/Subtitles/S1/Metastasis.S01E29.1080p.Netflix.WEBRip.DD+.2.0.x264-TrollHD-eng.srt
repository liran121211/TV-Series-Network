17
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,075
How much?

18
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,870
56.76 pounds.

19
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,605
Perfect.
We reached the schedule

20
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,232
and we have
an extra pound and a half.

21
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,127
Better over than under.

22
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,129
I thought you were all precise.

23
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,755
Let's save that pound and a half

24
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,757
for next week.

25
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,160
No, we'll ship it as
is.

26
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,370
Ship it as it?
How come?

27
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,789
Are we giving our
product away?

28
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,207
No, we're not running a
charity.

29
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,894
José, don't mess things up.

30
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,563
One batch, one ship.

31
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,981
It's simple.

32
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,941
Why are you purposely

33
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,401
giving him free meth?

34
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,637
He's bleeding us enough
already.

35
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,239
I can't believe it.

36
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,490
Are you listening to yourself?

37
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,909
You're paid extraordinary well

38
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,493
with this business.

39
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,646
And you even complain?
Don't pretend you're exploited.

40
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,398
Let's
see...

41
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,458
Speaking of that...

42
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,960
Look,

43
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,295
I been crunching numbers.

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,796
Have you?

45
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,257
So now you're a mathematician?

46
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,993
That's for spending
so much time with you.

47
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,494
I've been
crunching
numbers.

48
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,121
I don't have to
be
a mathematician

49
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,306
to figure out this deal you made

50
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,849
is bullshit.

51
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,084
- It's incredible.
- What?

52
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,602
You're so shameless.

53
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,687
How much do we take?

54
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,756
A million and a half
dollars each.

55
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,299
Why are you talking
in dollars?

56
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,261
Because in pesos
there're so many zeros
that I mess up.

57
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,764
Are you listening
what you're saying?

58
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,851
You earn an amount
that you can't even handle
in your head.

59
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,561
- And you even complain!
- Yes, I do. Yes.

60
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,496
But if we earn that,

61
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,941
then how much is taking
the owner of this shit?

62
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,317
Just think
about it.

63
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,444
He's got enough
meth

64
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,613
for the entire Colombia
and he's got some left.

65
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,407
So he's clearly exporting
it.

66
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,952
- So what?
- What do you mean "So what"?

67
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,454
You know what happens
when you export.

68
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,348
The price multiplies.

69
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know how many
times.
Five, six times?

70
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,170
- Ten, twenty. I don't know.
- Precisely! That's it..

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,815
He earns lots of money.

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,010
You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

73
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,653
José, don't be greedy.

74
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,347
No, bitch.
What's fair is fair.

75
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,849
Don't
you
think?

76
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,600
We should be earning
much more money.

77
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,202
Bye!

78
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,578
Can you listen to me

79
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,455
at least once?

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,873
Walter!

81
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,949
No, these ones are the same.
Put them there.

82
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,510
These pillows seem bricks.

83
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,789
They should use them
to make houses for the poor.

84
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,499
Do you want me
to ask for another?

85
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,852
No, but you know what?

86
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,255
Remind me to bring a better one
from home.

87
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,148
Excuse me.

88
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,693
Hello.

89
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,153
May I?

90
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,156
Yes, Gómez, come in.

91
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,411
Well, at least...

92
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,121
his color looks good.

93
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,580
And he talks.

94
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,541
Only when he wants to.

95
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,959
What's up Gómez?

96
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,627
What's up, buddy?

97
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,655
Come, buddy,
I need to tell you something.

98
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,951
- Tell me.
- Come here.

99
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,660
- What happened?
- Closer.

100
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,121
What is
it?

101
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,456
Scratch my balls,
they itch.

102
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,726
Henry.

103
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:19,588
At least you haven't
forgotten those bad jokes.

104
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,465
You know who can
scratch it?

105
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,178
The boss.
He even asks me.

106
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,989
Look at this.

107
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,350
I'll show you something that
will call your attention.

108
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:35,829
It'll make you feel better.

109
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,232
I've been keeping an eye on
that blue meth of yours.

110
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,125
Guess what?

111
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,111
Look at
Colombia.

112
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,656
There's nothing.
It disappeared.

113
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,201
Look where it appeared:
Venezuela, Brazil,

114
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:53,805
Peru, Ecuador, Panama.

115
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,474
What's more,

116
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,710
we're getting a report
from Chile.

117
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,713
It's the same that
happened in the US.

118
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,508
Why would that
make me feel better?

119
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,110
You're a genius.

120
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,762
You're the only one
who saw this coming.

121
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,406
Well, then,

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,225
put on your cheer leader
uniform and...

123
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,245
Three cheers for em.

124
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,122
It hurts me. It...

125
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,149
Call the nurse.
I want morphine right now.

126
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,525
- Really?
- Hurry up.

127
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,252
Okay, fine.

128
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,611
- Gómez.
- María!

129
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,280
Stop talking about
work.

130
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,282
I'm
going!

131
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,745
Buddy,
I have to confess something.

132
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:37,015
What is it?

133
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,836
I don't know what happened to me
with this case.

134
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,355
They caught me unguarded.

135
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,524
No.

136
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,553
No one would have reacted
like you did.

137
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,614
The only reason

138
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,618
I'm telling you this

139
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,064
is because I got
a warning call.

140
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,982
How come?
Who called you?

141
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,209
I don't know.

142
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:08,255
A voice scrambler.

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,716
I got a call and they told me

144
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,372
that someone
would kill me in a minute.

145
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,516
María's got my phone.

146
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,918
Run the incoming call
if you want,

147
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:25,256
but I'm sure that phone number
no longer exists.

148
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,258
Besides, that call
makes no sense.

149
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:29,943
I mean, why?

150
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,529
I don't know

151
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,306
but there's some big shit
behind all this.

152
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,753
About what Gómez said...

153
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,465
No.

154
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,285
I had nothing to do with
that.

155
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,517
Are we safe?

156
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,268
Yes.

157
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:07,856
Absolutely.

158
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,634
- And you?
- I'm absolutely protected.

159
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,567
I've been quitting it
little by little.

160
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,445
I've been clean
for three months.

161
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,697
It's been really hard
but I'm doing fine

162
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,327
and thanks to your help
I've quitted it.

163
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,929
Good, very good.

164
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:43,834
Thanks for sharing,
Rodolfo.

165
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,839
Who else wants to

166
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,437
share something?

167
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,939
talk to us?

168
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,900
Um?

169
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,112
No one?

170
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,389
What about you,
José?

171
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,032
What?

172
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,809
Don't you want
to tell us anything?

173
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,704
Talk?

174
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,998
About what?

175
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,486
I don't know.
Anything you want.
Your life. Whatever.

176
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,504
About my exciting life?

177
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,784
One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

178
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,678
I've been working a lot.

179
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,746
That's fine, isn't it?
That's good.

180
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,807
Working is a stimulus.

181
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,434
Where are you working at?

182
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,561
In a corporate Laundromat.

183
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,564
But my job is...

184
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,068
I work in an office.

185
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,696
I hate my boss.

186
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,073
Pretty much.

187
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,685
I hate the owner as well
though I don't know him,

188
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,021
they don't even let me
see his face.

189
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,539
Okay.

190
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,082
And...

191
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,569
And what about your
colleagues?

192
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,029
Does anyone seem
interesting?

193
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,948
Are you friends
with anyone?

194
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,243
- No, no way.
- Nothing?

195
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,911
No, the people over there
are like zombies.

196
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,414
The place is full of dead-eyed
douche bags

197
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,625
and nobody knows
what's going on.

198
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,893
It's all pretty ridiculous.

199
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,896
I get you, I do.

200
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,715
It sounds
like...

201
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,653
Kind of Kafkaesque.

202
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,013
- What?
- Kafka, the writer.

203
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,559
He wrote "The Metamorphosis",
"The trial".

204
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,395
The environments were
oppressive, surreal...

205
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,955
Totally Kafkaesque, yes.

206
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,983
- Kafkaesque.
- That's it.

207
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,085
Absolutely.

208
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,905
Look at all these flowers
Henry got.

209
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,634
Do you like them, babe?

210
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,286
- Lovely.

211
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,513
Who sent them?

212
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,972
The Attorney General.

213
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,516
"To Henry Navarro".

214
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,543
- Very nice.
- So elegant!

215
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,977
And look at this basket

216
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,355
full of goodies.

217
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,106
This one as sent

218
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,360
By "Soluciones Silva".

219
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,362
Hey, your boss is wonderful.

220
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,181
Not only does he let you
be with us,

221
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,934
he also sends you
these delicious chocolate.

222
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,812
It's even imported.
You want some?

223
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,167
Hey, what a nice job you have.

224
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,362
I want one.
What should I do?

225
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,005
Hello.

226
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,407
- Doctor, how are you?
- Excuse me.

227
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,284
- How are you doing today?
- Fine.

228
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,743
Just going to do
a quick peripheral response.

229
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,804
See where we're at.

230
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,431
Okay?

231
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,208
- Let's see. Thanks.
- Let me help you.

232
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,227
It's time to know the truth.

233
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,878
No, let's not
exaggerate.

234
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,256
It's just a sensitive
reaction test.

235
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,091
I want you to
think carefully

236
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,193
what you'll answer.

237
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,737
All right?

238
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,697
Can you feel this?

239
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,605
- No.
- No?

240
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,607
The other
foot?

241
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,488
- No.
- Neither.

242
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:04,075
Let's
see...

243
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,410
- I feel that.
- Yes.

244
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,053
- Perfect.

245
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,622
On a scale form
one to ten,

246
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,683
how much did you feel?

247
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,437
- Four.

248
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,440
Four? And here?

249
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,026
Six.

250
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,528
Fine.

251
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,904
Henry, thanks so much!

252
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,824
So this is good news?

253
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,266
It looks like some of
the nervous functions

254
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,037
are returning.

255
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,663
That's good, isn't it?

256
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,482
So when do we get him
walking again?

257
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,898
Hey!

258
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,592
- There he is! Finally!
- What's up?

259
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,843
Now that you're important
we must wait for you, don't we?

260
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,970
What do you want?
Manicure? Pedicure?

261
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,223
- Exfoliate!
- No, no. Maybe later.

262
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,367
What about our chemist?

263
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,019
Isn't it enough just with
me?

264
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,105
Just tell me what
the hell I'm doing here.

265
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,815
Well, then since
you came alone,

266
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,710
today is your lucky day.

267
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,152
What a lovely business,
isn't it?

268
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,254
It should be yours.

269
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,073
- This?
- This!

270
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,619
This is a discrete and
profitable business.

271
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,012
What's most important, legal!

272
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,664
You went nuts,
Saúl?

273
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,182
Just went nuts.

274
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,767
And you must be blind

275
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,795
because you don't see
what's going on here.

276
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,630
On the outside,
it's a nail salon.

277
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,606
On the inside,

278
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,942
it's the best money laundry

279
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,360
a growing boy could ask for.

280
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,571
Wait, wait, wait!

281
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,347
Let's not talk
about that here.

282
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,824
Because of them?

283
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,450
Don't worry.

284
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,993
This business

285
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,270
used to belong
to an emerald seller

286
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,872
and then to a smuggler.

287
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,440
And they don't know anything,
do they?

288
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,983
You know anything?
You' You?

289
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,501
Nothing!

290
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,044
Fine, but no.

291
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,863
- No, thanks. See you.
- Hey, wait!

292
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,698
Excuse me, girls.
I'll be right back.

293
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,050
Hey, don't go!

294
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,621
- What?

295
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,219
- No, come. Calm down.

296
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,721
- Wait, wait.

297
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,248
You know you need to launder
your money, right?

298
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,459
I know I have to launder
my money

299
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,336
but I don't want
a fucking nail salon.

300
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,172
No, you want to stay
out of prison, right?

301
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,274
You want money and freedom,

302
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,817
don't you?

303
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,470
Wait. I'll get some
didactic material

304
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,947
and explain it all to you.

305
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,364
Don't go.

306
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,772
Mrs. Navarro,
the important thing

307
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,249
is to lower your expectations.

308
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,110
Henry has months
of hard work ahead.

309
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,421
And even then,

310
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,593
the odds are not good.

311
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,745
But you can't know
for sure?

312
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,097
No.

313
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,333
When does he start
physical therapy.

314
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,769
We've sent the paperwork

315
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,187
to your insurance.

316
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,964
We should have a response
in five days.

317
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,758
No, that can't
be possible.

318
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,887
The sooner
physical therapy begins,

319
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,890
the better his chances
are.

320
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,308
- Yes.
- He needs daily sessions.

321
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,810
Actually your plan's treatment
program

322
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,037
covers four sessions a week.

323
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,858
Actually,
she asked the doctor.

324
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,545
Four sessions is not bad.

325
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,614
If Henry had more
physical therapy

326
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,716
with better therapists,

327
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,119
wouldn't it be more
likely he would walk?

328
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,472
It's very hard to say.

329
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,418
Generally,
what the insurances give

330
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,962
is acceptable
from the medical point of view.

331
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,272
But each case is different.

332
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,274
Then screw the insurance.

333
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,069
I want the best for Henry.

334
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,570
Look, madam,

335
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,405
I get your frustration,

336
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,115
but my best advice

337
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,909
is stay in the network.

338
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,520
Later on they might apply
any of their clauses

339
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,146
and not make any
reimbursements.

340
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,524
Physical therapy
is just the beginning.

341
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,711
We're talking nursing care,

342
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,071
modifications to your home,
occupational therapy,

343
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,173
medical equipment.

344
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,092
That could cost millions.

345
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,135
So then?

346
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,637
What do we do?

347
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,848
Do we sacrifice Henry's health?

348
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,416
Getting what the insurance
gives you

349
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:26,145
doesn't mean you don't worry.

350
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,090
Doctor, who's the best
physical therapist you know?

351
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,609
I can give you some names

352
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,804
but they're not likely
to be on the plan.

353
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,321
Okay.

354
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,434
Then to hell
with the plan.

355
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,827
Excuse me.

356
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,958
Let's see...

357
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,835
This is you...

358
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,006
surrounded by girls...

359
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,718
and partying hearty, okay?

360
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,746
These two
are from the IRS.

361
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,873
They come, look at you

362
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,334
"This young man
has no inheritance,

363
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,628
no career, is sort of dumb...".
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,087
- It's just an example.
- Come on.

365
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,341
"Besides, he's got
lots of money".

366
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,735
"Is he a business genius?".

367
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,971
"That's all I can think of",
says the other,

368
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,531
"If not, what could he be?".

369
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,908
A drug dealer!

370
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,367
Exactly!

371
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,745
And a tax cheat.

372
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,439
You see?
It's all bad on you.

373
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,875
And what was Josecito's mistake?

374
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,878
Not laundering the money.

375
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,947
Since I'm giving you
some examples,

376
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,033
let me explain to you
how this works.

377
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,094
First, you give me your money.

378
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,804
This is your dirty money.

379
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,790
I get it and put it
in this nail salon.

380
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,309
That's called layering.

381
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,712
I make it work
in the nail salon.

382
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,048
It'll work and it'll start
making lots of money

383
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,465
because it's
a successful business.

384
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,442
That's called stratification.

385
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,805
After a while,
I give you your clean money.

386
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,851
It's all yours and there're
no suspicions.
You get me?

387
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,163
That's called integration.

388
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,272
This process is what makes
the difference

389
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:12,151
between a criminal
and a good citizen

390
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,462
who pays taxes.

391
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,922
Who pays taxes?

392
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,049
That's the point, bitch,

393
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,425
I don't pay taxes.

394
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,178
By the way,

395
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,887
you get your 5%.

396
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,247
- Sure.
- No.

397
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,125
- My share is 17%
- No, no, no.

398
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,686
I heard you say 5%.

399
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,672
It's privileges of seniority
and all.

400
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,191
That 17% could be arranged.

401
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,550
No!
Fuck off.

402
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,152
We can arrange 15%.

403
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,636
Hey, don't you know
how to do business?

404
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,449
Twelve percent!

405
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,270
How is your
brother-in-law?

406
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,080
Fine. He'll live.

407
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:53,168
I'm glad.

408
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,419
Walter, you seen troubled.

409
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,464
What is it?

410
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,845
I asked to see you

411
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,430
in order to clear the air.

412
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,516
There are some issues

413
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,210
that could cause a
misunderstanding between us

414
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,838
and I think it's
in our best interests

415
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,339
to just lay the cards
on the table.

416
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,776
Sounds good.

417
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,594
That's the best way
to do business.

418
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,199
Moments before he was attacked,

419
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,268
my brother-in-law
got a warning call.

420
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,246
I believe that same person

421
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,955
was protecting me.

422
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,999
I suspect...

423
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,568
the assassins,
those two men,

424
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,629
were after me.

425
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:43,409
They were steered away from me
to my brother-in-law.

426
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,595
And that's to that intervention

427
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,264
I'm alive.

428
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,599
And yet I think

429
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,019
that this person

430
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,188
was playing a much deeper game.

431
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:58,549
He did this because it
was convenient to him.

432
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,426
Excuse me if I give you
too many details,

433
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,553
but I want to be
as clear as possible.

434
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,781
Go on, continue.

435
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,307
Thanks to my brother-in-law's
colleagues,

436
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,659
I found out these twins

437
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,745
belong to the Tapatío cartel,

438
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,289
which, in Mexico,

439
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,940
is in charge of doing business
with Colombia.

440
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,793
By chance...

441
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,570
I happened to read some news
on the paper

442
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,615
that said that
practically at the same time

443
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,201
that the twin
that was left alive

444
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,219
was dying here in the clinic,

445
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,887
the Federals in Mexico

446
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,599
were killing some Juan Bolsa,

447
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:36,020
the head of that cartel.

448
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,773
The point is, Gustavo,

449
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,845
I don't think

450
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,568
these are isolated facts.

451
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,945
they're just because.

452
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,613
I think that behind all this

453
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,449
there's just one person.

454
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,119
There's someone who's capable

455
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,562
of producing the best meth
in bulk

456
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,455
in Colombia.

457
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,249
Someone who's also interested

458
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,026
of getting rid
of the Mexican cartel.

459
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,362
Gustavo, you and I know
who that person is.

460
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,323
What's your point,
Walter?

461
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,135
I know I owe you my life.

462
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,498
And more than that
I respect the strategy.

463
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,060
I would have done the same.

464
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,337
But yes, there's something
that troubles me.

465
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,939
Tell me.

466
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,150
I don't know what happens

467
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,760
when our three-month contract
ends.

468
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,303
What would you like to
happen?

469
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,114
I want security for my family.

470
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,658
Then you have it.

471
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,661
Speaking of business,

472
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,688
the offer remains

473
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:40,484
Three millions for
three months of work.

474
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,281
We could extend that
to one year.

475
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:48,076
With a 15% raise
if that's good for you.

476
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,405
This is a really nice car.

477
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,198
Thanks.

478
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,116
This is the latest

479
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,534
we have for this job.

480
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,203
It's powerful, fast.

481
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,997
Just what we need, right?

482
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,916
I want to make you a proposal.

483
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:24,045
Tell me.

484
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,657
Here I have
6 million pesos cash.

485
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,327
More than what you earn
in a month, right?

486
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,121
- Sure, yes.
- You want to earn this?

487
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,748
Sure, as long as
it's not illegal.

488
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,558
Not at all.

489
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,018
What do I have to do then?

490
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,838
- Park and I'll tell you.
- Fine..

491
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,734
So what you want

492
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,679
is just to race
to the end of the road.

493
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,364
Yes, sir.

494
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,451
All right, then...

495
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,577
Let's do it.

496
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,662
Ready.

497
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,947
Watch out!

498
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,365
Open your eyes, please!

499
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,908
Guide me.

500
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,743
There's a truck coming, please!

501
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,020
Son of a bitch!

502
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,622
Stop!

503
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,878
What's wrong with you?

504
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,342
I told you to stop!

505
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,428
Asshole!

506
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,888
Crazy son of a bitch!

507
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,057
Get off my car now!

508
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,684
Get off!

509
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:05,046
Don't you think
I'll give you your money back!

510
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,106
Son of a bitch!

511
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,752
For those who were

512
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,839
in the last meeting,

513
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,743
and for those coming
for the first time.

514
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,746
I'd like us to talk
about those daily things

515
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,933
that bother us.

516
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,545
those things
that drive us crazy.

517
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,814
I think it's important

518
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,070
to learn to identify

519
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,846
those situations
that makes us nervous,

520
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,909
that make us nuts.

521
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:06,524
I think that could
help us get ready

522
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:12,989
so that when we see
a moment like that coming,

523
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,283
we can do something
and avoid it.

524
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,344
That way, we'll also avoid

525
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:22,139
the chance of a relapse.

526
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,917
That's what identifying
those situation is for,

527
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,937
that's what it'd be good for.

528
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,607
So, let's see,

529
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:35,011
who want to start?
Who wants to say something?

530
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,238
I have to go to the toilet.

531
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,490
Fine.

532
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,325
Who? Who dares?

533
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,369
What about you?

534
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,829
It's ridiculous.

535
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,275
Henry is a hero.
He's a hero just like...

536
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,194
every cop
and soldier

537
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,365
that risk themselves
to protect us.

538
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,034
You don't deny coverage
to a hero.

539
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,804
Can't be.

540
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,790
They'll say
they're not denying it.

541
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,143
They won't accept it.

542
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,462
I've been through that
with Walter.

543
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,422
If you do it on your
own, María,

544
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,632
you'll burn through
your savings

545
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,301
and you'll end up
full of debts.

546
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,320
But you can do this.

547
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,322
You told me

548
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,265
that the money
that Walter's partners gave you

549
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,825
was not enough.

550
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,703
But you could do it anyway.

551
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:28,022
- I'm going to get some wine.
- No, take this.

552
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,900
- I'm going to the clinic.
- No, María!

553
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,003
You have to rest.

554
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,197
Go home
or stay here.

555
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,116
Why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

556
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,452
I want to be there
in case he wakes up.

557
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,053
Did you see

558
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,705
all the meds
they gave him?

559
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,250
He'll sleep until
tomorrow.

560
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,203
Hello.

561
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,748
Hi.

562
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,124
What are you doing here?

563
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,710
I was worried about you

564
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,319
and I came to see how
you're holding up.

565
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,321
- Hi.
- Hello.

566
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:21,509
This id my boss, Ernesto Silva.

567
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,052
María, my sister.

568
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,745
- María, pleased to meet you.
- You too.

569
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,914
Thanks for the basket
you sent Henry.

570
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,625
We care about Cielo
so much

571
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,585
that naturally extends
to the whole family.

572
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,853
Come in, won't you?

573
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,855
it's very cold outside.

574
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,675
- Thanks.
- Yes, sure. Come in.

575
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,290
Thanks for sharing,

576
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:56,126
Carolina.

577
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,572
José,
now that you're back,

578
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,215
last time we saw you,

579
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,951
you were kind of
upset about your job.

580
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,096
Yes.

581
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,336
If you could do
whatever you wanted most

582
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,922
in your life,
what you desire the most,

583
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:20,259
what would that be?
What would you do?

584
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,404
Make more money.

585
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,722
I'm not talking about
that.

586
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,391
I'm not talking
about the money.

587
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,727
I'm talking about doing
something with you,

588
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,996
something sincere.

589
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,002
Well, it's not that...

590
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,880
It's not that I'm doing it.

591
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,926
I'm not doing it now but...

592
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,704
I think I'd like to do
something with my hands,

593
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:52,391
like handcraft.

594
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,561
Such as building things?

595
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,020
Especially carpentry.

596
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,298
- Fine.
- Carpentry.

597
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,361
It's just that...

598
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,572
When I was at school,

599
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,432
I just attended
the technical lessons

600
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,976
because those were
the easiest ones.

601
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,897
In fact, I never liked
any subject.

602
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,333
But I remember there was a class

603
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,794
that had a really good teacher.

604
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
He was called Hernando.
He was some kind of soldier.

605
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,449
He was hard of hearing.
You had to speak loud.

606
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,636
Whatever...

607
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,388
He once gave us a project.

608
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:34,475
We had to build a box

609
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,686
or something like that.

610
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,088
We had to build it
and give it to him.

611
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,482
I was really bad at school.

612
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,025
I just did the box

613
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,197
because I had to.

614
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,407
When...

615
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,326
When I gave him the box

616
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,204
for him to give me a mark,

617
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,691
he looked at the box
and asked me...

618
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,612
He asked me whether
that was the best I could do.

619
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:03,987
My immediate reaction

620
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,198
"Bitch, just give me a
mark.

621
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,576
I have to go meet my
friends.

622
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,286
They'll smoke it
all up

623
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,912
and I want to go
partying".

624
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,349
But there was something he said

625
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:21,397
that had an impact in me.

626
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,049
I don't know
whether it was his tone.

627
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,176
But what he said
was not wrong.

628
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:31,390
In fact,
he was right.

629
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,619
For some reason I thought:

630
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:40,082
"Yes, I can do better".

631
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,376
So then,

632
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,545
I just started practicing,

633
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,591
practicing, practicing.

634
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,009
I made one box after the other

635
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:55,222
until I finally made...

636
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,168
I made the nicest box
on earth.

637
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,921
It was lovely.
I made it with guaiacum,

638
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,233
some cedar.

639
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,011
It had some drawings
on the sides.

640
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,865
And a padlock.

641
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,868
A little padlock.

642
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,873
It was...

643
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,543
It was a beautiful box.

644
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,253
That's a nice story, isn't it?

645
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,838
Don't you think so?

646
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:30,716
It's nice.

647
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,369
And what did you do
with the box?

648
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,471
I gave it to my mom.

649
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,848
Well, that's even better.

650
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,084
Look, if you really
like carpentry,

651
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,228
that's great.

652
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,814
You could teach all of us.

653
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:47,383
- I think there are--
- I'm lying.

654
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,943
Actually not.

655
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,597
I didn't give it
to my mom.

656
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,993
I ended up changing the box...

657
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,996
for marijuana.

658
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,876
I have to get back.

659
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,862
I'll try to see Henry
at the clinic.

660
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,505
- Bye.

661
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,283
- It's been a pleasure.
- The pleasure was mine.

662
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,369
- Take it easy.
- Yes.

663
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,982
Ernesto, I'm really thankful.

664
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,218
Thanks for worrying,
but you know what?

665
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,136
- This is not a good time.
- No, no.

666
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,906
Let's talk for a minute.

667
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:39,076
Just one minute

668
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,079
Okay, tell me.

669
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,751
I know you need to be

670
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,319
with your
family.

671
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:52,130
But you just disappeared.

672
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,909
You don't answer my calls
or my messages.

673
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,802
I was worried about you.

674
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,471
You're right, I'm sorry.

675
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,958
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've--

676
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,627
No, I'm not talking
about work.

677
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:08,397
This is personal.

678
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,466
I was worried.
I didn't know
anything.

679
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:13,260
Yes, but you have to understand
the whole Henry thing

680
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,112
has been hard for all.

681
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:18,240
This is hell for us.

682
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,242
Sure, I know.

683
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,352
I know.
That's why I'm here.

684
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,397
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

685
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,484
But if you leave me aside,
I can't.

686
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,086
Thank you.

687
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,587
But it's not a good moment.

688
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,530
- For real, Ernesto, no.
- No, no, Cielo.

689
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:37,175
Your sister saw me here.

690
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,554
What's the thing between us?

691
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,848
How much longer?

692
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,810
I'm divorced, you're divorced.

693
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,730
Why do we have to hide?

694
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,816
Let's talk about it later.

695
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:58,430
Is there anything

696
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,818
you haven't told me?

697
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:58,530
I need to know?

698
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,974
No, no, no.
Let's talk later.

699
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,018
You really want
to do this now?

700
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,144
Are you going to make me
do this right now?

701
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,605
Okay.
You're right.

702
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,749
Okay?

703
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,334
We'll talk later.

704
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,088
Yes, yes.

705
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,967
Okay.

706
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:21,620
We'll talk
when I'm back at the office.

707
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,539
Take as much time
as you want.

708
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,328
Hey, dude,

709
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,482
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

710
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,043
It's depressing.

711
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,462
We should sort of...

712
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,380
keep a moment of silence.

713
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,551
No one misses it

714
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,512
more than me.

715
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,597
I was free to cook anytime,

716
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,183
anywhere.

717
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,167
I was free.
No responsibilities, no nothing.

718
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,229
Like a freelancer.

719
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:15,607
What's the point

720
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,359
of being an outlaw

721
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,735
when you got responsibilities?

722
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,488
They say on TV

723
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,140
that organized crime
doesn't pay.

724
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:26,518
They say Pablo Escobar
thought the same,

725
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,980
that's why he was so stressed
and worried

726
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:32,124
in the end.

727
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,334
The worst part

728
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,711
is I have to pay taxes now.

729
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,130
Pay taxes!

730
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,548
It's nonsense.

731
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,551
That's Kafkaesque.

732
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,891
Isn't it?

733
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:53,145
Yes, sure.

734
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,397
You know what, Tripa?

735
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,440
We should start slinging again.

736
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:01,511
- Yes, dude.
- Deal with the family.

737
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,656
We could get another RV.

738
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,809
Tripaseca and I will
take care of that.

739
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,368
No, no, no.

740
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,370
If we're doing it,

741
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,772
it needs to be different
this time.

742
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,317
A different way
of getting the product...

743
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,654
Other clients.
You get me?

744
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,463
Man...

745
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,675
How do you do that?

746
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,261
It's all planned, bitch.

747
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,599
How much does it weight?

748
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,770
José!

749
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,354
Hey!

750
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,298
Concentrate!
We haven't finished yet.

751
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,358
How much does it weight?

752
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,444
55 pounds.

753
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,930
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"I'm no fool,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">this is scorn</font></i>

754
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,891
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I own the money</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and everything</font></i>

755
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,477
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm a foreigner, a traveler,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">not just a cooker</font></i>

756
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,230
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I ain't no banker,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I come from garbage.</font></i>

757
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,774
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm the king of mortar,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">they call me rude</font></i>

758
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,293
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Those treacherous bitches...</font></i>

759
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,174
Why don't we start?

760
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,094
Who wants to begin?

761
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,762
You?

762
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,722
What's your name?

763
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,766
I'm Mauricio.

764
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,643
Welcome, Mauricio.

765
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,587
- Thanks.
- What do you want to tell us?

766
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,465
Well, I'm here
because...

767
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,568
I do meth.

768
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,306
Sounds funny, right?
"Do meth"

769
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,575
No, methamphetamine.

770
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,036
You get me, right?

771
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,772
That new stuff
that's hitting the streets.

772
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,441
I've left it
twice.

773
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,237
But there's a blue meth
in the streets now...

774
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:45,074
- It's so cool.
- No, no, no!

775
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,676
You just try

776
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,346
and it starts climbing up...

777
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,055
I'm sorry.

778
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,099
I didn't raise my hand.

779
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,709
That's fine.
What's your problem?

780
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,837
Pedro, but everyone
calls me Tripaseca.

781
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,506
Fine, then, Pedro.
Welcome.

782
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,025
Go on, Mauricio.

783
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,443
I'd never felt

784
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,931
life I felt with that blue
meth.

785
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,642
That stuff burns you
down.

786
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,911
I'm really scared

787
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,373
I might come across

788
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,399
that burning
and delicious meth again.

789
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,502
It's hard to get away from it

790
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,073
because you find it
on one corner,

791
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,342
you find it on the other.

792
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,802
It burns you down.

793
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,262
It burns your head down.

794
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:33,972
That's for meth addicts.

795
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,432
What do you do?

796
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,268
It's just so tempting.

797
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,686
That's... No.

798
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,063
It's really cool.

799
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,898
Yes.

800
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,341
It's the craziest
experience.

801
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,402
The craziest of all.

802
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,637
Excuse me,
what was your name?

803
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,239
Mauricio.

804
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:52,390
No, man,
you have to be strong.

805
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,578
Cheer up.

806
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,831
Pedro, thanks for your comments.

807
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,292
No, it's...

808
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,294
What a hard story.

809
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,203
I don't know what to do,
Cielo.

810
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:17,015
It's lots of zeros.

811
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,417
If I don't get it with the
insurance, I can't pay for it.

812
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,439
This is something daily.

813
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:24,898
María...

814
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,816
I want you to know

815
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,193
we're here for you.

816
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,652
Thanks, Walter.

817
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,113
I'm really thankful

818
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:34,324
for your support.

819
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,145
Walter, we can pay
for Henry's treatment.

820
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,480
Cielo, what are you saying?
Did you see the numbers?

821
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,607
Where would you get
that money from?

822
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,919
We have enough money!

823
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,155
- Cielo, please.
- No.

824
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,532
I think María
should know the truth.

825
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,950
No , Cielo, Cielo.
Wait a second.

826
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,635
Yes, I know it's embarrassing!

827
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,704
- No, no, no, please!
- But we have to tell her.

828
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,140
No!

829
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,625
María, Walter earned
lots of money.

830
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,587
- Gambling.
- What?

831
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,690
You know that Walter and I

832
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:10,568
have had problems lately

833
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,971
and it was because of that,
because of the money.

834
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:17,100
- for money?
- Yes!

835
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:19,495
When Walter was diagnosed,

836
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,747
his mood changed.

837
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:26,751
I just couldn't understand

838
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,712
everything he was going through.

839
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,634
He was not just afraid

840
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,929
of dying,

841
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,890
but of leaving his family

842
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,852
without anything.

843
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,480
So...

844
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,341
for better or for
worse...

845
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,609
he began gambling.

846
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,653
And he did well.

847
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,655
He did very well.

848
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,434
He even managed to pay
for his treatment.

849
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,454
What? Wait a moment.

850
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,648
I thought Edgar and Marcela
paid for your treatment.

851
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,292
Yes, I thought so too.

852
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,337
The truth is

853
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,881
he never took the money.

854
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,593
He was too proud

855
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:19,704
to take what he considered
to be charity.

856
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,807
Is that right?

857
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,481
You know Walter.

858
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,817
He began studying, reading...

859
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,070
and he made it.

860
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:39,391
He found a method
to count cards

861
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,244
and take money from casinos.

862
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,814
- Really, Walter?
- You know him.

863
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,916
He...

864
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:52,779
He solves problems,
he gets solutions.

865
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,299
And in this case he found...

866
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:59,469
What did you call it? A...

867
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:01,846
Statistical edge?

868
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,457
Yes, yes,
yes.

869
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,126
A statistical edge.
Exactly.

870
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,463
You remember when
Walter disappeared

871
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,548
and nobody knew
where he was?

872
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,691
Sure.

873
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,193
He was at the casino.

874
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,238
He was leading a double life.

875
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:22,642
What about your memory loss?
Was that a lie?

876
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,060
- No.
- No, no, no.

877
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,162
Not that...

878
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:29,291
In fact that night...

879
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,294
Walter had lost 30,000 dollars

880
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,489
in a clandestine bet
with some Koreans.

881
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,384
That was all our savings.

882
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,554
He was in shock.

883
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,957
he got out of the clinic
and went right to a casino

884
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,226
to get that money back.

885
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,687
Really, Walter?

886
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:54,174
- Well...
- I'm sorry.

887
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,319
What really matters here

888
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,096
is that with this system
to read cards

889
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,765
he didn't just recover
what he'd lost,

890
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:06,328
he also won a lot.

891
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:10,399
Although he didn't bet
again...

892
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:14,277
- Right?
- No, no, no, never again.

893
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:19,282
In spite of that,
we have enough money

894
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:24,346
to pay for Henry's treatment.

895
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:29,876
How much money
are we talking about?

896
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,936
How much?

897
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,065
Of...

898
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,385
I don't know.
Whatever you need.

899
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,097
I'm really good
with this system.

900
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:45,058
The one I invented
to count cards.

901
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,995
So I don't want you

902
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,147
to worry about the
insurance

903
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:55,293
or about the money.

904
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,488
- All right?
- Yes.

905
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,298
Wow!

906
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,884
I need a cigar.

907
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,844
A cigar?

908
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,457
- Yes, this is
too much information.
Come with me?

909
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:11,376
- Yes.
- Walter, thank you.

910
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,061
No, no, no.

911
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,438
Thanks to both.

912
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,482
Let's go.

913
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,204
Does Junior know?

914
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,706
No.

915
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,940
And he can't know
it.

916
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,084
No.

917
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,821
- Neither does Henry.
- Why?

918
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,115
Because Walter
would feel really ashamed

919
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,910
and Henry already has
enough things to think about.

920
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,387
Right?

921
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,623
- Don't tell him
- Okay.

922
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,224
María.

923
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,792
Henry woke up.
He's asking about you.

924
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,753
Thank you.
- Fine.

925
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,053
How did you come up
with that?

926
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,530
I learnt form the best.

927
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:11,911
I think it's the least

928
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,248
we can do.

929
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,751
Somehow something tells me

930
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,737
that Henry is here
because of you.

931
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:23,799
I'm not forgetting that.
