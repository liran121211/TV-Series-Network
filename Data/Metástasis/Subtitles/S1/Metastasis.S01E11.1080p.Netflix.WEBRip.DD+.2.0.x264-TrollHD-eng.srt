1
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,438
Hey, my friend.
I'll watch it for you.

2
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,706
Okay.

3
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,249
Thanks.

4
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,604
This is stupid.

5
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,439
Do you have a better idea?

6
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,857
I can't think of a worst idea.

7
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:13,759
- Really?
- Yes.

8
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,611
You call me to a secret meeting

9
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,822
in a place full of cameras.

10
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,932
And you are acting
all nervous,

11
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,600
like if you're going
to steal something.

12
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,478
I'm sure the cashier
doesn't stop looking at you.

13
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,814
If you don't have
anything good to say,
at least shut up and listen.

14
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,709
Whatever, bro.

15
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,195
- When do we start?
- No cooking for now.

16
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,634
Could you stop staring at me?

17
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,469
Pretend you're buying something.

18
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,681
You really piss me off, man.

19
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:46,084
We have to wait
until things settle down.

20
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,729
What do you mean "settle down"?

21
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,591
I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

22
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:57,762
I just put my family
through an ordeal.

23
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,347
I can't leave my house
for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

24
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,660
I need time to mend fences.

25
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,830
I'm not free right now.

26
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,857
I need to regain
my wife's trust.

27
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,443
So while you're fixing fences,
what about me?

28
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,403
Your brother-in-law
took all my money.

29
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,714
I have my own needs.

30
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,992
I don't have to pay
for your carelessness.

31
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,912
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

32
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,623
I told you not to,
but you didn't hear me.
Otherwise,

33
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,541
- none of this
would've happened.
- Just be cool.

34
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,393
Shut up for a minute.

35
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,859
POLICE

36
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,207
Are you going to grow up?

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,624
Can't you be patient?

38
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,918
It's easy for you to say so.

39
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:58,130
Jose, we're going to cook.

40
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,758
But, as for now, no contact.

41
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,997
Where are you going?
I leave first.

42
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:09,708
And buy something.
Do it, shit.

43
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,877
Really?
And where is the money?

44
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,272
Bitch.

45
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,033
Walter?

46
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,688
- Walter!
- I'm in the kitchen!

47
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,910
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

48
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,913
I didn't know you were allowed
to touch the stove.

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,643
You're missing your clown nose.

50
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,563
I have done orange juice.

51
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,384
- Good morning...
- Honey, good morning.

52
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,763
Don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.
Have a seat.

53
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,325
Follow this delicious scent.

54
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,827
Let's see...

55
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,912
Look.

56
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,106
- We have orange juice,
grapefruit juice...
- Thanks.

57
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,483
We have pancakes, coffee.
Have a seat.

58
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,197
I've never been a fan
of grapefruit juice,

59
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,991
but considering
all the polyphenols
and the albuminoids,

60
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,759
can't hurt.

61
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,803
Grapefruit juice?

62
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,097
You didn't have to do this.

63
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,665
I wanted to.
Grapefruit juice?

64
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,686
- Orange.

65
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,649
Here you have your orange juice.

66
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,695
Gentleman?

67
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,179
- Here you have.
- Thanks.

68
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,235
- Are you ready, José?
- What for?

69
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,862
I don't know
why you called me here.

70
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:06,885
Go ahead.

71
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,802
No, no, no.

72
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,455
Not another intervention,
please.

73
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,141
Have a seat.

74
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,397
Okay, José Miguel...

75
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,815
Pursuant to article 376

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,402
of the Real Property Code,

77
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,429
you are hereby given notice
to vacate the premises

78
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:32,017
listed as street 31,
18A-51, where you live.

79
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,286
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,188
Are you kicking me out
of my own house?

81
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,622
It's your nan's house.

82
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,375
She gave it to me.

83
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,320
She never gave it to you,
José Miguel.

84
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,157
You were allowed
privileges for residence.

85
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:50,161
Your parents have always been
the property owners.

86
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,371
Look, we talked about this,
okay?

87
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,266
I'd sell the house,

88
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,001
we'd split it fifty-fifty.
What the hell happened?

89
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,421
I don't want my mother's house
to be a drug dealers residence.

90
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,190
What?

91
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,427
An anti-narcotics agent
came looking for you.

92
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:20,649
Because I've actually
been helping them,

93
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,569
which I could get into a lot
of trouble for telling you.

94
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,172
I saw your basement, honey.

95
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:31,702
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in,

96
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,720
and I found your laboratory.

97
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,475
You guys have your own key?

98
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,420
José Miguel, the illegal
manufacture of drugs

99
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,982
is a second-degree felony.

100
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,302
Under federal asset seizure,
the government can take
the entire house.

101
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,347
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

102
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,449
Son, we can't stop you

103
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,826
from ruining your life,

104
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,203
but we will not allow you

105
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,247
to drag us down with you.

106
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,276
José Miguel, you have 72 hours
to vacate the house.

107
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,363
Otherwise, your parents have
authorized me

108
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,383
to contact the authorities.

109
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,802
I hope you understand it.

110
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,288
Do you have
any questions for us?

111
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:22,586
Okay. Three days, José Miguel.
You are served.

112
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,646
Please, come on.

113
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,463
Don't you know Daniel Santos?

114
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,492
I'm sure that some guy
like Daniel Santos

115
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,454
has a lot more of attitude
than any current rocker.

116
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,473
I'm sure about that!

117
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,267
And do you know current rockers?

118
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,603
Me? I know them all.

119
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,550
There is that...
The one with long hair.

120
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,471
He's dating that brunette.
What's his name?

121
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,724
Give me a second.
I will remember it.

122
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,619
Lucho is here for me, dad.

123
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,538
Good luck with that.

124
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,107
- Bye, mom.
- Tell Lucho to drive carefully.

125
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:27,792
I will remember.

126
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,445
Did you like breakfast?
You're welcome.

127
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,740
- No, relax.
- Thanks, Walter, thanks.

128
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,995
He doesn't know
who Daniel Santos is.

129
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,639
We have failed as parents.

130
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,683
I forgot to tell you.

131
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:48,588
There is a seminar
for amateur managers.

132
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,842
It's a course lectured
by one of those Hindu gurus

133
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,553
- you really like.
- And what about that?

134
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,782
The school sort of finances it,

135
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,435
and they give incredible
discounts for employees
and their families,

136
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,579
so I thought you would like...

137
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,372
I'll go with you, if you like.

138
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,001
Think about it.

139
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,489
I've been thinking
about the cell phone a lot.

140
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,493
I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm.

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,245
The alarm sound was exactly
the same as the regular
phone ring,

142
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,722
so I wanted to change it,

143
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,891
but I'm not good with technology

144
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,062
and I think I messed it up.

145
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,840
We can go to the shop now
and I can get a new cell phone.

146
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,135
I can actually buy one
less complicated...

147
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,821
Cielo?

148
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,786
Cielo.

149
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,212
Cielo.

150
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,006
Cielo, honey!

151
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,305
Hi.

152
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,415
- How are you?
- Fine.

153
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,309
Good to hear that.

154
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,255
Honey, you know what?
I fixed the door
in Junior's bathroom.

155
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,525
It was bent.

156
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,883
- Not anymore.

157
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,109
Great.

158
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,222
How are you?
Where were you today?

159
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,491
Out.

160
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,132
Is everything okay?

161
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,885
Everything's fine.

162
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,725
For what it's worth,

163
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,586
I was thinking about going back
to those meetings,

164
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,647
the cancer support group.

165
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:38,066
I think that's good.

166
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:40,819
Yeah, that's good.

167
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,222
You were right about that.
It's good to talk about things.

168
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,704
Yes.

169
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,289
I think that's great.

170
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,082
Yes.

171
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,976
Jose...

172
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,313
José Miguel.

173
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,524
Jose!

174
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,512
- Hi, mom.
- Why don't you answer
the phone?

175
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,072
I've just been pretty busy.

176
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,118
How did you get in?

177
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,914
Right, you have your key.

178
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,499
What's up?

179
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,585
Mom...

180
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,613
So I've been thinking a lot
about our conversation

181
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:45,200
and I completely get why dad
tweaked off on me like that.

182
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,385
It's not just your father.

183
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,956
I know, which is why
I wanted to talk to you.

184
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,335
I've been thinking
real seriously

185
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,604
about business school,

186
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,607
maybe economics.

187
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,610
Are you listening to me, mom?

188
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,556
Hey, this is good.
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

189
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,433
The time for talking
has passed, José.

190
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,286
What do you mean?

191
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,565
Who are these people?
What are you doing?

192
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,610
No, no, no.
Where do you take that?

193
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:23,154
That's my trunk, bro!
What's going on, mom?

194
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,617
I thought
it was just a wake-up call.

195
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,426
We are putting it in storage.

196
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,205
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

197
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,432
When I decide to grow up?

198
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,643
Why don't you grow up, mom?

199
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,562
My grandmother wanted me here.

200
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,464
I was the one
who took care of her.

201
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,424
I took her
to her doctor appointments

202
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,442
and made her lunch every day.

203
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,820
Don't lie, son.

204
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,598
I was here to see her
lying there dying.

205
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,283
Where were you?

206
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,603
Don't start with me.
I'm not going to answer.

207
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,772
Now what?
You've decided to make

208
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,290
your eldest son homeless?

209
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,193
Great mother,
you deserve some award.

210
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,196
Why are you like this,
José Miguel?

211
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,198
Why is this
the only way with you?

212
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,872
Leave your keys
in the kitchen counter
when you leave.

213
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,416
I have nowhere to go.
Where am I supposed to go?

214
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,769
I don't know!

215
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:23,298
I don't know. But please
turn your life around.

216
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,260
This is going to help
big time with that.

217
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,613
Thanks for everything!

218
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:37,979
- Hi, Lucho.
- Hi.

219
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,915
How are you?

220
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,818
- Come in.
- No, thanks, Mr. Walter.

221
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,377
Morgan and I need to get going.

222
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,087
We are late.

223
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,366
- Who is Morgan?
- Morgan!

224
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,009
Morgan?

225
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,636
Yes, why? Any problem?

226
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,013
No, not at all.

227
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,015
I like it.

228
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,767
Bye, Walter.

229
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,379
- Bye.
- Let's go.

230
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,923
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.

231
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,900
See you.

232
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,345
Why didn't you tell him
that we call you Morgan?

233
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,681
It doesn't matter.
Don't worry.

234
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,834
Morgan.

235
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,945
Morgan? That's how they
call him at school?

236
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,824
I can go and talk
to the principal.

237
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,092
He decided it.

238
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,079
It's what he likes
to be called these days.

239
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,998
He chose his nickname?
I don't understand.

240
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,460
In my time, other person
had to choose
a nickname for you. Why?

241
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:48,049
That's the name he uses
in the Internet. His nickname.

242
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,943
What's wrong with Walter?

243
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,531
Don't take it personally.

244
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,853
I'm asking because I think
Walter is a nice name.

245
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,665
It's about growing up.

246
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,750
He wants his own identity.

247
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,864
Do you think
he told Lucho about me?

248
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,509
About the blackout?

249
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,304
Lucho is his friend.

250
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,582
I don't think it's weird
if he talked to him

251
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,585
about how upset he was
because of your disappearance.

252
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,132
I made omelets.
Do you want some?

253
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,969
- I'm going out, but thanks,
though.
- Where are you going?

254
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,600
The phone is downstairs.
Can you get it, please?

255
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,828
Of course.

256
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,073
- Hello.
- Hi, can you talk?

257
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,619
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

258
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,971
I know, but there's a problem.

259
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,057
We agreed...

260
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,211
Missus, I'm not interested
in that credit card.

261
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:11,090
No, no, no, we already
have one without problems.

262
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,678
Right, honey?
We don't need
another credit card.

263
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,096
That's what I'm saying.
I'm not interested.

264
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,032
No, no, no, thanks a lot.

265
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,327
Honey, Cielo.

266
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,605
Can you at least tell me
where are you going?

267
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,665
The cab is here.

268
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,031
You should get that.
I'll be back in a few hours.

269
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,060
What?

270
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,937
I know I shouldn't call,

271
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,922
but I'm in a situation over
here, and I need my money.

272
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,050
- I gave you money.
- Thanks for the charity, bro.

273
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,218
But now I'm in a situation
with my house.

274
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,970
- Did you smoke the money?
- What?

275
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,363
I didn't smoke anything!

276
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,767
Your problems are just that:
your problems.

277
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,120
And when I say "no contact"

278
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,481
I mean it.
Do not call here ever.

279
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,984
Bro, you're not listening!
You're not listening!

280
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,294
No, I don't want to listen!

281
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,513
Don't call again!

282
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,456
Teacher, they're kicking

283
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,809
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">me out of my house!</font></i>

284
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,709
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They're kicking</font></i>

285
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,270
Teacher!

286
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,509
Bitch, you forgot
this light bulb!

287
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,945
Take it to your house!

288
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,571
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Who is it?</font></i>
- Bro, it's me, Jose.

289
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,241
- Okay, come in.
- Thanks.

290
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,046
Darkness holds you
pretending beauty

291
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,048
but that's only
the trap of your head.

292
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,134
Darkness holds you
pretending beauty

293
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,551
but that's only
the trap of your head.

294
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,237
One second.

295
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,513
We should get the band
up and running again.

296
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,284
"Fucking putrefaction".

297
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,410
That was the best!

298
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,065
Marcelín, bro, thanks
for letting me stay here.

299
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,542
Two nights tops.

300
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,777
I made sure this
stock knock exterminator

301
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,587
put me on his speed dial.

302
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,090
Don't worry.

303
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,283
You can call me
every time you need me.

304
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,494
Are you still staying
at your grandmother's?

305
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,179
Yes, bro.

306
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,972
But I'm thinking of moving.

307
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,293
Really?
That will be a permanent party.

308
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,187
Rock and roll and chicks.

309
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,564
Benji, you have to eat

310
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,733
the carrots and the soup.

311
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,762
Okay, Benjamín?
If you eat all this,

312
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,225
you will have a dessert!
But you have to eat it.

313
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,812
- Honey, hello.
- Mom is home.

314
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,356
- Hi, honey.
- Hello, honey.

315
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,292
Do you remember Jose?

316
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,043
- Hi.

317
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,421
He's eating everything.

318
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,784
Jose asked me to stay here
for a few days,

319
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,662
and our guest room
is available,

320
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,764
so, yes.

321
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,057
Okay.

322
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,878
Could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

323
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,881
- Be right back.
- Okay.

324
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,716
- This is heavy.
- How are you?

325
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,192
Fine.

326
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,740
What's up, little bro?

327
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,204
I used to not like carrots, too.

328
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,044
Honey, Benjamín.

329
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,319
I think it's someone's
shower time.

330
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,215
Then you can eat.

331
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,266
Man, you're going to kill me.

332
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,310
I totally spaced

333
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,961
that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

334
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,813
I have totally forgotten.

335
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,815
I get it.

336
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,941
Jose, please...

337
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,775
I have a girl

338
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,986
who can do me the favor.

339
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,404
The in-laws are the in-laws

340
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,198
and you have to do it.

341
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,225
I'm sorry, Jose,
but you know that you can

342
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,160
call me when you need me.

343
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,995
And let's talk about the band.

344
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,163
Right, let's talk.

345
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,733
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

346
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,751
Sorry.

347
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:50,328
I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights.

348
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,749
No, I have already called Mono
and he can't either.

349
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,975
I called everyone.

350
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,852
I need a solid here, bro.

351
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,106
Yeah, whatever.

352
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,816
All right.

353
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,818
Bye.

354
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,397
No, no, no!
Where is my bike?

355
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,485
Bro, I went to take a leak
and, when I got back,

356
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,295
the bike wasn't here anymore.

357
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,573
What the fuck?
Shit! I can't believe it.

358
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,160
This is a national problem,
the lack of security, bro.

359
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,802
This is the mayor problem.

360
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,057
Bye.

361
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,495
Good morning, Walter.

362
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,147
- Good morning.
- Mom?

363
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,124
Out.

364
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,419
Where's breakfast?

365
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,591
Let's do something different.

366
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,426
What?

367
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,244
You'll see.
You won't regret it.

368
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,227
This is going to be really fun.

369
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,465
All right, ready?
Start it.

370
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,195
Good. Handbrake.

371
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,909
Let's put it in gear.

372
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,729
And I let the clutch go softly,
as you told me.

373
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,789
Exactly, go on.

374
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:33,419
Nice and smooth.

375
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,050
Let the clutch go. That's it.

376
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,370
Smooth, smooth, slow down,
slow down, slow down, that's it.

377
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,973
You'll do it much better

378
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,875
- next time.
- Sorry.

379
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,978
Relax, you are doing it right.

380
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,564
Lucho has been helping me.

381
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,218
- Really?
- Yes.

382
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,114
Don't forget the turn indicator.

383
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,518
Perfect. And let's make
that left-hand turn.

384
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,145
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow down!

385
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,751
That's right. That's right.

386
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,586
Okay.

387
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,406
- Do you have your left foot
on the brake?
- Yes.

388
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,591
That's not the way.

389
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,826
You use the left foot
only for the clutch.

390
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,995
Why can't I brake
with the left foot?

391
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,914
You don't brake
with the left foot.

392
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,083
The left foot
is only for the clutch.

393
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,296
The right foot is for braking
and speeding up.
The left one is for the clutch.

394
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,065
Dad, this is way easier.

395
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,025
Come on, there's the easy way,

396
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,027
and then there's the right way.

397
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,946
We're doing things right.

398
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,684
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

399
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,895
That's why we are here,
so you can practice.

400
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,039
Okay, let's do it again.

401
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,860
Go across there,
nice and smooth.

402
00:28:56,986 --> 00:29:00,531
Take the wheel,
a little more, that's it.

403
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,909
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

404
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:08,747
And there you will brake
with the right foot.

405
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,583
Come on, the brake.
The brake.

406
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,919
No, dad.
My legs don't work that way.

407
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,563
Your legs are fine.

408
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,440
You just have to stick with it.

409
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,025
Don't set limits for yourself.

410
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,970
You're all right.
We'll get this.

411
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,888
Now let's just try again
with the right foot.

412
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,245
Here, straighten it.

413
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,231
Good, good, good.
You have the turn, the brake.
The brake, the brake.

414
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,917
Watch the cone here.

415
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,002
Come on, stop, stop.

416
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,738
Stop, stop, Junior!
Stop, stop!

417
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,282
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas.

418
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,470
I told you.

419
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,848
Okay, Morgan.

420
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,679
- Hands up, ass hole!
- No, no, no, bro.

421
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,572
If you move, I shoot.

422
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,574
No, no, bro, it's me.

423
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,159
Jose, man.

424
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,704
It's me, bro, Jose.

425
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,647
This is my RV.
I'm a friend of your cousin,
remember?

426
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,956
Do you?

427
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,317
What the hell
are you doing here?

428
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,919
You smell like shit.

429
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,488
It's a long story.
If you want to, I can tell you.

430
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,716
No, I don't have the time.

431
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,051
So, I fixed up this shit.

432
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,011
I had to buy some spare parts.

433
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,847
I spent 2000 dollars.

434
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,998
- And the toilet also.
- Okay.

435
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,875
- Give me the money.
- No, no...

436
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,561
I'm going to pay you.

437
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,937
But I can't pay you today.

438
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,940
Look at me. I don't have it.

439
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,968
- You gave me your word.
- Yes, and I will pay you.

440
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,555
I can really pay you,
that's the truth.

441
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,974
Let's do something.
This will be my payment.

442
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,536
No, no, no, please, bro.

443
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,772
Let's do something else.
Did you say 2,000 dollars?

444
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,083
That's four million pesos.

445
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,945
I owe you
a little more than that.

446
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,906
You give me 2500 dollars
plus interest.

447
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,719
Okay, okay, bro.

448
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,830
Do me a favor.
Give me two days.

449
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,750
Give me two days
to get that money
and I will pay you.

450
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,685
Just don't take my cook stuff.

451
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,937
That's all I got left.

452
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,814
Come on, please.

453
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,526
Please, all right?

454
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,267
Come on, Germán, please.
I'm begging you.
The bus.

455
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,579
Don't be like that, bro.

456
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,916
Germán, please, bro.

457
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,794
Come on, please, Germán!

458
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,424
Bitch.

459
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,494
There's a bunch
of stuff in there.

460
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,554
It seems to be a lab, bro.

461
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,499
He has some big bottles
that read something like...

462
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,852
Methylamine, maybe?

463
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,855
Yes, methylamine.

464
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,524
Are you kidding me?

465
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,735
Is that the real value?

466
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,890
And do you know
somebody who can buy it?

467
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,743
So wait a minute...

468
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,812
Son of a bitch!
What is that?

469
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,859
What are you doing?
Stop, idiot!

470
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,848
Come here!

471
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,850
Stop him!

472
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:35,155
Avocado, pineapple, banana.

473
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,777
Get your papaya.

474
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,325
Avocado, avocado.

475
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:42,830
Avocado, pineapple, banana.

476
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,084
Cielo.

477
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,756
Junior went to school.

478
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,801
Can we talk?

479
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:20,893
I know you have
a lot of reasons to...

480
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,620
That you might feel...

481
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:28,584
Basically,

482
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,987
I wanted to apologize

483
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,923
for everything.

484
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,823
I want you to forgive me

485
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:38,969
My desire for permanent privacy.

486
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:42,848
My emotional unavailability.

487
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,642
The way I mistreated you.

488
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,840
I know I've been
an awful partner lately.

489
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:57,805
Having cancer doesn't excuse
all that. I'm really sorry.

490
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,115
Please, forgive me.

491
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,607
I love you.
And I love this family.

492
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:12,903
And I just want to make sure
that we don't lose contact.

493
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,214
Please.

494
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,885
- Thank you.

495
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,099
Is that all?

496
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,938
What else?

497
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,236
We can't keep like this.

498
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,973
- How?
- Like this!

499
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,308
Not talking to me.
Making gestures
I don't understand.

500
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,687
Going out all day and refusing
to tell me where.

501
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:52,359
You are obviously angry with me
about something,

502
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,961
so let's talk about it.

503
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,240
You think that I'm up
to something, right?

504
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,538
You think I'm having an affair,
right?

505
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,290
Is that it?
Is that why you asked me
about the some other phone?

506
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,919
- Because you think that I'm
being unfaithful?
- I don't know.

507
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:12,212
- So ask me.
- Would you even tell me?

508
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,257
Yes, of course!
I will tell you now:

509
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,776
No! I'm not having an affair!

510
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,196
I have nothing like that.

511
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,973
What do I do
to prove that to you?

512
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,184
Swear an oath?
My right hand to God.

513
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,204
I'm not having an affair.

514
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,413
Okay, I heard you.

515
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,149
You're not having an affair.
Congratulations.

516
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,400
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you.

517
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,711
Great job keeping us apart.

518
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,216
All right.

519
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,493
- Do you want to talk?
- Yes.

520
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,680
On one condition.

521
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,724
Tell me only one thing.

522
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:53,253
One damn thing
that isn't complete bullshit.

523
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,647
It's easy.

524
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:00,218
You have to tell me what's
really going on right now.

525
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,071
Tell me!

526
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:04,198
No more excuses.

527
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,143
No more apologies.
No more of these obvious,
desperate breakfasts.

528
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,021
You don't want to lose contact
with me? Then tell me.

529
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,155
Tell you what? What is it you
want me to tell you?

530
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,716
Cielo, I don't know.

531
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,409
I don't understand
what's going on.

532
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,929
Cielo, Cielo!

533
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,560
Cielo.

534
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,104
Cielo, don't leave.

535
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:39,257
Cielo! Open the window.
We have to talk.

536
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,968
Do you know
what I've done for this family?

537
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,569
Cielo!

538
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,947
Run!

539
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,950
Run!

540
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,723
I'm really sorry, okay?

541
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,625
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

542
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,644
What's going through your mind?

543
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,022
My parents kicked me out.

544
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,172
I know this isn't
the best idea...

545
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,298
The best idea?
To park on my street?

546
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,009
- I know, I'm sorry...
- What are you thinking?

547
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,485
I told you I'm sorry.

548
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,570
What if my wife had seen you?

549
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,032
What was the plan then, genius?

550
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,431
- I don't know...
- Of course!

551
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,268
Because you have no brain!
Because you don't think!

552
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,063
I'm sorry, but I want
my half of the money

553
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,355
- and then I'll disappear.
- What money?

554
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,066
- What?
- You don't have any money.

555
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,608
- I have the money.
- No!

556
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,527
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

557
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,405
Look, that is completely unfair.
We agreed fifty-fifty partners.

558
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,257
Partners in what?

559
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:48,244
I cook!
I'm the producer!

560
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,512
You are just a drug addict.

561
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:52,639
You are a pathetic junkie.

562
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,042
That is what you are.
A complete idiot!

563
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,254
Too stupid to understand
and follow simple instructions.

564
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,693
Can I use the bathroom?

565
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,071
Yes, right there.

566
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,165
Do you want some breakfast?

567
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,501
Yes.
