1
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,575
So, how big's the batch?

2
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:19,687
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

3
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,397
- No!
- Okay, okay.

4
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,124
Mr. Blanco says the fumes

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,417
aren't good to breathe.

6
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,987
Let me worry
about what I breathe, kid.

7
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,255
Just hurry this up

8
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,741
so you can check its purity,
we can finish

9
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,176
and I can grab a smoke.

10
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,774
76%.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,635
Good! Nice
going!

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,820
Very good.

13
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:52,863
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,363
Where is the blue?

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,489
What?

16
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,199
The blue color.

17
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,810
Does it come
later,

18
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,686
when this hardens?
Where is it?

19
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:02,287
Mm.

20
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,482
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

21
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,876
See, I'm thinking

22
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,028
the headline here
should be

23
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,880
a purity of 76%.

24
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,531
The other dude
couldn't crack 70%.

25
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:14,575
Yes, I accept you
improved the purity,

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,344
congratulations, Beto,

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,956
but we don't have the color
and that's what Europe buys.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,624
That's what they pay
for.

29
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,837
If we're down a bit in purity,
maybe they won't notice

30
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:29,690
but not if it's not blue.

31
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,610
I don't know.

32
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,362
To my eye, it's kind of blue.

33
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,364
It's blue-ish.

34
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,117
Please.

35
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,035
Beto, you are the chef here.

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,536
What do you think?

37
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,039
The thing is that we are

38
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,416
in a dark closed place,

39
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,861
but if it catches
the light just right,

40
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,612
I could see how you'd think
there's a touch of blue.

41
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,089
Aquamarine.

42
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:58,452
Wait a minute.
Are you blind or what?

43
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,554
We'll put food coloring in it.

44
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,431
Make it any damn shade you want.

45
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,918
No, wait a minute.
I want it as it was.

46
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,770
I want it as usual.

47
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,481
With or without food coloring,

48
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,884
we're going to make
a lot of money with it.

49
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,163
Boss, boss.

50
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,581
Call me Lidia, Beto.

51
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:35,155
Mrs. here is your tea,
the brand and the sweetener

52
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,674
you always use.

53
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,717
Thank you.

54
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:44,623
You're welcome.
Look, about the product

55
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:48,168
I'm really sorry about the
color. For a minute or two,

56
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,839
it just got a few degrees too
hot in the mixing kettle,
I think.

57
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,651
You burned it, like a cake.

58
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,486
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

59
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,098
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

60
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,516
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

61
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,477
I mean, I'm doing everything
just like Mr. Blanco taught me.

62
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:09,523
You know, it's bound
to get better, right?

63
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,292
It will be better.

64
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,361
I appreciate you making
every possible effort
because, as you know,

65
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,656
my buyers expect a certain
threshold, a continuity.

66
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,993
Yes. But you don't worry
about those buyers.

67
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,413
If you have any
trouble, I can ask my
uncle to smooth things
over with them.

68
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,040
No, no, no.
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,516
That's not necessary.

70
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:33,047
Okay. Anyway,
I'm here if you need me.

71
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,107
I believe in you.

72
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:39,511
Please do make the cook better.
It's very important

73
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,239
to me.

74
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,784
Thanks.

75
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,179
Hello.

76
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,430
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Beto,</font></i>

77
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,557
I think I might have another job

78
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,101
for your uncle.

79
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,045
Okay. Do you want me
to set up a meeting?

80
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,839
Please.
Let's do that.

81
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,357
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Any heads-up I should give him?</font></i>

82
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,027
Which jail, how many targets,

83
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,737
stuff like that?

84
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,866
Hello, teacher?

85
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,409
Just one target.

86
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,953
Not currently in jail.

87
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,663
José Miguel Rosas.

88
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,667
Okay, sir.

89
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,114
Let me know about the meeting.
Thanks.

90
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,231
So, how's everything going?

91
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,234
Fine.

92
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,484
Still with the beauty?

93
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,762
I'm surprised you
didn't strangle him.

94
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,765
What do we do with
him?

95
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,101
Do we take him
to anti-narcotics?

96
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:53,145
I'm sure he has plenty to say
against Walt.

97
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:56,207
Knowing what we know

98
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,943
about how Walt deals with rats
behind bars? No.

99
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,502
So?

100
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,254
He has to be safer in jail

101
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,948
than out here
where it's open season.

102
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,758
What?

103
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,388
Kid's got an idea.

104
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,431
What kid?

105
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,334
Now we call him "kid"?
What kid, bro?

106
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,711
The one that screwed up
our sting?

107
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,064
He's a bitch, man!

108
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:24,218
Just hear him out
and tell me what you think.

109
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,697
So what do you say, genius?
Da Vinci.

110
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,425
What's the idea?

111
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,204
You guys need evidence
to put him away, right?

112
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:56,250
Only he's too smart to
leave any

113
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,851
out there, right?

114
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,770
So you say.

115
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,010
Well, I know some evidence
that greedy ass hole would
never destroy.

116
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,447
His money.

117
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,035
Do you know where he keeps it?

118
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,121
No.

119
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,024
But I know someone
who might.

120
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,254
What's up?

121
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,547
Did you get it?

122
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,549
Here you have.

123
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,593
So what?

124
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,472
Stewart stayed there.

125
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,182
Do you have his phone?

126
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,892
So?

127
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,352
And he's on ice?

128
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,480
Isolated? cut off?

129
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,049
He's in the safe house 30,
with Orozco.

130
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,677
And what do we do
if Orozco

131
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,821
start asking questions?

132
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,239
Orozco won't ask anything.

133
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,813
I have to tell you this
up front.

134
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,024
If this guy decides that
he wants to lawyer up,

135
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,652
I don't care if you are my boss,
I'm going to put a stop to this.

136
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,212
Relax, brother.

137
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,716
Look at this beauty.

138
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,763
Ha!

139
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,724
What's up?

140
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,502
What the hell, man?
What's this shit?

141
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,857
You're up.

142
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,386
Hi, boss.

143
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,179
Orozco, wait outside, please.

144
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,014
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,215
Stewart Alfonso.
How are you?

146
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,153
Do you know who I am?

147
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,074
I'll take that as a yes.

148
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,826
How are you, Stewart?

149
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,372
First of all,

150
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,832
thanks for your patience.

151
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,168
As they told you here,

152
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,322
you're not under arrest.
So relax.

153
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,632
Let's talk.

154
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,994
If I'm not under arrest,
why am I here?

155
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,538
You're here
because it's the best for you.

156
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,350
This is personal protection.

157
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,918
What are you talking
about?

158
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,896
Well, we both know how dangerous

159
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,399
Walter can be, right?

160
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,985
I'll take that as a yes too.

161
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,780
There's not much new

162
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,824
you can tell me about Walter.

163
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,036
Multiple murders,

164
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,230
ties to a white power
prison gang,

165
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,291
ran the largest meth racket

166
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,818
in Colombia.
I know all that.

167
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,045
So relax, brother.

168
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,824
Listen to this, Stewart,
this isn't an interrogation,

169
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,260
so you can answer what you want

170
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,220
or not, if you don't want to.

171
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,680
There is a lot we already know.

172
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,974
Let's cut to the chase.

173
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,126
We have a wire
on Walter's phone.

174
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,004
We intercepted a call between
him and a certain...

175
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,148
Saúl.

176
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,650
Saúl, the lawyer, Saúl Bueno.

177
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,110
I know he's your employer.

178
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,637
Anyway, in the call,
Walter said

179
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,806
that he was going to take care
of José Miguel Rosas

180
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,352
and that Stewart Alfonso was
the next on the list.

181
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,079
That's why you're here.

182
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,583
We are protecting you.

183
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:53,362
Yes, of course.
Bullshit.

184
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,864
We have the recording,
I can let you hear it.

185
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,675
What's your friend name?

186
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,010
Your associate...

187
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,136
Pirateque.

188
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,471
Gonzalo.

189
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,165
Gonzalo Pirateque,
well, Walter said

190
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,044
he was going
to take care of him also.

191
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,105
And Pirateque is missing.

192
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,986
I'm sorry to say that.

193
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,806
I don't think
he has had any luck.

194
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:26,353
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

195
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:32,484
Whatever you do,
I would not call Saúl.

196
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,796
He betrayed you.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,589
Have you seen his commercial?

198
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:42,661
"Better call Saúl".
Don't call him.

199
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,957
You're just playing
with me.

200
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,877
Don't take it personally.
Saúl does what Walter says.

201
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,879
He only does what the teacher
tells him to do.

202
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,523
Nobody else.

203
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,925
Of course Saúl
tried to help you

204
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,235
during 15 seconds,

205
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,279
maybe, but then he gave up.

206
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,848
He chose help Walter,
so they place a tracker

207
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:08,103
in your cell phone,
so when you call Saúl

208
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,165
Walter can find you

209
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,197
and, in just seconds,
you would end like this.

210
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,662
Shit, I didn't know they
were going to kill him.

211
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,666
I didn't know anything
about that.

212
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,959
Okay, relax.
Relax, Stewart,

213
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,813
We know you didn't know it.

214
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,508
If we thought you did,
you wouldn't be here.

215
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,652
You would be someplace else.

216
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,387
Let's do something.
Help us find Walter,

217
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,989
help us find him

218
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,283
before he finds you.

219
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,520
Why would he want to
kill me?

220
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,062
I didn't do
anything.

221
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,625
Who knows with this guy?

222
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,335
He's a psycho.

223
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,213
From what he said to Saúl,

224
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,867
it may have something to do with
him trying to tie up loose ends

225
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,579
regarding his poisoning
some kid.

226
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:09,222
What was his name?

227
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,849
Brock.

228
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:17,439
Or maybe it's because you know

229
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,150
where his money is.

230
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,615
I don't know that.

231
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,787
That isn't what we heard.

232
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,565
Well, you aren't listening
to the people in the know.

233
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,067
We only rented a van
for the dude,

234
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,570
loaded his cash up in
a self-storage unit

235
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,130
and handed over the keys to him.

236
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,116
And who knows where he took it
from there?

237
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:49,287
A van?
How much money

238
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,930
are we talking about?

239
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,351
Seven barrels' worth.

240
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,520
Seven barrels?

241
00:13:56,545 --> 00:14:02,150
Yes, Gonzalo and I filled them.

242
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,943
It was a lot of money.

243
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,612
What do you mean "barrels"?

244
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,890
Something like this?
Something bigger?

245
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:14,354
You know, those blue
plastic barrels.

246
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,208
For 50 gallons.

247
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,194
I bought them myself
in one of those stores

248
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,822
for construction
in the freeway.

249
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,800
Where did you rent the van?

250
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,746
It belongs to my uncle.
I can give you his phone

251
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,081
and address for you
to go check it.

252
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,017
We handed Walter the keys.

253
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,631
He had us wash it good
before taking it back.

254
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,566
Why did he make you wash it?

255
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,651
Was it dirty?

256
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,429
It was filthy, man, like if
he had went off road with it.

257
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,516
He grabbed a shovel
out the back

258
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:56,329
and reminded us to wash it

259
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,358
before taking it back.
That was all.

260
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,502
Was it soil or sand?

261
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,922
I don't know, soil, sand.

262
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,382
What color?

263
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,870
Yellow with red,
something like that.

264
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,000
All right, Stewart,
thanks for your cooperation.

265
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,796
We are going to do everything
we can to find Walter.

266
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,049
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

267
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,470
But if I were you, I wouldn't
take one step out that door.

268
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,699
They're going to kill you.

269
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,953
And remember, no phone calls.

270
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,314
I took the liberty of removing
the battery

271
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:46,446
so Walter
can't track you.

272
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,285
Stewart, you are
going to stay here with Orozco.

273
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,512
You're in good hands.

274
00:15:54,538 --> 00:16:00,794
But don't talk much to him
because he has to be focused.

275
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,713
How long am I going to
be here?

276
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:06,132
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

277
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,995
So just one guy this time.

278
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,412
Not even in lockup.

279
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,956
Right.

280
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,709
Some former partner,

281
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,836
Beto says.

282
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,045
Yes.

283
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,031
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

284
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:35,094
No, he's not a rat.

285
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,722
He just won't listen to reason.

286
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,307
Of course.

287
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,728
He's just angry.

288
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:47,090
He's not a rat.
I want that clear.

289
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,133
All right.
Angry, non-rat.

290
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,735
Yes.

291
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,029
How angry are we talking?

292
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,990
Like, Hulk angry?

293
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,476
When he tears all his
clothes?

294
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,563
Or like your wife
when you arrive home late?

295
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,484
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I want to understand something.

296
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,782
This is something
you wouldn't do yourself.

297
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:15,468
José is like family to me.

298
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:21,959
Look, I want what you do
to be quick and painless.

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,021
No suffering, no fear.

300
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,648
Bullet to the back of the head.

301
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,901
Something he doesn't see coming.

302
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,903
I respect that.

303
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,931
There's too many
savages out there.

304
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,199
Let's just talk about the money.

305
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,077
No, we don't want your money.

306
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,996
So?

307
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,956
We want you to cook for us.

308
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,833
You know I can't do that.

309
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,919
I'm out of the business.

310
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,796
Just a couple times to tutor

311
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,715
my nephew here, that's all.

312
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,925
No.

313
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,201
Get him on track to bringing
the purity up.

314
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,220
Get the color right too.

315
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,389
Absolutely not.

316
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,333
Look, what was the price
per head last time?

317
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,935
I'll triple it.

318
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,813
That's a drop in the bucket

319
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,716
compared to what we aim to earn
from the blue stuff.

320
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,902
Don't skimp on family.

321
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,404
You need us and we need you.

322
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,822
What's the price?

323
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,365
You cooking.

324
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,164
One cook after the job is done.

325
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,793
Time is of the essence.

326
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,987
It has to be
as soon as possible.

327
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,405
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

328
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,424
Just tell me where he is.

329
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,009
I don't know where he is.

330
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,764
But I know how to flush him out.

331
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,474
Make him come to us.

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,844
- Hi, Andrea.
- Hi.

333
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,220
I'm Walter Blanco,
do you remember me?

334
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,763
Yeah, of course,
Walter.
How are you?

335
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,600
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this

336
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,229
but I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

337
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,124
Yes, but I'm feeding Byron.

338
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,401
Do you want to talk inside
while he finishes his meal?

339
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,654
I don't have any problem,
if that's okay with you.

340
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,756
Yes, of course.

341
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,740
- Good.
- Come in.

342
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,924
Thanks.

343
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,243
You met Byron
before, right?

344
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,454
Yes, of course.
That dinner.

345
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,874
- Yes, yes.
- At José's. How are you?

346
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,377
Byron, he asked you a
question.

347
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,381
Don't worry. Kids are...
Enjoy it!

348
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,316
Have a seat, please.

349
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,734
Thanks.

350
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,406
I don't want to alarm you,

351
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:46,310
but I've been trying
to reach José for days.

352
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,456
He doesn't answer the phone.

353
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:55,003
He's not at home.

354
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,754
I can't find him anywhere.

355
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,339
Have you heard from him?

356
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,451
I don't know,
two weeks ago, maybe.

357
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:08,374
Really?
Okay. Well, you know...

358
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,434
He's using again.

359
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,644
What?

360
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,397
I have a bad feeling about this.

361
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,940
I want to find him.

362
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:22,221
I don't know.
Have you tried calling Saúl,

363
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,365
the lawyer on the T. V.?

364
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,226
Yes, yes. In fact,
he was able to verify

365
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,621
that José's not locked up

366
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:37,654
and he doesn't have problems
with the police.

367
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,824
The thing is that José and I
had this argument recently.

368
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,702
I won't bore you
with the details,

369
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:49,707
but you know that,
when we talk about addiction,

370
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,936
things get worse.

371
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,754
I'm worried for him,
that's why I'm here.

372
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,274
I'm thinking

373
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,927
that I could call him
to see if he answers me.

374
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,637
- That would helpful.
- And we'll see.

375
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,614
That would be perfect, thanks.

376
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,993
What number do you have?

377
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,061
This
one?

378
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,872
Let's see.

379
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,582
No, he changed it.

380
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,959
This is the new one.

381
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,210
Okay, let me see.

382
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,414
He doesn't
answer.

383
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,126
Leave you message
after the tone.

384
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,671
Hi, José, it's Andrea.
I'm at home

385
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,799
with Byron and your friend
Walter who came to visit us.

386
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,679
We're thinking of you.
Please call me
when you get this.

387
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,599
I want to know about you.
It's important.

388
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,577
Okay? Bye.

389
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:58,276
Perfect.
That will really help.
Thanks a lot.

390
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,319
You're welcome to stay
a few minutes to see

391
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,445
if José
calls back.

392
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,532
No, it's okay.
You are busy.

393
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,285
If I find something,

394
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:09,996
I'll call you.

395
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,096
I've got your number.

396
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,831
Okay, perfect,
Walter.

397
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,959
Byron, have a nice day.
Bye, Byron.

398
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,103
Byron, say goodbye.

399
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,922
Hello.

400
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,465
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's done.</font></i>

401
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,092
He should be here any time now.

402
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,719
Be alert.

403
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,970
Okay.

404
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,015
Remember, fast and painless.

405
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,809
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And take him away from here.</font></i>

406
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,711

407

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay? Bye.</font></i>

412
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:44,065
Keep trying, piece of shit.

413
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,202
So?

414
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,272
Did the van of
Stewart's uncle

415
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,374
had a GPS?

416
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,709
Nothing. No GPS, no nothing.

417
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,294
So we're fucked up.

418
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,530
No, no.
You can't just give up on this.

419
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,615
Who said we're giving up?
Nobody.

420
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,468
So what?

421
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,911
Do you remember
what Stewart said

422
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,955
about the dirty van
and the shovel that had Walter?

423
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,182
I'm sure he buried that money.

424
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,378
Let's say he did,
what do we do?

425
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,587
We start making holes
through all Bogotá?

426
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,589
You said it yourself that the
van didn't have a GPS.

427
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,817
What do we do?

428
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,026
Nothing.

429
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,530
But Walter doesn't know that.

430
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,536
Here's your change.

431
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,745
Count it out, please.

432
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,459
5, 10, 15.

433
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,085
Exactly.

434
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,462
Have a nice day.

435
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,297
Thanks.

436
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,614
Give this to your car wash
professional.

437
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,717
Thank you very much.

438
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,343
Thank you. Bye.

439
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,219
Honey, next time you say

440
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,762
"have a brilliant day".

441
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,889
Do I have to say so?

442
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:03,002
Yes, that's our motto.
It reinforces our brand.

443
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,338
Mom, it's Saturday.
Can I go?

444
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,149
Go where?

445
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,094
I want to go home
to pick up a few things.

446
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:14,347
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

447
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,933
Why don't you just stick around
here for a while longer,

448
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,742
to help me?

449
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,703
Okay.

450
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,581
Who do I give this to?

451
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:27,944
I'll take care of it.
That'll be 14.

452
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,965
You're the lawyer guy.

453
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,551
The one on T. V.

454
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,511
Did you recognize me?

455
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,678
Yes.

456
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,597
Better call Saúl. Ha, ha.

457
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:43,834
Your change. 30 makes 100.
Thank you very much.

458
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,730
What happened to your face?

459
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:52,051
I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

460
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,262
Give that to your car wash
professional. Thanks.

461
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,932
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

462
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,911
Don't drink and drive.

463
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,746
But if you do, call me.

464
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,914
Ha, ha, ha.

465
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,317
Yes, sir.
Have a brilliant day.

466
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,168
Brilliant.

467
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,504
That's our motto, right?

468
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,871
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

469
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,723
Between them.

470
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,542
What the hell
are you doing here?

471
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,962
José left so much powder
in my car

472
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,090
that if police stops me
I should call Saúl.

473
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,302
Couldn't you call, Saúl?
Don't you have a cell phone?

474
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,095
One of the two hundred
you have in your office?

475
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,573
My bodyguard is missing.

476
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,016
I don't have any idea
where he is,

477
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,269
he doesn't answer the phone,
nobody knows where he is.

478
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,188
What do you know
about José?

479
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:49,500
He hasn't shown up yet.

480
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,902
But he will. I'm sure
he's hidden someplace.

481
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,238
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

482
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,325
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

483
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,747
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

484
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,100
Did you miss the part

485
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,503
about my bodyguard
has gone missing?

486
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,213
I had him watching
the dog house,

487
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,465
figuring the kid might
show up.

488
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,759
Next thing I know,
radio silence.

489
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:20,557
You're exaggerating, Saúl,
José is not

490
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:25,144
on some killing spree.
It's me he wants.

491
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,498
It's just me.

492
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,917
So where is Stewart?

493
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,021
Hi. Any news?

494
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,148
No, not yet.

495
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,736
Mom, can you help me?

496
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,446
Yes, honey.

497
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,464
José.

on doing here,

510
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,663
but listen--

00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,261
Yes, I understand.
I understand it.

No, no, no! José, José,
please, listen to me.

529
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,414
Don't touch my money!

531
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,319
No, no, no, José,
stop, please!

532
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:42,114
I'm dying.
My cancer is back.

533
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,550
You're not hurting anyone

534
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,386
but my family.

535
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,622
I won't be around
long enough to use it.

536
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,307
It belongs to my children.

537
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,250
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you really want</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to talk about kids, Walter?</font></i>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you want to go there?</font></i>

539
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,229
I am sorry about Brock.

00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,106
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Of course you're not!</font></i>

541
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,357
Yes, I am, believe me.

542
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,609
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Don't talk bullshit!</font></i>

543
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,013
José, José, I am really sorry.
Please forgive me.

544

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You're not,</font>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When you get here.</font></i>

546
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,269
José, the most important thing
is that he is alive.

547
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,231
I'm not that stupid,
I knew exactly

548
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:18,108
how much to give him
and not kill him.

549
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,694
You know me,
I had it all planned.

550
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,279
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know you're a lying,</font>

553
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,411
You know nothing,
damn it!

554
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,705
Can't you see that I
needed you

555
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,998
on my side to kill
Gustavo?

556
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:37,836
I ran over those gang
bangers, I killed Loco.

557
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,839
I did all of those things
to try to save your life.

558
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,525
Don't you see that?

559
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:47,697
José, José?

560
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,308
I'm here!
I didn't hang up!

561
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,082
José, I'm here.
Where are you?

562
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,126
José, I didn't hang up!
Talk to me.

563
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,098
What's up?

564
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,183
Ouch...

565
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,837
Wait a minute.
How do you do that?

566
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,439
Hello.

567
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,885
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Joaquín, It's me.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I have José in sight.</font></i>

568
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,804
He's coming for me right now.
He knows I'm alone.

569
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,906
I'm guessing he's got backup.

570
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,866
How many guys?

571
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:56,910
I don't know.

572
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,327
Where are you?

573
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,578
Get a pen.

574
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,913
Write this down.

575
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:04,667
These are coordinates. 34.

576
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,210
59, 20.

577
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,296
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">52.</font></i>

578
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,615
Listen to me, Joaquín,
if you want me

579
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,367
around to cook,
you get here right now.

580
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,511
As fast as you can.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter, do you have eyes on him?</font></i>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Tell me something,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter.</font></i>

583
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:33,220
Wait a minute, no, Joaquín.
Forget it. Don't come.

584
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,139
It's off.
Do not come.

585
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,783
What?

586
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,750
What's up?

587
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,117
This is
clean.

588
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,764
He has to be somewhere.

589
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:06,378
He can't be far,
sick and walking.

590
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,089
And I don't think
he leaves us all the money.

591
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,191
Right?

592
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,317
Walter!

593
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:23,604
I know you can hear me!
Come on out!

594
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,941
Sooner or later
we're going to find your money!

595
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:35,992
Walter, give up!
This is over!

596
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:41,221
Freeze! Drop the gun!

597
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:51,799
Hands up!
Walk towards me slowly!

598
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,727
Slowly,
slowly.

599
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:16,448
Stop. Turn around.
Lace your fingers

600
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:25,624
behind your head.
Walk backwards to me.

601
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,887
Stop.
Get on your knees.

602
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,664
How did you like
my barrel photo?

603
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,434
Do you know where I took it?

604
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:13,772
In my house's backyard,

605
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,274
by the barbecue grill.

606
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,636
You know, where we used to
cook out with the family.

607
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,864
Remember?

608
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:26,102
Gómez thought the sand
might not match.

609
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:30,147
That you would find out.
But I thought

610
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,108
you were going to be so
worked up about the prospect

611
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,277
of losing his cash
that he won't catch it.

612
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,966
Looks like I was right.

613
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,468
I remember this place.

614
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,746
The very first place
we cooked.

615
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,457
When you told me you had cancer
and I had to cook alone.

616
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,271
Walter, do me a favor, brother.

617
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,048
Tell me where you have
the money buried

618
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,860
and save us the busywork.

619
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,238
Would you help me?

620
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,766
No matter.
I'll get a search team

621
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,910
out here even with dogs.

622
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,312
We'll find it
in less than five minutes.

623
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,664
Agent Gómez!

624
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,291
Yes, sir.

625
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,324
Shall we flip a coin
for the honors?

626
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,759
It's all yours.

627
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,761
Thank you.

628
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:30,707
Walter Blanco, you have
the right to remain silent.

629
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,795
Anything you say can and will
be used against you
in a court of law.

630
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,379
You have the right
to speak to an attorney.

631
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,676
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

632
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,971
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

633
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,405
Right.

634
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,328
Did you understand?

635
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,163
Coward!

636
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,466
Son of a bitch!

637
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,035
- Okay, okay.
- Son of a bitch!

638
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,205
Come here.
Back off! Back off!

639
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,390
Get him in the car.

640
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,182
I'm going to take him down
for booking, okay?

641
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,033
I think you should stay here

642
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,228
until the search team arrives.
Right?

643
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,912
Okay.

644
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,792
You are unbelievable.

645
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,460
Congratulations, buddy.

646
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:48,077
Thank you.
Thanks for your patience.

647
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:52,081
I'd take the kid with me,
but they'd probably kill
each other on the way.

648
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,266
I'm going to make a phone call.

649
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,608
Hi, honey.

650
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,902
Honey, I got him.

651
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:07,779
Walter?

652
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,724
I have him in handcuffs
as we speak.

653
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,536
He won't escape this time.

654
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,105
Do you want me to wave
to him for you?

655
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,792
Wait a minute.

656
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,962
He's not feeling too friendly.

657
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:31,912
Thank God, Henry.
You did it. Thank God.

658
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,082
Things are going to be a little
rough for the next couple weeks,

659
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,685
but they'll get better.

660
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,396
Ha, ha.

661
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,606
Are you okay?

662
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,942
I'm much better now.

663
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:50,155
Okay, I have to go.

664
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,141
It may be awhile
before I get home.

665
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,700
Is it okay?

666
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,702
It's okay.

667
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,496
I love you.

668
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,024
And I love you, Henry.
I love you.

669
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,609
This can't be true!

670
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:37,019
Hey, Henry,
who are those?

671
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,275
Henry, watch out!
Henry, Henry!

672
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,054
No, no, no Joaquín!

673
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,987
Police, drop your weapons!

674
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,571
Don't shoot!

675
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,351
Who are you?
Show us some ID!

676
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,910
Drop your weapons!

677
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,829
Joaquín, Joaquín, don't shoot!

678
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,523
You drop your guns!
You are at a disadvantage!

679
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,001
Joaquín, Beto, don't shoot!

680
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:36,661
Beto, don't shoot! Henry!
Please, don't shoot!

681
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,889
Joaquín, I told you it was off!

682
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,724
Damn it!
