1
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,833
<i>Good morning! Good morning.</i>

2
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,837
For those of you not
with us this morning,

3
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:29,007
and for those who came in late,

4
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,717
this man is Tuco Salamanca.

5
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:34,219
With Mr. Gómez here,
we've been performing

6
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,221
a raid in his headquarters.

7
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,891
Also his last known
address. Even his girl's house,

8
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:41,936
His meth hag girlfriend. Right,
Gómez?

9
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,187
He fell in love.

10
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,109
He likes them skinny to
be able to suck their bones.

11
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,531
We netted a bunch
of Tuco's lieutenants.

12
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,283
The big man himself smelled us coming,
so he fled.

13
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:01,747
So get a big old raging hard-on

14
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:06,502
at the idea of catching
this piece of shit.

15
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:11,716
Alright? I need you to bring
me Tuco Salamanca here!

16
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,968
To all the ladies here,
I apologize

17
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,678
for the ideas I just suggested,

18
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,390
but I need you to get excited

19
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,852
with the idea of bringing
me Tuco Salamanca.

20
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,354
Use whatever image turns you on,
okay?

21
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,108
So let's talk for bit
about Tuco Salamanca:

22
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,654
Mexican citizen,
been living in Colombia for five years now.

23
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,242
he supplies products for
almost all Mexican cartels,

24
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,956
and he's currently head of the
rising methamphetamine cartel.

25
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,250
Please.

26
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,670
One thing we must know
about Tuco Salamanca:

27
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,007
he's a psycho. He gets mad at you,
you're dead.

28
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,884
Although we have no evidence,

29
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,802
we know he's involved
in the missing case

30
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,470
and death of our informant,

31
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,099
Mr. Molina, aka "El Loco".

32
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,519
So let's have a moment
for our favorite spy.

33
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:10,108
May an eternal light shine on him. Right,
so much for that.

34
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,734
Which brings us
to the good news.

35
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,528
After much digging and digging,

36
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,532
we finally got some actual
evidence against Tuco Salamanca.

37
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,995
This man here is No Doze.

38
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,832
His body was found
right next to Gonzo's.

39
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,962
These two are Tuco
Salamanca's henchmen.

40
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,882
They were found at a container
storage. So what happened there?

41
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,093
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,596
was moving No Doze's body.

43
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,183
Either hiding it there or pulling it out,
still not sure.

44
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,146
He got his arm crushed clean
off after something fell over him.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,984
The guy was trapped and lost
blood to death next to his friend.

46
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,403
Anyone want to see the photos,
they're on my web site.

47
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,032
Hilarious.

48
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,284
Okay,
but don't you get sad. Easy now.

49
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,830
After every massage
there's a happy ending.

50
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,207
- Gómez.
- Happy ending!

51
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:12,044
Mr. Tuco's fingerprints are here,
on No Doze's.

52
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,588
This evidence is more than
enough to hunt him down.

53
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,215
Anyway.

54
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,844
I ask you,
do you want to find Tuco Salamanca?

55
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:20,970
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,513
Did you hear flies?

57
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,973
We need the fumigator over here.

58
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,226
Alright! Will you bring
me Tuco Salamanca?

59
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,145
- Yes, sir!Yes, sir!
- I can't hear you!

60
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,771
- Louder!
- Yes, sir!

61
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,356
- Will you bring him in?
- Yes, sir!

62
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,941
- I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

63
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,442
- I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,569
- Louder, come on!
- Yes, sir!

65
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,363
Do you think we'll catch him?

66
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,073
No way we're getting that dude.

67
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,784
He must be tucked in
Mexico having chilaquiles.

68
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,244
So what was all that fuss about?

69
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,747
Hey, it's all about motivation.

70
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:52,501
Gómez, I need a favor. Can
you cover for me this afternoon?

71
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,879
I've got to take
some personal time.

72
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,296
What?

73
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,217
Are you getting implants,
rays and all that shit?

74
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,052
Did you make up your mind,
Henry?

75
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,387
I'm all in for that.
You have my support.

76
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,724
Come on now,
enough. This is serious.

77
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,475
Walter, my brother-in-law,
is missing,

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,187
and Cielo asked me to
look for him personally.

79
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,274
Wow! Maybe Walter...

80
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,113
Okay,
I hope it's nothing serious, man.

81
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,574
Okay. Thanks for this.

82
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,785
Holler if you need me.

83
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:33,417
This is the most recent photo. That's
what he looks like now. Without the hair.

84
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,046
Ramón.

85
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,964
What's up?

86
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,966
Thanks a lot, man.

87
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,262
Ramón is coming
with us on his day off.

88
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,638
No worries. This is family.

89
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,390
Right.

90
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,437
I've been looking in the car
and there's nothing strange.

91
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,530
Ma'am,
what about Mr. Blanco's height and weight?

92
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,283
Five eleven...

93
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,410
About 170.

94
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,539
Now he weighs a little less.

95
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,209
He's thinner.

96
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,462
What about other distinguishing
features? Tattoos or moles...

97
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,922
No, not really.

98
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,673
Any threat that you know of?

99
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,092
Threat?

100
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,426
No.

101
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,305
No.

102
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,514
Is that the list of medications?

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,601
Yes,
and confirmed by the doctor.

104
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,020
Has he been depressed lately?

105
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,396
- Depressed?
- Yes.

106
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,316
What do you mean?

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,735
It's very important to know
if he's been depressed.

108
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,946
Kind of.

109
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,448
No, he wasn't depressed.

110
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,994
We could say he was a bit...

111
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,703
Not as joyful.

112
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,169
But yesterday he
was particularly...

113
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:02,089
He was agitated. In a bad mood.

114
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,424
In a bad mood in general
or because of something?

115
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,387
When I asked him what was wrong

116
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,891
he said "I don't
know where to begin."

117
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,310
But there was
something going on.

118
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,022
We were talking upstairs.

119
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:22,401
I was finishing a session
of meditation exercises,

120
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,155
and then five or six
minutes later he was gone.

121
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,869
Nothing else missing
in the house? His or...?

122
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:41,128
I think he only took his keys,
his cell phone...

123
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,546
His wallet.

124
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,925
Do you think this was robbery,
extortion or something like that?

125
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,531
We can't jump to
conclusions just yet,

126
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,804
but we can't rule out
any options either.

127
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,764
Right,
but if it was robbery or extortion,

128
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,641
he could have appeared by now,
couldn't he?

129
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,105
And the call? What happened?

130
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,863
I'm looking into
it. I'm on that...

131
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,699
Much paperwork
and forms to fill out.

132
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:16,121
While we were talking, he got a
call on his cell and didn't answer.

133
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,123
And then he left.

134
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,085
- Could that be a clue?
- Yes, it is.

135
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,504
Anything else you'd
like to mention?

136
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,259
No... I called

137
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,302
to find out about
the credit card,

138
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:34,014
and there's been
no recent activity.

139
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,809
There's a little money in the
savings account, nothing missing.

140
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,853
That's why I don't
think it's a robbery.

141
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:45,943
I checked with every hospital,
every clinic every morgue.

142
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,363
I was actually hoping that
you had something else.

143
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,908
Being that you're
the experts in this.

144
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,761
I really don't feel
you're helping me at all!

145
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:55,911
Cielo...

146
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,459
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to be rude.

147
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,419
Don't worry.

148
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,297
Gives us plenty
material to work on.

149
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,343
Nice to meet you.

150
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,345
I really appreciate this.

151
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,638
Take care, sir.

152
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,931
I'll walk you to the door.

153
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,690
Ramón,
the phone call Cielo mentioned...

154
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,858
What about it?

155
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,610
I looked into it.
There's no record

156
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,612
that the call existed.

157
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,243
Second cell phone.

158
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:42,040
Okay. Ramón, thanks again.

159
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,490
God damn it!

160
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,687
Don't worry, I understand.

161
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,319
Get out.

162
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,695
Come on!

163
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,537
So there was
the little lovebird!

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,997
Get away from
me! Don't touch me!

165
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,793
Calm down, little girl!

166
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,589
You going to shoot
me? Shoot me in here!

167
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,965
I hope I bleed like a mother,
too!

168
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,636
What a retard. It's your ride,
I ain't got to clean jack.

169
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,304
Now get out!

170
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:32,943
Get up!

171
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:37,155
Don't do it, Tuco! Please,
don't do it! Please.

172
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,450
Please.

173
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,076
Let's go up there.

174
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
Go on, you little bitches!

175
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,591
Inside, inside!

176
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,766
No more signs.

177
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,060
Junior is getting more printed.

178
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,106
Relax, Cielo,
he'll be fine. He'll show up.

179
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,443
Thanks

180
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,740
Okay, the whole tiara thing,
I thought it was

181
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,301
- the most gorgeous thing ever.
- María.

182
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,494
I can't believe you
actually wanted to return it.

183
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:05,933
¡María!

184
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,905
I stepped into this place
and it looked beautiful,

185
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,414
I thought it was
the perfect gift

186
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,626
Maria, please, not now! Please.

187
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,921
Okay.

188
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,174
Okay. Okay.

189
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,843
Empty your pockets, fuckers.

190
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,914
So Heisenberg is actually
called Walter Blanco.

191
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,251
Walter Blanco...

192
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,920
- Heisenberg is an alias.
- What?

193
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,757
It's a business name.

194
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,467
Don't we all have one of those?

195
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:32,140
...! There!

196
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,186
I like doing business
with a family man.

197
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,692
Look, uncle.

198
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,243
This is sweet!

199
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,750
You must use these with guys,
you faggot.

200
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,168
Don't you?

201
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,097
Can I trust you? Tell me!

202
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,058
Yes, absolutely.

203
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,060
Because this is about trust,

204
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,479
- about faith in the other.
- Right.

205
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,861
Get your stuff.

206
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,798
The police raided on my things.

207
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:51,094
And now they're looking for
me in every corner of the planet.

208
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,512
Why could that be?

209
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,141
Maybe you're the spies?

210
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,602
- No.
- No.

211
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,315
Picked up my whole crew,
except Gonzo.

212
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,195
Except Gonzo,
uncle. Isn't that weird?

213
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,616
Weird...

214
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,577
I mean it's unusual.

215
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,914
Hey, unusual.

216
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,627
That's a fancy word.

217
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,380
Heisenberg likes fancy words,
uncle.

218
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,097
I've been trying to locate
Gonzo for two days now,

219
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,224
but he won't answer my calls.

220
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,185
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No Doze.

221
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,147
As if we all weren't
meant to die one day!

222
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,859
As if I were to blame that the
asshole didn't know how to behave!

223
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:56,117
I saw this coming. I can see the future,
you know?

224
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,286
I knew last night they
were going to come

225
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,871
and that Gonzo
was going to talk.

226
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,167
I'm sure he's the one
who snitched to the cops!

227
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:10,423
That lousy son of a bitch!
I trusted him like a brother!

228
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,514
I see Gonzo,
I'm going to gut him,

229
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,517
make myself a whip and
hit myself on the back.

230
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,102
That way I finally
learn the lesson

231
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,606
that you can never trust
the people you love, ever!

232
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,650
Love is no guarantee!

233
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,110
Tuco, I'm really sorry that
Gonzo ended up being a traitor.

234
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,779
I truly am sorry.

235
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,324
I'd waste him, too.

236
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,202
- Shut up, you idiot.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,875
I need powder, I need something!

238
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,760
This smells like rotten cheese.

239
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,513
No, man. It's killer. Seriously.

240
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,310
Heisenberg...

241
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,104
I've been thinking.

242
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,107
Mexico's the answer.

243
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,653
- Mexico?
- Right, fucker, Mexico!

244
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,531
Or don't you like Mexico?

245
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,658
No, I do, it's just that...

246
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,785
- Have you ever been there?
- No.

247
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,997
So how in the hell do
you know you don't like it?

248
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,249
Everyone should go to Mexico!

249
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,670
I went to Mexico once, to Cancun
with my family. That was some place.

250
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,673
Shut up,
asshole! Cancun is not even Mexico.

251
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,475
Look, Heisenberg.

252
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:49,689
Mexico has the
prettiest landscape.

253
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:54,027
And the food... Isn't the
food the best ever, uncle?

254
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,363
And we have culture, music...

255
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:04,203
Maybe the ladies aren't as hot
as they are here, but they're tamed.

256
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,416
And the capital city.
You know what's in D.F.?

257
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,461
A bunch of stuff,
loads! Anything you want!

258
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,924
Never been there, but they say
in D.F. you can get anything at all.

259
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,051
We know what to
do with meth there.

260
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,553
We'll set you up in a super lab.

261
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,932
We'll do nothing but cook 24-7.

262
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,392
Every week,
all year. Nobody will mess with us

263
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,519
because I got my people there.

264
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,440
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg. The lottery!

265
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,401
Tuco, I have a wife and kids.

266
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,737
So what? You'll get another one.

267
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,574
You just don't like Mexico,
that's all.

268
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,660
I do like it,

269
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,872
but I can't just
uproot my life like that.

270
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,834
- Neither can I.
- Who the fuck is talking to you?

271
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,585
- Who? Who?
- No, no, no, man,

272
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,753
calm down, calm down.

273
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,965
You need me,
I have knowledge too.

274
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,093
I cooked that
scante in your pocket.

275
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,971
It smells like that
because of the chemicals.

276
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,974
But you've never tried
nothing like it. It's like...

277
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,768
One bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

278
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,605
It's a new product him and I have
been working up, with a secret ingredient.

279
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,025
What's the secret ingredient?

280
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,359
Coffee.

281
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,949
I don't like coffee.

282
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,951
It makes my heart pound hard.

283
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,913
Don't make anything new.

284
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,209
This blue magic
is worth everything.

285
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,475
All right! Time to
burst the piñata!

286
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:49,984
No!

287
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:53,563
No, don't do it,
Tuco! Please, don't do it.

288
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,232
He's my partner.

289
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,900
I need him.

290
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,777
And if he doesn't go,
I don't go.

291
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,787
I'll tell you this,
little fucker.

292
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,456
My cousins are driving
up here right now

293
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,334
to smuggle us back down.

294
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,255
And you're coming with me,
or you're dead!

295
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,133
Bam!

296
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,635
Say your prayers, boy,

297
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,387
that there be a
place for you to come.

298
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,981
Mom, I'll be right back.
I'll give out these flyers.

299
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,733
- I'm coming with you.
- No, mom.

300
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,027
Relax. I'll go alone.

301
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,030
Cielo, easy,
you have to rest. Stay.

302
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,699
Call me if anything shows up.

303
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,285
I'll be fine.

304
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,081
You have a passenger
inside. You should rest.

305
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,796
Actually, I think the very fact they
haven't found Walter yet bodes well.

306
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,879
What do you mean?

307
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,465
Well, I mean,
if he... You know....

308
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,842
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

309
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,223
What?

310
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,309
Henry...

311
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,186
There's got to be something
that we haven't picked up.

312
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,189
Some detail we just missed.

313
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,109
What about Walter's
second cell phone?

314
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,153
- María! What the hell?
- What?

315
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,155
We can't just ignore
a potential clue.

316
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,781
She should know
this. Tell Cielo.

317
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,366
What are you talking about?

318
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,409
I'm not telling her.

319
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,221
- Can you explain yourself?
- Nothing, that the call

320
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,805
Walter got before going missing,
that's what we're talking about.

321
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,374
Right, what about it?

322
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,543
Well,
I went to the phone company,

323
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,546
and in Walter's log

324
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,466
there were no incoming
or dropped calls.

325
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,801
- I heard it.
- Right.

326
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,636
His phone rang. I heard it,
I swear.

327
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,389
I know, I know you did.

328
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:56,435
The only logical
explanation there is for this

329
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,065
is that Walter must
have a second phone.

330
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,318
What for?

331
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,154
No. What sense would there
be in that? Another phone?

332
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,199
Look, I...

333
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,951
I'm not here to argue with you,

334
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,120
if it makes sense or not...

335
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,499
No, no, no. You can't just
bring up "second cell phone"

336
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,128
and then drop it.
What does it mean?

337
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:26,132
No, I mean... Maybe Walter...

338
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,888
- You know? That...
- No, I don't know.

339
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:36,851
We all have secrets. María
has secrets. We all do...

340
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,521
I can't believe
you're saying this.

341
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,024
I can believe it. Why not?

342
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,152
How long has Walter kept
the whole cancer thing?

343
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,948
Okay...

344
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:54,577
Let's assume there's second cell phone. So,
what?

345
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,829
Is he having an affair?

346
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,041
Walter? Please. A lover.

347
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,419
I'm thinking marijuana.

348
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,796
- Walter doesn't smoke that anymore.
- Really?

349
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,132
Why? Because he told
you and you believed him?

350
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,344
Chemotherapy and marijuana
go together like siblings.

351
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,931
Maybe he's addicted to the pot,

352
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,934
and he owes his drug
dealer a lot of money.

353
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,144
María,
you don't get hooked on pot like that.

354
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,479
You don't? How do you know?

355
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,899
You didn't even know he
had a second cell phone.

356
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,361
Henry,
what you should do is question

357
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:31,614
this pot drug dealer person
that has Walter into this.

358
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,952
Wait,
we're rumbling around too much here.

359
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,913
- No, no, what we want--
- I agree with you.

360
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,125
But we're making
progress. That's something.

361
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,365
No sugar, thank you.

362
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:19,537
Mrs. Sofía,
thank you so much for speaking to me.

363
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,874
It's been very hard
to take in this visit.

364
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,752
Last time I spoke to my
son things didn't end up well,

365
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:31,299
so anything having to
do with him bitters me.

366
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,967
Do you have children,
Mr. Navarro?

367
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,346
No, no children. I have a nephew,
he's like a son to me.

368
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,265
So I kind of know the feeling.

369
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,311
It's like anything else in the world,
completely different...

370
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:49,775
Especially, when it comes to
a young man like José Miguel.

371
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,696
He was a very problematic child,

372
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,533
and I'm the one to
blame for most of that.

373
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,785
I think we parents
raise up to a point,

374
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,706
and then it's up to the person
what to do with their life.

375
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:07,751
Right,
but the problem is I overprotected my son.

376
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,589
We was a very sensitive child,

377
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,508
not much disciplined.

378
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,054
That caused problems with his father,
and...

379
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,808
then came all the rest: the drugs,
the lies,

380
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,604
the problems... So we
ended up isolating him.

381
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,567
I'm here for a rather
personal matter

382
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,361
It's about Walter Blanco,
my brother-in-law.

383
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,739
Does the name sound
familiar? Walter Blanco?

384
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,658
He taught José Miguel
chemistry at Los Monarcas.

385
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,662
Professor Blanco! Yes,
of course I remember him.

386
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:48,334
He helped José Miguel so
much. He saw potential in him.

387
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,294
Did something happen to him?

388
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,714
He's missing,
actually. I'm trying to gather leads.

389
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,758
To see if I can find him.

390
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,887
So are you accusing José Miguel
of something? Is this his fault or...?

391
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,557
No, no, no,
calm down. Like I say...

392
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,644
This is out of the police,
this is a personal matter.

393
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:11,649
Do you know if José
Miguel and Walter

394
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,818
were in touch lately?
Do you know about that?

395
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,238
I have no idea.

396
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:22,201
No? Because I
have a number here.

397
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,621
Is this José Miguel's number?

398
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,372
Aha, it is.

399
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,749
I'm calling, and nobody answers.

400
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,629
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you. I...

401
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,465
I haven't spoken with
my son for about a month,

402
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,343
and I don't think I'll
be talking to him soon.

403
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,305
We had an argument

404
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,974
and haven't spoken ever since.

405
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,810
I understand.

406
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:52,189
Just one more question.
Does he still have the same car?

407
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,526
Yes...

408
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,736
I could never
get him to sell it.

409
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,713
Hello. What's up, Gómez?

410
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,548
How's it going?

411
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,050
It's fine, dude. Listen,
I need a favor.

412
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,595
I need you to take
down this plate.

413
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,098
Okay, it's FJA 319.

414
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,644
It's under José Miguel Rosas.

415
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,439
Let me know if it has a
satellite anti-theft system, okay?

416
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,359
If it does,
locate that car for me, will you?

417
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:39,028
Yes, yes,
I owe you one more, buddy.

418
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,572
Easy,
I'll but you beer one of these days.

419
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:42,990
Thanks, bye.

420
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,804
Coffee? The secret ingredient?

421
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,224
How many times did I
tell you that's just stupid?

422
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,352
But it almost worked.
At least I tried.

423
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,355
But your idea of leaving the
gun in the house is better?

424
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
No, right,
I absolutely was expecting

425
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,108
for you to come to
my house with Tuco.

426
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,152
At least he wants you alive.

427
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:25,074
<i>Apparently linked to Mexican
drug dealer Tuco Salamanca.</i>

428
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>The dead bodies of
these two gang members</i>

429
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,289
<i>were found at a container
storage in the outskirts of the city.</i>

430
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,434
<i>Authorities have not
confirmed their identities yet,</i>

431
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,460
<i>but alternative sources
have informed us</i>

432
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,171
<i>that they are apparently Gonzalo Cañas,
aka Gon--</i>

433
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:48,097
If Gonzo's dead and Tuco didn't kill him,
what the fuck happened?

434
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,767
I don't know.

435
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,269
But that's the least
of my worries now.

436
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,854
If he finds out that Gonzo is
dead and not a police informant,

437
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,648
who does he automatically blame?

438
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,818
Ha!

439
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,528
We need a plan now.

440
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,032
Let's just bum-rush him, man.

441
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,837
You crack him over
the head with something,

442
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,412
and I'll go for his gun.

443
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,666
Right,
something like what? The cactus?

444
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,336
I don't know, take a shot.

445
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,214
You're as good as
checked out already.

446
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,925
You should be, like,
all sacrificial for future generations.

447
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,177
So my life is not
a priority here

448
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,597
because I'm going to
be dead soon anyway.

449
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,181
Thanks a lot.

450
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,600
Well, yes.

451
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,035
We got to get him to take this.

452
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,582
He doesn't like much
the taste of coffee.

453
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,712
So unless you can convince
him to booty bump eat.

454
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,223
Let's have lunch, uncle.

455
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,101
Okay.

456
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,875
Eat, it's a long trip!

457
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,086
Come on, you fucktards!

458
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,800
I'll go get chilies, uncle.

459
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:18,831
Start eating! You're looking a little weak,
Heisenberg.

460
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,333
I don't want you to go
belly up before we get there.

461
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,303
Calm down,
uncle. I told you already.

462
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:38,058
I will feed you. I eat
first. That's the deal.

463
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,480
What is it, Héctor?

464
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,699
I get it,
I get it. You greedy old bastard.

465
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,117
You want the big one, don't you?

466
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,082
These old people...

467
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,376
They don't care if
you buy them a house,

468
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,003
treat them well, care for them,

469
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,965
feed them. They
always want your share.

470
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,927
They never had anything.

471
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,348
Eat up, uncle.

472
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,870
Why did you do that?

473
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,375
You don't waste food.

474
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:49,713
Okay.

475
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,847
You don't waste food, uncle.

476
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,961
Hey, hey, hey!

477
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:32,089
That fucking cow didn't
know where it came from!

478
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,925
She's as good as a steak.

479
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,303
What is it, uncle?

480
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,227
Don't tell me you're hungry.

481
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,436
What is it?

482
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,028
What's up with them?

483
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,278
You don't like them?

484
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,158
One bell means "yes".

485
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,537
He doesn't like you.

486
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:10,044
Why don't you like them uncle?

487
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,670
You don't trust them?

488
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,719
Why don't you trust them?

489
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:22,264
No, no, Tuco, come on,
your uncle's not fir to make any--

490
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,724
Shush.

491
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:32,524
Did they do something to you?

492
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,780
- What did you do to my uncle?
- Nothing.

493
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,241
Bullshit! My uncle does not lie!

494
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,120
I swear we didn't
do anything to him!

495
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,747
Maybe,
I did change the channel on his TV.

496
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,632
But that's it. I didn't
know he'd get pissed.

497
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,584
Right! He was watching the soap,

498
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,252
and this dude
changed the channel.

499
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,130
- See? I told you not to!
- Stop!

500
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,011
Is that true, uncle?

501
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,183
Did they change the
three-o'-clock soap?

502
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:09,145
Or are they laughing
at me and lying as hell?

503
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,859
No, no, no!

504
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,360
Tuco!

505
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,116
Leave him!

506
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,701
Hold it there, bastard!

507
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,746
Leave him alone!

508
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,706
Move, you motherfucker! Go on!

509
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:00,863
Don't kill me!

510
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,865
Don't kill me,
please don't kill me.

511
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,535
What were you going to do?

512
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,083
What the fuck were
you going to do?

513
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,421
Poison you! We tried to poison you,
because you're an insane,

514
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,757
degenerate piece of shit!

515
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,121
How does it feel now?

516
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:53,790
Who's the bitch now?

517
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,462
How does it feel?

518
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,674
Leave him! Let him bleed.

519
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,384
Let's go.

520
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,025
Come on, let's go.

521
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,028
Man, the keys.

522
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,990
Tuco has them.

523
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,082
His cousins!

524
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,204
Ha...

525
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,742
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

526
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,299
José Miguel Rosas?

527
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,387
You're a hard man to find.

528
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,688
Stand still...

529
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,280
Stand still!

530
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,831
Fuck me!

531
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,117
- It's Henry!
- Who's Henry?

532
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,910
- Henry, damn it!
- Who the fuck is Henry?

533
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,870
- Move!
- What are you...?
