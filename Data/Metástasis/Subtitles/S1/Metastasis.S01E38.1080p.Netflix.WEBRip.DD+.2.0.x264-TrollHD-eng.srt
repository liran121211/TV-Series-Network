1
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,824
Did you understand?
Saúl!

2
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,843
Tell me if you understood.

3
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:36,203
Saúl, shut up for a second!
Damn it!

4
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,164
Listen. I need you to give her
all the money.

5
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,334
Put it in garbage bags
if it's necessary.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,588
Give her every cent.
Understood?

7
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,104
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You've reached the Blancos.</font>

8
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,082
Hi, Cielo.

9
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,125
It's me, Walter.

10
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,377
Listen...

11
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:14,492
I wanted to tell you
that I was thinking
of you and the kids, and...

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,746
Well, I love you very much.
Did you hear?

13
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,680
Hello. Can I help you?

14
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,056
Gustavo Cortés.

15
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,224
Excuse me?

16
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,670
Gustavo Cortés, your boss.
I need to talk with him.

17
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,730
No, Mr. Gustavo isn't here.

18
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,675
He is here.
I saw his car
in the parking lot.

19
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,844
He was here,
but he had to leave.

20
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,904
He's here!

21
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,391
Go and tell him
that Walter Blanco
needs to talk with him.

22
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,785
He knows what it's about.

23
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,995
I'll be waiting.

24
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,161
- Hello.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Walter.</font></i>

25
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,264
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What do you think you're doing?</font></i>

26
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,915
- Where's Jose?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- I'm with him.</font></i>

27
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,226
And he's fine.

28
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,643
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you want me to believe you?</font></i>

29
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,437
I'm telling the truth.

30
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,965
Do you want me to swear
on the Holy Cross?

31
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,635
- No, don't swear. I want proof.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Hold on.</font></i>

32
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,389
- What's up?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Jose.</font></i>

33
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,575
Jose. Where're you?

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,769
- I'm with Mario.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Jose...</font></i>

35
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,289
Does he have a gun on you?

36
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,542
No.

37
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,753
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Then tell me what's going on.</font></i>

38
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,880
We're driving away from Bogotá.

39
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,548
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Where are you going?</font></i>

40
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,283
I don't know.
We're going North.

41
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,469
Why are you going there?

42
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,122
Jose, do you know exactly
where they're taking you?

43
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,598
No, no idea.

44
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,309
Put me through Mario again.

45
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,464
What's up, Walter?
Hello again.

46
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,442
Mario,

47
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,970
tell me exactly
what is going on.

48
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,265
What you need to do
is to go back to your lab
and get on with the cook.

49
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,684
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You'll have to muddle through.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">He'll be with me today.</font></i>

50
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,786
No, listen, Mario.

51
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,397
- Goodbye, Walter.
- It doesn't--
Don't hang up on me, Mario.

52
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:27,912
Sir, sir.
That area is restricted. Sir!

53
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,235
You're not allowed back there.

54
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:47,389
This area is for employees only.
Leave immediately
or I'll call the guard.

55
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,080
What are you planning to do?

56
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,816
Are you planning
to leave me in some ditch
or throw me into the river?

57
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,878
What do you care?

58
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,863
I thought
everything was the same for you.

59
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,589
You're right.

60
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,717
But listen to me.

61
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,246
You better shoot straight,
or I'll slice off your other ear
before going.

62
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,655
What do you have there?

63
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,787
What we all want.

64
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,374
Let's go.
Or are you staying there?

65
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,019
We have to do it six times.

66
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,064
With a lot of miles in between.

67
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,925
Hurry up.
I'd like to finish before dark.

68
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:33,157
Look what he did.
He was completely crazy.

69
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,077
He's a combination
of a drug dealer and Bambi.

70
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,015
Is this Heisenberg?

71
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,875
I thought you've caught
him
a long time ago.

72
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,087
No, they caught a man
called Fredy Liso.

73
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,798
Those inexperienced
thought he was Heisenberg.

74
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,025
Are we sure this is him?

75
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,986
Yes, I think so.

76
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,155
Why was he killed?

77
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,809
Is there any rival drug gang
trying to move him away?

78
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,436
Do you have any name
to investigate?

79
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,205
I'd like to help you,

80
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,375
but I only know two persons

81
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,628
involved with methamphetamines,

82
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,113
especially with blue crystals.
The first one

83
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,241
is a big silly man
called El Mono.

84
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,927
He isn't a drug dealer.

85
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,246
The other one
is José Miguel Rosas.

86
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,723
He and I have a history.

87
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,850
Do you remember I was suspended?

88
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,936
Yes, yes.

89
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,438
Is possible that Rosas

90
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,673
is the killer
of the big cook?

91
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,610
I would be surprised

92
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,612
because he wasn't brave enough.

93
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,156
Okay.

94
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:43,477
All we have
is this composite picture.

95
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,733
According to the neighbors,
he entered the house,

96
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,904
inspected the body,
analyzed the crime scene,
and left without saying a word.

97
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,867
- I don't recognize him.
- Keep that copy.

98
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,054
Is this all you have?

99
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,999
We have a couple of prints
to investigate.

100
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:10,061
I'll get you updated.

101
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,564
Okay.

102
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,219
Ramón, I really appreciate
that you keep me informed,

103
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,490
but now that...

104
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,393
Heisenberg is dead,
I don't have...

105
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,453
I can't help you any more.

106
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,330
Why do you say that?

107
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,315
Henry, I said it,
and I repeat it:

108
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,944
Your help is very important
now and ever.

109
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,380
I appreciate your words, but...

110
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,260
But I'm done here.

111
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,557
Well, okay.

112
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,418
If you're done, you're done.
Excuse me.

113
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,356
Thank you very much, Henry.

114
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,968
- Thank you.
- Okay.

115
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,153
I can't walk you to the door.

116
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,780
Don't worry.

117
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,615
It's okay.

118
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,910
I'll call you.

119
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,408
Hello!

120
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,713
What are you doing?

121
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,843
Watching.

122
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,761
Why?

123
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,288
That's why you brought me here.
I understood it.

124
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,931
I haven't say that.

125
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,476
No, but it's obvious.

126
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,020
If I'm going to be here

127
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,675
as your backup,
shouldn't I have those things
that backups have?

128
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,027
What do you mean?

129
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,766
- Well, a weapon, a gun.
- No.

130
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,768
It doesn't make sense
that I'm standing here,

131
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:15,021
watching all around,
without a gun.

132
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:20,068
If something happens here,
it's useless for you
and dangerous for me.

133
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,613
If you have a gun
is useless for me

134
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,282
and dangerous for you.
Get in. Let's go.

135
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,684
Come on, man.

136
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,920
If you haven't brought me here
to watch or to be your backup,

137
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,132
can you explain me
why the hell am I here?

138
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,635
You haven't brought me here
to hold a conversation.
You aren't good at it.

139
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,181
- Can I smoke or not?
- No!

140
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,387
Chips?

141
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,810
I'll light one.

142
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,596
Do you know
I got your plan?

143
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,114
Can I tell you?

144
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,952
Do I have an option?

145
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,537
You want to bore me

146
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,190
until I'm death.
Am I right?

147
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,462
Congratulations, Mario.

148
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,866
Mission accomplished.
I'm about to shot myself.

149
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,759
Come on, Mario.

150
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,678
Let's talk seriously.

151
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:40,417
I know how the system works.
The hidden things,

152
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,727
the money bags.

153
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,881
I used a similar system
with my partners.

154
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:51,110
Obviously, the team I led

155
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,724
didn't deal
with the amount of money
you deal with.

156
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,118
But the scheme or the concept

157
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,789
are very similar, aren't they?

158
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,734
This thing of keeping
supplier and distributors
separated from each other

159
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,544
is very well thought.

160
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,363
It's very smart and useful.
Well done!

161
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,841
You do it very well!

162
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:22,166
If we're working together,
don't you think it'd be good

163
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,295
if we, at least,
talk to each other?

164
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,172
I've been talking all day,
but you didn't say a word.

165
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,900
You just take me

166
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,844
from one place to another,
taking the money.

167
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,513
Honestly,
I'd like to know something.

168
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,283
Listen.

169
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,228
I know I'm here
to do some work, right?

170
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:46,691
- I'm the man for the job.
- No.

171
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,881
You aren't the man for the job.

172
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,366
You can't be the man
for the job.

173
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,413
I had the man for the job,
but I don't have him anymore.

174
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,807
Do you remember?

175
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,626
What matters
is that you aren't the one.

176
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,186
Then what am I doing here?

177
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,355
I don't know!

178
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,609
It's not my call.

179
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:17,014
I do what I know best.
I obey.

180
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,599
I receive an order,
and I obey it.

181
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,061
Now you'll do
what I tell you.

182
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,230
- What is it?
- You'll stay there.

183
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,499
Remain quiet and in silence

184
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,402
until we've collected
all the money.

185
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,026
Any doubt?

186
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,054
I always have second thoughts.
Every day, every time.

187
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,391
Well, that's completely normal.
But we must be confident.

188
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,994
You have a solid business plan.

189
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,897
- Yes.
- Your expectations
are realistic.

190
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,209
Let alone your safety.

191
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,962
You're doing perfectly fine.

192
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,408
- Everything will be fine.
- Okay. Walter.

193
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,179
Walter.

194
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,459
- Shall we sign?
- Yes, sure. Of course.

195
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,105
No, no, no. You sign first.

196
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,749
So.. this is yours.

197
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,864
I'll bring these documents
to the notary's office
to certify the purchase.

198
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,327
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

199
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,330
- Thank you.
- And, of course.

200
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,667
Next week,
I'll be the first one

201
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,394
to wash my car there.

202
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,880
- The first one is free.
- Okay.

203
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,422
You'll be charged
the second time!

204
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,984
Perfect!

205
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,220
- Have a nice day.
- Walter, have a nice day.

206
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,562
- Thank you very much.
- Good bye.

207
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,530
We're officially
the owners of the car wash.

208
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,926
How are you feeling?

209
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,346
And you? How are you feeling?

210
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,708
- Nervous. I'm scared.
- Why?

211
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,854
We have to do it right.

212
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:21,007
We'll be fine.
We're doing this right.

213
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,026
Will we?

214
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,719
Please!
I have to hear it.

215
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,098
- I guarantee it!
- Okay, fine.

216
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:33,436
If we're going to do this,
I mean,
we're really going to do this.

217
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,334
We have to promise each other

218
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,529
there won't be more secrets.
There can't be any mistakes
like before.

219
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,633
We have to be completely honest.

220
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,011
I'm all for that.

221
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,497
- Absolutely!
- Good. Okay.

222
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,683
Good.

223
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,228
How about a drink to celebrate?

224
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,047
Yes, yes. Definitely.
Let's celebrate!

225
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,008
- I have a bottle in the fridge.
- I hope it isn't expensive.

226
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:08,138
No, of course.
Nothing flamboyant.
Something simple.

227
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,889
- A simple drink.
- Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,824
But it has its effect.

229
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,165
There's a message.

230
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,167
I haven't noticed.

231
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:25,155
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi, Cielo.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's me, Walter.</font></i>

232
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,828
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Listen. I wanted to tell you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">that I was thinking</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of you and the kids, and...</font></i>

233
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,497
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, I love you very much.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Did you hear?</font></i>

234
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,927
These sheets smell different.

235
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,431
Why?

236
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,227
I changed the soap powder.

237
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,645
A long time ago.

238
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,482
I like it.

239
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,360
I like you.

240
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,654
It must be the new look.

241
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,114
You didn't notice, did you?

242
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,532
Of course I noticed!

243
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,394
- I was about to tell you, but--
- Liar!

244
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,188
- What?
- You're a liar!

245
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,123
I didn't do anything.

246
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,503
You're being mean!

247
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,743
Do you want to have dinner
with María and Henry tomorrow?

248
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,388
If you aren't busy.

249
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,041
Yes, yes. I'm free.
I like that.

250
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,520
María says only us

251
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,047
and those rocks
he's collecting--

252
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,007
Minerals.
They're minerals.

253
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,568
Well, that.

254
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,029
Only us and the minerals

255
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,114
make Henry leave the room.

256
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,866
Mom, I'm home!

257
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,242
Shit!

258
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,662
Hi, Junior!

259
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,524
Dad!
Are you here?

260
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,610
Yes.
We'll be right there.

261
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,504
We're having a conversation.

262
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,838
Okay.

263
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,758
Shut up!

264
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,594
Did you have to tell him?

265
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,580
He was going to notice.
My car was outside.

266
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,209
He'll make questions.
What are we going to tell him?

267
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:47,063
He'll ask about our situation.

268
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,799
I don't know.
What should we tell him?

269
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,118
Perhaps you should move back in.

270
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,288
That would make it easier.

271
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:08,818
I don't know.
It'd be easier
to explain to everyone.

272
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,754
Don't you think so?

273
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,908
I have to get back to work.
I'm running late.
I have a shift now.

274
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,525
Hey!

275
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,985
Listen up!

276
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,364
This is a two-man job!

277
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,533
I can't do it alone!

278
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,619
I'm done! That's it!

279
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,580
It's senseless.

280
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,318
Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

281
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,934
Where's Jose?
I need him here.

282
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,747
You have me down here alone.

283
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,859
I'm doing the job of two men.
Understood?

284
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,712
This is senseless.

285
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,006
It's counterproductive.

286
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,799
And it's dangerous!

287
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,369
Jose operates that machine.
I don't do that.

288
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,997
That's one of the many things
he does around in the lab!

289
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:30,059
That keeps us on schedule.

290
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,520
I suggest that you get him back.

291
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,233
Are you listening to me?

292
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,258
Where do you want it?

293
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,656
This is the last one, isn't it?

294
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:29,101
I've been counting.
And this is the last one.

295
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,451
[engine starting
and speeding up]

296
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,914
You have to pick me up.

297
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,024
I'm two blocks
from the north warehouses,

298
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,251
where we do our collections.

299
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,714
Yes, at Juanita's store.

300
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,215
I'll be waiting.

301
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,348
Cancel that.

302
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,755
You don't know
what happened to me.

303
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,590
I was there,
and a few men approached.

304
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,802
One had a gun or a shotgun.
I don't know.

305
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,262
He got off,
and came after me.

306
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,140
The other one was blocking
the street on a motorcycle.

307
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,811
They were going to rip us off!
I swear it!
I didn't have a choice.

308
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,746
I had to put it in reverse.

309
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,648
I think I slammed
into the guy's car.

310
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,608
And I almost ran over
the motorcycle guy.

311
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,276
He almost fell
on some barbwire.

312
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,320
He fell down.
There were sparks.

313
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:48,574
I swear to God
I'm telling the truth.

314
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,967
Yes, I saw it.

315
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:55,305
What did you see?

316
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,600
I'm sorry. I forgot.

317
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,126
Do it.
You've earned it.

318
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,797
- Really, Mario?
- Yes. Let's go.

319
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,823
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

320
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,593
Did you sleep well?

321
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,244
- Yes.
- Do you want some juice?

322
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,039
- No, coffee.
- Coffee?

323
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,417
I didn't know
you drink coffee now.

324
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,837
I also started tying
my own shoelaces, too.

325
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,397
Sure! You're being funny.

326
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,593
That's good.
You're growing up.

327
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,016
- Milk and sugar?
- No. I'll have it black.

328
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,562
Black. Wonderful!
That's good.

329
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,735
- Hey, dad.
- Tell me.

330
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,378
I was thinking,

331
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,489
and I wanted
to tell you something.

332
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,882
Sure, tell me.

333
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,119
I wanted to tell you
that I like having you back.

334
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,058
I like being around, too.

335
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,978
I like to be back.

336
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,089
Mom said that on Tuesday
you're moving back home.

337
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:32,344
- Did she tell you that?
- Yes.

338
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,946
SOLUCIONES SILVA

339
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,494
On Tuesday.

340
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,623
We'll see.

341
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,625
It's nice.

342
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,775
Jose.

343
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,279
Jose!

344
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,919
Jose.

345
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,253
Hey.

346
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,465
What are you doing?

347
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,326
Breaking crystal.
It's part of our job.

348
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,928
I'm not talking about that.

349
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,597
What are you doing here now?

350
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,457
Who brought you here?
I didn't see your car.

351
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,725
Mario dropped me off.

352
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,728
Jose.

353
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,465
Stop it.
I'm talking to you.

354
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,509
- Walter, what do you want?
- What happened yesterday¡

355
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,027
Where were you?

356
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,320
I was out with Mario.

357
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,948
Out?

358
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,558
Yes, he needed help
to pick up the money.

359
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,452
What money?

360
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,771
I don't know.
From the business.
They hide it. Mario picks it up.

361
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,414
I watch his back.

362
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,374
What?

363
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,944
No, no, no.
Hold on.

364
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:15,572
Are you watching Mario's back?
No!

365
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:18,742
Sorry for laughing.
It's a good joke.

366
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:23,163
Listen, Walter?
Stop talking without knowing.

367
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,749
For your information,
they tried to rob us.

368
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,044
I prevented them
from robbing our money.

369
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,547
They were after me,
but I drove away.

370
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,508
So this time,
I did my job.

371
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,511
And right now,
I'm doing my job, too.

372
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:43,809
If you aren't going to help me,
let me work
because I don't have time.

373
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,494
You don't have time?

374
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,437
No, I'm going out
with Mario again this afternoon.

375
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,498
Really? Again? Why?

376
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,629
Apparently, I have two jobs now.

377
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:12,963
- Okay.
- Thank you.

378
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,024
- Any injuries?
- No.

379
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,777
One twisted ankle.
That's it.

380
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,753
Nothing too bad.

381
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,073
It all went
like you thought it would.

382
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,535
I will, of course, reimburse you
to the damage to your vehicle.

383
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,221
Okay.

384
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,932
Any questions?

385
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,584
More than a
few.

386
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,395
But I know I shouldn't ask.

387
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,840
What matters
is that it all went through
according to your plan.

388
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,843
José Miguel is convinced
that he's a hero.

389
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,073
Very good.

390
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,963
The idea of owning a car wash

391
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,632
scares me.

392
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,135
But then I remembered

393
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,554
that I studied for that.

394
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,041
I'm an accountant.
I'm prepared
for running this business.

395
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:35,545
- What a nice baby!
- In this case,

396
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,925
the business is already running,
so it's much faster.

397
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,069
Of course!

398
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:45,430
I think we'll have to do
plenty of changes.
Hiring people, for example.

399
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:49,643
Beautiful Valentina.
Look at me.

400
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,203
May I have some wine?

401
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,997
No.

402
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:57,084
Well, we want to...

403
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:00,712
The idea is to succeed

404
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,867
in order to keep
all the current employees.

405
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,010
I really think

406
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:10,247
that if we do good,
in a couple of years

407
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,583
we may buy another one.
Or even sooner.

408
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,752
Are you going to put
Junior to work?

409
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,381
No! I'd rather study
than having my mom as my boss.

410
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,010
Hey, didn't you think
of including Valentina
in the advertisement?

411
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,988
As a pet or what?

412
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,973
Silly you!
As a marketing strategy.

413
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:32,519
People will think
it's a baby wash,
not a car wash.

414
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,621
Don't be silly.

415
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,858
Beautiful babies are used
in all kind of advertisement.

416
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,110
If I saw Valentina
in a big poster,

417
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:43,488
I'd wash my car there
every day.

418
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,490
Can't you use me
for the picture?

419
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,118
No, we're saving you
for your mother's next business:

420
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,053
the house of terror.

421
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,667
Walter, do you want more wine?
There's more in the kitchen.

422
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,061
No, no, no. I'll get it.

423
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,967
What will you do with Valentina?
You can't take her there.

424
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,469
It's full of fumes
and disgusting people.

425
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,697
María!

426
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,725
Am I lying?
Aren't there fumes?

427
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,518
And are people nice?
No, please.

428
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:18,481
Did you hire models
to work in your car wash?

429
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:23,486
Luckily, there's a good nursery
five minutes from there.
I can visit her anytime.

430
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:27,741
I want to congratulate you
because you started
a family business.

431
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,492
- You share it.
- Yes, yes.

432
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,346
You'll see the results!

433
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,390
We'll get the keys tomorrow.

434
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,960
Walter! Will you drink
all the wine there?

435
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,754
I'm sorry.
I'm coming.

436
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:45,425
Have you changed gaming
for this?

437
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,361
Why do you ask him that?

438
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,140
It's a joke.
I always joke with him.

439
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:54,268
I know, but Walter
needs your support right now.

440
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,855
He needs positivism, motivation
to recover, right Cielo?

441
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,792
Yes.

442
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:07,405
I don't think it's bad
that my father earns money.

443
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,549
Let's change the subject.

444
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,761
Hey, uncle.

445
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,289
What happened
with the case of the crazy man

446
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,515
who used to sing karaoke?

447
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,142
I'm not in the case any more.

448
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:23,713
I gave the information
to Homicides.
It's closed case to me.

449
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,049
The crazy man
who used to sing karaoke?

450
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:31,654
It seems like a horror film.

451
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,991
The man wasn't crazy.

452
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,853
Honey, what's that word
that isn't "crazy"?

453
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,355
- Eccentric.
- Eccentric! He was...

454
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,982
- He's a wealthy crazy man.
- Yes.

455
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,109
- Who's that man?
- Was.

456
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,029
He was killed.
A meth cook.

457
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:50,090
One of the best ones.

458
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,993
He was very good
for that stuff.

459
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,872
He was a genius.
He was an absolute genius!

460
00:40:56,997 --> 00:41:01,251
If he had used his brain
to do something good,

461
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,837
he would have helped
humanity a lot.

462
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,299
I'm serious.
He was wonderful!

463
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:11,928
How many geniuses are there in
the world?
You can count them on one hand.

464
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:15,182
- He was one of them.
- Hey, hey, hey. Henry.

465
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:20,312
- It's a personality.
- Hey, hey. Henry, I'm sorry.

466
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:24,191
I know I'm nosing around
in something
that isn't my business.

467
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:31,340
But I don't agree.

468
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:34,701
- What? Which part?
- Well...

469
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,762
The notebook you showed me.

470
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,890
That notebook!

471
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,685
I saw it.

472
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,297
And this is just
my humble opinion.

473
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:50,900
He wasn't a genius.

474
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:57,474
Those were the notes of a man
who wants to follow a routine.

475
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,144
Someone who's copying
the work of a master.

476
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,707
I know what I'm talking about.

477
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,110
I've spent my entire life
around students.

478
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,128
It's typical.

479
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,052
Do you know what I think?

480
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,582
If I were you,
I'd think it twice.

481
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,145
Perhaps, your genius

482
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,731
is still out there.

483
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,378
POLICE ANTI-NARCOTICS DEPARTMENT

484
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,724
CHICKEN BROTHERS AND CO.

485
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,711
What's
that?

486
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,732
Hi, honey. I called Ramón.

487
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:17,846
I asked him to bring me
the information
on the case I told you

488
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,140
- The karaoke man.
- Yes.

489
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,033
I wanted to analyze it.

490
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:25,103
- Again.
- Okay.

491
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,605
I'm sorry for the mess!
Look what I've done.

492
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,359
It doesn't matter, my love.
Do you want a cup of coffee?

493
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:32,986
Yes. Thank you.
- Okay.

494
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:37,340
What have you found?

495
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:43,121
There's something strange.
This man, Guido Bermúdez,

496
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,558
is vegetarian, vegan.

497
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:51,629
Everything he buys is organic.
He eats tofu and that stuff.

498
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,608
But, now

499
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,843
there's something
I don't understand.

500
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,305
It's the napkin found
in the crime scene.

501
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:06,328
Tell me why a strict vegan

502
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,022
was at a place
like Chicken Brothers and Co.?

503
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:12,917
Don't you think it's strange?
