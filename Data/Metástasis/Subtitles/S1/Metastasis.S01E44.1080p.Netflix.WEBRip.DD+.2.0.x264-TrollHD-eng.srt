1
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:27,962
Hello?

2
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,881
Alright. Yes.

3
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,431
Come on, come on!

4
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:40,641
Quick!

5
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,937
Mario.

6
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,271
Are you okay?

7
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,648
Grab him there.

8
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,025
Grab him hard.

9
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,099
Doctor, this man needs help too!
He's dying!

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,870
Let's go.

11
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,790
Come on, let's go.

12
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:05,958
Calm down.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,504
Adrenaline!

14
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,160
Hey, man, I need help here!
Mario needs assistance!

15
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,079
Prepare the defibrillator,
nurse. Quick!

16
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,626
Hey, a little help over here.
I don't know what to do.

17
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,186
Quick, quick!

18
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,775
Stand by!

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,359
Hey, man, what do I do?

20
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,238
Come on!

21
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,993
Man, please. Help me!

22
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,990
28.05.

23
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,912
Any news from them?

24
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,648
I don't know.
What about Jose?

25
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,233
Let's be clear on this,
Mosquera.

26
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,293
If anything happens to Jose,

27
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,671
I'm out of here for good.

28
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:36,198
You know?
Don't count on me.
What'll you do?

29
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,827
I said 28.05.
Don't you trust me?

30
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,932
28.10.

31
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,560
Walter.

32
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,324
I need you to pay attention.

33
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,160
Mosquera,

34
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,645
you just don't seem to care,
do you?

35
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:11,358
My brother-in-law keeps talking
about driving out
to Chicken Brothers and Co.

36
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,003
I can't stop him any further.

37
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,655
He's eventually
going to find someone else
to take him out there.

38
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,549
So have you cleared it out?

39
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,326
Is it presentable,
does it look normal?

40
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,095
Mosquera.

41
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,206
I should be the one
to take him out there.

42
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,560
Why aren't you paying attention?

43
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:33,047
Can you just run it
up the chain of command, then?

44
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,899
Hey, I'm talking to you!

45
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,964
See anything suspicious?

46
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,886
Do you see anything unusual?

47
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,596
No.

48
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,265
Not yet.

49
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,811
Well, then, should we go?

50
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,648
You got someplace to be?

51
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,342
It's like the third time
you've asked me that.

52
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,279
No. No, I'm sorry.

53
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,515
It's just that these things
make me a little nervous.

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,226
I'm just curious
what the next move is.

55
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:31,563
Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

56
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,275
Keep on the lookout,
see what happens.

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,570
That's my job.
They pay me to wait.

58
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,714
Everything people believe,

59
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,425
that cops are always shooting

60
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,719
or on a speedboat.

61
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,123
Or maybe looking
at the drug dealer models.
No, sir.

62
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,310
Watching too much TV lately?

63
00:04:56,047 --> 00:05:01,010
Henry, any news
about what happened
with the Mexican cartel?

64
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,599
In the news here
you only see soccer,
heists and gossip.

65
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:11,562
What about the face
of the Virgin
that appeared on cornbread?
See that?

66
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,248
We get those too.

67
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,127
No, the thing is

68
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,738
the media here in Colombia
don't actually

69
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,340
pay much attention to anything

70
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,033
having to do with Mexico,
you know?

71
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:28,204
They treat that
as ordinary crimes.

72
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,208
But I found out about something
brutal that happened in Mexico.

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,018
Really? What was that?

74
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,131
Some big killing
within the Tapatío cartel.

75
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,676
They seemed to wipe out
the whole thing.

76
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,888
They were killed
among themselves.

77
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,532
And that cartel, Tapatío,

78
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,727
has the most interest here
regarding methamphetamines.

79
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,996
So any minute now,

80
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,066
these people
will start making their moves.

81
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,667
We just have to wait.

82
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,424
Hey, Walter.

83
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,218
So?

84
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,412
Won't you ever tell me
what happened to your face?

85
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,664
No, I'd rather
not talk about it.

86
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,585
No, that's really not the idea.
Imagine.

87
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,338
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like a rotten
passion fruit,

88
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,856
and he thinks

89
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,858
we're not going to discuss it?

90
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,719
Buddy, I'm concerned.
Understand that.

91
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,447
Once I had a friend, Hernández.

92
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,725
He had a gambling problem
just like you.

93
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,686
But I know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

94
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,496
You know he managed?

95
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,457
He spoke, spit it out.

96
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,917
So look...

97
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,128
I might be the guy to talk to

98
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:46,782
if you have any issue
with anyone, you know?

99
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,618
Henry, listen to me,
it's not because of you.

100
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,745
I don't want to talk about it
to you or to anyone else.

101
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,959
I'm done explaining myself
to everybody.

102
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,039
Hey, man.

103
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,458
Doctor!

104
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,153
You think
Mario needs some more blood?

105
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,088
It's in the refrigerator.

106
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,426
You want me to put that on him?

107
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,136
Go ahead.

108
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,121
You're 25 years old.

109
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,816
You weight 160 pounds,
5.9 height.
You drink, smoke...

110
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,668
You do drugs.

111
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,631
You're physically quite alright,

112
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,618
But we did find
you're allergic to eritromicin.

113
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,080
Which is not a problem
because here we have

114
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,848
cefazolin.

115
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,852
How do you know all that?

116
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,446
He thought of everything.

117
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,031
O-negative...

118
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,119
That's what Mario needs.

119
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,259
It's time to go.

120
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,180
What? What about Mario?

121
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,417
With his injury?
No travel. At least a week.

122
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,630
So we're just
going to leave him here?

123
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,024
No.

124
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,817
I'll send for him.

125
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,265
That chain
doesn't match the clothes.

126
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,651
- Thanks.
- My pleasure, buddy.

127
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,238
You know now.
Much water and rest.

128
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,071
We have to leave quietly
so as not to look suspicious.

129
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,993
There's a chopper waiting
about three miles from here.

130
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,871
What? We're going to Colombia
on a chopper?

131
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,140
To Guadalajara.

132
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,419
There's a hot shower
and clean clothes over there.

133
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:31,465
Our way out of Mexico
should be as legal
as our way in.

134
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,925
Good, because I'd be concerned
to commit a crime

135
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,819
in a foreign country.

136
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,991
You did well down here.

137
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,243
And you also proved a point.

138
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,689
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

139
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,209
On your own.

140
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,503
Don't you?

141
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,715
Fine, let's say I do.

142
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,679
But let Mr. White go.

143
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,305
Don't kill him.

144
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,022
You know that won't work.

145
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,316
Then you've got a problem.

146
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,942
I won't do this then.

147
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,197
Gustavo, listen.

148
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,307
Let's do what's best
for everybody.

149
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,120
Let's not get complicated.

150
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,413
Seriously.

151
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,030
Hey, Morgan. I'm here.

152
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,490
Did you do your homework?

153
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,283
I did.

154
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,826
Okay.

155
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,787
Well, dinner is in about 30.

156
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,330
I'll be right down.

157
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,037
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Cielo, sorry to call you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">at home, but I think</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you're not getting my messages.</font></i>

158
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:30,834
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Anyway, I've been thinking</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">about what we discussed...</font></i>

159
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,130
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I decided I can't do it.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know? I just can't.</font></i>

160

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">at nine in the morning</font>

161
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,987
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm here.</font></i>

162
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,851
Wow. That's sharp timing.

163
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,397
This is serious.

164
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,982
Come on in.

165
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,016
First, I want to tell you
that I get it.

166
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,976
This situation
with Walter's gambling

167
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,620
must be really hard for you.

168
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,037
It is.

169
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,039
Yes, it's been hard.

170
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,983
That's why
I would greatly appreciate it

171
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,943
if you would just
help me out here.

172
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,574
Yes.
I know what I'll do

173
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,216
to help you out.

174
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,327
So how's Walter?
Do you know anything?

175
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,012
Yes. He's okay.

176
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,555
Right. I'm glad.

177
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,670
What is this?
What are you doing?

178
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,672
This is a check by management
to give you

179
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,592
the transference I got
for the so-called inheritance.

180
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,819
What? I mean, why?

181
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,679
- I can't take your money.
- Why not?

182
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,725
No, because
the source of that money

183
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,576
doesn't look legal.

184
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,062
The gambling field
is kind of obscure,

185
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,190
and I don't want any part in it
because it wouldn't feel right.

186
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,250
It doesn't feel right.

187
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,253
Yes. Listen.

188
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,865
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm not judging you or Walter.

189
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,788
I'm just saying
I feel uncomfortable with it.

190
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,039
Wait a minute.
Let me remind you

191
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,974
that the reason why we're here

192
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,253
is because you had me
cooking your company books.

193
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,438
That sure is uncomfortable.

194
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,549
So when did wrong
suddenly become a problem
for you?

195
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,593
Now, hold on.
That was a one-time measure.

196
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,261
I took an honest attempt
to save my dad's company

197
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,863
and protect my employees.

198
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,197
No, wait a minute.

199
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,600
You're not focusing
on the problem.

200
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,869
You have a debt with the IRS,

201
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,730
and if you don't,
they'll come and get you.

202
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,916
And then they'll come get me.

203
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,192
If they audit on me,
they'll find out Walter and I

204
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,794
pay millions

205
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,614
for a business
with undeclared money.

206
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,991
So you'll be screwed
and I'll be screwed too.

207
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,467
Do you understand?

208
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,011
Of course I understand.

209
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,080
You know what I think?
You...

210
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,933
You're overreacting.

211
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,626
All these issues
with tax management

212
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,143
can be fixed, Cielo.

213
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,881
No! You're being
too light about this!

214
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,216
Let's say I take your advice.
I pay the IRS.
Then what?

215
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,094
Then you don't owe them
and we're all happy.

216
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,614
Right. What about the banks?

217
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,932
I'll lose my business
and my home.

218
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,826
The employees will be left out.

219
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,828
That's just not enough!

220
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,914
That won't change anything.

221
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,457
Okay.

222
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,275
Wait a minute.
Am I following this right?

223
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,278
You can't take the money,
but you could get more.

224
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,656
- Right?
- No, no. Wait.

225
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,034
No. Look, I appreciate
all the help you gave me.

226
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,621
Thanks, but the money
you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

227
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,432
Because it's not enough?

228
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,628
How can I speak
when you twist my words?

229
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,105
Ohhhhh....

230
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,549
- You know?
- This is not about that.

231
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,467
- This is about me
doing the right thing!
- No!

232
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,694
Are you blackmailing me?

233
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,614
No, no, no.

234
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,766
I feel like
I'm not explaining things right.

235
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,643
I think
you're explaining it fine.

236
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,270
And you know what?
It's not enough.

237
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,105
This isn't even half
of what I gave you.

238
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,250
I said I would pay.

239
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,237
If I'd known
that was your money,
I wouldn't have bought it.

240
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,799
I'll pay gradually, okay?

241
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,050
No, no, no. Gradually?

242
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,218
Yes.

243
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,038
If I go out to sell that car,
you know how much I'd get?

244
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,875
It would be little, Cielo,
but I'll pay you.

245
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,753
No, no,
I don't want you to pay me!

246
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:46,047
I want you to pay
these damn taxes!

247
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,607
I can't, Cielo, I can't.

248
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,484
Yes, you can!

249
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,572
I can't, and I don't want to.

250
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,116
You will want it.

251
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,952
And you will be able to!

252
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,606
I need to speak with Saúl.

253
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,149
This is Cielo Restrepo,

254
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,902
Walter Blanco's wife.

255
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,239
Yes, it's important and urgent.

256
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,703
Hey, Héctor.

257
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,564
Everyone, Héctor.

258
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,650
Mr. Eladio.

259
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,234
Paco.

260
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,112
César.

261
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,072
Reinaldo.

262
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,365
Fortunato.

263
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,826
And Luis Esteban.

264
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,207
All dead.

265
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,470
Your grandson, Joaquín,

266
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,972
he also got wiped out.

267
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,461
Do you want to know
who killed Joaquín?

268
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,036
Remember him?

269
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,066
He shot Joaquín
several times.

270
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,270
It was you and Joaquín.

271
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,440
That was all the family left.

272
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,488
Now the Salamanca Tapatío name

273
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,574
dies with you.

274
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,704
Look at me, Héctor.

275
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,709
I said look at me, Héctor!

276
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:30,725
Walter, I really appreciate
you doing this again.

277
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,228
I know you guys
must have your hands full
with the car wash.

278
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,997
No, no, no, not really.

279
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,234
The car wash
is Cielo's domain.

280
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,445
My pleasure to do this.
I'll take you
wherever you want.

281
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,965
And I like this! I think

282
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,701
it gives me a chance to see
a researcher's work up close.

283
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,512
It's interesting and exciting.

284
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,724
Like watching snails having sex.

285
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,311
And it's useful for me to...

286
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,980
I don't know, get distracted.

287
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,924
- From so much problems.
- Right!

288
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,695
Hey, Henry.

289
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,890
So any more news
on that thing in Mexico?

290
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,644
Same old thing. Bunch of animals
clawing each other's eyes out

291
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,605
over turf.
Not much more than that.

292
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,608
So you think all of them
were cartel members?

293
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,878
You sure are curious?

294
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:29,408
Listen, take a right
at this street here, will you?

295
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,552
No, isn't it to the left?

296
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,412
- No, no, no.
- No? But the chicken farm
is that way.

297
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,748
Right, but we're not going
to the chickens today.

298
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,875
We're going someplace else.
That's straight ahead.

299
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,352
What place?

300
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,755
There's this industrial laundry
I want to check out.

301
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,775
What laundry?

302
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,886
Well, it's owned by this
company,

303
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:53,391
a Spanish multinational
called Madrigal.

304
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,895
These kinds of companies
manage many businesses.

305
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,191
Among them, they own
Chicken Brothers And Co.

306
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:05,569
Sounds like a real shot
in the dark there.

307
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,948
I mean,
if it's such a big conglomerate

308
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,785
and there's shares everywhere,
then they've got

309
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,553
thousands of businesses.

310
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,580
So are you a private
investigator or something?

311
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:20,751
No, no, I'm just saying
because, I don't know,

312
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,629
that chicken business
doesn't sound good.

313
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,024
It usually doesn't sound good.

314
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,055
And also because I think
that place seems ripe

315
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,160
for some kind of

316
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,870
clandestine activity.

317
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,539
The storage units...

318
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,582
Want me to tell you

319
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,085
about clandestine businesses?

320
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,238
You know the same people
at Madrigal

321
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,031
are the owners of a factory
that manufactures

322
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:54,035
this state-of-the-art air
filtration system.

323
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,415
Guess who took delivery
of one of these systems
in Colombia.

324
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,142
Guido Bermúdez!

325
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,560
Really?

326
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,312
How about it? A chemist

327
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:08,799
who was in possession
of hand-drawn plans

328
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,819
explaining step by step

329
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,697
how to set up a meth super-lab.

330
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,308
And a day
before he was capped in the face

331
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,353
he see Gustavo Cortés
in his apartment,

332
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:24,690
ad he's the one
buying Madrigal these filters.

333
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,418
Not such a twisted idea, is it?

334
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,821
And you and me know
what a twisted idea looks like.

335
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:34,909
Well, I don't know why
I got this feeling, but...

336
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,162
I don't know,
I think I'd insist...

337
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,624
on researching the chickens
and not some laundry.

338
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,336
An industrial laundry
would be one hell of a place

339
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,271
to hide a meth lab.

340
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:51,134
You know why?
Because laundry's produce

341
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,345
very small odors
that can eclipse

342
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,598
all the chemical smells
and all that.

343
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,143
Here, make a right
on the next one.

344
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,417
This is it.

345
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,236
- Okay, just get in there.
- Aha.

346
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,238
- No, here, this turn.
- Here?

347
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,074
I'm sorry,
I just got distracted
with the conversation.

348
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,134
Then make a U-turn over here.

349
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,220
There, fine.

350
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,640
What ice-cream is
this?

351
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,852
It tastes like
nothing.

352
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:47,315
I was going to bring the usual,
but mom said
it had to be organic.

353
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,650
No, not the same at all.
Anyway,

354
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,544
this is a gift.

355
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,821
Don't judge an ice-cream
by its looks.

356
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,825
Honey,
can you handle one more visitor?

357
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,329
¡Walter!
The chosen driver!

358
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,014
Careful with the bollard.

359
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,559
How are you feeling, buddy?

360
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,670
Kind of feels
like one of those cones
they put on dogs

361
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,881
so they don't lick
their own balls.

362
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,218
Henry! Thank you
for the lovely image.

363
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,845
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry about all this.

364
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,322
I don't know what happened.

365
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,808
That guy
just came out of nowhere.

366
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,977
Actually, he didn't.
We both saw him coming
a mile away.

367
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,188
- What?
- You crashed him.

368
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,332
Anyway, these things happen.

369
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,275
The important thing
is nothing happened to us.

370
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,112
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

371
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:38,491
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

372
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,701
- Okay, mom.
- I'll take you.

373
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,178
No, forget it.

374
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,664
She's right.
It was a bit shortsighted of me

375
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,918
to ask me to take you
to all these places.

376
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:51,337
That's why I caved.
Took my hand off.

377
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,439
Wait, You caved?

378
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,400
I ordered me a gimp-mobile.

379
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,219
- That's not the name, Henry.
- Like a handi-van with a lift?

380
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,221
No, no, no.
It's got hand controls.

381
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,722
- On the wheel.
Right, right.

382
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,976
I sure hope
I don't have to use it
for too long.

383
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,479
And stop being
such a damn burden to everyone.

384
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,913
That's true.

385
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,876
Check if that's mine.

386
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,420
No! That's me, that's me.

387
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,464
What's that?

388
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,408
The laundry.
There's a problem...

389
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,427
Ice-cream!

390
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,763
Okay.

391
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,306
Taste that!

392
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,850
It's tofu, with miso and soy.

393
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,398
Ye, hello?

394
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,107
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Can you talk?</font></i>

395
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,277
I can hear.

396
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,112
That should be fine.

397
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,614
Okay, well...

398
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,310
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He doesn't own a gun.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">At least not one legally.</font></i>

399
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:51,230
And his home security system
is really bad,
so this should be easy.

400
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,733
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">If that's still the way</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you want to do things.</font></i>

401
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,005
Like I said, what's important

402
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,199
is that
I don't want anyone hurt.

403
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,911
All I want is for him
to write a check.

404
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,556
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's going to be fine.</font></i>

405
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,792
I've got my A-team
working on it.

406
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,836
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- I'll let you know.</font></i>
- Okay.

407
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,201
And you are?

408
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,983
Calm down.
Tell me what you want
and we can arrange it.

409
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,944
- Shhh.
- Easy, man!

410
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,546
This is easy.

411
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,298
What we're going to do

412
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:47,495
is do our best
to keep Estiwar happy.

413
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,038
- Who is Estiwar?
- Him.

414
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,265
Now you know him.

415
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,477
Estiwar, are you happy?

416
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,062
Right now I am,

417
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,482
but I could get unhappy.

418
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,151
So what could get you unhappy?

419
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,928
This little mofo
not doing what he's told.

420
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:08,349
Would that be good
for Mr. Silva?

421
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,033
I don't think so.

422
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,478
Alright, fox, look at me.
Look at me.

423
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,997
Did you get it? Great.

424
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,858
We're going to fill out
these payment forms.

425
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,130
Sign up.

426
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,802
You have a nice house.

427
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,579
Congratulations.
Such good taste.

428
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,849
Sign this.

429
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,142
Look, here.

430
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,670
You won't have to pay
one more dollar.

431
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:41,340
That amount is enough
to pay what you owe
to the IRS.

432
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,733
That's a check.

433
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,985
We'll pay the rest.

434
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,680
Because we know
you got a car, didn't you?

435
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,600
Well, that ride
will be on our name,
and everybody's happy.

436
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,327
Sign, please.

437
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,746
Cielo sent you, didn't she?

438
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,123
Doesn't matter who sent us.

439
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,026
The important thing
is we all must do
what we must do

440
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,170
as State citizens.

441
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,885
Sign up.

442
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,346
Sign up!

443
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,973
Fill out the form and pay up.

444
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,794
If you pay what you owe,
you know what you have.

445
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,439
Great.

446
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:25,760
Now the fingerprint
of the left finger.

447
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,763
Hey, Estiwar,
what's with the violence?

448
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,031
The man is cooperating.

449
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,158
Okay, the finger.

450
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,284
There we go.

451
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,663
Perfect.

452
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,790
See how easy that was?

453
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,835
Estiwar, are you happy?

454
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,295
I'm ecstatic.

455
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:48,407
Now all we have to do
is take these forms

456
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,009
to the IRS and pay up.

457
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,478
There, buddy.

458
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:43,813
Cool.

459
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,357
Does the clothes
have to be dirty?

460
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,750
No.

461
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,298
Was somebody cooking here?

462
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:59,037
Walter, you've been
out of commission four days.

463
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,331
Think we're going to shut down
the whole operation
just for you?

464
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,393
Who was it?

465
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,687
Who was here?

466
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,188
Do you really want to know?

467
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,022
- I'm going to kill no.
- No!

468
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:29,819
I got the grenade
and...

469
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,962
That's cheating!

470
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,423
Ouch!

471
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,633
Who's wining?

472
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,702
- Me, me!
- I'm wining.

473
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:41,038
Okay, Byron, great!
Have a chip here!

474
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,963
Keep it up
and don't make me lose, okay?

475
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,264
- Jose.
- What are you doing here?

476
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,810
I got nothing
to say to you, man.

477
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,770
No, no, please,
just a minute, okay?

478
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,815
- Jose, only for a minute!
Please.
- Get the hell out of my house.

479
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,817
- Get away!
- Please, listen to me.

480
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,361
- Shut up, they'll hear you!
- I'm sorry,
but you have to listen to me.

481
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:13,863
I know that you
have been cooking without me.

482
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:16,365
- That's right. So what?
- So what?

483
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,617
Isn't it obvious to you
what Gustavo is planning?

484
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,995
He's going to use you
to replace me, Jose.

485
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,039
He doesn't think
you need me anymore!

486
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:26,333
If you agree to replace me,
he will kill me.

487
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,878
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

488
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:32,631
You brought your brother-in-law
to our lab. Think!

489
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,776
Sorry, but that's not my fault.

490
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,302
You know what?
We're through talking.

491
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,763
No, Jose, Jose.
I'm begging you!

492
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,490
You've got to help me!

493
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,953
"You've got to help me"?

494
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,814
You remember last time
I asked for your help?

495
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,692
When I had to go cook
in Mexico?

496
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,403
You said, "I hope you end up
in a barrel in the desert."

497
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,488
So you know what?
Get out, Walter!

498
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,007
Get out of here!

499
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,128
- Walter, we're going.
- What? Let go of me!

500
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,713
We're leaving,
we're leaving now!

501
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,214
Calm down and lay down the gun.
Let's talk.

502
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,507
- Put your hands down.
- What do you want?

503
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,442
Just walk already!

504
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,571
You're done, Walter.

505
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,658
I've had it with you.

506
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,816
Do not show your face
at the laundry again.

507
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:17,502
Stay away from José Miguel.

508
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,089
Don't even try to phone him.

509
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,951
I hope you're listening
very carefully.

510
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,138
What if I don't?

511
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,639
Excuse me?

512
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,545
What if I don't stop
seeing Jose?

513
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,856
What'll you do?

514
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,275
Kill me?

515
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,553
If you could kill me,
I'd already be dead.

516
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,324
You can't kill me.

517
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,726
You can't kill me
because if you do

518
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,603
Jose wouldn't cook for you
anymore.

519
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,623
That's it, isn't it?

520
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,416
No matter how hard you tried

521
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,210
to turn him against me,

522
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,837
he still won't let you do it!

523
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:04,867
He will never, hear me out,
ever let you kill me!

524
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:08,386
Maybe for now,

525
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,056
but he'll come around.

526
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,169
Now I'm concerned
about the matter

527
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,005
- of your brother-in-law.
- What?

528
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,509
He is a problem
you promised to resolve.
You have failed.

529
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,262
Now it's left to me
to deal with him.

530
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,072
No! You can't!

531
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,490
Yes, I can!

532
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,910
And I will.

533
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,038
If you try to interfere,

534
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:37,066
this becomes
a much simpler matter.

535
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,837
I will kill your wife.

536
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,865
- I will kill your son.
- No.

537
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,616
I will kill
your infant daughter.

538
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,345
No.

539
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,423
Perfect, you know.
And I said you were my A-team.

540
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,483
This was really an act of God.

541
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,818
No accounting in that case.

542
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,486
Besides, it's done.

543
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,655
All taxes paid.

544
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,683
No, perfecto.
I just have to say, "Cielito,

545
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,352
the good news is
the IRS has been paid off.

546
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:58,563
The bad news..." Shit!
Well, thanks for nothing.

547
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,108
Hey, I told you,
you can't come in!

548
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,569
- Saúl.
- No, no. This is just great!

549
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,004
How did you find out?

550
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,757
Find out about what?

551
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:12,244
Boy, go, scram.
We'll talk later.

552
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,179
Out, get out!

553
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,889
What happened to you?

554
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,891
Saúl.

555
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,102
You told me about a guy.

556
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,504
This person that you said
could disappear me,

557
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:27,092
give me a whole new identity
and a new life.

558
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,610
Who is it?

559
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,861
- An eraser. That's it!

560
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,972
- What about him?
- I need him now!

561
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,641
Gustavo is going to kill
my whole family.

562
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,534
This is going worse and worse.

563
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,412
Come on, Saúl, please!

564
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,206
Yes, fine, alright.

565
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,251
Walter, you're aware

566
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,653
- that there's no
turning back on this, right?
- I know.

567
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,072
If you disappear,
it'll be forever.

568
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:51,091
Yes.

569
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,785
You can't contact anyone,
your friends

570
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,123
or your relatives.
Ever again. Understood?

571
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,434
Yes, yes, understood.

572
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,752
How are you going to sell this
to your wife and son?

573
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,063
Saúl, I have got no choice!

574
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,675
Walter, you're wanted
by some scary individuals.

575
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,777
Not to mention the law.

576
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:15,015
You're going to need
the deluxe service.
It's going to cost you.

577
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,866
How much?

578
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:19,602
The last quote I got
on the deluxe was 125 grand.

579
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,564
Each one.
He collects cash.

580
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:26,735
I don't care!
I've got the money!

581
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,295
Here you go.

582
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:35,785
This is a vacuum cleaner
repair company.

583
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:40,707
What'd you expect,
Haji's Quick-Vanish?

584
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,712
- Saúl, so what do I do?
- Easy, calm down.

585
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,340
You just call that number
and leave a message.
Tell them you need a new filter

586
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,568
for an extra strong MX..

587
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,111
An X what?

588
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,805
I wrote it
right on the other side.

589
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,557
He'll call you back
in five minutes.

590
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:02,187
How long does it take
for him to arrange?

591
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,647
The guy works fast.
I mean, that's the game here.

592
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,791
That's why, Walter,

593
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,028
you've got to have your family
packed and ready to go

594
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,963
before you make the call.

595
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,865
He'll tell you
where to meet him.

596
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,052
What about after that?

597
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,997
He'll put you up in a safe house
until everything is set.

598
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:25,043
But you have to bring the money.
He doesn't lift a finger
unless he's paid in full.

599
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,103
Right, okay.

600
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:31,400
Saúl...

601
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:32,609
Walter...

602
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,805
Can't say
it's been a pleasure, but...

603
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,365
Good luck to you,

604
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:40,476
- anyway.
- I need you to do
one more thing for me.

605
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,479
- Something else?
- Yes, Saúl, it's important.

606
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,231
Call Anti-Narcotics
and tell them that Gustavo

607
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,150
has a hit out on Henry,
my brother-in-law.

608
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,777
I can't do that!
I've got to go on living here.

609
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,322
Please!
Just call anonymous then!

610
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,407
- No, you call!
- Me?

611
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,884
Saúl, these people know me!

612
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,371
I go to their Christmas parties,
they can recognize my voice!

613
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,223
I'm not calling! No!

614
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,875
Please, Saúl!
Please.

615
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,644
I'm begging.

616
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:11,298
Henry doesn't deserve to die
for this. Please...

617
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:15,051
I can't even mention Gustavo
in a phone call.

618
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:18,555
Think about the consequences
with José.

619
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,490
But he has to know!

620
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,078
The best I can do

621
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,397
is call and let them know
of a possible attack.

622
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,107
- No mentioning Gustavo, okay?
- Okay.

623
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,834
I can say, I don't know...

624
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,612
They're coming back
to finish the job
that they botched.

625
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,905
- Right, right.
- But that's all.

626
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:39,409
- That's all.
- Fine, whatever you want!

627
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:43,179
And... Give me an hour.

628
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,686
Make that call in an hour, Saúl.

629
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,611
Saúl, thank you.

630
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,654
This is not enough.

631
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,447
There's money missing here.

632
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:45,783
Where's the rest of the money?

633
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,540
Where's the rest of the money?

634
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:53,750
Damn it!

635
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,693
- Walter!
- Down here!

636
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,883
Where's the money

637
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,869
What about the call
about us talking right now?

638
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,723
Where's the rest?

639
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,125
Cielo, where's the rest
of the money?

640
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,101
Cielo, where's the money?

641
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,604
I gave it to Ernesto.

642
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,356
What?

643
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,734
I did it for us, I swear!

644
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,927
- I swear
I did it for the family!
- No!

645
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:25,031
You gave Ernesto our money?

646
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,934
I can explain!
I can explain everything!

647
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,830
No! No!

648
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:44,008
Walter...
