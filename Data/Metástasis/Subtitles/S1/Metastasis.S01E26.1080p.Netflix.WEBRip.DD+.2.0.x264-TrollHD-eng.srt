1
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,456
KDK-12 here, over.

2
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,249
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Have you arrived?</font></i>

3
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,751
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Report your location.</font></i>

4
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:28,654
Yes, I'm at 5km,
Verada Las Aguas.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,616
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hey Tovar, were there people</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">passing through there?</font></i>

6
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,619
Yes, somebody finally came
to visit the old women.

7
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,345
Ok, I'll go check it out, over.

8
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,230
Hello!

9
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,572
Doris!

10
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,748
Hello.

11
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,213
Hello, Doris.

12
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,226


13
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,946
(swarm of flies buzzing
in distance)

14
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,262
- Guevara?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> </font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> </font><i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> What is it, Tovar?</font></i>

15
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,823
Guevara, we've got a homicide.

16
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,975
Get over here
and bring backup, over.

17
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,942
Whoever is inside,
come out now!

18
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,381
Come out, slowly!

19
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,925
Show me your hands.

20
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,596
On your knees!

21
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,556
On your knees, do as I say!

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,002
Down, now!
Do as I say!

23
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,355
Slowly.

24
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,565
Do as I say!

25
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,647
Hello.

26
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,774
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I found the...</font></i>

27
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,303
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">divorce papers right </font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">where you left them, </font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">in the crib.</font></i>

28
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,739
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, well, you know best.</font></i>

29
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,283
It's what you wanted, right?

30
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,270
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Anything else?</font></i>
- Yes.

31
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,650
Do you have any thoughts about
how we're going to explain
this to Walter?

32
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,002
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He'll always be my son.</font></i>

33
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,613
Well, of course
he's still your son,

34
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,909
but what I mean is, what reason
are we going to give him
when he asks
why I want a divorce?

35
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,344
Well, I think he'll understand.

36
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,622
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I mean,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I think he saw it coming.</font></i>

37
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,308
He realized you weren't happy.

38
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,086
Well, of course he realized
I'm not happy!

39
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,839
He knows I give everyone
a fake smile.

40
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,466
But what are we going
to tell him?

41
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,802
I thought you said
it was for the best, right?

42
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,618
Ok, fine.

43
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,623
One more thing before you go.

44
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,900
On the child support worksheet,
you listed...

45
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,462
medical, dental, education,

46
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,907
transportation,
food, and clothing.

47
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,717
That's right, all of it.

48
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,011
Walter, no.

49
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,123
Cielo, you wanted me out
and I'm out.

50
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,126
But I will provide
for my family.

51
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,813
Not with that money!

52
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,713
You hear me?

53
00:04:55,838 --> 00:05:00,009
You would be making us
your accomplices!

54
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,969
Answer me this,
where do you think
we got the money

55
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,513
to pay our bills
these last six months?

56
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,534
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I have to go. Bye.</font></i>

57
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,706
Yes, sir, I was right.

58
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,235
There are three other houses
available to rent.

59
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,404
If you like,
we can ask for the keys
and go see them immediately.

60
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,157
No, that's not necessary.
I'll take this one.

61
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,619
No, unfortunately,
this one is a model home,

62
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,914
and it would be very difficult
to purchase it.

63
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,977
I like this one, just how it is.

64
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,546
This puts us in a tight spot.
Look, it just can't--

65
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,551
Friend, name one thing
in this world
that is non-negotiable.

66
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,476
Please put the breasts
in the upper tray.

67
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,787
Hand me some glasses, please.

68
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,814
- How many glasses, sir?
- Two.

69
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,320
Sandra, we have to clean
this machine every night.

70
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,322
- Okay.
- To be able to clean it,

71
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,784
you have to go to go
round the back
where there is a valve.

72
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,886
That valve has a red knob.

73
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,038
You have to turn it
to the right.

74
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,582
When the valve is pointing
towards you,

75
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,934
you can clean the machine, okay?

76
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,273
Seriously, José,
you made this, bro?

77
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,125
Yeah.

78
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,215
Heisenberg can suck it.

79
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,384
José sure can cook!

80
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,372
Look man, it's totally clean.
It's not at all cloudy or dirty.

81
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,599
You're the man.

82
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,336
Now I get why women dream about
blue eyed boys.

83
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,895
Yeah.

84
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,231
And the size, man.

85
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,385
If you put a stick on it,
it'd be like a lollipop.

86
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,487
Try it, bro.

87
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,270
- Are you sure, man?
- Try it.

88
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,147
If you want, I can take it home
and do it there,

89
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,108
because I feel kind of bad
with you being in rehab and all.

90
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,043
No, it's alright.

91
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,921
I can watch.

92
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,590
I can cook and I can watch.

93
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,677
Are you sure?

94
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,414
Go for it, man.
I tried it last week,

95
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,809
and I'm still coming down.

96
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,253
But go easy.
In moderation.

97
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,328
Wow, dude.

98
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,121
Wow.

99
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,194
Hey, man, don't go jumping out
of the window, OK?

100
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,033
That's enough, dumbass,
you're getting the floor dirty.

101
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,511
This guy's hair is falling out.

102
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,053
Okay, enough!

103
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,248
Bow to me,
ladies and gentlemen,

104
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,391
for I am the Lord of the Dance!

105
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,604
Wow, it's so good, dude.

106
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,840
- I want more!
- No, you've had enough.

107
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,651
That's all.

108
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,738
Dude, I feel like...

109
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,435
someone took out my brain
and turned it into vapor.

110
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,828
I told you it was the shit, man.

111
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,541
Yeah, it's like anthrax, dude.

112
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,817
Don't be dumb,
that's something else.

113
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,336
Okay, now what?

114
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,007
Are we going to talk business?

115
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,160
What do you mean?
That wasn't the plan.

116
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,079
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

117
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,516
Really, I do.

118
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,380
But it's not going to be
like it was before.

119
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,591
I promise you guys,
it'll never be like that again.

120
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,845
What's so different
this time around?

121
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,475
The difference is
this time we'll sell it safely.

122
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,368
We'll sell it smartly.

123
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,895
We won't get greedy,
or ambitious.
Not this time.

124
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,957
I don't know, man.

125
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,822
I still think about Gordo
from time to time.

126
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,592
That was really rough.

127
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,760
Yeah, but dude...

128
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,371
We have to keep going, right?
What else do we do?

129
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,434
If it's like Jose says,

130
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,669
and we don't get greedy
or anything,
this time around...

131
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,938
I'm in, dude.

132
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,231
What about you?

133
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,483
I don't know, man.

134
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,345
Last time
we started to push our luck.

135
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,097
I'd love to turn back time,
but...

136
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,866
That's exactly the point, dude.

137
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,203
We've done this before.

138
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,606
We're going to do it again,
but this time
we won't make any mistakes.

139
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,546
Look, step one:

140
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,906
we make an inventory of
everything we have.

141
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,716
OK?

142
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,302
You, Mono.

143
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,997
Go see Germán,
so he can fix up the bus.

144
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,516
Change the oil, maintenance,

145
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,644
lights, all of that stuff.

146
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,672
You know the police are
looking for any reason
to stop someone.

147
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,966
This time,
we don't give them anything.

148
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,886
We're going to be cautious
about everything.

149
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,696
On top of that,

150
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,973
we're going to get
one of those noise things,

151
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,476
that goes off when you leave
the key in the switcher,
you know what I mean?

152
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,811
One of those alarms
that go off
at the drop of a pin.

153
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,939
We need to ensure
the bus isn't just left
in the middle of nowhere.

154
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,858
Of course, man,
like what happened last time.

155
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,944
Exactly.
And you, Tripa,
are in charge of supplies.

156
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,157
I'm going to give you
a detailed, step by step list,
of what you need to buy.

157
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,510
OK? What do you say?

158
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,348
Okay.

159
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,518
Are you sure?

160
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,505
Shit, okay,
let's do it.

161
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:18,678
- Agreed?
- Ready to go, dude.

162
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,391
This time,
we don't need anyone else.
We're going to do it alone,

163
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,117
and we're going to do it well.

164
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,291
Okay, alright, then?

165
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,236
- Alright, dude.
- Hey, man.

166
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,339
Mauricio Mejía.

167
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,509
I know you.

168
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,971
It's a small world.

169
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,295
Do you want to talk about it?

170
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,505
Why?

171
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,883
Do I have a say in the decision?

172
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,119
Look, ironically,
I think from now on,

173
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,747
I'm going to have
a lot more time for you.

174
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,417
- Sure.
- I'm going to buy a car.

175
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,212
I can take you to and from
school every day.

176
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,882
So I don't have a say
in that decision either?

177
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:24,054
Better yet,
I can't go with Lucho
just because you feel guilty?

178
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,115
Yes, I feel guilty.

179
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,951
I am what I am, Junior.

180
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,187
You know what?
I would love to
change a lot of things,

181
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,331
but I can't. Here I am.

182
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,999
That's all there is to it.

183
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,610
Call me crazy,
or whatever you want.

184
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:42,906
But you know what?
I have a good feeling
about this.

185
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,991
I'm optimistic
about what's to come.

186
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,035
Good morning.

187
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,414
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Combo three is ready.</font></i>

188
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,024
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Combo three,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for table number four.</font></i>

189
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,819
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Half a roasted chicken,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">one hamburger...</font></i>

190
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,114
This will vibrate
when your food is ready,
and then you come
and collect it, OK?

191
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,716
Good morning, Sandra.

192
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,951
Good morning, Don Gustavo,
How are you?

193
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,078
Have you noticed
who's over there?

194
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,931
Yes.

195
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,628
Sir, I don't know,
but frankly I think
we should call the police.

196
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,255
I don't think
that will be necessary, Sandra.

197
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,900
They have done nothing wrong.

198
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,009
This order is for
table number 15.

199
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,820
Yes, sir, I'll take it now.

200
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,150
- Keep the change.
- Thank you very much, sir.

201
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,793
Good luck with your son, sir.

202
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,545
They get used to it eventually.

203
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,731
Good morning.

204
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,391
Professor Walter Blanco,
I presume.

205
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,159
Yes, that's me.

206
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,729
How are you?
- I'll come down.

207
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,075
Nice to meet you.
I'm Guido Bermúdez.

208
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,969
How are you?

209
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,454
- Are you my new
laboratory assistant?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,374
I suppose you want to know
my qualifications?

211
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,128
I printed my resume,
I can give it to you right now.

212
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:48,717
I printed it
in case you wanted to see it.

213
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,429
I graduated with a degree in
Chemistry from the Scientific
University of Colombia,

214
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,933
a masters in Science from
the same university and...

215
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,059
with an specialization
in Organic Chemistry.

216
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,787
My doctorate thesis is on...

217
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,414
Well... It's all in there.

218
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,671
"X-Ray Crystallography."

219
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,949
- Seriously?
- Yes.

220
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,119
I could talk for hours
about that subject!

221
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,304
I would love that, professor.

222
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,209
But look, what really makes me
curious is this...

223
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,980
This.

224
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,817
No, it's nothing, it's...

225
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:35,472
It's a pilot project
that I'm developing
in my free time, of course.

226
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:41,352
I have the theory that
everything has something
to do with the concentration
of chemical acid.

227
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,898
Because it requires
4,800 milligrams per liter,

228
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,985
but if it overheats
in order to get to that point,

229
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,112
the tannin will filter out,
and then what happens?

230
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,630
It's bitter, right?

231
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,299
It has a bad flavor.

232
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:59,329
For that reason, I've been able
to extract a very mild space,

233
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:04,501
in order to
to maintain the temperature
to below 92 degrees Celsius.

234
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,938
Do you want to try it?

235
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,648
Yes.

236
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,911
Thanks.

237
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,840
Mm.

238
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,370
This is the best coffee
I've ever had in my life!

239
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,555
It's organic coffee from Nariño.

240
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,791
You've got to give the mill
some credit too, right?

241
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,377
But thank you very much,
Professor.

242
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,146
Call me Walter.

243
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,547
- Guido.
- Yes?

244
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,757
What are we doing making
methamphetamine?

245
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,361
This is really good!

246
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,863
Thank you very much.

247
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,185
So, you say that,
with phenylacetic acid solution,

248
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,522
there are 150 drops per minute
during the first 10 minutes,

249
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,525
and then 90 drops
for the rest of the time, right?

250
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,296
Why is that?

251
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,991
Because diluting the phenol,
makes a layer of water and oil,
therefore...

252
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,284
A better extraction
of the benzene.

253
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,803
Exactly.

254
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,512
Of course, I prefer ether.

255
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,389
Of course.

256
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,457
I'll make sure
we have some tomorrow.

257
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,226
How nice!

258
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,212
Shall we celebrate?

259
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,482
Guido...

260
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,777
I've keep wondering...

261
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,612
how you ended up here.

262
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,142
Well, it's a question
I also ask myself.

263
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,536
It's strange.

264
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,859
Because you and I don't see
ourselves as criminals, right?

265
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,752
No.

266
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,005
Of course, it's a crime.

267
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:08,411
But I personally
consider myself to be
a libertarian.

268
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,873
I'm someone who thinks
that adults can do whatever
they want,

269
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,500
as long as
they aren't hurting others.

270
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,129
And, if I don't provide them
with what they want,

271
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,315
then someone else will.

272
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,218
The only difference is that,
with me,

273
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,054
they know exactly
what they're buying.

274
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,989
Without toxins.

275
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,825
Without additives.

276
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,312
Have you seen what
they're mixing it with
on the streets?

277
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,775
They're throwing in
fake ecstasy,

278
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,195
scopolamine,
horse tranquilizer,

279
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,173
not to mention brick dust,

280
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,409
- or gasoline that
they add to cocaine.

281
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,927
It's dangerous.

282
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,621
Here, on the other hand,
it's...

283
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:56,000
guaranteed quality,
and guaranteed purity.

284
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,560
Cheers!

285
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,480
Mm.

286
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,175
It's just...

287
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,777
I love the laboratory,

288
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,808
because the laboratory
is still magic to me.

289
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,827
Do you understand?

290
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,787
Chemistry is still magic.

291
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,984
And I wonder what would happen
if they took that away from us.

292
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,502
I completely agree.

293
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,714
Chemistry is still magic.

294
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,869
But, you didn't answer
my question.

295
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,637
How did you end up here?

296
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,724
It's nothing special.

297
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,504
I was going through
all the necessary steps
when you have a research grant.

298
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,814
Most of the time...

299
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,319
I was doing office work,

300
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,222
in public relations,
resolving all kinds of issues

301
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,975
that have nothing to do
with chemistry.

302
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,978
You must know how it is
in the academic world.

303
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,788
Yes.

304
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,817
What happened was,
they made me a job offer and...

305
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,464
Here I am.

306
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,672
In action.

307
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,428
I think the best way to explain

308
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,165
what happened to me is,
I opened my eyes
thanks to some verses...

309
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,417
by William Blake,
the English poet.

310
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,797
- Recite them.
- No.

311
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,924
No, it'd make me feel
embarrassed and pathetic.

312
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,194
No, please!

313
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,448
Go on!

314
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:38,019
Basically, they are three verses
of a poem that's called,
"Proverbs of Hell".

315
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,414
It goes like this:

316
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:46,610
"The road of excess leads
to the palace of wisdom.

317
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,492
Prudence is a rich,
ugly, old maid,

318
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:58,764
courted by incapacity.

319
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,752
He who desires but acts not
breeds pestilence".

320
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,010
"We are obligated to consumer
our life with strength today".

321
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,823
I have always wondered...

322
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,185
if it's really worth it
to always behave well.

323
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,621
Because in the end,

324
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,583
nobody will praise you for that.

325
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:29,737
But I believe
that the only way...

326
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,657
to feel true pleasure
is in life.

327
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,244
And it depends on
someone allowing themselves to,

328
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,304
before it's too late.

329
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,599
It's now or never.

330
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,019
Cheers!

331
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,485
Come on, Rosas.

332
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,012
Go commit a crime,
or steal something.

333
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,048
Hey, my love.

334
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,575
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Hi, babe.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Are you coming home for dinner?</font></i>

335
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,011
I'm working, María.

336
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,788
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Did you catch that guy</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">with the bus?</font></i>

337
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,458
Babe, if I had found him
I would be home already, OK?

338
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,421
- So--
Why don't you just
arrest him and question him?

339
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,648
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's not that easy, María.</font></i>

340
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,758
There are things called laws
and the constitution.

341
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,652
Blah, blah...

342
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:37,888
You don't know how much
I want to catch this asshole.

343
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,933
- It's that Rosas kid, isn't it?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Yes.</font></i>

344
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,911
I'm sure he has the bus.

345
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,272
But I don't know
where he's put it.

346
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,733
I just have to wait,
because I know he'll take me
to wherever he's hidden the bus.

347
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,236
So, I won't be coming home
any time soon.

348
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,631
I'm trapped here.

349
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,534
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hey, there's something</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">we had long forgotten,</font></i>

350
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,135
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I don't want to throw salt</font></i>

351
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,095
on old wounds, but...

352
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,081
I think I know someone who can
give you information on Rosas.

353
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,433
Who?

354
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,108
Hello, what is it?

355
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,594
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> What's up, brother?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">How's it going?</font></i>

356
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,471
Good, Henry.
How are you? What's up?

357
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,265
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Listen,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm sorry to bother you,</font></i>

358
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,185
but I have a quick question
for you.

359
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,078
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, of course, ask me.</font></i>

360
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,481
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, before anything,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I want to clarify that</font></i>

361
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:14,652
I'm asking you this simply
because I'm in the middle
of a case,

362
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,254
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and I'm at a bit of a dead end.</font></i>

363
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,283
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I want you to know that I don't</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">want to make you uncomfortable,</font></i>

364
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,635
or get you in trouble...

365
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,205
Ok, Henry,
can you just cut to the chase?

366
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,332
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You remember when you got lost,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">right?</font></i>

367
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,503
And I was trying to
track you down through...

368
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:36,715
Do you remember your
former student,
called José Miguel Rosas?

369
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,344
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay, well,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">you know that I know</font></i>

370
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,974
that once upon a time
that guy sold you some weed...

371
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,809
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Marijuana.</font></i>
- Henry.

372
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,537
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Easy, brother,</font></i>

373
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,315
don't worry,
I really don't care about that.

374
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,958
I know he sold you some.

375
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:58,321
If people start asking me,
"Is your brother-in-law
a pothead?"

376
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,658
I'll tell them,
"No, he hasn't tried it".

377
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,286
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Sorry, I'll get to the point,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">as you said.</font></i>

378
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:10,207
Do you by any chance know
if this José Miguel Rosas...

379
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,309
...has a school bus?

380
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,604
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know that this sounds weird,</font></i>

381
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:19,717
but any information you can
give me would really help me out
for the case.

382
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,637
Have you ever seen him driving
a school bus?

383
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,307
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The bus is blue and</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">has a silver band around it.</font></i>

384
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,892
- No.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- It's one of those buses...</font></i>

385
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:34,732
Well, it's not a huge bus,
or a little one,
it's medium size,

386
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,751
old, like from the 80's.

387
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,320
It's not one of those
modern buses we have nowadays.

388
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,989
- Why?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- It's a long story.</font></i>

389
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:48,120
But look, I'm absolutely certain
that guy stopped
selling marijuana,

390
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,765
to join the big leagues,

391
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,503
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and produce</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">crystal methamphetamine.</font></i>

392
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,730
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you understand?</font></i>

393
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:01,050
The guy is so nutty,
that he took
one of those school buses...

394
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,152
and adapted it

395
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:08,474
to make it into
a mobile laboratory
to cook methamphetamine.

396
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,159
What do you think?

397
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,744
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello?</font></i>

398
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,121
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello Walter?</font></i>

399
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:20,277
Dude, I think you've got
a gift for this.

400
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:23,322
You also know
about tools and all that.

401
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,658
You know what, dude?
You should invent a car

402
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,202
that run's off of water,
you know what I mean?

403
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,720
Yeah, bro.

404
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,414
We would make a killing
in New York.

405
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,750
Are you crazy?
Why is this out in the open?

406
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,852
Don't be stupid!

407
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,337
- Who is this guy?
- He's Heisenberg.

408
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,757
Is it ok?
Can you drive it?

409
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,966
Yes, of course, we changed
the oil and everything.

410
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,511
Good, we'll clean it
and I'll take it to the plain.
Give me a hand.

411
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,446
What's going on here, bro?

412
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,947
What's happening?

413
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,158
The cops are on my tail.

414
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,437
That's what's up!
Narcotics agents.

415
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,647
Surely you've heard
about them, right?

416
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,274
Well, they know
what's inside this bus,

417
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,443
and they're looking for it
right now!

418
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,086
Well, get it out of here, man.

419
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,072
- I don't want anything
to do with this.
- First we have to
destroy the evidence.

420
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,533
We'll burn it later,
but not here.

421
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,009
I'm closing up shop, bro.

422
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,787
Help me get it
out of here, then.

423
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,388
Listen to me.

424
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:15,098
Are you going to help me?

425
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:18,753
If I go down, we all go down,
including you.

426
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,338
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

427
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,401
Okay.

428
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,653
But not right here.

429
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,681
I know a guy that can make
this bus disappear off
the face of the earth.

430
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,408
No questions asked.

431
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,910
Call him.

432
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,459
Hey! What about José?

433
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,169
What about him?

434
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,390
Dude, guess what's going on.

435
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,434
Get me that address, Mono!

436
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,019
No, man...

437
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,255
I don't care,
just get it for me.

438
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,425
Look, this asshole wants to take
the bus and kick us out
of the business.

439
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,761
- I'll see you there.
Finally!

440
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,696
Where are we going?

441
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,825
Why the rush?

442
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,959
Excuse me, are you leaving?

443
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,216
I'm sorry, gentlemen,

444
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,703
but the tables are for
paying customers only.

445
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,972
Sandra, I'll handle this.

446
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,682
Yes, sir, excuse me.

447
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:45,005
- How can I help you?
- You know how.

448
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,843
I'll see you tonight
when I leave.

449
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,545
One hundred, two hundred,

450
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,407
three hundred,
four hundred,

451
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,384
five hundred.

452
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:21,308
Beyond recovery.

453
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,180
Do you know what that means?

454
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,208
Of course!

455
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,753
I want you to erase it from
the face of the earth.

456
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,129
When we are done,
nothing will remain.

457
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,607
So calm down, don't worry.

458
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,301
This is a very
gratifying business.

459
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,696
Only the benefactors remain.

460
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,600
Don't worry,
everything is under control.

461
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,493
Do me a favor,

462
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,353
- call me a taxi.
- Okay.

463
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,898
I'm going to go take a quick
look around inside, do you mind?

464
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,666
No, go ahead.

465
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,379
What the hell are you doing?

466
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,090
Me?

467
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,574
No, what are you doing here,
dumbass?

468
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,576
This is just as much mine
as it is yours

469
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,787
and you're not going to take it
away from me just like that!

470
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,769
What are you doing, Walter?

471
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,756
- We're fucked!
- Why, what are you doing?

472
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,549
- He's here!
- Who?

473
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,177
My brother-in-law, dumbass!
Close everything!

474
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,971
- Your bro-- ?
- Close it!

475
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,223
- Like that.
- Close them!

476
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,372
You brought him here!

477
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,483
You guided him right here,
you imbecile!

478
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,709
What do we do?

479
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,426
Be quiet.

480
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,314
He's at the door.

481
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,864
There are holes in the door.

482
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,346
José Miguel Rosas?

483
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,599
Come out!

484
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,296
It's better
if you give up yourself!

485
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,109
Come out now!

486
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:07,350
This is your last chance
to do it the easy way!

487
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,019
- Come out!
- Should I go out there?

488
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,537
No.

489
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,250
Okay.

490
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,718
Shit, the door!

491
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,031
What are you doing?

492
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,266
Why are you damaging
that vehicle?

493
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,894
Do you want me decapitate you
and bury you right here?

494
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,356
Do you want me to sell your
pick-up truck to pay me back
for the trouble you've caused?

495
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,400
Take it easy, buddy,
I'm a policeman.

496
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:59,711
Take it easy.

497
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,421
Who are you? Lower the weapon.

498
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,033
What is he doing?
Lower your weapon.

499
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,969
I'm the owner of this lot.

500
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,511
What do you know about this bus?

501
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,664
Better yet,
tell me what you're doing here,

502
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,958
and why you're trespassing
on private property,

503
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,878
and not only trespassing,
but damaging it.

504
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,814
Do you have a warrant?

505
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:24,928
I don't need a warrant,
because I have probable cause.

506
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,141
If you can see
bullet holes like these,

507
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,102
then a crime was committed
inside this vehicle.

508
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,164
Understood, Mr. Lawyer?

509
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,873
Well, maybe I'm not a lawyer,

510
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,151
but I have three children
who are lawyers,

511
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,486
and who are going to
eat you alive

512
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:45,448
in a court of law,
if you go even slightly
against regulation.

513
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,509
Also, let me tell you

514
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,120
that I'm willing to go to any
length to testify against you.

515
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,956
You know what?
Save yourself the trouble
and cooperate with me.

516
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,474
No fucking way!

517
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,501
You came here fishing
for something.

518
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,503
But you're disrespecting
my property,

519
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,923
you're disrespecting me,
and you're disrespecting
my business,

520
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,425
the business that
gave my children
their education.

521
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,262
As I already told you
they are lawyers.

522
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,946
You don't have any proof.

523
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,599
You're violating
the required process.

524
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,726
- You're going to leave
empty handed!
- Rosas!

525
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,786
Come out!

526
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,563
Tell him to bring the
warrant and then you'll talk.

527
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,482
- Tell him!
- Bring the warrant and
then we'll talk!

528
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:30,202
I'm going to count to three,
and you're going to come out.

529
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,636
One!

530
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,622
- Tell him!
- Two!

531
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,792
I already told you;
get the warrant,
then we'll talk!

532
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,436
Imbecile!

533
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:43,215
- What?
- I'll bring the warrant,
no problem!

534
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,426
I've waited a long time,
I'm not going to wait
any longer.

535
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,733
No, now we're fucked.
He's got us.

536
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,128
What do we do, Walter?

537
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:14,388
Vicky, get me the boss.

538
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,556
I know!

539
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,059
I say we ram him.

540
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,170
We run over that peace of shit
and then take off with the truck

541
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:23,755
- and make our escape!
- Shut up!
Stop talking bullshit!

542
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,697
Then what the fuck do we do?

543
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,143
Boss,
I'm going to need a warrant,

544
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,187
let's see if
you can help me with that.

545
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:40,772
Think of something, Walter,
think up something!

546
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,666
Thanks.

547
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,907
Do you have a plan?
Yes.

548
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,719
Yes, I have a plan.

549
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,305
What are we going to do?

550
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,400
I need your help.

551
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,667
Hello?

552
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,252
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Is this Mr. Henry Navarro?</font></i>

553
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,962
Yes.

554
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,780
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Sir, we're calling you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">from the Transit Police.</font></i>

555
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,075
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Is your wife's name</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">María Restrepo?</font></i>

556
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,592
Yes, why?

557
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,161
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm sorry to inform you,</font></i>

558
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,038
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but she has been</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">in a car accident.</font></i>

559
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,056
How is she?

560
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:41,724
What's her status?

561
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,849
You're going to have to start
paying me more for this, Saul.

562
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,035
I know it's ugly, Panchita,

563
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,412
but it had to be done.

564
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,185
Emergency room?

565
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,836
- Down the hall, to the right.
- That way?

566
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,344
- Where is the emergency room?
- In the back, to the right.

567
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,957
Mrs. María Navarro?

568
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,825
- Hello?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Hey, babe.</font></i>
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I just got home.</font></i>

569
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,885
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Should I make us some dinner?</font></i>

570
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,345
How are you, babe?

571
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,139
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry, what's wrong?</font></i>

572
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,724
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Henry...</font></i>

573
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,643
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Babe...</font></i>

574
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,857
I already told you that
you can't kill Walter Blanco

575
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,151
until I finish my business
with him.

576
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,629
You have to wait.

577
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:23,781
I know he betrayed
your cousin Tuco.

578
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,784
But he wasn't the one
who killed him.

579
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,954
The one who pulled the trigger
was a narcotics agent.

580
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:34,350
This is my territory.

581
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:37,587
I decide who can
and can't be touched.

582
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,924
As a sign of respect
to the cartel,

583
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:46,346
I have decided that
you can go after him.

584
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,239
His name is Henry Navarro.

585
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,770
I hope his death leaves you
feeling satisfied.
