1
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,587
This, the chemistry,
is my realm.

2
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,173
So I am in charge of this place.

3
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,637
<i>I cook,
you deal with the street.</i>

4
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,407
As far as our customers go,
I don't want to know anything about them.

5
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,726
I don't want to see them. I
don't want to talk to them.

6
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,480
<i>This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.</i>

7
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,441
<i>I'm invisible.
Absolutely invisible.</i>

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,239
- Whatever, professor.
- And one more thing, no more bloodshed.

9
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,243
From now on, no matter what happens,
no more violence.

10
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,497
Are you okay?

11
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,248
You don't have to stay.

12
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,585
I like to be with you.

13
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,340
Right,
but maybe you have things to do.

14
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,429
Actually,
it would make me feel better if you left.

15
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,268
You know, for the baby...

16
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,188
For Junior.

17
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,524
I'd like you to be there when
he gets home from school.

18
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,901
Don't you think that's better?

19
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,447
- As you wish.
- Yes.

20
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,366
You'll call me when
you're finished?

21
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,910
Yes.

22
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,251
I haven't seen a check from
Marcela. Do you know about that?

23
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,380
Yes... Yes,
I got it. It came last week.

24
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,625
I put it into my credit account,
I forgot to tell you.

25
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,551
Good. That's good.

26
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,428
- So call me.
- Yes.

27
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,821
Could you not deposit this until Monday,
please?

28
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,698
Sure, no problem.

29
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,409
Mr. Walter,
call us if the discomfort's too much.

30
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,453
That's why we're here.

31
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,455
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

32
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,171
<i>If a chemical reaction
take place gradually,</i>

33
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,716
changes in energy are equal.

34
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,721
You don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

35
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:42,473
For example, when rust collects

36
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,102
on the underside of a car.

37
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:54,944
But let's just say...

38
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,281
If a reaction happens quickly,
otherwise armless substances

39
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,619
can interact in a way that generates
enormous changes of energy.

40
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,957
Great bursts of energy.

41
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,215
Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

42
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,138
Hint, hint.

43
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,974
Like an explosion?

44
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,266
Right.

45
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,603
Explosions are an
excellent example

46
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,108
of chemical reactions
happening almost instantaneously.

47
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,734
And...

48
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,407
Mercury fulminate...

49
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,285
is a prime example
of an explosive that,

50
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,165
the faster they undergo change,

51
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,668
the more violent the explosion.

52
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,713
So open your books
on chapter seven.

53
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,736
Are you okay, professor?

54
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,321
Would you like something?
Want me to call someone?

55
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,866
No, no, no. It's fine, Hugo.

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,542
Don't worry,
professor. Don't you worry.

57
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,544
I'll take care of this.

58
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,005
Might as well have a rest.

59
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,631
Thank you.

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,640
When you don't let me in,

61
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,727
when you don't tell
me what's going on,

62
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,855
I feel like you don't want me near you,
and it hurts.

63
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,191
It really hurts.

64
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:01,112
I feel like you don't even
want me around sometimes.

65
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,654
No, please.

66
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,117
And besides, you leave,

67
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:09,954
- and we don't know where you are.
- Yes, dad, we don't know.

68
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,082
Walter, is there anything else
you're holding back from your family?

69
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,876
Look, speak calmly.

70
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,923
It's nothing. It's just that...

71
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,217
I's just that I
like to be alone.

72
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,263
And it's not about you.

73
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,807
It's not that I don't
want to be with you...

74
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,977
It's just...

75
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:35,020
That's it, I like to be alone.

76
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,856
In silence, I mean.

77
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,276
Not to talk at all
about anything.

78
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,071
And especially,
not to have to listen to anyone.

79
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,866
Sometimes it bothers me.

80
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,745
Well, Walter, alone time can be
helpful for some types, you know?

81
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,877
But I think your family would
have more peace of mind

82
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,300
Well, then...

83
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:09,554
Well, sometimes after class

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,684
I like to go for a walk.

85
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,104
One, or a couple of times a week,
it depends.

86
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,983
For instance, the weather.

87
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,406
I usually go to
the National Park.

88
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,991
I really like that park

89
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,243
because...

90
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:35,414
Well, it's huge, it's green.

91
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>And I just get carried
away by that sensation.</i>

92
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,428
<i>Like...</i>

93
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,890
<i>I feel I'm free
watching the sky,</i>

94
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,728
<i>the green trees,
to feel the breeze.</i>

95
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:04,026
<i>It feels like nature</i>

96
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,654
<i>is becoming very
therapeutic for me.</i>

97
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,312
What's up, dude?

98
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:43,190
- What is it?
- I'm dizzy, really dizzy.

99
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,859
- I need air.
- Come here. Sit down, sit down.

100
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,195
- I can't breathe.
- Wait--

101
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,947
Okay, okay.

102
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,408
I feel like I'm burning inside.

103
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,412
Breathe in, breathe. Calm down.

104
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,830
Better?

105
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,208
- Okay?
- Yes, a little.

106
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,347
When were you going to tell me?

107
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,976
- Tell you what?
- Cancer. You got it, right?

108
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,777
- How do you know?
- Because my grandma had one of those...

109
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,363
dots on her,
to target the radiation.

110
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,035
Professor,
I'm your partner, man.

111
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:40,747
You should have told me. That's not right,
man.

112
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:46,711
What stage are you?

113
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,964
Three-A.

114
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,510
It got to the lymph nodes.

115
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,602
How bad was she
when they caught it?

116
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,396
Bad enough.

117
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,152
How long?

118
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,281
Seven months and
four days exactly.

119
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,492
I was always by her side.

120
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,625
I get it now.

121
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,088
That's why you're
doing all this.

122
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,011
You got a problem with that?

123
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,888
I don't know. You tell me.

124
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,102
Are you going to be
able to finish the batch?

125
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,772
What is it?

126
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,568
No.

127
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,778
No, I can't. You'll have to.

128
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,031
- Me?
- Yes, José, you.

129
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:03,205
You're the great cook.
Mr... Cappuccino?

130
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,417
- Espresso.
- That's it.

131
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,503
You can do it. Go.

132
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,428
If you need anything,
I'll be right out here.

133
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,355
Next time, put an ice pack

134
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,233
on your head during chemo.

135
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,527
My grandma said
it helped her a lot.

136
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,773
- What's up, Gómez?
- Hey.

137
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:18,322
What, another gift? Come.
I was going to say, Gómez,

138
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,700
that even if you give me
present or stuff like that,

139
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,827
I'm not giving anything to you,
okay?

140
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,791
That's the one we
found at El Páramo.

141
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,585
Do you have the report?

142
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,388
That's not true.

143
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,265
What is it?

144
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,894
It was right here.

145
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,314
What does it say?

146
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,818
Chemical Laboratory,
Los Monarcas School.

147
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,237
Doesn't your brother-in-law
Walter work there?

148
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,887
We were supposed
to start at three.

149
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,808
Calm down,
everything's five. It's all good.

150
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,645
Prepaid cell phone. Use it.

151
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,276
Ok, look.

152
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,152
There you go.

153
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,573
- How much is this?
- Two and a half grand.

154
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,033
- Is that all?
- No, not all.

155
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,787
1,500 yours, 1,500 mine.

156
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,872
Minus 25 bucks for that phone.

157
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,499
How much meth did you sell?

158
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,335
Nearly an ounce.

159
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,714
Last time I checked,
there were 16 ounces

160
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,592
to a pound.

161
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,595
Did you smoke the rest?

162
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,890
You know what? I've been out
there all night slinging crystal.

163
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,478
You think it's cake moving a
pound of meth one tenth at a time?

164
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,354
And then there are
those who buy less

165
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,482
because sometimes
they just ask for a dose.

166
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,819
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

167
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,322
What do I look like? Pablo Escobar? No,
man

168
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,407
- Look, José Miguel...
- José.

169
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,034
You have no idea what
I've been going through.

170
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,120
I am breaking the law here.

171
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,997
I could go to jail.

172
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:18,502
For this? This return
is too little for the risk.

173
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,838
I need more.

174
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,923
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound tonight.

175
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,884
No, professor. You know what?

176
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,470
You may know a
lot about chemistry,

177
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,682
but you don't know
jack about slinging dope.

178
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,809
Maybe not.

179
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,812
But I'll tell you,
I know a lack of motivation when I see it.

180
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,814
I'm really good at that.

181
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,568
We can't stick to crumbs, man.

182
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,363
You've got to be more imaginative,
think big.

183
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,116
We have to move our product in bulk,
wholesale.

184
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,703
How do we do that?

185
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,038
Well,
I don't know. Maybe get a distributor.

186
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,707
Exactly.

187
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,335
That's what we need.
We need a distributor now.

188
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,880
- Do you know anyone like that?
- Yes, I do.

189
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,382
I mean I used to.

190
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,343
Until you killed him. Remember?

191
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,929
So who took El Loco's place?

192
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,725
As far as I know,
the path was free for the Mexican, Tuco.

193
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,769
Then we got to the Mexican.

194
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,188
Tuco? Yes, right.

195
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,106
So we just go over
to his door and say,

196
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,025
"Hey,
old Tuco. I came with some meth."

197
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,945
He'll let us right in.
Even offer us some wine.

198
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,072
Hey, that's not an attitude.

199
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,617
Listen, Tuco's O.

200
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:36,371
That man is dangerous.
Don't you understand?

201
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,917
Mexicans have been doing
this for much longer than us.

202
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,812
They already have their cooks, and they
have suppliers. They won't be interested.

203
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,672
Nobody produces the
stuff as purely as we do.

204
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,925
We have the best product.

205
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,390
Okay, let's say I got for it.

206
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,561
Okay? We take
the risk. Then what?

207
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,481
You need an intro. You
need someone to vouch.

208
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:08,570
If you have no contacts,
you're nothing, like in everything.

209
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,935
So how did you get to El Loco?
Who introduced you to him?

210
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,449
- Well, Emilio.
- There you go.

211
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,993
But that's because Emilio
and I played soccer as kids.

212
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,496
And we can't talk to him either because,
well,

213
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,999
- you might remember--
- Right, fine, okay.

214
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,337
Listen, professor, listen.

215
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,215
Let's not get involved.

216
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,469
Why can't you just be
satisfied with the way it is?

217
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:36,139
I mean, we're making money,
and you should be happy.

218
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,392
Jesus! Just grow
some fucking balls!

219
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,445
Okay, Shall I wait until Monday,
Mr. Blanco?

220
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,031
Yes, please.

221
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,365
- Okay.
- Thanks.

222
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,075
Take care.

223
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,770
Professor.

224
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,110
Thank you, Hugo.

225
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,292
- Hey, Walter.
- Hey, Carmen.

226
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,047
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.

227
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,757
Someone's here for you.

228
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,679
- Hi there.
- Henry?

229
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,390
- Let me know if you need anything.
- I will.

230
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:52,859
Man, that chick got an ass.

231
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,986
- What's up?
- How are you?

232
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,238
- Okay, and you?
- What are you doing here??

233
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,992
Well, I had some questions I
wanted to run by you, work-related.

234
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,411
Are you okay?

235
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,663
Yes, yes, yes. Go ahead.

236
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,041
Okay.

237
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,669
Do you recognize this?

238
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,928
- No.
- No?

239
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,640
That was used to cook meth.

240
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,600
We found it on the outskirts

241
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,645
like 25 miles
right after Páramo.

242
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,481
And the weirdest thing of all

243
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:37,154
is the old label: "Lab,
Los Monarcas School."

244
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,490
I can't believe it.

245
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,827
I don't understand how
that came from here.

246
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,954
I was hoping you could help me.

247
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,622
We found this mask

248
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,540
near the same
place where we found

249
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,542
a car belonging to
one of our snitches.

250
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,004
- Snitches?
- Yes, one of our confidential informants.

251
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,422
Domingo Molina, aka "El Loco".

252
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,800
Went missing a while back.

253
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,303
We're pretty sure he's chopped up
in little pieces and fed to the buzzards.

254
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,889
That's why you
should be very careful

255
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,517
where you buy sausages.

256
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,311
Listen.

257
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,857
Have any of these masks
gone missing lately in the lab?

258
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,376
No, I mean, not that I know of. I'll
need to take a look at that inventory.

259
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,238
Because for a while... Want
to see it? I have a copy here.

260
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,199
- Sure.
- Sure.

261
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,958
You mind if I take a
look at your storeroom?

262
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,960
Not at all, no.

263
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,339
Has anyone else got keys?

264
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,799
Yes.

265
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,053
The Science faculty, Carmen,

266
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,763
the janitor

267
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,183
the vice principal and me.

268
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,019
- How about students?
- No, not at all.

269
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,812
- I should hope not.
- No.

270
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,148
Do any know where you keep them?

271
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,941
I don't think so.

272
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,860
I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway.

273
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,867
Come in.

274
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,958
I know they're your students,
but do not underestimate them.

275
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,962
That's the worst
mistake you can make.

276
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,383
Look, I know cases where the
least expected person... bam.

277
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,385
So keep your eyes open.

278
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,068
Are there any more of these?

279
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,612
No, only those there.

280
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,824
But you need three, right?

281
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,289
Well.

282
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,584
Glassware looking
a little sparse.

283
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,461
Is it?

284
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,131
Just look...

285
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:05,260
Two test tubes missing here.

286
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,721
A couple of Erlenmeyer
flasks at least.

287
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,682
The flasks are complete.

288
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:17,730
And these balls
with round bottom...

289
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,357
How much do these hold?

290
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,111
500.

291
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,948
You need a big one,
5,000 milliliter.

292
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,034
Meth heads love to brew in that.

293
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,165
Won't you answer that?

294
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,543
Answer.

295
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,172
Surely it's not important.

296
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,842
What if it's Cielo and
she needs something?

297
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,885
Answer, man.

298
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,887
I'll hang around here.

299
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,685
- Hello?
<i>- Professor, it's me. Bad time?</i>

300
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,606
Yes.

301
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,733
<i>You know that Mexican
we were talking about, Tuco?</i>

302
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,736
Turns out I'm here
with my boy Tripaseca.

303
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,989
He was in the same
cellblock with him,

304
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,326
<i>They stayed in touch and
are friends. So we got our in.</i>

305
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,329
Tuco agreed to see me,
so we're waiting.

306
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:19,000
We're hauling a pound
to the dude right now.

307
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,212
Okay,
then. Thank you very much for calling.

308
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,381
Same to you.

309
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,303
The doctor.

310
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,097
It's amazing. The people from
the hospital are very solicitous.

311
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,016
They call me every
day to know how I am.

312
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,561
That's great.
- It is.

313
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,564
Look, buddy,

314
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,484
the last thing I want to
do is get you in hot water,

315
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,446
but some meth monkey
had a feeding frenzy.

316
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:53,492
You got to keep a better
watch over your turf.

317
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,247
We don't want people

318
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,665
to start wondering about you,
right?

319
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,428
What's you think? That I was
going to read your rights or what?

320
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,432
- No...
- That was funny.

321
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,229
Listen, that woman...

322
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,031
So you're sure you're
tight with this guy?

323
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,574
Absolutely.

324
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,619
Yo, man.

325
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,666
Hey, what's going on?

326
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,380
It's Pedrito, Tripaseca.

327
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,765
Okay.

328
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,059
Maybe this isn't such a good idea,
yo.

329
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:04,855
Come on, Jose. Man, trust me.

330
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,278
What did I say? See that?

331
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,255
So what now?

332
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,090
Tuco's waiting for us.

333
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,232
Clean.

334
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,207
Hey, I said easy!

335
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,173
What's up, Tuco?

336
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,097
No love.

337
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,559
What's it been?

338
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,603
Like a year since
you've been released?

339
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,318
- This your boy?
- Yes, that's Jose.

340
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,071
The dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

341
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,864
Hey, man.

342
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,408
Let's see it.

343
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,867
Show me.

344
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,177
Come on.

345
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,804
No worries, man. I'm no cop.

346
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,015
What kind of idiot
would do that?

347
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,352
Hit it.

348
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,204
Fuck me!

349
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,833
This kicks like a mule
with his balls in duct tape.

350
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,836
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

351
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,714
Bullshit!

352
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,508
Where'd you get it?

353
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,052
- Who you working for?
- No one, man.

354
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,765
I mean, I have a partner that I cook with,
but that's it.

355
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,436
He does crystals.

356
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,688
That's good news.

357
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,858
We got a deal.

358
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,194
See? I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

359
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:04,243
Cool,
but we still haven't said how much.

360
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,496
How much?

361
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,140
Well,
this shit is of much better quality

362
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,666
than everything
you get on the street.

363
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,542
How much?

364
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,629
25 grand for the pound.

365
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,547
What?

366
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,758
At a single dose for
powder meth on the street?

367
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,678
Come on, boy.

368
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:26,516
Well,
that's the street in the market.

369
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,933
I'm the market.

370
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,646
Besides, there's missing.

371
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,858
I weighed that. There
should be a pound.

372
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,985
It's a joke. Fine.

373
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,948
Well.

374
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,742
Thanks for coming.

375
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,786
No, no, no. Dude,
where are you going?

376
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,581
Just a second,
Tuco. You didn't give me the money.

377
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,124
Later.

378
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,631
Later? You expect me to
stay with 25 grand in credit?

379
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,299
Don't you trust me?

380
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,135
No, let's not get dramatic, man.

381
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,305
But Tuco,
you know business isn't handled like that.

382
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,183
You're calling me useless
for not handling my business?

383
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,435
- Hey, what's up with him?
- Easy, easy.

384
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,936
Tuco's good for it.

385
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:18,817
I don't need your punk
ass to vouch for me!

386
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,195
Then I'm taking it.

387
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,365
No,
I'm not doing business like this.

388
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,866
God luck.

389
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,873
Calm down, boy, calm down.

390
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,668
It was a joke,
my friend. I'll pay you.

391
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,926
Do you really want your
money up front? I'll give it to you.

392
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,344
Alright.

393
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,692
Here.

394
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:18,294
Man, hold it.

395
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,337
Hold it, man!

396
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,364
Hugo.

397
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,991
Can I call you?

398
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,012
Isn't that my uncle?

399
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,692
Mrs. Carmen,
how long has he worked for you now?

400
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:27,530
A long time,
and we never had a problem.

401
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,867
- They work--
- Nice job, Gómez.

402
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,368
They work like that, you know?

403
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,495
They get along nicely,
they're good people.

404
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,915
He had a record,
I don't know if you knew that.

405
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,711
No, we didn't. Officer,
there must be a mistake here.

406
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,421
No, no mistake.

407
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,089
Go back to work. Excuse me.

408
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,384
Thank you.

409
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,219
<i>You've reached Jose's crib.</i>

410
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,430
<i>Leave me your plates,
and I'll see.</i>

411
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,850
Where are you? I
need you to call me.

412
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,852
Walter.

413
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,020
- Henry's done.
- Okay, honey, coming.

414
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,984
You look better,
Walter. Your color's better.

415
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,112
He's actually on the
pretty strong stuff now.

416
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,078
Dr. Sánchez is
trying to talk him into

417
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,283
taking some time off from work,
but Walter...

418
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,995
Actually, I talked to Carmen this morning,
and they're getting a substitute.

419
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,622
Really?

420
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:22,251
I just didn't have a
chance to tell you.

421
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,379
- Cielo, your bet.
- I'll pass.

422
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,928
Honey,
the green ones are 20,000 each.

423
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,222
Well,
then it's 40. That's how I bet.

424
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,685
Hey, uncle...

425
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:44,273
why were you arresting
Hugo? He's a pretty cool guy.

426
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,444
Because there were signs
that he was one of the thieves

427
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,320
of the lab gear.

428
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,740
He has a minor record.

429
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,910
for disturbing the peace.
And the other is that

430
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,245
he was one of the
people who had the key.

431
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,748
Fits the profile perfectly.

432
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:05,335
When we searched his truck,
we found

433
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,380
a big old fat blunt.

434
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:13,719
Which goes to prove old Hugo

435
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:17,431
isn't so cool after all.

436
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,518
Your bet.

437
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,313
I can't believe the
school system didn't know

438
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,273
about this guy's record.

439
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,275
I mean, that's pretty scary.

440
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,902
Well, my personal opinion

441
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,279
is that Hugo is not a thief.

442
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,157
Well, nothing personal, Walter,
but if they were to point at you

443
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,162
with a water gun,
you'd give away even your mom.

444
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,661
Yes, yes.

445
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,079
Well, coming back to Hugo,

446
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,290
We tore his house apart.

447
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:47,503
Turns out he's a
major league pothead.

448
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,171
But you're right
about what you said.

449
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,716
But he didn't raid
your chemistry set.

450
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:59,515
I bet 10,000. Last card here.

451
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,518
What?

452
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:05,312
I've got nothing. I'm out.

453
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,897
I'm out too.

454
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,315
Let's see.

455
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,859
I'm out.

456
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:14,530
Well,
if Mrs. "That's How I Bet" leaves,

457
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,533
looks like it's you and me,
buddy.

458
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,577
What will happen to Hugo?

459
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:23,205
He's going to lose his job,
and then it's up to the judge.

460
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,624
He could get a
fine or time in jail.

461
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:32,214
You going to man up,
or you're going to puss out?

462
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,300
- Henry.
- Sorry.

463
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,886
Sorry.

464
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,433
I'm all in.

465
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,736
What have you
got? Straight flush?

466
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,781
Henry! Come on!
- Okay, okay.

467
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,325
You know what? I'm out.

468
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,413
- You talker.
- Let's see.

469
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,207
- Let's see that.
- ¿What? No peeking.

470
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,002
Why do you look at them?

471
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:13,839
Really? You risked
everything for an ace and a K?

472
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,632
- Well.
- No.

473
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:17,968
Let's see what Walter has.

474
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,345
My God.

475
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,432
All for nothing.

476
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,559
Such a liar.

477
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,937
- No, uncle. No.

478
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,261
<i>Hello?</i>

479
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,973
Hello.

480
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,933
I need to speak to
José Miguel Rosas.

481
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,728
Listen, man,
Jose can't come over.

482
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:10,896
Why not?

483
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,585
Are you his man?

484
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,631
Yes, I'm his "man".

485
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,341
How is he?

486
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,303
Got some busted
ribs and like that.

487
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,723
Got messed up pretty good.

488
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:52,021
I was all like "Damn,
Tuco, chill, ease."

489
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:55,565
But he wouldn't stop. I
don't know what got into him.

490
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,030
Jose.

491
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,865
No.

492
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,325
He's out, man,
way out. They got him doped up big-time.

493
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:12,666
Are you the cook?

494
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,585
I figured you differently.

495
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,838
Nice to meet you.
Pedrito Tripaseca.

496
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,890
Tell me about this Tuco.

497
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,236
Good morning.

498
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,793
Wow,
Walter. You look like a criminal.

499
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:41,504
Would you pass the butter,
please?

500
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,871
Tuco?

501
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,084
I need to talk to him.

502
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,503
And I'm not leaving until I do.

503
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,605
What's your name?

504
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,607
Heisenberg.

505
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,818
"Haisenber"?

506
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:49,114
Wow,
what a name! How do you write that?

507
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,490
With an A?

508
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,994
With an A and an E.

509
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,663
- Have a seat, dude.
- I won't be long.

510
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,876
No?

511
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,503
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

512
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,630
30 grand.

513
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,552
What? 30 grand?

514
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,389
25 grand for the meth you stole,

515
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,515
and five more for what
you did to my partner.

516
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,644
Your partner?

517
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,398
Your partner, partner.

518
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,275
I remember that little bitch.

519
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,485
That's your partner.

520
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,487
Let me get this straight.

521
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,450
You're accusing me of stealing?

522
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,994
I beat the piss out
of your mule boy

523
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,580
and then you bring me more.

524
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,082
You bring more.

525
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,379
Yes.

526
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,676
You got one part of that
wrong. This is not meth.

527
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,490
You son of a bitch!

528
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,162
- Are you nuts?
- You want to find out?

529
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:21,581
No, no, no, no!

530
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,792
Calm down,
calm down. Put that down.

531
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,835
Put it down.

532
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,463
Calm down.

533
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,381
Damn.

534
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,722
You got balls.

535
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,349
I'll give you that.

536
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,228
I'll give you your money.

537
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:48,608
That crystal that your
partner brought me,

538
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,736
it sold faster than ice-cream.

539
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,156
- Cash?
- Yes.

540
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,495
Put that down,
damn it! Didn't you hear?

541
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:07,794
What say you bring me
another pound next week?

542
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,338
Money up front.

543
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:12,882
All right. You give me
the meth. Money up front.

544
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,968
A pound is not enough for me.

545
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,262
You should buy two pounds.

546
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,597
Two pounds.

547
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,434
Fine, two pounds.

548
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,102
"Heisenberg".

549
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:29,983
Sometimes you got to
rob to keep your riches.

550
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,585
Just as long as we
got an understanding.

551
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,822
Hey, hey.

552
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,074
What is that shit?

553
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,205
Mercury fulminate.

554
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:50,337
A little tweak of chemistry.

555
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,756
Son of a bitch.

556
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,723
Yes!
