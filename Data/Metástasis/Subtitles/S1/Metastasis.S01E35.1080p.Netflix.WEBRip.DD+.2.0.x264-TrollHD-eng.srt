1
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,275
What are you looking for?
How can I help you?

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,569
I have DVDs,
I have some CDs,

3
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,380
porno 3D. The latest.

4
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,007
Do you want to see them?

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,009
Tell me. Can I help you?

6
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,578
You are talking to Tigre.
Tell me.

7
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,306
I'm looking for this place.

8
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,144
Who sent you?

9
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:48,774
Sir.

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,137
Go up the stairs
to the bottom.

11
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,573
Ask for Gancho.

12
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,683
Who are you looking for?

13
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,903
How does it look?

14
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,863
You mean, in do I see it?

15
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,598
- Yes.
- You look pregnant.

16
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,476
Any lawman
worth his salt

17
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,411
is going to spot that, yeah.

18
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,290
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

19
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,626
Yes. It's a deal breaker.

20
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,880
You won't buy it then.

21
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,256
I have to buy something.

22
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,258
I need protection.

23
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,244
The thing is
which is the right one.

24
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,143
Here.

25
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,628
I'll show you one
of my favorites.

26
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,397
The best of the best.

27
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,983
"Topo Gigio".

28
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,610
.38 Special, snub nose.

29
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,930
It's the same
as the other one but smaller.

30
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,240
This can do wonders.

31
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,894
It's smaller
and it doesn't show.

32
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,938
A revolver
is the best thing, man.

33
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,623
It won't jam.

34
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,775
- I don't know.
- Listen,

35
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,986
I'm not just trying
to sell this to you,

36
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,879
this is not a selling technic.

37
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,548
I've used this gun.

38
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,951
If you could see
the hole it left on the front.

39
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,886
And even bigger on the back.

40
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,039
I'm not feeling it.
I don't know.

41
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,600
It seems fragile.

42
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,187
Fragile? If you could see

43
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,562
people laying on the floor

44
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,982
after three of four shots.

45
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,566
Plus, I will give it to you

46
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,901
with hollow-point bullets,

47
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:58,054
not the other ones
that have less power.

48
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,848
- Don't you have anything
bigger?
- Sure.

49
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:05,310
They're not stronger,
they just have more bullets.

50
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:08,522
In this one you can have
up to ten bullets,

51
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,249
you put them in here.

52
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,111
And one on the barrel.
Like this one or this one.

53
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,504
But let me tell you one thing.

54
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,464
If you've got six bullets

55
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,658
and you can't get out
of the problem you're in,

56
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,202
that means you're in
a big shooting.

57
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,163
Some seven or eight other
bullets

58
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,306
won't do shit.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,567
Is this the correct side?

60
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,927
If you're right-handed,
it is.

61
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,679
Maybe it'll feel
better on the left side.

62
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,807
No, no, no, no.
Never.

63
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,285
You don't want to cross draw,

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,312
not unless
you're going to be sitting,

65
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,272
you know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

66
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,666
But you never cross draw.

67
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,446
I feel the urge
to ask you something,

68
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,131
even though I know better.

69
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,034
I've been providing my services
for the past 30-odd years.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,510
But I do have to ask you,

71
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,287
we strictly talking
defense here?

72
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,431
Yes, absolutely defense.

73
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,600
You don't look like a crook.

74
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,104
You could simply buy it legally.

75
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,174
If you did have to use it,
wouldn't it still be better

76
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,718
to use one
that couldn't be traced?

77
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,071
That's true.

78
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,865
I believe that in this country

79
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,491
one needs to defend oneself.

80
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,603
You can't let someone
fuck you over.

81
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,914
If someone wants to fuck you,

82
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,108
you take that
and you fuck him up first.

83
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,085
Some call it a moral right,

84
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,989
and I do include myself
within that class.

85
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,176
I'll take it.

86
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,799
Honey.

87
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,868
Can I have another coffee,
please?

88
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,136
Sure.

89
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,822
- Jose!
- Hi!

90
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:04,925
What's up, brother?

91
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,466
What noise.

92
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,953
Dude, it sounds
like an earthquake out there.

93
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,913
Yeah. New sound system.
Check it out.

94
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,099
Whoa! Bodacious subwoofers, yo!

95
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,600
Serious cannons.

96
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,644
18-inchers,

97
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,730
six of them, aluminum columns,

98
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,466
so they're really, really like,
sonically neutral.

99
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,818
Tweeters are killers, too.

100
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:28,055
Dig all them lines
jumping around.

101
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,157
Psychedelic.

102
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,159
See that, Mono?

103
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,661
It's kind of like a fish tank.

104
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,539
Kind of like just want

105
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,666
to stare at them.

106
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,001
Yeah, man.

107
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:43,112
We can bet on which light
gets up there the most.

108
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,588
Don't be stupid, Mono.

109
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,783
This is a temple of Art and
Music.

110
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,077
It's got, like,
parametric equalization.

111
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,537
Automatically
adjusts the levels

112
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,623
to changes in, like,
air pressure and whatnot.

113
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,935
It's a totally digital

114
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,438
vacuum tube amp

115
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,588
which is by far the best
anti-distortion-wise.

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,968
It's 120 decibels
without breaking a sweat.

117
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,970
You learned the catalog by
heart.

118
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,307
It's the first thing
he learns since kindergarden.

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,784
Because his head is toast.

120
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,062
That's why they say:
say no to drugs.

121
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,373
No to drugs.

122
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,425
Hey.

123
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,724
Hold on to your hats, bitches.

124
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,885
I saw Andrea
at a meeting yesterday.

125
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,239
And?

126
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,656
She asked about you.

127
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,616
Okay.

128
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,920
No.

129
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,905
No, man, no.
No, I...

130
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,925
12 steps and all that.

131
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,260
Seriously?

132
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,886
Yeah, man.

133
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,930
Pass.

134
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,193
Yeah, man, 12 steps.

135
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,944
Come on.

136
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,157
Maybe just a little bump.

137
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,036
I can control it.

138
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,459
Sure, if Mono can control it,
so can I.

139
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,204
You ever played
Zombie District?

140
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,250
It's great!
Those bitches, look.

141
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,685
You cap them in the head.

142
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,422
The way them bitches
get all cranial.

143
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,592
The Japanese take it by a long
shot.

144
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,528
Please, brother.

145
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,322
You're fronting.

146
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,141
No, man, seriously,
the Japanese

147
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,767
are way sicker
than the gringos.

148
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,538
The chicks, they are smoking.

149
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,290
The zombies... uf.

150
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,442
You are sicker than the
Japanese.

151
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,127
How can you look at a zombie?

152
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,422
Come on.

153
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,008
Zombies must be a good fuck.

154
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,428
But then who cleans up?

155
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,122
Imagine all the scratching and
shit!

156
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,394
They must feel that.

157
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,522
I was thinking

158
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,065
about another thing.

159
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,943
What happens if a zombie

160
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,863
bites a vegetarian?

161
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,582
That sounded deep.

162
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,501
A paradox.

163
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,171
He will get rabies

164
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,616
and start eating
all the fruits and vegetables.

165
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,618
That's really
dangerous.

166
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,346
Can you imagine that?

167
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,640
He starts eating one fruit--

168
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,019
And eats them all!

169
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,306
Jose, what do you think
will happen

170
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,283
to the vegetarian zombies?

171
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,579
Agree, totally.

172
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,568
Hey, man,
what's the matter with you?

173
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,461
Why are you looking so funny?

174
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,380
It's too quiet in here.

175
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,757
Silence...

176
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,426
This is too empty.

177
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,429
You know what this place needs?

178
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,441
What is it, honey? You okay?

179
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,655
Can't you sleep?

180
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,060
Actually, yes, Maria.
This is me sleeping.

181
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,246
What's it look like?

182
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,816
Looks like you're
looking at a rock

183
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,418
at... 3:00 in the morning.

184
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,253
Rock?

185
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,865
For, like, the tenth time.
This is not a rock.

186
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,260
This is a mineral.

187
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,179
Okay. Got it.

188
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,014
This is a kyanite

189
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,266
of the silicate family.

190
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,628
Your kyanite
is very pretty, honey.

191
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,146
Comes from the Greek "kianos".

192
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,442
It's methamorphic.

193
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,470
Found in the Central
Cordillera.

194
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,432
Would you like some more detail?
You keep acting like you
give a shit,

195
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,576
I can give it to you.

196
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,936
I'm not going
to fight with you.

197
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,192
You know, when last
I counted, Maria,

198
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,027
there were four bedrooms
in this house.

199
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,158
You know, I mean, if I'm keeping
you awake and all that.

200
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,469
See you tomorrow.

201

211

Hello, Cielo?

212
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,427
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What are you doing?</font></i>

213
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,664
What do you mean? Wait. Are you
screening all my calls?

214
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,334
What are you thinking, leaving a
message like that on my machine?

215
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,269
You have to be careful.

216
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,688
Why? What did I say?

217
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,315
You just left recorded proof

218
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,008
of our intention
to buy a car wash.

219
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,986
Now you think that was wise?

220
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,389
Walt, it is a car wash,
not a brothel.

221
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,725
I mean, if we can't
even say what it is,

222
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,242
why are we buying it at all?

223
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,786
Cielo, please, just--

224
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,649
- Hey, Mom.
- Hold on. Hey, hon.

225
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,918
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Your breakfast is in the oven.</font></i>

226
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,696
- It's still warm.
- Thank you.

227
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,845
I'm telling you,

228
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,080
if you're not willing
to pull the trigger on this,

229
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,749
I am more than happy
to call Saul myself.

230
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,377
No, no, no, no, no.
I will handle it, okay?

231
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,850
Look, a flying scorpion.

232
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,309
What?

233
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,837
Look, I have to go.
I'm going to work.

234
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,772
Wow--

235
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:29,549
I could so use a brain
transplant right now.

236
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,737
Tripa.

237
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,410
What is it, man?

238
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,537
Wake up, bitch.

239
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,772
I need to get
all these people up.

240
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,957
No, no, no. I didn't say that.

241
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,026
- Tripa.

242
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,193
- Listen here.
- Yes.

243
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,962
Here's some money.

244
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,906
Just go out and get
everybody some breakfast.

245
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,492
Stock up on liquor while you're
at it. Keep this party going.

246
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,160
I want this place kicking
when I get back.

247
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,054
You got it, bro.

248
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,018
Come on, damn it.

249
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,062
Wake up and party!

250
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,606
Come on! Party!

251
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,284
Hello.

252
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,239
You the new guy?

253
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,621
All set?

254
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,082
You got something for me?

255
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,210
201.6.

256
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,586
What's the count?

257
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:59,049
201.6.

258
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,368
Give it a second weigh
if you would, please.

259
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,681
New policy.

260
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,811
"New policy"?

261
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,688
What's that, Mario?

262
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,482
Any particular reason?

263
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,485
Don't you trust us anymore?

264
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,930
What, Walter?
Any problem?

265
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,908
Where's Gustavo?

266
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,102
- Why?
- Because I would like to speak
with him.

267
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,729
Because,
the way we left things,

268
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,608
I would like
the chance to clear the air.

269
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,527
We need to be able
to work here.

270
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,756
Walter,

271
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,909
you're never
going to see him again.

272
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,692
Look who woke up hungry.

273
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,445
Are you hungry?

274
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,781
There.

275
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,617
Drink that up!

276
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,624
Another motor wash.

277
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,002
That's ten today.

278
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:25,218
That's five.

279
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,515
What, honey?

280
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,751
Just a few more minutes,
and we're on our way home.

281
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,461
Mama's just
doing her work here.

282
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,984
That's it! Come on!

283
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,136
Way to go, Henry,
one more step!

284
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:47,282
Come on! Come on! Come on!

285
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,117
Come on, honey!

286
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,601
- Keep it going!
- Come on, honey.

287
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,829
I am going!

288
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,706
Use that anger!

289
00:21:55,732 --> 00:22:00,070
- Come on, that's it.
- Come on, honey.

290
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,130
You are almost there, Henry!

291
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,200
Just eight more steps.
Seven. Come on!

292
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,885
- Six! That's it.

293
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,914
It's all up in here, Henry,
it's all up in here.

294
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,415
- Keep it up.
- Come on, honey.

295
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,667
- Come on, that's it!
- No, come on.

296
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,394
Come on!

297
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,921
- That's it.
- Henry, that's it!

298
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,149
Three more, Henry.

299
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,844
Two, two, two, Henry.
Two more, Henry, and--

300
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,988
- Two! It's all in here.

301
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,515
Henry, it's all in here.
That's it, man.

302
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,728
- All right, buddy!
- Yes, honey!

303
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,247
Excellent!

304
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,125
This is the man!

305
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,252
Very nice.

306
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,048
Very nice. Very nice.

307
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,533
You're a good man.
Thanks.

308
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:51,304
It's an honor, my friend.

309
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,930
An honor.

310
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,976
Same time tomorrow?

311
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,129
- Yes.
- If I'm still alive.

312
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,048
What do you mean?
Sure you'll be!

313
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,025
I'll walk you out.

314
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,969
Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

315
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,820
Great, honey!

316
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,394
Great session.
Lots of positive energy.

317
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,038
We need that all the time.

318
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,206
Yes.

319
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,151
It's great to see him
like that, but--

320
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,820
One day at a time.
We are doing great.

321
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,713
I know.

322
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,507
You've got a real way with him.

323
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,884
You know how to get to him.

324
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,303
You want to go full-time?

325
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,389
We've got a spare bedroom.

326
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,225
Be patient. We're doing fine.

327
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,544
- I'll see you tomorrow, right?
- Sure.

328
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,046
- See you.
- Bye.

329
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,820
That was great.

330
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,599
You had a great day.
You made progress.

331
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,911
Did you work up an appetite?

332
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,771
I have a great recipe,
you'll love it.

333
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,332
You want some?

334
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,420
Get out.

335
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,257
Henry...

336
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,593
Henry what? Get out.

337
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,889
Okay.

338
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,434
Let me know, okay?

339
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,436
About time!
I was starving.

340
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,777
What's up with the pie,
man? It ain't cut.

341
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,838
That's the gimmick.

342
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,381
What gimmick?

343
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,491
This place.
They don't cut their pizza,

344
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,702
and they pass the savings
on to you.

345
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,873
How much can it be to cut
a damn pizza?

346
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,252
Maybe it's, like,
democratic, bro, you know?

347
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,145
It's like on your Birthday,

348
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,672
you cut a slice
the size you want.

349
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,527
Yeah. It's democratic.

350
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,154
Birthdays.

351
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,932
What am I supposed
to do with this?

352
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,644
You got some, like, scissors?
I will cut this bitch up good.

353
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,375
Who is it?

354
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,403
- Hey, would you mind?
- Uf.

355
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,839
Jose, I figure you make,

356
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,050
like, 10 million pizzas a year.

357
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,327
Each pizza takes,
like, 10 seconds to cut.

358
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,290
In man hours, that's--
A lot?

359
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,893
Hey, man.

360
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,004
- Who is it?
- No, it's... Andrea.

361
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,875
What about the scissors?

362
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,093
What about Byron?

363
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,387
Honey, wait in the car, okay?

364
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,348
Let the grownups speak.

365
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,807
Little man.

366
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,104
About this.

367
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,597
I get this in my mailbox.
This was you?

368
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,187
Is someone gonna come
looking for this?

369
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,829
No.

370
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,191
What exactly am I
supposed to do with this?

371
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,236
I don't know,
Buy a house with Byron.

372
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,155
Get out of that shit hole
of a neighborhood.

373
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,158
Or you can go out
and spend it on glass,

374
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,660
but I got to believe
you won't do that.

375
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,223
Bye, Jose.

376
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,324
- Hello.
- Go home, Walter.

377
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,085
- Good day.
- Good morning.

378
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,479
Delivery for Henry Navarro.

379
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:16,606
Yes, it's here.

380
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,940
Can I have a signature, please?

381
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,192
These bricks are heavy.

382
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,944
Rocks.

383
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,053
Want me to wheel them
inside for you?

384
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,405
Thank you.

385
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,453
Okay.

386
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,936
- There's the living room.
- Thanks.

387
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,915
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> Is that my minerals?</font></i>

388
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,459
Yes, sir.

389
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,127
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> How many boxes?</font></i>

390
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:43,991
I don't know, three, four,
a hundred, a million.

391
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:47,344
Did you check them for damage?

392
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,096
They're rocks, Henry.

393
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,016
No, they're minerals.

394
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,587
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Check if they're all right,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">will you?</font></i>

395
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,423
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Those delivery jackoffs,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm telling you-- </font></i>

396
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:00,941
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm not getting ass raped</font></i>

397
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,445
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">by those bastards, all right?</font></i>

398
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,402
- You going out?
- Yes, honey.

399
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,945
I need you to look after
your little sister.

400
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,783
Where are you going
all dressed up?

401
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,871
Can't your mother dress up
for a change?

402
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,542
You can if you're going
to see dad.

403
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,810
Are you going over there?

404
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,272
Maybe.

405
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,719
The bottle is in the fridge.
You heat it up.

406
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,378
Asshole, look at that!

407
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,589
What's with all the soap?

408
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,466
You think that's free?

409
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:10,761
Stop wasting it.

410
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,765
Look,

411
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,209
tell your brother that if he
doesn't show up tomorrow,

412
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,936
I'm going to have to fire him.

413
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,922
- Yes, sir.
- And no more excuses.

414
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,927
- Hello.
- Yes?

415
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,097
- Don Ramiro Clavijo?
- Yes.

416
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,408
Hello, Cielo Restrepo.

417
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,992
Excuse me.

418
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,041
You want to buy my car wash.

419
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,836
I do. And I am prepared

420
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,129
to talk numbers right now.

421
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,658
Do you think
this is an easy job?

422
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,118
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees

423
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,597
and scrub like a house maid

424
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,974
with all the chemicals

425
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,060
eating into your nice skin

426
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,772
and stinging in your eyes?

427
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,342
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

428
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,152
Any other advice for me?

429
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,906
Because I am serious about this.

430
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,282
Good.

431
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,200
I am serious, too.

432
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,078
I have worked 30 years

433
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,939
of building this business
from nothing,

434
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,442
with my own hands
and my own sweat and blood.

435
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,195
So, with that in mind, is there
a figure you can quote me?

436
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,882
19.000 million pesos.

437
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:33,135
How about 1.500 million?

438
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,539
Where do you come up
with this number?

439
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:42,586
On a typical day,
you manage 19 cars per hour.

440
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,798
Extrapolating,
I added the extra revenues

441
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,066
for hand waxes and detailing,

442
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,902
subtracted

443
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,445
your overhead

444
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,657
and salary and maintenance,

445
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,810
which I obtained
from comparable businesses.

446
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,078
Giving me an estimate

447
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,790
of your annual cash flow here,

448
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,627
to which I added

449
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,153
the market value
of your real estate,

450
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,365
giving me a total estimated
value of 1.400 million.

451
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,216
On top of which

452
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,952
I generously
added an extra 100 million pesos

453
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,013
so as not to be insulting.

454
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,544
The price is
40.000 million pesos.

455
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,312
Mister Clavijo, please.

456
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,049
This is the price
for Walter Blanco.

457
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,511
You don't think
I know who you are?

458
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,738
I remember.

459
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:37,558
Well, I have not
pretended to be any--

460
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,185
Your husband, he quit
without giving me notice.

461
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,897
He broke my air fresheners.
He cursed at me.

462
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,733
And now he wants to buy
my car wash.

463
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:49,837
But he's not man enough

464
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,740
to come in here
and face me himself.

465
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:56,552
Instead, he sends his woman.

466
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,555
Excuse me?

467
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,333
Walter Blanco wants
to buy my car wash.

468
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,670
The price he pays
is 40.000 million pesos.

469
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:10,299
But he doesn't have
to send you, he should come.

470
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,401
I don't do business with women.

471
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,762
Now, please be
kind enough to leave,

472
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,573
I have things to do.

473
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,568
Hi. Have you recently
lost a loved one

474
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,295
on an aviation disaster?

475
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,907
Have you suffered injury,
shock to the senses,

476
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,493
or property damage
as a result of airplane debris

477
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:41,330
or, God forbid,
falling body parts?

478
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,518
Don't miss this week's specials

479
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,229
in "Tell Saul".

480
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,715
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You'll learn a lot</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">about your rights.</font></i>

485

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You deserve justice.</font></i>

486
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:07,039
So "Tell Saul".

487
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,532
You might want to learn
how to tail better

488
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:20,661
if you're planning
on making a habit of it.

489
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,768
May I sit?

490
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,071
Can we have something stronger?

491
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,489
On me.

492
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,893
You make a hell
of a lot more than I do.

493
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,040
What alcohol do you have?

494
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:51,583
Rum, liquor.

495
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,962
Two rums, double.

496
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,540
There were some actions that I
took which I want you to
understand.

497
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,459
I didn't want any of this
to happen.

498
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,770
Everything I did

499
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,131
I did out of loyalty
to my partner,

500
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,317
and then, later, of course,

501
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,469
it was purely
out of self-defense.

502
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,163
Thanks.

503
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,572
I hope you can
appreciate that, Mario.

504
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,286
I appreciate that when
you were going to kill me

505
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,872
you were simply
following orders.

506
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,851
And I harbor no ill will.

507
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,395
Great.

508
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,214
Well, there's a load
off my mind.

509
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,113
I'm trying to tell you--

510
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,658
I get it. Drink up.

511
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:13,790
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

512
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:18,154
Makes a man wonder
exactly where he stands.

513
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,490
I cannot be alone
in feeling this way.

514
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,827
Not after what happened
to Victor.

515
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,848
Walter, what's with the piece?

516
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,168
Right hip
inside your waistband.

517
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,546
You wear it if it
makes you feel better,

518
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,566
but if push comes to shove,

519
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,568
it's not going to help.

520
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,197
Do I have

521
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,407
to come right out and say this?

522
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,810
You and I,
we're in the same boat.

523
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:52,079
Drink your drink.

524
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:56,108
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

525
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,501
To any of us.

526
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,571
And what the hell was that
anyway?

527
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,340
A message?

528
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,592
He cuts a man's throat

529
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,344
just to send a message?

530
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,804
You won.

531
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,140
You got the job.

532
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,642
Do yourself a favor

533
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,005
and learn to take yes
for an answer.

534
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,590
Yeah, I got the job,
but for how long?

535
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,276
Mario...

536
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,696
Get me in a room with him.

537
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,740
That's all I'm asking.

538
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,285
I'll do the rest.

539
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,870
You done?

540
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,747
Yes.

541
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,428
Thanks for the drink.

542
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,833
I'm sorry.
This won't happen again.

543
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,069
See you next time.

544
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,822
Bye.

545
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,074
Thanks, Rosa.

546
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,202
We'll be here.

547
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:16,939
Come on.
Jose, that was epic.

548
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,567
- Epic. Thanks.
- Seriously,

549
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,278
where
are you two going?

550
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,964
Mono, get back inside.

551
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,491
Come on.
Tripa, let's get inside.

552
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,452
No, man, I've been awake for,
like, three straight days.

553
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,012
I can't take it.

554
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,622
It's not
like I ain't got the space.

555
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,182
You crash here.

556
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,101
I think I've got a canary.

557
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,836
I think I'm, like,
supposed to feed it.

558
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,356
Whatever, you little bitch.

559
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:44,983
Tripa!

560
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,195
Come on, get back inside.

561
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,696
Thanks, man.

562
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,557
I'm kind of
pushing flowers here, yo.

563
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,660
Look, man...

564
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,080
I ain't proud of it,

565
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,985
You know we got man love for
you. Now that you're back in the
mix

566
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,695
Come on, you're staying,
Tripa.

567
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,489
It's like nothing
but good days ahead.

568
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,867
- Come on.
- Plenty of time. No, man.

569
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,346
I'm good for now.

570
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,623
- Man.
- There's...

571
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,602
There's time for that.

572
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,338
Plenty of time to pace it
out is all I'm saying.

573
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:24,714
I was thinking,
like, next week?

574
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,300
Yeah, sure, man.
Next week.

575
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,862
We are cool.
