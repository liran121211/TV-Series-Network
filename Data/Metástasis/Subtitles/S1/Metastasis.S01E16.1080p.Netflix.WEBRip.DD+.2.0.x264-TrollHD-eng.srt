1
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,243
These people.

2
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,228
I have better magazines
in my office.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,206
At least not this old.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,626
María.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,194
You guys really don't need
to hang around.

6
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,172
They will make the tests now,

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,573
but we won't even get
the results

8
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,217
until next week.

9
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:37,848
Buddy, we're going to be here.

10
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,601
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,018
Or just the PET?

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,003
All of them.
He's getting all of them.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,439
Good.

14
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,399
Some places skimp,

15
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,359
and they only do the PET.

16
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,319
They do it to save money,

17
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,805
but they tell you
they did everything.

18
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,240
That depends on the place.

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,743
I'm not naming any names.

20
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,954
So why did we come here?

21
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:04,565
This is where
Walter's doctor is.

22
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,567
With us, you wouldn't have
to wait until next week

23
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,211
to get the results.

24
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,613
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

25
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,173
In fact, if you want to,

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,035
I could take one look at them
and tell you how he's doing.

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,013
Yeah, sure.

28
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,514
For real, Junior.

29
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,500
Doctors like people to think
that they're so much smarter

30
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,936
than the technicians,

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,854
but you would be surprised

32
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,839
how much they come to us
for input.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,278
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,263
Never turn down a chance to hit
the bathroom, right?

35
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,432
Are you all right in there?

36
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,851
Yes, I'm fine.

37
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,269
Are you sure?

38
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,063
Sure.

39
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,358
You can get dressed,
Mr. Blanco.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,545
So, how did we do?

41
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,006
You did fine.

42
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,216
Do you see anything?

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,409
I'm just a technician,
Mr. Blanco.

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,827
I can't tell you
anything.

45
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,346
But you know a lot, right?

46
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,288
You see these things
all the time.

47
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,707
That's right, Mr.
Blanco.

48
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,918
But doctor Sánchez will go
over the results with you

49
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,353
next week.

50
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,338
- Right. Sorry.
- Excuse me.

51
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,581
The money laundering
is pretty easy.

52
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,601
But, telling your wife?

53
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,561
She will want to know

54
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,688
why you suddenly got rich.

55
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:38,094
If she finds out,
it's after I'm gone.

56
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,573
How much time did they give you?

57
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,700
Weeks.

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,790
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

59
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,416
I was hoping we could make

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,753
some real money together.

61
00:03:56,195 --> 00:04:00,383
Let's cut to the chase.

62
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,802
Let's crunch some numbers.

63
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,410
How much money
are we laundering?

64
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,621
At this time,
16.000 dollars.

65
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,641
16.000?

66
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,249
How long
have you been doing this?

67
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,337
We've had some
extenuating circumstances

68
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,357
we've been through.

69
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,193
Apparently.

70
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,404
All right, 16.000 laundered

71
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,931
at 75 cents on the dollar,
minus my fee,

72
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,952
which is 17%,

73
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,580
comes to 9960.

74
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,207
Oops!

75
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:37,277
You just left your family
a secondhand vehicle.

76
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,841
Congratulations.

77
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:45,577
We'll just have
to cook more,

78
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,016
a lot more.

79
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,085
Exactly!
That's my legal opinion.

80
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,755
Make hay while the sun
is still shining.

81
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,109
Take advantage of your life.

82
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,611
Your life!

83
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,472
I'm sorry.
Do I call Francisca?

84
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,412
Honey.

85
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,857
We should do something
this weekend.

86
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:19,278
Get our minds off
the test results?

87
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,049
Yes.

88
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,801
Actually, I'm thinking...

89
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,578
I should go see mom in
Pereira.

90
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,807
Really?

91
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,709
You know, I never
did call her.

92
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,562
You told me to.

93
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:39,298
I'd rather go
see her.

94
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,217
You're going to Pereira
because you're expecting

95
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,219
the news from the scan
to be bad. Right?

96
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,654
No.

97
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,741
Honey, I'm begging you.

98
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:51,227
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

99
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:56,148
Yes, positive is
good.

100
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,650
But that doesn't change
facts.

101
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,444
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

102
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,090
I know.

103
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm just trying to be hopeful.
Please, let me.

104
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:09,745
I need to have hopes, despite
you don't think that's good.

105
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,958
Don't be sad, I know
this is harsh.

106
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,393
Please understand

107
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,377
that I need to arrange
some things.

108
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,340
I have to talk to mom
about different issues.

109
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,344
Among other things,
I need to talk about succession.

110
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
I need to be sure
that everything I own

111
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,242
will be for you.

112
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:35,229
You know?
Just in case.

113
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:39,608
And believe me,
I'm going to earn

114
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,254
every penny of it, too.

115
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,447
I can hear her,
as soon as she sees me:

116
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,409
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"Sinner! You didn't receive</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">the first communion!"</font></i>

117
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,845
Shut up.

118
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,555
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"Are you going to church?"</font></i>

119
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,748
She might even call
the priest

120
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,501
in the neighborhood for me
to confess my sins

121
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,562
and don't go to hell.

122
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,048
See? You know
it's hard for me to see her.

123
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,902
But I have to.

124
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,028
Yes.

125
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,663
- Good night.

126
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,547
I actually think

127
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,533
the news from the scan
is going to be good.

128
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,686
We should do
something.

129
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,334
Yeah, we should.

130
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:06,754
No, something else.

131
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,216
We should go somewhere.

132
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,927
Where?

133
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,055
We should go to MAMBO.

134
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,058
No, I don't want to dance.

135
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,018
What?

136
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,436
I'm not feeling

137
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,438
like dancing right now.

138
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:27,841
- Really?

139
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,277
What?

140
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,905
No, no, wait a minute.

141
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:36,934
MAMBO is the Modern Art
Museum of Bogotá.

142
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,145
Don't you know it?
It's downtown.

143
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,082
Too bad?

144
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,858
Boy, you need some
educating.

145
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,297
Yes, I do. Come here.

146
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,715
Come on.

147
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,910
- No!
- Yes.

148
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,703
Do you want to go
to shitty downtown

149
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,934
just for a museum?

150
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,769
You are very romantic.

151
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,396
Get up, we're leaving.

152
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,813
No!

153
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,799
Why can't we just go
to the movies

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,802
or playing bowling?
That's good.

155
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,768
A little culture
won't kill you.

156
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,186
Besides, there
is a showing

157
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,623
about erotic art.

158
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,583
You might like it.

159
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,527
We could get some
ideas, if you like.

160
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,529
- Really?
- Yes.

161
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,553
This is Jose's house.

162
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,954
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave me your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and--</font></i>

163
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,831
- I get it!
- I'll see, pal.

164
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,250

166
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,314
Hi, here I am.

167
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,274
Give me one second.

168
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,307
Okay.
What do you want?

169
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,742
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Where were you?</font></i>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Where's your drop phone?</font></i>

172
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,082
Dead.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay, listen.</font></i>

174
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,710
Clear your social calendar.

175
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,338
We have to cook.

176
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,280
- Today?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- No.</font></i>

177

00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:22,289
heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

180
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,724
You should be writing this down.

181
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,125
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know what,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">teacher?</font></i>

182
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,103
Go shopping yourself.

183
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,523
I have plans today.

184
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:33,943
I can imagine your plans.

185
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,403
Eating Cheetos, masturbating

186
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,388
and smoking marijuana.
Am I right?

187
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,823
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know what, man?</font></i>

188
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,308
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Screw you and your</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">opinions</font></i>

189
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,161
about my plans.

190
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,330
I'm going to MAMBO,

191
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,314
not like you need to
know.

192
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,209
You're going to a museum?

193
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,692
Of course!
There is some erotic
showing

194
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,653
with pictures,
documentaries and sculptures.

195
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,089
A lot of stuff.

196
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,966
What are you talking about?

197
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,369
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Why am I explaining</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">myself to you?</font></i>

198
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,663
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

199
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,641
All you need to know

200
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,293
is that I don't want to,
I can't, I won't buy

201
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,812
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">or cook anything.</font></i>

202
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,565
Let me explain something to you.

203
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,425
You and I need to cook
all weekend

204
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,860
through to next Tuesday.

205
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,278
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Four days straight?</font></i>

206
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,890
- We have no choice.
- Who says so?

207
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:25,185
José Miguel, our methylamine.
It's going bad.

208
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,621
What?

209
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,022
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's losing</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">its chemical potency.</font></i>

210
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,984
Unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you.

211
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,629
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So now you know it.</font></i>

212
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,447
We have to act fast
before it goes to waste.

213
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,258
Do you have paper and pencil?

214
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:43,287
Six mantles?
What kind of mantles?

215
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,714
I wish you didn't have
to do this.

216
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,068
I'll be back in four days.

217
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,071
And I'll be here.

218
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,489
The signal is terrible there,

219
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,349
so, if you need anything,
call me on her number.

220
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,144
The number must be
in the notebook

221
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,038
I have on my bedside table.

222
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,040
Or maybe in the library.

223
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,459
I don't remember.

224
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,858
- Okay..
- Look for it.

225
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,295
Actually,

226
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,279
I don't want to talk
to your mother.

227
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,715
No, thank you.

228
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,199
You'd rather talk to
her

229
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,619
about everything
you need to talk.

230
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,371
I'll call you only in case of
an emergency.

231
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,375
- Let's hope not.
- Okay.

232
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,590
- I love you.
- I love you too.

233
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,318
I'm going to miss you.

234
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,735
Me too.

235
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,946
Tell Junior to behave.

236
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,364
And be good.

237
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,782
Okay.

238
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,433
- Fly safe.
- Thanks.

239
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,454
- Bye.

240
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,787
Come on.

241
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,086
What's up?

242
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,488
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

243
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,924
You said we were in a hurry.

244
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,926
I saved us a trip.

245
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,536
Did you get
everything?

246
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,971
Yes.

247
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,581
- Six mantles?
- Yes, man.

248
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,998
With reflux
condensers?

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,018
Yes, like I said.

250
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,211
Okay.
Can we leave, please?

251
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,731
I'm fine too.

252
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,148
Thanks for asking.

253
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,151
Drive!

254
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,223
Are we feeding ourselves
with chips?

255
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,100
Those chips are
awesome.

256
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,060
And they're natural, not
like those lemon-flavored

257
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,705
and those stupid flavors.

258
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,982
How about something
with some protein, maybe?

259
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,002
Something green?

260
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,195
Man, I'm getting no
service.

261
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,215
How are you even alive?

262
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,699
Teacher, check your
phone.

263
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,844
Do you have any bars?

264
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,140
I've got a signal.

265
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,540
- Really?
- Yes.

266
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,958
Let me use yours,
would you?

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,394
Are you crazy?

268
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,378
I have to assume my wife
checks my phone records.

269
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,882
It's not business.
It's personal.

270
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,050
Personal.
- Yes.

271
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,404
What, female?

272
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,030
Maybe.

273
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,117
Absolutely, that's all I need.

274
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,536
My wife hits "redial"

275
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,163
and some stripper answers.

276
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,914
No, no, no, respect her.

277
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,732
She's not a stripper.
Okay?

278
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,168
You can't call.

279
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,195
My wife checks the phone.
What can I do?

280
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,659
- Drinking water?
- Yes.

281
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,637
Is that all we've got?

282
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,872
Ten gallons isn't
enough for you?

283
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,916
Are you planning
on taking a bath in it?

284
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,145
What are you doing?

285
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,273
That is our work station.

286
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,444
That is our only set, right?

287
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,554
- Yes.
- Jose, please,

288
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,514
try to find a place
where it won't get lost.

289
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:16,142
Remember we are in
the middle of nowhere.

290
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:21,189
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass?

291
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,892
Partner.

292
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:59,032
2.5 pounds.

293
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,992
That's the last of it.

294
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,703
How many in total?

295
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,204
42.

296
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,107
And how much money
is that?

297
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,611
Well, median weight...
That's 41.8.

298
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,383
Call it 42 pounds.

299
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,783
What are we selling it
for these days?

300
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,803
40 a pound.

301
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,429
40.000?

302
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,414
You said raise the
prices.

303
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,433
Very good.

304
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:32,065
All right, that's 40 times 42,

305
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,026
minus distribution charges.

306
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:41,365
672.000.

307
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,452
All that?

308
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,456
672.000 each.

309
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,692
Each, man?
Are you sure?

310
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:56,505
672.000 dollars each?

311
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,924
Are you sure, bro?

312
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,341
672.000 each?

313
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,301
I'm sure.

314
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,638
Yeah! 672.000 dollars!

315
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,057
That's it, teacher!

316
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,041
Come high, baby!
Come high!

317
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,227
Come on!

318
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,313
Yeah!

319
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,440
672.000 dollars!

320
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,789
Well, there goes the generator.

321
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,249
Perfect timing, bro.

322
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,209
How do you figure that?

323
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,962
We're done cooking.

324
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,361
I am not done
until this is empty.

325
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,572
Jose, we still have 35 or 40
gallons of methylamine.

326
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,574
Come on, where's
your ambition?

327
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,911
Jesus.
Seriously?

328
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:49,207
The generator needs gas,
we're almost out of propane,

329
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,752
and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

330
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,397
Come on.

331
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:00,402
Let's do something.

332
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,655
When do you have to be home?

333
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,139
- On Tuesday?
- On Tuesday.

334
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,950
Okay, on Tuesday.

335
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,351
Can we at least
just take the night off?

336
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,787
We'll be back like new.

337
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,189
We come back tomorrow
and start all over again.

338
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,085
Come on, let's go for some beef,

339
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:21,072
sausages, corn cakes,
cold beer.

340
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,241
There has to be some place
to eat good meals

341
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,677
around here.

342
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,537
In our way here,
I saw a motel.

343
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,974
A hot shower?

344
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,185
A bed?

345
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,939
Come on, bro.

346
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,066
Okay.

347
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,864
Separate rooms, right?

348
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,365
That's a given.

349
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,579
What's up?

350
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,289
The battery's dead.

351
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,708
What?

352
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,126
Yes, it's dead.

353
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,069
Back when I asked you
to put the keys

354
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,071
in a safe place,
where did you put them?

355
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,050
Here in the ignition.

356
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,676
Son of a bitch.

357
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,094
What?

358
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,037
Is this a genetic thing
with you?

359
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,454
- What?
- Were you born like this?

360
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,349
Or you fell from the bed?

361
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,767
What are you talking about?

362
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,186
Damn it!

363
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,336
You can't let the keys there
almost two days!

364
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,505
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything.

365
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,382
- What did you do?
- I wanted to let--

366
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,261
It buzzes
when you put the keys in.

367
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,990
Okay, okay.

368
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,309
We need to jump
the battery somehow.

369
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,453
Yes, but how?

370
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:48,343
Are you okay?

371
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,470
It tastes bad, right?

372
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,770
No luck?

373
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,980
No, mail voice.

374
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:03,400
The call doesn't get through.

375
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,344
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after the tone.</font></i>

376
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,388
Mom, why don't we call
to the Nan's house?

377
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,408
Honey, I can't find

378
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,826
the phones' notebook.

379
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,104
I don't know the new number
of your granny.

380
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,273
But your dad said that,
if it wasn't here,

381
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,251
it could be in the library.

382
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:23,378
Could you go see?

383
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,215
Here?

384
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:30,636
Yes, this is fine.

385
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,263
Move it a little bit.

386
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,389
There.

387
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,898
And now what?

388
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,299
Red to red,
black to black?

389
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,319
Positive, negative.

390
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,947
Same thing.

391
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,575
Done.

392
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,601
- Let me know.
- Okay.

393
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,002
Done.

394
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,129
Start it up.

395
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,844
Ready?

396
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,600
What's wrong with this shit?

397
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,477
You have to really pull.

398
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,895
And what am I doing?

399
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,397
You're doing it like a girl,

400
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,815
not like a man.

401
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,775
You know what? Pull this.

402
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,195
I can't believe you, man.

403
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,821
Come on, come on.

404
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,241
What an idiot!

405
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:38,204
Bring something, fast!

406
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,331
Not that! Stupid!

407
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:53,052
It's dead.

408
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,263
Good.

409
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,266
We're out of water, you idiot.

410
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,410
Mom, I found it!

411
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,444
Don't make me
talk to her.

412
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,363
Say hello from me,
but don't make me talk.

413
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,383
Yes, mom.

414
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,889
I told your dad

415
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,874
we would only call
in case of emergency.

416
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,801
It's ringing,
but nobody answers.

417
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,029
I think they're not at home.

418
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,155
There?

419
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,223
This isn't working.

420
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,207
Now we have to use
your phone.

421
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,060
This is ruined.

422
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,461
It was hooked up
wrong

423
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,896
and blew up.

424
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,856
That is not what happened.

425
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,275
How do you know?

426
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,692
The only thing I know

427
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,653
is that you ruined the mantles

428
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,280
and dumped out the water.

429
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,697
This isn't serious.

430
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,849
Maybe we can find
some water around here.

431
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,309
- Don't you think
it's serious?
- No.

432
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,312
Where do you see water?
Here we have only rocks.

433
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,938
Aren't you a chemist?
I don't know.

434
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,357
Maybe we can lick
some plant

435
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,376
or wait till it rains.

436
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,044
And what do we do tonight,

437
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,463
when it gets cooler?

438
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,590
We'll be two penguins.

439
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:01,078
Come on,
teacher.

440
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,597
Teacher!

441
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,558
Give me your cell phone.

442
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,976
Somebody can pick us up.

443
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,978
Your wife won't notice.

444
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,938
We erase the call.

445
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,422
And what happens
when I receive the bill

446
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,858
with the detail of the calls?

447
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,027
Don't be so negative.

448
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,153
Help me out here!

449
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:23,577
Come on.

450
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,078
Okay, but make it snappy.

451
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,105
- Okay.
- It has a low battery.

452
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,928
Hi, Tripa.

453
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,556
How are you?

454
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,391
I need a favor.

455
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,125
I need you to come
pick us up.

456
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,769
You got a pen for directions?

457
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,771
Okay.

458
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,525
Okay, you go out of Bogotá,

459
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,343
30 miles away,
you'll see a park.

460
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,987
Not there.

461
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,365
Then you will find a road.

462
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,558
You continue until you see
a house with a blue sign.

463
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,562
You turn left
into another road.

464
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,540
You drive there...

465
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,482
- What do you say?
- 12 miles.

466
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,377
Hurry up that it's going to die!

467
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,212
12 miles more.

468
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,197
Hurry up because
we'll freeze tonight.

469
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,718
Okay, bye.

470
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,745
He's coming.
You see?

471
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,068
Tell me, bro,

472
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,261
have you watched the movie
of that man

473
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,805
that got his arm
wounded by a rock

474
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,824
in the middle of nowhere,

475
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,810
and he had to cut his own arm
to set him free?

476
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,813
He had to drink
his own urine also.

477
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,024
Weird, right?
What would be the flavor?

478
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,461
Did you watch it?

479
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,588
No, and I don't want to.

480
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,498
What if we make a fire outside
to warm ourselves?

481
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:09,933
If you want to die,

482
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,875
try lighting something
out there.

483
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,895
You'll feel the wind.

484
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,926
We should just call Tripa
to know where he's at.

485
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,530
Hi, Tripa.
How are you, man?

486
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:44,759
Where are you at?

487
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,596
Have you found the road?

488
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,222
Okay.

489
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,184
You just crossed the river?

490
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,168
Wait a minute.
What river?

491
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,024
Tripa, bro, what river?

492
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:04,029
There's no river.

493
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:07,199
No, bro, you went the wrong way.

494
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,201
You have to go back

495
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,621
to the road...

496
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,040
Hello?

497
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,166
Hello, Tripa?

498
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:27,176
Battery's dead.

499
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,474
What do we do now, bro?

500
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,358
We couldn't be better.

501
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,571
What are you
doing?

502
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:08,075
I'm trying
to charge the battery.

503
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:12,847
Just by turning that thing?

504
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,474
The commutator.

505
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,334
It's the part which generates
the electricity.

506
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,963
Usually, this little piston
engine turns it,

507
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,923
but considering it's lying here
completely totaled

508
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:27,904
due to some fire...

509
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,864
Apply a little elbow grease

510
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,825
It'll take longer.

511
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,160
A lot longer.

512
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,771
But theoretically,
it should work.

513
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:40,542
Theoretically.

514
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:44,755
It has to work.

515
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,172
Can I try?

516
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,174
I'll do it.

517
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,326
How much
longer?

518
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:35,347
I don't know.

519
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,446
Teacher, and now?

520
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:01,665
Man.

521
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,543
Man!

522
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,862
Is it ready?
Are you alright?

523
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,507
Yes, I'm fine.

524
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,509
I think it's ready.

525
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,451
Why don't you do it
a little bit more

526
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,596
to be sure?

527
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:26,064
Walter...

528
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:29,049
Methylamine doesn't spoil,
does it?

529
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,867
No.

530
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:41,437
You fooled me to cancel
my plans

531
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,581
and come here.

532
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,099
Don't you know the story

533
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:05,127
of the liar shepherd
and the wolf?

534
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,629
I think it's ready.

535
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,723
Go connect it.

536
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,850
All right.

537
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:50,714
Granny, please,
I'm begging you.

538
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,734
Make it work.

539
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,882
Damn it, please.

540
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,663
Come on!
Yes!

541
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:29,479
No, no, no...!

542
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:32,482
No, no, no!

543
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,609
Fucking bitch!

544
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,121
What am I doing here?

545
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:52,068
I should have gone
to the museum.

546
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:02,929
Teacher!

547
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:07,893
Walter...!

548
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:11,020
Walter!

549
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,901
Man, are you alright?

550
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:32,900
I had this coming.
I deserve this.

551
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,336
You snap out of it.

552
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,755
First off, everything you did,

553
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:40,174
you did for your family.

554
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,577
All I ever managed to do
was

555
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,997
worry and disappoint them
and lie.

556
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,624
I have told them
so many lies

557
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:53,045
that I can't even keep them
straight in my head anymore.

558
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,464
You know what?
Screw this.

559
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,674
I'm going to leave this place.
I'm walking.

560
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,318
You can come or not.

561
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,737
José Miguel.

562
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,363
Where's my other shoe?

563
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,976
Jose, your body is running
dangerously low on electrolytes.

564
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,996
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

565
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,414
And when they're gone,

566
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,399
your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

567
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:19,780
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

568
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,657
You go marching out
there,

569
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,617
and within an hour,
you will be dead.

570
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,053
So what?

571
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,471
We stay here and we'll die

572
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,872
in three hours
in this cold.

573
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,041
You need to cut out it all
right now and do something.

574
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,477
I don't know.

575
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,646
Think of something scientific!

576
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,840
Something
scientific, right.

577
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,860
Of course, Walter!

578
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,763
Come on.
You're smart.

579
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,533
You made poison out of beans.

580
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,144
You made a bomb
with a toy.

581
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:54,166
You are just like MacGyver.

582
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,583
Come on, bro.

583
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,003
We got an entire lab right here.

584
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,420
Think of something.

585
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,823
Make some gas,
build a robot,

586
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:05,259
a battery, I don't know.

587
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,662
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV

588
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:15,711
and build a buggy
to get out of here?
What is it? What?

589
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,318
Tell me.

590
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,945
Do you have any coins?

591
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,488
I got a bunch of them.

592
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,472
Then gather them.
Bring all of them.

593
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:31,476
And washers and nuts
and bolts and screws

594
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,896
and whatever little pieces
of metal we can think of
that is galvanized.

595
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,331
What does galvanized mean?

596
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,375
Metal covered with metal.

597
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,735
It has to be galvanized
or solid zinc.

598
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,171
Solid zinc, right.

599
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,588
And bring me brake pads.

600
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,447
The front wheels
should have discs.

601
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,075
- Okay.
- What are we building?

602
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,511
You said it yourself.

603
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,513
A robot?

604
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,082
A battery.
Move!

605
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,226
Brake pads, brake pads.

606
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:02,007
This doesn't look like
any battery I ever saw.

607
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,633
Well, trust me.
It is a battery.

608
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,636
Or rather, one cell
of a battery.

609
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,656
Cut up the last two sponges.

610
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,409
Remember the electrolytes?

611
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,827
Yes.

612
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,829
A battery is a galvanic cell.

613
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,064
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode

614
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,607
separated by an electrolyte,
right?

615
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,150
- Right..
- Look at this.

616
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,945
On one side, we have mercuric
oxide and graphite

617
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,338
from your brake pads.

618
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,323
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

619
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,618
This is where the supply
of current flows out from.

620
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,620
On the opposite side
we have all the zinc.

621
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,580
It's what we find in
our coins

622
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,392
and anything galvanized.

623
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,020
This is our anode.

624
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,672
So, the sponge
is the electrolyte?

625
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,302
Yes and no.
But very good.

626
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,637
The potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte,

627
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:52,057
that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

628
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,536
Now...

629
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,354
What shall we use to
conduct this current with?

630
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,791
The electricity?

631
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,753
A wire.

632
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,171
Copper, Jose.

633
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,324
I was going to say copper wire,
but you interrupted me.

634
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,759
Right, right.

635
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,177
The only question now

636
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,661
is will this supply
enough current?

637
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,180
And how many cells

638
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,099
will we need?

639
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:19,126
We've only got material
enough for six.

640
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:29,219
We have to isolate
both contacts.

641
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,185
- And connect.
- Which one?

642
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,079
Positive cathode.

643
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:43,025
- Which?
- The red one.

644
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,461
Good.

645
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,448
Good!
That's a good sign!

646
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,468
The keys.

647
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,461
Come on, come on,
please.

648
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:22,081
- Come on!

649
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,207
Come on, come on.

650
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:36,137
Thank you!

651
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,141
Yes!

652
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,143
Drive.

653
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:02,121
How are you feeling?

654
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:06,459
I'm fine.

655
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:10,653
It's good to know
I can trust you.

656
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,092
Of course.

657
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:16,635
Whatever happens,

658
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:20,580
your family will get
your share.

659
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,809
Thank you.

660
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,794
So I'll be hearing
from you.

661
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,440
See you.

662
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:31,984
Yes, of course.

663
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,986
Bye.

664
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,765
How's everyone doing?

665
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,600
- Fine.

666
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,002
Is that baby ever going
to come out, you think?

667
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,438
I know.

668
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,440
It's almost here.

669
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:13,425
I'm teasing.
Everything in its time.

670
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,069
Okay, dear Walter,

671
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,072
I have your scan results.

672
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,492
Yes.

673
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:24,162
I have to tell you...

674
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,938
that you're showing
signs of remission.

675
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,958
Your symptoms have diminished.

676
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,960
In this moment,

677
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,963
you cancer is an inactive one.

678
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,590
I want to clarify.

679
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,992
It does not mean
that you are cured.

680
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,994
To classify someone
as in total remission,

681
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,430
we only need to determine

682
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,307
that the tumor hasn't grown.

683
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,291
Could you explain it better,
doctor?

684
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,893
Please.

685
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,462
Technically speaking, a tumor
can remain the exact same size

686
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:54,299
it was before, and the patient
could still be in remission.

687
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,759
Now, in Walter's case,
with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma,

688
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,196
I hope to see a 25 to 35%

689
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,199
reduction in tumor mass.

690
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:05,203
And how has my cancer responded?

691
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:10,332
Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

692
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:17,155
Really? Tell me again.
80%?

693
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,591
That's a lot, mom!

694
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,075
That's a lot,
that's incredible.

695
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,994
Sweetheart, you were right.
It's very good news.

696
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,223
I knew it! I knew it!

697
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:27,040
What do you think,
Walter?

698
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:30,627
You were thinking
about the red card, brother,

699
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,671
but you only got
the yellow one.

700
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,010
Listen, Walter,
that cough is the other thing

701
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,572
we need to discuss.

702
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:43,765
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

703
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,785
This is fairly common.

704
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,787
Look at this.

705
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,499
I don't know if you can see it.

706
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,108
See that scary-looking thing
there?

707
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,544
Yes.

708
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:56,379
That's tissue inflammation.

709
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,363
That's a reaction
to your radio therapy.

710
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,383
It's usually not serious,

711
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,367
but it can produce
a cough like that.

712
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,387
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

713
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,431
Tissue inflammation?

714
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,558
Are you sure about that?

715
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:11,977
Because the other day,

716
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,188
I was coughing up some blood.

717
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,148
What?

718
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,609
You probably have

719
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,468
a tear in your esophagus
from the coughing,

720
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:21,320
and that can be very serious.

721
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,197
We have to see that today.

722
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,157
You could rupture and bleed.

723
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,577
Why didn't you tell me?

724
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,787
Because I've been--

725
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,789
Walter, please,

726
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,208
no more secrets with me.

727
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,210
Your health is really fragile.

728
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,154
With something like this,
you have to call me.

729
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,590
Yes.

730
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:42,782
Now, with these results,
we are on the good path.

731
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,993
We have hopes,
we have some options.

732
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,887
I think you have

733
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,871
a very good reason
to celebrate.

734
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,891
Party!

735
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,518
You see?

736
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,294
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

737
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:57,339
You are strong!
Really strong!

738
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,693
I knew it, I told you.

739
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:03,720
Yes, you told me.
You told me.
