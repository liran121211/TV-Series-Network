1
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,344
- Cielo.
- What?

2
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,013
- They're here.
- How many are they?

3
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,556
I don't know.
Two cars, dunno.

4
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,562
- Toothbrush?
- Got it.

5
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:44,914
Phone charger?

6
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,999
In my back pocket.

7
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,818
Are Junior's clothes
already packed?

8
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,570
Yeah, I told him
to start already.
He's waiting for us there.

9
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,798
What's this?

10
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,393
Your clothes!

11
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,046
We've to talk to them
and go to your place.

12
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,129
- Cielo, Cielo...

13
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,523
- What?

14
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,423
- I'm not going.

15
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,969
I'm not going to stay
with Henry and María.

16
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,597
- Walter, we're in danger!
- I know! It's my fault.

17
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,641
- It doesn't matter!
- No, it does.

18
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,937
Forgive me. The only thing
that matters here,
is that you're both safe.

19
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,732
That's why you
have
to leave without
me.

20
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,735
No, we'll be all safe
at Henry's place.

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,405
No! If I go there,
no one's gonna be safe.

22
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,199
It's the police!
It's the good guys!

23
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,745
Cielo, you don't know
these people.

24
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,598
It's my fault, right?

25
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,917
No, how come you
say that?

26
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,752
I feel horrible
about the money!

27
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,311
No!

28
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,105
We've already talked about it.

29
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,982
I'm not blaming you.

30
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:57,095
You made a choice.
You though it was right,
that's it.

31
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,140
What's going on now?
Us, you...?

32
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,559
- What?
- You've got to move on
without me.

33
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,355
Believe me, it's the right thing
for all of us.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,943
Those agents outside,
they're not going to just
leave you here.

35
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,612
They came to escort
and protect us.

36
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,839
No! No! They...

37
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,535
All they know is Henry's
in danger. They... Look.

38
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,997
We're involved here
only as a courtesy to María.

39
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,541
What am I supposed to say
to Junior, María and Henry?

40
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,920
I don't know. For God's sake,
just come up with something,
okay?

41
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,255
Look, Henry knows
María is always
overreacting.

42
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,940
Except she's not.

43
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,776
Okay, I'll talk to Henry.

44
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,972
Relax. You just back me up
with everyone else.

45
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,682
Perfect, Walter,
just chill out!

46
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:48,187
No! No, no, no,
there has to be another way.

47
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:52,357
There was, but not anymore.
Please, let's go. Move.

48
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,419
How long will it take?

49
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,909
When are you going to be sure?
When's this thing going to end?

50
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,872
I don't
know.

51
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,307
Cielo...

52
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:14,463
Look, I have lived
under the threat of death
for a year now,

53
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,257
and because of that,
I've made choices.

54
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,719
Those are my choices.
Mine. Nobody else's.

55
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,768
- Look, please--
- Cielo. Listen, please.

56
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,413
These choices have consequences.

57
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,650
I alone should suffer
the consequences
of those choices.

58
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,863
And those consequences
are here right now.

59
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:43,283
So please, no more
prolonging the inevitable.

60
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,178
Let's go. Come on.

61
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,638
I'll go get the baby.

62
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,682
Come on, Cielo, please!

63
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,110
Henry, bro, please understand.

64
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:05,223
I've got a car wash to run,
I can't leave it like that.

65
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,476
Bro, it'll be María
who kills me when she finds out.

66
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,230
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, well, I'll get there</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">as soon as I can.</font></i>

67
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,415
Tell Gómez.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,027
I'll send you a message
with some of the guys.

69
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,711
Come, hang on a moment.

70
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,134
You know what?

71
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,286
I don't believe
any of this.

72
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,430
This whole thing's bullshit.

73
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,723
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, bro,</font></i>

74
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,626
but keep your head down anyway,
all right?

75
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,436
Fine.

76
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,572
Hi, my baby!

77
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,314
It'll be alright,
it'll be alright.

78
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,110
He's going to risk his life
over a stupid car wash?

79
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,820
Does he even understand
what's going on?

80
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,739
I've already told you,
he'll come when he's able to.

81
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,034
This is bullshit!
How hard did you even try,
or did you?

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,329
Hey, don't talk like that
to your mom.

83
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,498
He wouldn't be arguing
if Walter was here.

84
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,416
I don't understand
how you let him do that.

85
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,087
Why can't you tell your men
to get him in the car?

86
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,605
María, it's not that easy.

87
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,217
And why?
You know what?
I'm calling him.

88
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,718
I'm telling him
to come here right now.

89
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,430
Thanks, auntie! At least
somebody is listening to me.

90
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,907
We are all in danger here.

91
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,452
No one's in danger here.

92
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,313
Henry, will you stop
saying that? That is asking
for trouble.

93
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,292
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is Walter Blanco's phone.</font></i>

94
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,568
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Please, leave your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after the tone.</font></i>

95
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,570
He's not answering.
I got the answering machine.

96
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,240
Okay, everybody
calm down now, okay?

97
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,327
Cielo, you can stay here
as long as you want.

98
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,413
There's no problem,
we've plenty of room here

99
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,834
Don't you worry about Walter,
none of us is in danger.

100
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,839
Okay? This whole thing's
just a smoke screen.

101
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,859
How come?

102
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,987
Look, Cielo.

103
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:53,140
How come?
An anonymous threat against me?

104
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,268
I'm stuck in a wheelchair.
I'm not even on the job.

105
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:58,870
In my opinion...

106
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,441
someone doesn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

107
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,960
What, the minerals?

108
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,363
Gómez, don't you think
it's odd,

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,367
when I start looking into
Gustavo Cortés,

110
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,552
I get stuck in my place?

111
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,454
I'm under lockdown
for my own protection?

112
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,805
Why do you say that?

113
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,665
Gustavo Cortés?
The one...

114
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,518
The one from Chicken Brothers?

115
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,128
No, I can't believe that
from this gentleman.
Such a pity.

116
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,689
That's my humble opinion.

117
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:31,236
I think the Chicken Brothers

118
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,932
is a front for the biggest
meth distributor

119
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,492
on this country.

120
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,327
Meth?

121
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,162
I can't believe that.

122
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,000
That's huge?

123
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,320
You're already
investigating it, right?

124
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,741
Well, first thing,
what Henry said:
calm down. Let's just relax.

125
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,885
It is being looked into.

126
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,013
We're working on actual facts.

127
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,376
And what's the fact?
Who attacked him?

128
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,353
The Mexican cartel.

129
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,922
No international corporation,
it wasn't a Spanish company.

130
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,341
What proof do we have?
Any leads?

131
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,303
Gómez, aren't you
being paid for that?
For getting the leads?

132
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,808
Remember that laundry
I told you about?
I'd start there.

133
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,935
- Man, Henry...
- That place's perfect

134
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,648
for a meth superlab, bro.
You know I'm right.

135
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,985
No-- Well, even though
I was right,

136
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,446
there's no way in hell
a judge is going to give me
a search warrant.

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,797
Who's talking about a warrant?

138
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,950
What happened to good,
old-fashioned knock and
talk?

139
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,344
"Hello, my lady...".

140
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,803
Well, no, truth is...

141
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,581
You were never very good
at those, were you?

142
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,062
- Hello.
- Morning.

143
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,248
Can I help you?

144
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,125
How are you doing?

145
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,985
We wondered if we could take
a look around, brother.

146
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,962
And why's that?

147
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,613
- Your name is...?
- Jairo.

148
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,799
Let me introduce myself, Jairo.

149
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,742
Víctor Gómez,
from Anti-narcotics.

150
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,262
What? Is there a problem?

151
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,747
No, no.
There's no problem,
don't you worry

152
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,001
Let me tell you
a story, Jairo.

153
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,128
- Sure.
- I bust this chef.

154
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,131
Well, to say a chef
would be too much.

155
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,092
The guy grills
expensive burgers
and he thinks he's a chef.

156
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,653
Yeah, sure.

157
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,598
Well, we bust this cook
with heroin possession.

158
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,059
Can't believe it!

159
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:45,187
You know what he said?
"That's not mine! Who told you?

160
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,607
So because you find it
in my clothes,
that makes it mine? No!

161
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,859
Maybe it came from the place
that launders my whites".

162
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,986
You know where he has
his clothes laundered?

163
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,946
- Here. how's that?
- No...

164
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,116
No, excuse me, but we don't do
that kind of stuff here.

165
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,328
No, no... I can see this is
a serious business.

166
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,248
It's easier to get heroin
in a church than here, right?

167
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,933
Yes, sure. Yes, sir.

168
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,311
But watch out.

169
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,172
Imagine this guy's the son
of a politician.

170
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,232
An important politician.

171
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,967
You know who we're
talking about?

172
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,278
Right, let's leave it there.

173
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,572
The politician's into deep shit.

174
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,350
He went to the station,
went to my boss,
my boss got me into this.

175
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,285
I was left with the whole story.

176
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,371
Help me, bro?

177
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,691
Man, the thing is,
I'd have to tell my boss,

178
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,487
and he's out of town,
I can't reach him right now.

179
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:38,990
I want to help,
but it'll be next time.

180
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,677
No, I get it.

181
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,538
But we'll be all implicated,
because I'll have to
bring in a warrant,

182
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,457
and I'll have to close this up
for a couple of days.

183
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,351
What? Why?

184
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:54,548
With a warrant,
I'll have twenty agents
poking around.

185
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,692
Everybody will have to be out.

186
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,652
Well, but that's your choice.

187
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,820
Help me, Jairo.

188
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,350
We'll be only two guys,
we take a look,
and that's it.

189
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,187
So, it'll just be
the two of you?

190
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,064
- Just the two of us.
- And it'll be quick?

191
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,416
You won't even hear us.

192
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,084
Promise?

193
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,069
- Man.
- Okay, fine, do it.

194
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,005
You tell the man, please.

195
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,800
Mister! Go on. Come in.

196
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,176
You may go on.

197
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,679
Come on.

198
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,180
Thanks.

199
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,757
Do me a favor.
Clear out some of your people
for us.

200
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,151
Confuses the dog's nose.

201
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,345
- Sure.
- Okay.

202
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,904
Done. Come on.

203
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,265
Thanks, Jairo.
Come on.

204
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,136
So how long we gotta be
quiet down here?

205
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,899
Come on, what happens
after this?

206
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,569
Provided they don't find us,
because if they do,

207
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,904
they'll bust our asses
out.

208
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,324
And meanwhile, what?
Are we staying here
under a laundry

209
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,760
for all eternity, amen?

210
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,843
For the record,
it sucks to be down here.

211
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,056
Hey, are you answering or
what?

212
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,961
Hello.

213
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,217
It's for you.

214
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,637
Give it to me.

215
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,892
Hello.

216
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,210
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You know what's going on</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">up here?</font></i>

217
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,771
I have a pretty good idea.

218
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,633
This is all the result
of your former partner.

219
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,885
Do you understand
the dimension of it now?

220
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,972
Do you see why
this can't continue?

221
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,268
I get it. The guy's a complete
and total dick

222
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,272
But I can't,
I'm not signing off.

223
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,790
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Is that clear?</font></i>

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,586
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll repeat it for you.</font></i>

225
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,113
If anything happens
to Professor Blanco,

226
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,493
you and I are going
to have a problem,
and you won't be counting on me.

227
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,202
So tell me
what you're going to do.

228
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,099
You'l have the right answer.

229
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,601
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">All in good time</font></i>

230
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,628
Right?
What do you mean, right?

231
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,023
Hello?

232
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,736
He hanged up.

233
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,358
- Thanks, Jairo.
- Fine. Good luck.

234
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,515
Hello.

235
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,143
They've left, boss.

236
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,049
Fine!
We're good. Get back to work.

237
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,320
Get to work now!

246
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,781
- What's wrong?
Saúl's waiting for me.
- Slow down.

247
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,325
What are you doing, bro?
Move. Saúl, I'm here!

248
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,594
Stop it, man!

249
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,888
Stop now. Estiwar!

250
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,666
Not him, man.
Now, hush, calm
down...

251
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,710
Sorry, you can't be
too careful these days.

252
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:10,507
Please, go lock the door,
then you can take on your nap.

253
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,233
Come on in.

254
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,016
Time for a break,
Pachita HT.

255
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,522
You're going to stop calling me
that, or I'm going to hang you
by your tie.

256
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:30,068
Yeah, yeah, stop showing off
for the client.

257
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,753
Excuse me.

258
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,341
"Pachita HT".

259
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,494
Honey Tits.
I say it's endearing.

260
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,140
So what's so important?

261
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,459
Well, they're here.
The end times, José Miguel.

262
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,337
How come? The end of what?
Will you tell me
why I'm here, Saúl?

263
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,982
You want your money, right?

264
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,483
I guess so.

265
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,860
And that couldn't wait?

266
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,570
Mmmmh...

267
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,182
You ever hear the expression
"a fart in the wind," kid?

268
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,852
I don't think so,
Ive just made it up.

269
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,645
But it's quite literal,
you know?

270
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,747
Inside of an hour,

271
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,777
that's going to be me, okay?
I'm hitting the road.
I'm off!

272
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,906
- How come? forever?
- For as long as it takes.

273
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:19,283
I don't like my heat so hot,
if you catch my drift.

274
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,829
I'm not catching, like, anything
you're saying, and what the hell
is your problem?

275
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,040
You haven't talked
to your partner, have you?

276
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,308
No, not since last night.

277
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,460
Today he didn't show up
to work,

278
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,213
and the Anti-narcotics
paid us a visit.

279
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,606
Yeah, some coincidence?

280
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,192
Yeah, I don't know about that.

281
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,112
All I know is,

282
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,640
when he tells me
that your employer fired him
and threatened

283
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,602
to murder his entire family,
I made my choice.

284
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:50,732
Because after all,
I'm also part of his family,
right?

285
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,375
Wait, hang on a sec.

286
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,819
He was threatened?
When did it happen?

287
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,488
You know what?
Let's just drop it.

288
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,991
We both know Walter
tends to overreact.

289
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,343
Here.

290
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,873
I wanted to ask you a favor.
I'd like you to...

291
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,002
put in a good word
for me
with Gustavo,

292
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,337
your boss. I mean,
just for old time's
sake.

293
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:17,942
Okay? I can't afford

294
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,512
to butter the wrong
bread here.

295
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,698
Okay? Please?

296
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,368
Good luck, Saúl.

297
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,338
What?

298
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,840
Nothing?

299
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,161
Clean as a whistle,
that's suspicious.

300
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,038
Maybe that's what he wants
us
to believe?

301
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,083
But he'll have it
now.

302
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,328

I'd like you

God. Call me, okay?
Please, call me.

308
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,283
Can I come out here

309
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,661
No. Just stay behind the bars,

a cigarette?

Yes, sure.

312

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

313
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,010
Hello.
Hi, how are you?

314
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,807
Hey, hey.
Calm down, what happened?

315
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,785
How come?

316
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,538
Wait, what hospital?

317
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,333
Okay, I'm coming.

318
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:39,812
Andrea!

319
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:40,896
Jose!

320

Where's Byron?

321
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,554
He's over there with my mom.
They got me filling out
all this paperwork.

322
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,368
How's he doing?

323
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,313
He had a stomachache
this morning,

324
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,732
and then we was pale
and passed out.

325
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:06,070
I don't know what it is, Jose.
He's getting worse.

326
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,464
Don't cry.

327
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,092
I'm sorry, Miss.

328
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,661
We're going to go ahead
and admit your son
to the pediatric ICU.

329
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,805
Please come with me.

330
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,126
- So you're the boy's father?
- No.

331
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,961
Then you'll have to wait
here.
You can't get in.

332
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,687
I'll be out here if you need me.

333
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,525
Let's go.

334
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,554
No, no, no...

335
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,292
No, don't do this to me.
Don't you dare do this to me.

336
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,602
No, no, no, no, no.

337
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,544
- ¡Andrea!
- Sir, you can't be here.

338
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,547
I don't care! I need to talk
to her! Come, it's important.

339
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,175
- Andrea, come here.
- No, no, no.

340
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,803
Jose, what's wrong with you?
Byron's sick.

341
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,846
- Come, it's urgent.
- I can't go right now.

342
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,641
Andrea, I think Byron
may have been poisoned.

343
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,394
- What?
- There's this stuff
called ricin.

344
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,646
- How do you know that, Jose?
- That doesn't matter.

345
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,691
Just tell them it's a guess.
Ricin. They'll know
what you're talking about.

346
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,987
If there's something you're
not saying, you've to tell me,
please. What's going on?

347
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,906
I gotta go.
I need to see someone, okay?

348
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,699
- I'm really sorry. Ricin.

349
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,552
- Jose!

350
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,452
- Go tell them right away.

351
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,394
Who is it?

352
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,937
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's me.</font></i>

353
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,774
Are you on your own?

354
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,010
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, I am.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">We need to talk.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Let me in.</font></i>

355
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,622
Come in.

356
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,124
Come in, quick!

357
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,570
I don't know
what you're thinking,
coming here.

358
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,423
Tell me what you're thinking!

359
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,707
Well, it doesn't
matter.

360
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,062
This is the end, Jose.

361
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,606
It's over now.

362
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,677
Do you even know
what's happening?

363
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,197
Do you have...

364
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:05,976
the slightest idea
of what's happening right now?

365
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,023
Mosquera was waiting for me
at your place,

366
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,917
and he took me to a place.

367
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:18,656
They put a hood over my head
and had me on my knees
for who knows how long.

368
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,176
Then came Gustavo.

369
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,305
He threatened my family.

370
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,057
Not only Henry.

371
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:33,003
He threatened my wife
and my children.

372
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,303
It's just a matter of time
right now.

373
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:47,768
I was able to protect them
for now, but I don't know
how much longer I'll be able
to make it.

374
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,982
Gustavo is making his move
and I don't know when.

375
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,734
I don't know how,
but he'll make it.

376
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,090
And I'm powerless to stop him!

377
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,760
What are you doing?

378
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,638
Why, bro?

379
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,374
- Tell me why you did it!
- Jose...

380
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,644
Jose, put the gun down.

381
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,605
Please, calm down.

382
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,732
Put the gun down, let's talk.

383
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,010
Please, put--
At least--

384
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,429
At least tell me what
you think I did, okay?

385
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:24,655
Byron!

386
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,434
- Why did you poison Byron?
- Jose!

387
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,578
Who's Byron?

388
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,396
You know perfectly well
who Byron is!

389
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,814
You saw him!
Don't you dare fool me!

390
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,735
No, no, no, no!
Jose, I just saw them,

391
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,615
but I swear, I have no idea
who these people are.

392
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,550
Jose, I swear.

393
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,513
Look... Byron...

394
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:50,765
Was he poisoned?

395
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,433
Ricin!

396
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,628
Byron dying in hospital
because someone gave it to him!

397
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:59,382
And only you and I were
the only two people on earth
who knew about it!

398
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,567
No! Wait a second!

399
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:06,013
Calm down!
Maybe the kid got his
hands
on it by accident.

400
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,098
- That's impossible!
- Why?

401
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,185
It's impossible, I had
the cigarette in the pack!

402
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,898
This morning I had the cigarette
in my pack!

403
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:19,443
And the last time I saw Byron
was last night,

404
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,571
and this morning
I put the cigarette

405
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,614
- into a new pack.
- Calm down!

406
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,325
- He couldn't have taken it!
- You're not thinking clearly.
Look at me!

407
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,177
You've just said it yourself!

408
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,204
You had the cigarette
in your pocket this morning.

409
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,872
Then why could I have
possibly gotten it?

410
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,917
It was Saúl!
You had Saúl do it!

411
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,462
- How?
- Yeah, I went to see Saúl
this morning-

412
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:42,508
He called me and just had
to see me this morning.

413
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:46,763
When I got there,
his big man-mountain bodyguard

414
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,266
patted me down.
He searched my pocket,
that's when he got it.

415
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,393
- That was his fucking plan!
- No! Why?

416
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,953
Why would I poison him?

417
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,023
To get back at me.
Because I'm helping Gustavo!

418
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:03,529
You knew it was
your only way

419
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:07,074
way of ripping my heart out
before you're dead and gone,
son of a bitch.

420
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,745
- Admit it!

421
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,718
- ¡No!

422
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,845
- I didn't do it! I swear!

423
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,682
Shut up!

424
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,641
You're a liar, bro.

425
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:20,897
Jose, I swear, I didn't do it!

426
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:25,025
Tell me why I'd poison a child!

427
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,012
Who could poison a child?
Tell me. Who?

428
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,994
No... This is...

429
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,985
- Don't laugh.
- Jose...

430
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,404
- Don't you laugh, shit head!
- Jose!

431
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,923
Jose!

432
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,134
I have been waiting all day,

433
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,121
waiting for Gustavo
to send his men

434
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,832
to put a bullet in my
head.

435
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,100
And it's you!

436
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,630
Who's okay with using children,
Jose? Think!

437
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,423
- Shut up.
- Who?

438
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,483
Gustavo!

439
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,218
He has always been
ten steps ahead of me!

440
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,887
- No! No!
- He has!

441
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,390
The one thing that he needed
to finally get rid of me

442
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,910
was your consent.

443
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,105
And not only
does he have
that,

444
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,150
but he managed
to manipulate you

445
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,027
into pulling the trigger
for him.

446
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,504
No. Only you and I

447
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,324
knew about this poison.
We were the only ones!

448
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,784
No! Don't be such a
prick!

449
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:36,955
Think! Jose, Gustavo
has cameras all over the place.

450
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,057
He knew it all along!

451
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:44,714
Where were you this morning?
You were at the lab, right?

452
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,050
And you don't think it's
possible that Mosquera
lifted the cigarette
out of your locker?

453
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,359
There you are!

454
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:57,727
Jose...
You are the last piece
of the puzzle.

455
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:03,190
You were the only thing

456
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,537
he needed.

457
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,290
Gustavo wanted!

458
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,609
You're his cook!
You have to understand!

459
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,003
Jose!

460
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,239
And not only does he have
his cook,

461
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,116
he also has the person
who can run the lab without me.

462
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:17,705
And now that cook
has reason to kill me.

463
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,710
The plan's brilliant.
He's a genius!

464
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,800
Not only does he get rid of
me, he also keeps his cook.

465
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,696
So go ahead!

466
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,725
If you think I'm capable
of killing a boy in this war...

467
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,268
- Come on!
- I will do it!

468
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,478
- Put a bullet in my head!
- I will!

469
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:44,565
- Do it! Shoot me!
- I will, son of a bitch!

470
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,443
- I will!
- Come on, do it!

471
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,570
- Just do it!
- I will, motherfucker!

472
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:56,802
Do it!

473
00:33:56,953 --> 00:33:58,679
I will.

474
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,097
Do it!

475
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,395
Jose, are you going? Jose!
Where are you going?

476
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,897
I'm going to find
the motherfucker
and kill him.

477
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,957
No, wait! Wait!

478
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:30,319
You can't get close to him,
not even at a 50 meters,
they'll kill you.

479
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:33,071
- As if I cared!
- No! Please, calm down.

480
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,967
Look, take your car and leave.

481
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,245
No, bro
I'm finding this guy today.

482
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,290
I'm going to do this
one way or another, get it?

483
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,892
Just wait.

484
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,437
Let me help you.

485
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,609
Mr. Rosas, I don't want
to sound repetitive.

486
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,696
You can't be here,
unless the family allows it.

487
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,090
So please go away.

488
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:21,871
Mr. Rosas, did you understand?
Help me, please.

489
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:25,332
Don't make me call security.
Please leave, Mr. Rosas.

490
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,397
Please, do it for me.

491
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,885
Jose.

492
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,554
Hey!

493
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,641
You've work to do.

494
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:11,921
I already told you.
I'm not going. Stop that.

495
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,756
You've got a batch
that will be ruined, bro.

496
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,677
And an employer who will
be
very upset if that
happens.

497
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,931
And I could give a shit, bro.
I told you,
I'm not leaving here.

498
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,849
If he's got a problem,
he can tell me himself,

499
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,993
not send his errand boy.

500
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,372
What are you doing, bro?

501
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,627
what are you gonna do?

502
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,907
Security, there's a man
bothering me here!
Please, I don't know him!

503
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,202
That's it, walk, you
prick.

504
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,102
We've a problem, sir.

505
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,981
Jose, they need you.
They want to talk to you.

506
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,320
Bro, how many times
do I have to tell you
I'm not leaving?

507
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,199
Then go on now,
they're waiting for you
downstairs.

508
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,508
Walk.

509
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,177
¡Move!

510
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,229
Mosquera told me
what's going on.

511
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,164
There's a sick kid.

512
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,944
I understand your concern,
but I've business here.

513
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,965
I need you at the lab, cooking.

514
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,493
You can come back
when you're finished.

515
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,059
I can't.

516
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,089
It is, as you must know,
in both of our best
interests.

517
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,989
The kid's called Byron, bro.

518
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,061
And he's dying upstairs,
do you get it?

519
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:22,814
I can't be away.
I don't even want to be here
talking to you now.

520
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,818
I can't leave here.
If anything happens to him...

521
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,572
- If the kid...
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

522
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,925
Is there anything I can do?

523
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,871
I know the board
of this hospital.

524
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,042
I can recommend doctors
that could give him

525
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,144
the best treatment.

526
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,438
But he's not sick.

527
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,400
He was poisoned.

528
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,320
How did that happen?

529
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,032
The doctors don't know.

530
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,372
The batch is lost...

531
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,831
Am I wrong?

532
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,671
Stay with the boy.

533
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,454
Mosquera will pick up
the shit from the lab
and clean the tanks.

534
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,932
When you're ready,

535
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,810
we'll work on a new batch.

536
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,854
Maybe next week.

537
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,143
Yes. Finally!

538
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:48,851
What is it?

539
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:19,841
That's it.

540
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,554
Yes, go on.

541
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,124
give me the pleasure
of blowing you up!

542
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,894
Come on!

543
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,192
Come on!

544
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,406
No!

545
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,893
Why are you turning back?
Dammit!

546
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:51,665
What are you doing?

547
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,043
Shit!
