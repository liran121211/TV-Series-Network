1
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,835
How's it coming?

2
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,837
Very, very well.

3
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,783
- It's a flurry of deliveries.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,261
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,846
Don Gustavo...

6
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,639
this is very exciting.

7
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,642
I'm glad.

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,964
And if you have any questions
about the price that we pay,

9
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,025
which is understandable,

10
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,761
I guarantee you that what we
have here is the best.

11
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,613
Great quality.

12
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,808
I want you to have
what you need.

13
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,369
I do.

14
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,813
I doff my proverbial cap to you,
sir.

15
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,650
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

16
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,419
Within a month, I'd say.

17
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,337
Two weeks.

18
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,342
Yeah, two weeks.

19
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,011
Perfect.

20
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,141
By the way,

21
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,961
that sample
you asked me to run,

22
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,899
I ran it, and it is quite good.

23
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,094
Thank you very much, Guido.
You can give that to Victor...

24
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,904
to discard.

25
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,283
Is that our competition?

26
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,162
I'm sorry?

27
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,939
It really is quite good.
The purity...

28
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,316
I'm speaking, of course,
strictly in chemical terms.

29
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,444
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color.

30
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,197
You don't have
any competition,

31
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,424
not as far as I'm concerned.

32
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,594
After all,

33
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,681
how pure can pure be?

34
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,227
Of course, I told you

35
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,271
I can guarantee you

36
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,982
a purity of 96 per cent.

37
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,551
It's a hard-earned
figure, 96.

38
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,862
Fine by me.

39
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,031
However,

40
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,616
this other product

41
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,077
is higher than that.

42
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,354
It's 99, maybe even
a touch beyond that.

43
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,149
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph...

44
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,792
and, and...

45
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,586
What I mean, Don Gustavo,

46
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,115
is that last 3 per cent, it may
not sound like a lot,

47
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,591
but it is, it's tremendous.

48
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,010
Who ever did that

49
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,095
is way ahead of us,

50
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,538
ahead of the gringos
and the Mexicans,

51
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,974
the one who synthesized it.

52
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,934
For our purposes,

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,229
96 per cent will do just fine.

54
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,047
Please, don't let this
trouble you.

55
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,942
Yeah. It's just

56
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,486
being a chemist

57
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,640
I'd love to know
who synthesized it, is all.

58
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,684
It's just professional
curiosity.

59
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,857
A man who wants
to work with me.

60
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,626
A trained chemist,

61
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,336
like yourself.

62
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,116
But I don't consider him
a professional.

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,162
With all due respect,
Don Gustavo,

64
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,471
if the person who did that

65
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,224
is not a professional

66
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,725
I don't know what that makes me.

67
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,021
There are other considerations.

68
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,508
His is the best I've
ever seen,

69
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,860
hands down.

70
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,613
Truely. He's a genius.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,811
No, please, don't.

72
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,647
Please, don't.

73
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,539
Yes, sir. Carrera 20

74
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,917
number 25-12.

75
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,962
I just heard the one shot.

76
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,324
Just the one single
like a backfire.

77
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,579
No, the neighbours
didn't hear anything either.

78
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,264
We talked

79
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,100
and no one heard fighting

80
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,935
or anything like that.

81
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,147
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,607
He's dead.

83
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,720
Thank you,
we are waiting for you.

84
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,784
Sorry, did you know him?

85
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,691
You don't want
to touch anything.

86
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,044
Police are on their way.

87
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,233
What the hell happened?

88
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,859
What did you do?

89
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,531
What did you do?

90
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,783
Drive.

91
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,053
What the hell happened?

92
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,317
What the hell happened?

93
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,303
Look at me. What the hell
happened?

94
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,029
He's gone.

95
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,949
Shit!

96
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,868
You do a sweep?

97
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,829
I couldn't. People there.

98
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,772
People? You got yourself seen
by these people?

99
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,458
So what?

100
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,418
Just another looky-loo.

101
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,529
I guess I'd better
get this over with.

102
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,028
- Hey.
- Geez, I woke you up.

103
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,047
I should have called ahead.

104
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:54,452
I needed to get up anyway.
Come in.

105
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,495
No, no. It's kind of my
only time to run errands.

106
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,790
I just needed to--
My bills.

107
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,710
Cielo, thank you,
big time, as always.

108
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,505
They seem to be getting
bigger instead of smaller,

109
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,299
and I'm not really sure what
that's all about.

110
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,384
Tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you guys.

111
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,571
It's absolutely fine.

112
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,113
Okay. Thanks.

113
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,781
Hey, what's with that car?

114
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,911
It's Walter's new car.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,289
Walter's new car?

116
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,041
Wow.

117
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,501
A new car

118
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,087
plus he's paying Henry's bill?

119
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,948
He must be doing great
with that gambling thing.

120
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,617
- We're not talking about that.
- No, easy.

121
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,538
Does this mean
what I think it means?

122
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,139
What? What do you mean?

123
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,183
Come on! You and Walter?

124
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,852
He's spending the night here.

125
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,547
All right.
Okay. I'm not pressing.

126
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,342
You'll tell me when you're
ready. I think that it's great.

127
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,528
I'm out of here. Okay.

128
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,306
A big howdy-do
to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

129
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,117
- Bye.

130
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,311
Hi! I thought
you were sleeping.

131
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,330
Where were you?

132
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,042
At the store

133
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,503
buying things for breakfast.

134
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,338
Dressed like that?

135
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,285
Would you rather
have no breakfast?

136
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,553
No, no, no.

137
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,346
Give me a hand with the eggs?

138
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,492
It's about eight.

139
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:10,481
- We should start--
- Shut up!

140
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,376
We need to start a cook at eight

141
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,028
to keep to our schedule--
Gus' schedule.

142
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,757
And as angry as he may be,

143
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,216
I don't believe he's willing

144
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,552
to forfeit an entire batch.

145
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,623
That just might
make him angrier.

146
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,477
Please, Mario, come on.

147
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,354
Let us cook.

148
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,174
Isn't that what this
whole thing is about?

149
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,591
That's right, genius.

150
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,676
We ain't missing no cook.

151
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,280
Just for the record

152
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,157
we should wear masks.

153
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,499
I insist on putting on masks.

154
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,382
What is this jerk doing?

155
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,411
I'm sure he will forget
the aluminum.

156
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,184
You see? No aluminum.

157
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,957
Gustavo.

158
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,793
I want to talk about Guido.

159
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,865
Guido was a good man,
he was a great chemist.

160
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,426
I always respected him.

161
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,596
He didn't deserve what happened.

162
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,017
This is a big injustice.

163
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,424
But I would shoot him
if I had to.

164
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,761
If I had to do it
again tomorrow

165
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,096
I would,
and the day after tomorrow.

166
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,938
You had me choosing
between me

167
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,540
and Guido and Jose

168
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,044
and Guido got the worst part.

169
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,506
It's a fact.

170
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,177
This is all your fault.

171
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,388
It's not mine nor Jose's.

172
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,020
Guido's death is on you.

173
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,507
Gustavo, let's be reasonable,
what did you expect me to do?

174
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,150
To sit tight

175
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,177
waiting for you
to kill us?

176
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,196
Without defending ourselves?

177
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,991
Did you really think

178
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,977
I wasn't going
to fight back?

179
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,481
That I wouldn't take
extreme measures to defend
ourselves?

180
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,211
That was a misjudgment,

181
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,672
a bad call, and you know it.

182
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,468
Gustavo.

183
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,847
Please, think.

184
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,749
I don't care what
you're planning.

185
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,921
No matter what you're trying
to prove here

186
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,439
please don't loose sight

187
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,733
of what's going on here.

188
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,029
Without us, Jose and me,

189
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,807
you won't have anyone
to cook your product.

190
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,911
Victor here

191
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:44,439
is not the right person
I can assure you.

192
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,167
He has no idea what he's doing.

193
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,196
I've been watching him for
weeks, I know every step of it.

194
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,257
Is that so?

195
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,968
You think you could do it?

196
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,683
If you know that much,

197
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,670
why don't you explain
the details of this procedure?

198
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,521
Tell us!

199
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,274
Tell me,

200
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,234
is the catalytic hydrogenation

201
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,137
protic or aprotic?
Please, tell me,

202
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,281
I seem to have forgotten.

203
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,768
If the reduction
is not stereoespecific

204
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,121
why do we get

205
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,648
a enantiomericly pure product?
Tell me!

206
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm talking about the phenyl,
a hydroxyl,

207
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,544
two methylaminopropanes,

208
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,421
each one, of course,

209
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,239
with a chiral center in the
carbons...

210
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,993
one and two
of the propane chain, right?

211
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,469
Tell me!

212
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,039
The reduction
in our methamphetamine

213
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,165
which chiral center does it
eliminate?

214
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,643
Please, help me, Victor,

215
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,979
I can't seem to remember it!

216
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,717
Gustavo,
please, let us work.

217
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,236
It's clear your professor here,

218
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,613
elementary first,

219
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,657
is not up to the task.

220
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,118
That is called cooking,

221
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,896
no matter how
you choose to call it.

222
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,956
It's a recepe.

223
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,650
You just need to follow
the steps, and I know them.

224
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,505
Is that what you want, Gustavo?

225
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,633
A fast food cook?

226
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,846
Why don't you set up

227
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,373
a hot dog stand
up on the street?

228
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,545
You want to compete with the
Mexicans with this? Come on.

229
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,191
Good luck to you!

230
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,442
I want to know

231
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,695
what your new cook will do

232
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,305
when he gets
a damaged precursor.

233
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,934
Will he even realize it?
He won't have a clue!

234
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,894
What will he do
in the raining season,

235
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,021
when the temperature increases
and so does the humidity,

236
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,539
and the product gets all cloudy?

237
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,775
How will he fix that?
Tell me!

238
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,092
No, Gustavo.

239
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,638
Gustavo, if you kill us,

240
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,640
you will have nothing.

241
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,601
Just a highly equiped basement

242
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,253
that's worth eight million
dollars

243
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,856
for which you'll have no use.

244
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:20,428
Without Jose and me
this equipment is worth nothing.

245
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,781
No one will make a profit here.

246
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,811
Your clients won't buy that
shit!

247
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,815
The distribution chain
will break, and you know it.

248
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,025
Gustavo, if you kill me
you'll have nothing.

249
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,753
If you kill Jose, you loose me.

250
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,675
I know you are a smart guy

251
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,455
you won't sacrifice reason
for a tantrum.

252
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,851
Gustavo, let us work.

253
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,147
We're here, we are ready,

254
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,399
we are motivated.

255
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,861
We can simply

256
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,405
pick up where we left off.

257
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,243
Gustavo, please.

258
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,079
So?

259
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,665
Cooking time!

260
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:08,691
We're closed!

261
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,888
- Closed!
Open.

262
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,811
- It did.
- Look at the time, man.

263
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,751
Tell Saul.

264
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,571
No, no Miss,
he's not in,

265
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,631
but you can leave a message.

266
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,092
I wouldn't know.

267
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,291
I'll see what I can do.
Please hold.

268
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,898
Saul, Walter's wife calling.

269
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,886
- Saul, there's a call for you!
- Really?

270
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,655
Walter Blanco's wife.

271
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,074
What the hell does she want?

272
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,185
I don't know.
What are you doing?

273
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,648
I'm looking for bugs.
I think we are clear.

274
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,857
Tell her I'll call
in ten minutes

275
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,751
from a safe phone.

276
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,179
He's nowhere to be found.

277
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,706
I called his house. I called
every number I have for him.

278
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,043
#Yeah, I'm sure he's
fine.

279
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,005
You're sure? As in you know
where he is?

280
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,816
Well, I'm not the man's keeper.

281
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:36,053
#Clearly something
is going on here.

282
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,930
Why would he leave
his car in my driveway?

283
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,867
People carpool to work, right?

284
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,327
#It's good for the environment.

285
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,079
#He carpools?

286
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,064
Why would he leave
his keys laying around?

287
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,067
Well, be both know
he's kind of a genius

288
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:54,155
a mad scientist,
these people get distracted.

289
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,424
Maybe the keys fell off

290
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,535
and he couldn't find them
and so he took a cab.

291
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,329
No, no, no, look, Saul,
that's absurd.

292
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,597
I'm looking for some help here.

293
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,516
I need to find him.

294
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,645
Look, Walter is fine, okay?

295
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,480
I guarantee that 100 per cent.

296
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,358
100 per cent. Idiot!

297
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,238
You got a passport, right?

298
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,491
That's great.

299
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,867
We may have to fly out of here.

300
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,703
Fly!

301
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,014
Walter.

302
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,980
Walter!

303
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,993
Walter!

304
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,367
Yes, hi, Miss.

305
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,269
I need the number
for a locksmith.

306
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,748
No, listen, please,

307
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,525
I can't get into de house,
I can't get into de car,

308
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,236
they stole my purse
with everything inside.

309
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,671
Please, help me!

310
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,407
Don't you have
any way of proving

311
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,800
that this is your house?

312
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,702
I just told you,
they stole my purse.

313
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,498
I had my wallet inside
and all my papers.

314
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,709
Look, the baby is hungry.
Yes, honey.

315
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,483
Are you all right?

316
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,193
Not now, God.

317
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,847
Hold the child
for a moment, please.

318
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,449
Hold her.

319
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,495
What's wrong?

320
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,832
I have asthma.

321
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,711
My inhaler is inside.

322
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,625
Perfect!
Thank you.

323
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,813
Yes, honey, I will feed you.

324
00:29:56,837 --> 00:30:00,608
There, there.

325
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,575
What do we do?

326
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,911
Do I send you the money?

327
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,289
No, that's fine, Miss.

328
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,857
- That's fine, easy.
- Really?

329
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,250
Sure, no problem.

330
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,918
Sir, again, thank you so much.

331
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,529
- My God repay you.
- Be well.

332
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:25,007
Thank you. You are an angel!

333
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,746
Yes, honey,
I will give you some food.

334
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,329
Hey, there! I'm back!

335
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,291
How was P.T.?

336
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,668
I heard it was very good.

337
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:30,783
I need some water
for the flowers.

338
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,829
I'm really liking
this new therapist.

339
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,599
He keeps me in the loop,

340
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,126
always has time
for a phone call.

341
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,896
He keeps me posted.

342
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,315
You can see he cares.

343
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,636
I heard you broke
new ground today.

344
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,073
I broke new ground?

345
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,577
That's what he said. Tell me.

346
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,081
I walked 5 meters in 20 minutes.

347
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,819
And I had maybe this much
less shit in my pants.

348
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,420
That's new ground?

349
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,714
So if you and him

350
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,825
changed the meaning of
the entire language,

351
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,578
yeah, I guess
I broke new ground.

352
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,794
Call it
a figure of speech,

353
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,813
it's a way of looking at it.

354
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,635
But I am seeing progress.
Definite progress.

355
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,033
You're ordering a new rock?

356
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,036
It's not a rock.

357
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,329
It's a mineral.

358
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,919
It's a nice one.

359
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,973
I need the thing.

360
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,793
- Number one or two?
- Number two.

361
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,895
Number two. Coming right up.

362
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:17,473
Number two.
Let me help you there.

363
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,950
We'll just lay this down.

364
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,087
There. All right.

365
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,300
Here we go.

366
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:46,393
Will you just stay there?

367
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,354
No.

368
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,440
Come on, then.

369
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,670
Hold that.

370
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,338
No.

371
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,677
All right.

372
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,180
Hold that.

373
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,625
- What do we do?
- Let's pick it up.

374
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,437
One, two and--

375
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,272
There.

376
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,800
- There it is.
- That's it.

377
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,527
I'll get the chemicals.

378
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,615
Mario, you should wear a mask.

379
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,832
You'll see if he wears a mask.

380
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,694
I never used this stuff.
You sure it'll do the job?

381
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,755
Trust us.

382
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,160
There.

383
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,314
That can go
into the records

384
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,083
as waste without any problem.

385
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,460
Clean and legal.

386
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,280
- Great.
- So?

387
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,993
We just have to finish up
cleaning and cook.

388
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,704
- Don't ask for my help.
- Don't worry

389
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,890
we got that.

390
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,392
Each one to his own.

391
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,885
You've always been bad
at cleaning.

392
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,013
I didn't like to do it
when I lived alone

393
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,098
nor when I lived
with my parents, ever.

394
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,393
In life you have to change,
Jose.

395
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,022
- Grow up.
- That's not what I meant.

396
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,957
Since I met you

397
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,900
I never cleaned so much
in my life.

398
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:58,668
I would have liked

399
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,046
not to have to clean so much.

400
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,658
I guess that's what
they pay us for.

401
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,218
I gues we are the World's

402
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,137
most expensive cleaning crew.

403
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,180
There's worst things than that.

404
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,808
Like what?

405
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,064
Sure.

406
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,997
Can I get you anything else?

407
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,566
- Can I get some more fries?
- Yes, sir.

408
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,676
Jose, how are you?

409
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:49,970
I'm starving.

410
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,705
I don't understand
how you are not hungry

411
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,350
after all this time.

412
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,585
I don't understand
how you can eat.

413
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,312
Like this.

414
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,106
Are we talking or not?

415
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,567
Really, Jose,

416
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,445
tell me how you feel

417
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,266
after everything that's gone
through.

418
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,410
I'm eating, okay?

419
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,356
You did the only thing
that you could.

420
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,583
I hope you understand that.

421
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,298
Understand it or not,

422
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,175
what's done is done.

423
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,219
I can't bring that man back.

424
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,263
Now we have to think.

425
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,640
Thoughts?

426
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,418
- Thoughts?
- Sure.

427
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,546
We have to know what
our next move might be.

428
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,940
Our next move.

429
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,859
What next move?

430
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,637
You can stop repeating
everything I say.

431
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,823
Jose, it's very important

432
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,909
that we are perfectly focused

433
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,911
on what we are going to do next

434
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,687
given the fact that
at the first opportunity

435
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,956
Gustavo will kill us.

436
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,128
What, that wasn't

437
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:08,073
an opportunity just now?
He didn't do it, did he?

438
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,327
No. We bought ourselves some
time.

439
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,137
Some time.

440
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,139
So you think

441
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,016
we are still fucked?

442
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,894
We bought ourselves some time.

443
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,938
The question is how much.

444
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,133
He'll be looking
for another chemist.

445
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,594
He's not going to find
another chemist.

446
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,805
Where is he going to find
another chemist?

447
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,241
It's not just about somebody

448
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,725
being able
to run a lab that big.

449
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:38,203
Someone he can trust,

450
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,646
someone he knows will
keep their mouths shut.

451
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,748
Yeah. Good luck with that.

452
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,401
Bet it took him years
to find Guido.

453
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:48,546
Bet he's sorry now.

454
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,136
Are you sure you're okay?

455
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,681
Come on.

456
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,435
At least now

457
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,003
we all
understand each other.

458
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,896
I mean him and us, we get it.

459
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,689
What do you mean?

460
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,234
We're all on the same page.

461
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,860
Clear as shit.

462
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,237
Really?

463
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,991
What page is that?

464
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,494
The one that says...

465
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,871
if I can't kill you,

466
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,874
I'll fuck you up

467
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,237
and you'll shit wish you were
dead.

468
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:33,909
Miss, can I look at the
desserts?

469
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:50,633
- Hi!
- Hello.

470
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,156
Don't worry.

471
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,100
It's parked over a couple of
blocks down.

472
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,701
How so?

473
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,580
Junior was about to get up,

474
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:07,167
and he would have seen it,

475
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,611
so I wanted to avoid
a lot of questions.

476
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,255
That was smart.

477
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,676
Did you buy some clothes?

478
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,915
- Sort of.
- Do you have your keys?

479
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,793
- Here.
- Thanks.

480
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,565
You okay?

481
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,650
Right as rain.

482
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,653
Good.

483
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,617
Here are the keys.

484
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,579
The car is parked--

485
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,540
You know where the butcher's is?

486
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,319
- About a block down.
- Sure. Thanks.

487
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,004
Good day.

488
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,131
You too.

489
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:57,926
Come here!
