1
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,370
Shit!

2
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,176
My name is Walter Blanco.

3
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,764
You can find my personal
details in my wallet.

4
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,518
You'll find my ID there.

5
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,649
To all law-enforcement entities,
this video

6
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,649
is not an admission of guilt.

7
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,611
I'm speaking to my family now.

8
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,830
Honey...

9
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,000
You're the love of my life.

10
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,960
You know that.

11
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,340
Walter Junior... champion...

12
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,052
I'm very proud of you.

13
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,765
You'll come to learn some things

14
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,765
in the next few days...

15
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,185
that may seem very strange.

16
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,479
They'll seem very bad.

17
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:12,985
But believe me.

18
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:12,985
I'm doing this for you.

19
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,696
I love you with all my heart.

20
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,407
Goodbye.

21
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,064
- Happy birthday!

22
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,064
- Thanks!

23
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,109
What's this?

24
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:21,197
It's veggie bacon.

25
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:21,197
It's zero cholesterol.

26
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,326
My love,
what time will you be home?

27
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,121
I'll go from school
to that other place.

28
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:32,166
I'll stay the usual four hours.

29
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:32,166
I'll be back by 6.

30
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,960
Don't work overtime for free anymore,
please.

31
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,421
That job only helps
us to make ends meet.

32
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,507
- That's it.

33
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,507
- I know. Give me your glass.

34
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,177
Good morning.

35
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,012
- Good morning.

36
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,012
- Good morning.

37
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,225
Here.

38
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,143
Happy birthday, Walter.

39
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,604
Thank you!

40
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,604
I thought you had forgotten.

41
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,732
Did you take a shower,
young man?

42
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,111
Yes, but very fast.

43
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,111
The water was too cold.

44
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,363
The heater is failing again.

45
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,992
But water isn't cold. It's warm.

46
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,992
You can take a shower.

47
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:10,246
It's too cold to me.

48
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,584
Did you take the
cough syrup I made?

49
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,337
Yes. In fact, I'm much better.

50
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,882
- What's this pod?

51
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,882
- It isn't a pod?

52
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,551
It's veggie bacon.

53
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,512
It's zero cholesterol.

54
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,848
I want real bacon.

55
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,809
I'm growing up.

56
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,353
But we'll give it a chance.

57
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,815
- Mom!

58
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,815
- We have nothing to lose.

59
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,193
- Mom, the taste...
- Junior? Junior.

60
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,823
Eat it.

61
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,823
Don't be mean with your mother.

62
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,700
It's very tasty.

63
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:54,623
¿Y qué, Walter?

64
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:54,623
¿Qué se siente ya estar cuchito?

65
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,670
How does it feel
to be a smart-ass?

66
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,339
It's disgusting.

67
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,272
- Is everything okay?

68
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,272
- Yes, dad.

69
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,732
Hurry up or you'll be late.

70
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,153
- I'm not the only one!

71
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,153
- I have an excuse!

72
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,280
See you.

73
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,407
Lock the car!

74
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,741
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Chemistry!</font></i>

75
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,910
It is the study of what?

76
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,249
Salazar?

77
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,583
Chemicals.

78
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:43,839
No. Well, technically, chemistry

79
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:43,839
is the study of matter.

80
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,427
But I prefer to
see it as the study

81
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,427
of change in matter.

82
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,887
That's what it's about.

83
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,723
Just think about this.

84
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,976
Electrons change their orbits.

85
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,145
Molecules change their bonds.

86
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,233
Elements combine and change.

87
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,443
They change into compounds.

88
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,740
Well,
that's how everything in life works.

89
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,287
It's a constant cycle of
solution and dissolution.

90
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,581
Over and over again.

91
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:23,462
It is growth, then decay,
and then transformation.

92
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,797
It is fascinating, really.

93
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,678
Mr. Giraldo, I remind you

94
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,678
that cell phones are
not allowed in class!

95
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,003
Go back to your place, please.

96
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,143
Ionic bonds.

97
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,446
Are you done?

98
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,828
Ionic bonds. Chapter six.

99
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:06,213
Two, four,
six... Ten makes fifty.

100
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,213
Thank you.

101
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,589
Thank you.

102
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,432
He's drunk again,
and he won't come back to work.

103
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,811
You have to replace him, Walter.

104
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,231
No! No, no, Ramiro, please!

105
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,358
Wow!

106
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,358
I'll run the register.

107
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,568
Ramiro,
we talked about this many times.

108
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,156
- I'm not here to...

109
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,156
- What am I going to do, Walter?

110
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,951
What am I going to do?

111
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,951
We should all cooperate!

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,964
What's up, Mr. Blanco?

113
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,176
Hey, look who's here!

114
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,176
I'll take a picture, okay?

115
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,762
- Smile.

116
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,762
- You can't imagine
what I'm seeing.

117
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,598
Mr. Blanco is
cleaning Diego's car.

118
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,768
- Let's leave him a tip.

119
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,768
- I'll tell you later.

120
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,768
what's going on. Bye!

121
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,138
- Hello!

122
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,138
- Surprise!

123
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,724
Ayayayayay!

124
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,268
Happy birthday, my love!

125
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,812
Where were you?

126
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,812
They've been
waiting for a long time.

127
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,410
- You look awesome!

128
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,410
Thanks.

129
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,495
Your pregnant belly
hasn't shown yet.

130
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,623
Yes, it has.

131
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,623
She looks like a balloon.

132
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,042
Have you met my sister María?

133
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,211
- No. Hi.

134
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,211
- Hi, María.

135
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,795
- Nice to meet you.

136
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,795
- You too.

137
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,965
If you ask me which
one I would choose?

138
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:18,011
A 9 mm or this one?

139
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:18,011
I'd undoubtedly choose this one.

140
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:24,768
But this gun needs very strong

141
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:28,480
bases because this
gun tends to recoil,

142
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,480
to kick back.

143
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,999
Unless you want to repeat
your uncle's experience.

144
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,025
It almost hit him in the balls.

145
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,485
- You're right!

146
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,485
- It's all true.

147
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,865
- I'm sorry. Henry.

148
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,865
- What's up?

149
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,410
Isn't it dangerous to have a gun

150
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,410
with Junior around?

151
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:45,414
Pal, it isn't loaded.

152
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,875
Nobody will blow his
brains out because of me.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,087
Come on, check it out.

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,087
Take it. How does it feel?

155
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,757
- It's great, - It is, isn't it?

156
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,594
Come on.

157
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,594
Check this out.

158
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,430
What do you want?

159
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,474
Do you want to feel it?

160
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:07,269
Take it. Take it.

161
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,356
Do it. Come on.

162
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,356
Come on. Come on.

163
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,732
So?

164
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,109
It's heavy, isn't it?

165
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,362
Sure!

166
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,362
That's why they hire men.

167
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:23,243
Come on. Hold it tight.

168
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:23,243
This isn't a piece of china.

169
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,954
Hold it tight like a man.

170
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,456
Put the finger up there.

171
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,750
And the other hand, here.

172
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,750
Well done.

173
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,836
Hey, it's not going to bite you.

174
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,212
Ready?

175
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,429
Everybody, listen up.

176
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,429
Come here, family.

177
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,141
I'm giving a toast to my brother-in-law,
Walter.

178
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,935
We all know that Walter has

179
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,063
one of the brightest
brains in the whole world.

180
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,025
But we're not holding
that against you.

181
00:12:56,527 --> 00:13:00,322
No, that isn't true.

182
00:12:56,527 --> 00:13:04,618
Let's give a toast...
because Walter

183
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,618
has a big heart, doesn't he?

184
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,371
Where is it?

185
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,371
Where's your heart?

186
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,334
Cheers!

187
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,334
To Walter! Cheers!

188
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:17,797
My love. Turn on the TV.

189
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:17,797
I'll appear on the news.

190
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,552

193
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,391
¿Metanfetamina?

194
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,310
What's that?

195
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,310
Is it like cocaine
and marijuana?

196
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,604
No, no, no.

197
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,604
It's a new drug.

198
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,484
It started in the USA,

199
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,484
but now it's strong in Mexico.

200
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,028
Then why it is here, too?

201
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,489
We love to imitate the gringos.

205
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,832
Henry, that's a lot of money,
isn't it?

206
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,209
How much is it?

207
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,005
There are 120 million pesos

208
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,005
and 100 thousand dollars.

209
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,799
Are there dollars, too?

210
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,927
Of course!

211
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,927
Mexicans control the business.

212
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,388
That's why we use dollars.

213
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,973
It's interesting, isn't it?

214
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,770
Walter, come here.

215
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,439
You can join me in an operation

216
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,439
whenever you want to.

217
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,649
Get a little
excitement in your life.

218
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:21,445
You didn't look ten
pounds fatter on TV.

219
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,072
Thank you, my love.

220
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,477
You looked twenty pounds fatter.

221
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,341
What are you doing?

222
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,177
I'm checking the accounts
of the brownie business.

223
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,931
We grew ten per cent this month.

224
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,768
It isn't much more money, but...

225
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,978
Let's take it step by step.

226
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,522
What do you mean it isn't much?

227
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,522
It's very good.

228
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,945
Hey, birthday boy.

229
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,700
I haven't given you my present.

230
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,245
Really?

231
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,413
Don't you want to do it?

232
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,165
Yes. Yes.

233
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,418
I'm thinking of... I
fear for the baby.

234
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,173
No,
let's leave the baby out of it.

235
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,134
Relax and enjoy.

236
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,136
- Really?

237
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,136
- Really.

238
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,309
What's up for Saturday?

239
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:40,398
Ehmm... Car wash in the morning.

240
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,818
And I was thinking of
going to a science exhibit.

241
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,862
Won't you paint the baby's room?

242
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,865
Of course.

243
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,951
But we still have time

244
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:53,537
until the baby is born,
so-- Yes, my love.

245
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,456
But if we leave everything
for the last minute,

246
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,416
we'll end up in chaos.

247
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,377
Está bien, yo pinto.

248
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,880
Thank you.

249
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,934
It won't come up, will it?

250
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,728
No.

251
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,085
Good afternoon.

252
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,089
This is for you.

253
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,089
Thanks.

254
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,147
This is so embarrassing.

255
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,943
I'm-- I am fine, honestly.

256
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,820
Don't make such a big deal.

257
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,820
It isn't worth it.

258
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,824
Hey, listen,
can you do me a favor?

259
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,577
Can you just drop me off
at a corner somewhere?

260
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm fine.

261
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm fine, honestly.

262
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,914
No, sorry.

263
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,460
My insurance isn't the best o--

264
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,879
Take a couple of
deep breaths for me.

265
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,598
Is there anybody you
want me to contact for you?

266
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,266
No.

267
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,810
Lean forward for me, would you?

268
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,231
Mr. Blanco, are you a smoker?

269
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,109
No, I have never smoked.

270
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,109
Why?

271
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,391
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mr. Blanco?</font></i>

272
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,645
Walter? Walter?

273
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,983
Walter, did you understand

274
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,983
what I've just said to you?

275
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,529
Yes. Lung cancer.

276
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,406
Inoperable.

277
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,911
I'm sorry to insist.

278
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:44,708
I just need to make
sure you fully understand.

279
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,712
Best-case scenario,
with chemo, you'll live maybe

280
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,712
another couple years.

281
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,964
It's just...

282
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,844
There something on your lapel.

283
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,097
Is it mustard?

284
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,482
My records show
that I paid for it.

285
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,482
I don't owe anything.

286
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:15,238
Okay.

287
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:15,238
Well, I'll check with the bank.

288
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,698
Okay. Thanks.

289
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,369
- Hi.

290
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,369
- Hi.

291
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,372
Did you use the
credit card last month?

292
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,250
Thirty thousand
pesos in one payment?

293
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,421
Yes. I needed printer ink.

294
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,092
And did you use the credit card?

295
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,135
Remember it's only
for emergencies.

296
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,680
Okay. I won't do it again.

297
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,473
So how was your day?

298
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,143
It was...

299
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,897
I don't know.

300
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,819
Fine. It was fine.

301
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,372
Walter, there're a lot of

302
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,372
cars, and I'm shorthanded.

303
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,583
I need you to be washing cars.

304
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,919
- What?

305
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,919
- Wash the cars!

306
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,046
You've been standing
there the whole morning!

307
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,632
Are you here to work,
or to stare at the cabinet?

308
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,508
- Go!

309
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,508
- Leave me alone, Ramiro.

310
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,635
What?

311
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,262
- Fuck you!

312
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,764
- You won't-- Fuck you!

313
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,478
I said fuck you,
and all your shit!

314
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,897
I hate your job!

315
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,734
And I hate you
and your damn cap!

316
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,029
And do you know what?

317
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,029
Why don't you wash these?

318
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,029
Wash these!

319
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,198
Hello. Henry?

320
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,159
This is Walter.

321
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,204
I'm sorry for the time.

322
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,708
I've been thinking about
that offer you made me

323
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,169
of taking me to an operation,
remember?

324
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,467
That's the house,
with the colorful windows.

325
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,887
- Green, coffee... What?

326
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,887
- Mahogany.

327
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,639
- Mahogany.

328
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,639
That color is mahogany.

329
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,639
- Mahogany, don't be silly.

330
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,892
What do you mean?

331
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,892
Are you interior decorator?

332
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,021
Be careful.

333
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,021
That's how they all begin.

334
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:58,526
And then you end up
using mahogany high hells.

335
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,738
That you don't have a dictionary

336
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,738
doesn't mean words don't exist.

337
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,157
That color is called "mahogany."

338
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,367
Do you want me to tell
you the words that I know?

339
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,452
I can tell you a lot of words,
Gómez.

340
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:12,123
I don't do it out of
respect for my guest.

341
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,419
Henry,
how do you know there's a meth lab there?

342
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,629
We have an informer.

343
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,590
Do you remember I
told you the Mexicans

344
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,426
are in charge of the business?

345
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,929
The cook has to be Mexican.

346
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,765
Or gringo.

347
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,765
We found a gringo cooking, too.

348
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,269
We found a gringo cooking!

349
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,269
There also are gringos.

350
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,105
I got fifty thousands
that he's a beaner.

351
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,317
Fifty thousand that he's gringo.

352
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,317
Fifty thousand.

353
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,651
What if he's Colombian?

354
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,866
No. Colombians don't know how to make meth,
yet.

355
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,032
At least not alone.

356
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,909
We found one who added coffee.

357
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,661
Coffee to add a personal touch.

358
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,330
"Espresso," they call him.

359
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,042
Chemically,
it doesn't make any difference.

360
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,629
It doesn't make any difference

361
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,629
because they aren't good at it.

362
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,965
They still have a lot to
learn from the Mexicans.

363
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,883
Or the gringos.

364
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,139
Hey, Henry,
how do they produce it?

365
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,807
Here,
they produce paste or powder.

366
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,268
They don't produce crystal,
which is the best.

367
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,686
That's what they want.

368
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,686
They want to produce crystal,

369
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,686
but they couldn't yet.

370
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,732
Do you know why they work here?

371
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:22,652
Because they know
this is the preferred place

372
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:24,321
for foreigners who come to...

373
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,658
- Do you understand? Do you?

374
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,658
- Yes. Yes.

375
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,371
There's the bus.

376
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,371
There it comes.

377
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,583
Gómez,
let's wait until the girl gets off the bus.

378
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,128
Yes.

379
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,551
Ready?

380
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,972
Let's do it!

381
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,557
Hold on.

382
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,447
[screeching

383
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,218
Walter,
these labs are very dangerous.

384
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,804
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You mix it wrong,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and you get mustard gas.</font></i>

385
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,433
- Phosphine gas.

386
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,227
No, no, no,
that's how I'd call it.

387
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,271
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you know</font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif">why the
use the respirators?</font></i>

388
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,443
One sniff of that gas,

389
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,867
and it will kill you instantly.

390
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,593
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's clear.</font></i>

391
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,512
Is the suspect foreign?

392
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,057
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, he's from here.</font></i>

393
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,057
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's name is Emilio Molina.</font></i>

394
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,558
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's the one who adds coffee.</font></i>

395
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,394
He isn't beaner nor gringo.

396
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,272
- Hey! Hold on.

397
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,272
- What, what, what?

398
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,400
At least I said he
was Latin American.

399
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,318
- So?

400
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:31,155
Take your twenty thousand.

401
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:31,155
Don't cry. Don't think I'm bad.

402
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,950
- I'll buy you lunch.

403
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,950
- Henry. Henry, Henry.

404
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,618
Can I go inside and
see the actual lab?

405
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,203
Mm-hum. No, you can't.

406
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,123
We're going to
peek our heads in.

407
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,000
We'll check it out first,

408
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,000
and I'll let you know. Okay?

409
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:46,045
Don't get off if I
don't authorize you.

410
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,381
- Understood?

411
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,381
- Yes, yes.

412
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,632
Let's go.

413
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,215
José Miguel Rosas?

414
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,507
It's me.

415
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,179
I'm alone. Calm down.

416
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,264
How did you find me?

417
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,767
You're still in the
school filing system.

418
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,104
It's your grandmother's house,
isn't it?

419
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,457
It's your grandmother's house,
isn't it?

420
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,984
Don't worry.

421
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,984
I'm alone, honestly.

422
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,405
- Nobody is looking for you,
José Miguel.

423
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,405
- Jose.

424
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,281
- Jose. They call me "Jose".

425
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,281
- Jose. Jose.

426
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,158
- Why are you here¡

427
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,158
- Jose, calm down.

428
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,453
I'm just curious.

429
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,453
Don't worry.

430
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:48,751
Sure. It's just...
I remember you.

431
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:48,751
You were probably
the worst student I had.

432
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,295
But you were financially okay.

433
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,797
Am I right?

434
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,797
You never needed money.

435
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,550
Not at all.

436
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,927
I don't understand
why you're into this.

437
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,613
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

438
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,848
There's a lot of money

439
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,848
in the meths business, isn't it?

440
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,309
What?

441
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,745
Don't you know what
I'm talking about?

442
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,396
Not a clue.

443
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,274
It was just a coincidence
that you run away

444
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,274
during the operation?

445
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,735
I have no idea what
you're doing here.

446
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,739
I'll tell you something.

447
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,739
If you're here to
teach me a lesson

448
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:23,327
about religion or the right path

449
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:23,327
or my true calling, save it.

450
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,289
I finished high school
a long time ago.

451
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,874
Okay?

452
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,874
Let's do something.

453
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,128
Thank you for coming,
and good luck.

454
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,672
Go away!

455
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,672
Go away!

456
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,258
Your partner was caught today,
wasn't he?

457
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,093
What's his name?

458
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,554
Emilio.

459
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,390
They seized the money.

460
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,767
The lab was dismantled.

461
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,146
You've got nothing.

462
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,146
Am I wrong?

463
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,231
Jose.

464
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,446
You know the business.

465
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,659
And I know the chemistry.

466
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm thinking...

467
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,204
maybe you and I
could partner up.

468
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,049
Do you want to cook?

469
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,597
You and me?

470
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,597
Methamphetamines?

471
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,808
José Miguel, we work together or

472
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,808
I'll tell the police what I saw.

473
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,943
- How is Walter doing?

474
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,943
- He's fine. Why?

475
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,905
I don't know.

476
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,905
He's quieter than usual.

477
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,576
Well, he's just turned fifty.

478
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,787
It's a big deal.

479
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,123
I don't imagine what
I'd look like at his age.

480
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,710
- I still have time.

481
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,670
Not so much.

482
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,756
As long as I don't
become crazy like you.

483
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,717
Then, Walter is in a crisis.

484
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,385
No.

485
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,262
He's like that.

486
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,262
He's quiet.

487
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,931
- How's sex?

488
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,931
María!

489
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,143
What?

490
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,146
I guess the answer is that.

491
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,688
What's up?

492
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,941
Won't you help me?

493
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,118
Be careful.

494
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,790
What's this?

495
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,916
It's a treasure.

496
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,586
Look at this.

497
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:22,590
Recovery flask, 800 milliliters.

498
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:22,590
They're scant.

499
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,926
Erlenmeyer flask.

500
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,264
Look at this.

501
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,264
Look at this.

502
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,602
Round bottom flask,
500 milliliters.

503
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,602
Thermo resistant.

504
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,396
I cook in one of those.

505
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,396
In a bigger one.

506
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,734
This is a volumetric flask.

507
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,734
You wouldn't cook
in one of these.

508
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,110
Yes, I do.

509
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,030
Not anymore. This
is for general mixing

510
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,030
and titration.

511
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:50,117
This boiling flask
is for cooking.

512
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,453
Didn't you learn anything
from my chemistry class?

513
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:56,165
No.

514
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:56,165
You flunked me, remember?

515
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,585
No wonder.

516
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,754
Do you know, Mr. Blanco?

517
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:05,466
This isn't a chemistry class.

518
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:05,466
This is art.

519
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,678
Cooking is art.

520
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,678
And I'm and artist.

521
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,013
I cook, and I do it very well.

522
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,013
You can ask.

523
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,516
Don't come here to teach me,
okay?

524
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,268
What you did was shit
considering the place

525
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,268
where you've been doing it.

526
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,479
That place was a shit.

527
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,565
You and I will not make garbage.

528
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:24,318
We will produce a pure and

529
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:24,318
stable product, José Miguel.

530
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,989
Jose. My name is Jose.

531
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,202
What's this?

532
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,120
That's for protection.

533
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,498
Otherwise we'll have
an ambulance outside.

534
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,292
For your information,
the fumes of these chemicals

535
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,292
are toxic.

536
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,002
Do you know what?

537
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,548
You can dress up like a faggot,

538
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,548
an astronaut or a bullfighter.

539
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,091
I won't wear it.

540
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,812
Well,
these can't remain here more than 24 hours.

541
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,856
What?

542
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,856
We're going to cook here.

543
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,526
Here?

544
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,526
We won't cook here!

545
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,820
I don't shit where I eat. No.

546
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,906
Then where are we going to work?

547
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,658
You tell me.

548
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,658
This is your deal, isn't it?

549
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,410
Do it at your place.

550
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,749
That's what I thought.

551
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,295
Well... I don't know.

552
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,295
What if we rented one
of those warehouses.

553
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,839
No, it won't work.

554
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,552
They are far away from here.

555
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,598
It's ideal to do it at a

556
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,598
different place each time.

557
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:39,101
A big truck, or a van.

558
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:39,101
I don't know.

559
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,103
That's it!

560
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,103
That's a good idea.

561
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,398
- Let's prepare a truck.

562
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,398
- Yes, let's prepare a truck.

563
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,901
Where did we get the money?

564
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,152
Let's share the expense equally.

565
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,321
"Let's share the
expense equally."

566
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,824
I don't have any money.

567
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,824
The police took
almost everything.

568
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,786
Almost.

569
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,786
It means you have some.

570
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,749
They owe me some money, but...

571
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,209
But it will take time.

572
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,177
Thanks.

573
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:35,157
This isn't even half
of what we need.

574
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,996
These are the savings
of my whole life.

575
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,581
At least,
I'm contributing with something.

576
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:47,210
You're the drug dealer.

577
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:47,210
Negotiate. See what you can do.

578
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,838
Hey, wait!

579
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,132
Why are you doing this?

580
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,132
Tell me the truth.

581
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,970
Why are you doing it?

582
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,180
I'm doing it for the money,
brother.

583
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,431
Exactly.

584
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,435
No, come on, man.

585
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:08,357
A straight man like you,

586
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:08,357
who looks almost like a
priest around his sixties,

587
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,776
all of a sudden
decides to break bad?

588
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,529
- No.

589
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,529
- Fifty. I'm fifty.

590
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,532
Whatever. Fifty, sixty.

591
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,532
It's the same.

592
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,361
I'm just saying, Mr. Blanco.

593
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:26,000
If you went mad or
if you're depressed,

594
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,086
you have to tell me
because it affects me.

595
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,881
I know exactly what
we're getting into.

596
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:35,968
If you know how it works,
why are you doing it?

597
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,390
Because I'm finally awake.

598
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,562
What?

599
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,402
I like it.

600
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,821
We can look for another design.

601
00:35:56,488 --> 00:36:00,200
The skinny ones
are in fashion now.

602
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,954
No.

603
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,954
Look at that! Look at that!

604
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,459
"Mom, please,
help me zip my trousers."

605
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,922
"Mom, please."

606
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,258
No, leave them.

607
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,258
Don't pay attention to them.

608
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,258
They aren't worth it.

609
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,596
He's such a silly boy.

610
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:26,560
Walter...
- What's wrong with him, mom?

611
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,560
- I don't know.

612
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,898
But don't pay attention to them.

613
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,898
They're very stupid.

614
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,155
Those look really good on you.

615
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,744
"Mommy, please."

616
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,121
"Mommy, please, help me."

617
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,376
What's the matter?

618
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,376
Can you get up by yourself?

619
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,005
Come on! Stand up!

620
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,005
Hit me!

621
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,925
What are you waiting for?

622
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,925
Hit me!

623
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,802
Or do you need your mom?

624
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,973
He's a son of a bitch.

625
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,160
What's this shit?

626
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,704
It's a bus.

627
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,040
We said an equipped truck.

628
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,002
This is equipped, too.

629
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,671
It's a school bus!

630
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,671
That needs to be equipped!

631
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,841
You know?

632
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,859
Why don't you take
a look before talking?

633
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,388
Come on.

634
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:51,061
We removed the seats
to have more room.

635
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:54,356
I have some windows sealed

636
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:54,356
to control the air inside.

637
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,942
These storage tanks
provide us with running water.

638
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,612
This tube is for fumes.

639
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,199
And it also has the
connections you asked for.

640
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,743
This is much worse
than I expected.

641
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,121
What did you expected
with the money you gave me?

642
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,166
You didn't waste my money,
did you?

643
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,835
Are we going to start
mistrusting each other?

644
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,171
This is a mess from
the very beginning!

645
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,174
Then why didn't
you do it yourself?

646
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:25,054
I'm doing this because
I have no choice.

647
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,016
So? What are we going to do?

648
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,691
Let's get the equipment,
and leave.

649
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,571
Ready!

650
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,365
There's nobody here.

651
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:32,204
Only a bear or a tiger
can attack us here.

652
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,291
A tiger?

653
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,709
Sure. There're tigers here,
aren't they?

654
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,130
Let's cook.

655
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:53,433
No. What are you doing?

656
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:53,433
Let's keep straight.

657
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,060
These are my good clothes.

658
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,271
I won't go back home

659
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,271
smelling like methamphetamines.

660
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,163
- Come on!

661
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,163
- After you.

668
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,765
Let's get to work.

669
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,765
I have to go back home today.

670
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,974
Be serious or get out of here!

671
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:58,641
Mr. Blanco,
these... These are crystals

672
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,641
two or three inches long.

673
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,396
This is pure glass!

674
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,396
This is art!

675
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,023
You're an artist!

676
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:08,110
Well, actually,
it's just basic chemistry.

677
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,612
- But thank you.

678
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,612
- Basic chemistry?

679
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:14,657
You're the chef.

680
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:14,657
The best chef ever.

681
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,328
Everybody will want to taste it.

682
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,456
Do you know what?

683
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,456
I have to try this.

684
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,873
No, no, what are you doing?

685
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,710
We produce it, we don't use it.

686
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,464
Since when?

687
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,966
I won't argue with
you about this.

688
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,342
What's next?

689
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,681
Let's cook more.

690
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,601
In the meantime,

691
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:47,524
I know who will buy this.

692
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:01,704
Cat! Cat!

693
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:01,704
Cat! Cat!

694
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:06,251
What's up, crazy man?

695
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:06,251
How are you?

696
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,545
It's a nice dog! Tough!

697
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,672
I had one like that.

698
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:14,009
You should teach him
to go straight to the balls.

699
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,263
Tell me how much you want

700
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,263
and leave the money there.

701
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,850
Listen to me.

702
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,978
I'm not here to buy.

703
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,148
I'm here to sell.

704
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,692
Show me.

705
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,906
Isn't it the finest product

706
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,906
you've seen in your life?

707
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,201
[background
barking and growling]

708
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:42,412
Try it!

709
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:42,412
Go ahead! Try it.

710
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:46,583
[background
barking and growling]

711
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,466
What do you think?

712
00:43:54,591 --> 00:44:01,515
Aaaahhh...
- It's all right.

713
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:01,515
- It's all right?

714
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,101
It's all right to be
the best in the world.

715
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:06,936
What do you think?

716
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,398
Are you back in business?

717
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:13,902
Of course!

718
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:13,902
I have to make a living.

719
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:18,574
After all your cousin
and I went through.

720
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,995
Yes, it was terrible.

721
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,540
My cousin is caught,
and you weren't there.

722
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,251
No, no, no, no.

723
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,337
There's nothing wrong in that.

724
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,173
I was there

725
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,134
with some neighbor lady.

726
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:42,013
When I heard them,
I just reacted.

727
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,061
What happened, Loco?

728
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,061
Emilio and I are like brothers.

729
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,938
Your "brother"

730
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,938
is slightly suspicious.

731
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,148
He thinks you turned him in.

732
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:54,192
What?

733
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,445
No, that is bullshit!

734
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,364
Calm him down.

735
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,364
Tell him he's crazy.

736
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:03,577
- I'm not like that.

737
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:03,577
- Why don't you calm him down?

738
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,955
There's judicial strike.

739
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,955
They can't detain him
for more than 24 hours.

740
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,207
Emilio!

741
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,046
So what, Emilio?

742
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,673
- What's up?

743
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,673
- What?

744
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,009
Okay, okay, okay!

745
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:23,639
- Hey, Loco!

746
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:27,392
- You know,
Jose... You aren't that good

747
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,392
to cook something like this.

748
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:31,020
These are crystals.

749
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:31,020
They weren't
produced in Colombia.

750
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:32,272
Where did you get them?

751
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,900
I didn't know this
was a nudist area.

752
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:25,074
Someone told me that
you've been cooking

753
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:28,244
something very nice
and I want to do business.

754
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,244
Would you work for me?

755
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:32,123
I'd be willing to sell it to you

756
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:32,123
if the price is right.

757
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,809
I know this man, Loco!

758
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,437
He's a cop!

759
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,437
He was there when
the Police caught me!

760
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:56,732
- Yes or no? Yes or no?

761
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:56,732
- Run, Mr. Blanco! Run!

762
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,858
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

763
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,858
- No!

764
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,073
Loco!

765
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,118
I say we cap them both.

766
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,664
Did you really cook that?

767
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,834
It's a damn shame.

768
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,834
You had talent.

769
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,714
No! No, no, please!

770
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,714
Please, don't do it.

771
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,966
Let's make a deal.

772
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,344
Do you want to cook like me?

773
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:31,307
Let us both live,
and I'll teach you my recipe.

774
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,201
Can't you do it faster?

775
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,953
Hurry up.

776
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,628
Ready?

777
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,886
Where's the little boy?

778
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,889
He's tied down there.

779
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,268
You didn't hurt him, did you?

780
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,687
No, he won't die.

781
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,608
Put that cigarette out.

782
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,742
Tell him to put
the cigarette out.

783
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,164
I know why I say it.

784
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,459
Put it out.

785
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:14,888
Jose!

786
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,015
Jose!

787
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,663
What happened, Mr. Blanco?

788
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,663
What did you do to them?

789
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,629
Red phosphorus in
the presence of moisture

790
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:37,090
and accelerated by heat
yields phosphorus hydride,

791
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:43,179
phosphine gas or F205 gas.

792
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:43,179
One good whiff and...

793
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,401
What are we going to do?

794
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,447
We have to clean this up.

795
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:12,309
Where were you?

796
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,570
Walter, I don't know what's

797
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,570
been going on with you lately.

798
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,864
Nothing. I'm fine.

799
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,324
Whatever it is,
I'll tell you this.

800
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,577
I don't like it when
you don't talk to me.

801
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,579
I don't like your silence.

802
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,208
The worst thing you
can do is shut me out.

803
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,913
Walter!

804
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,624
Walter...

805
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,002
