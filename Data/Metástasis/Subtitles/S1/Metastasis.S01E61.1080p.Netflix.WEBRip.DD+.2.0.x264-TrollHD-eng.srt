1
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,107
You can come on out.

2
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:07,210
It's an actual vacuum store.

3
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,861
It says so on the card,
doesn't it?

4
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:12,031
I guess I figured
Vacuum Cleaner Repair

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,093
was just a facade,

6
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,096
a term of art.

7
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,724
Leave your luggage

8
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,933
and step right here.

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,021
There.

10
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,718
What are we going to do
about this?

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,696
I wouldn't like to look

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,323
like a professional boxer.

13
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,492
We'll delete that later.

14
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:42,995
Chin up and hold still.

15
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,457
There.

16
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,320
You'll most likely
end up in Santuario.

17
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,214
Santuario? What's that?

18
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,116
It's a little town,
very cozy.

19
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,971
Very nice weather.

20
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,848
When am I leaving?

21
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,683
It's gonna take me some time

22
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,333
to get your
new situation fixed.

23
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,895
And in the meantime?

24
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,505
Until then,
you're gonna be staying here.

25
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,632
I got a place downstairs,
out of sight.

26
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,218
It's not the Ritz-Carlton
but it's comfortable enough.

27
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,055
How long
are we talking about?

28
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,157
Considering you got your face up

29
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,076
in TV recently,

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,870
maybe not in the best channel

31
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,831
or the best time slot,

32
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,691
I'm thinking, two days.
Maybe three.

33
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,004
The only thing is...

34
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,698
Under these circumstances,
what's another problem?

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,760
I don't like to do this,

36
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,345
and I usually try to avoid it,

37
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,097
but you'll have a bunk mate.

38
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,183
A bunk mate?

39
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,769
Hold on, is he...?

40
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,312
He's still here?

41
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,398
He's a special case.

42
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,734
Gonna take some doing.

43
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,652
How's he holding up?

44
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:01,265
You be the judge.
You can see the room here.

45
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,507
Don't worry, Maria,
we will find him.

46
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,011
We will find Henry
and Gómez.

47
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,575
You have my word.

48
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,375
Stop, the door is open.

49
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,859
Call it in,
get her out of here.

50
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,420
Move.

51
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,558
I, got to his door,

52
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,521
and I could hear music inside.

53
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,397
I knocked on his door.

54
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,591
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

55
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,718
This looks
like a chick flic.

56
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,071
Turn that cry baby off.

57
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,572
Just watch.

58
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,182
It's important
you see something, Joaquín.

59
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,495
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Then, you know, we turn around,</font></i>

60
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,439
and there is this kid
on a dirt bike, looking at us.

61
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,734
Then I heard he was called
Agustín Herrera,

62
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,088
that kid that went missing,

63
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,464
that was everywhere.

64
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:27,619
And then out of nowhere, Peto,
that opie,

65
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,705
pulls out a gun
and shoots the kid.

66
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,309
Like it was nothing.

67
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,729
He just shot him.

68
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:39,381
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is Peto Calderón</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">we're talking about?</font></i>

69
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:45,387
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, that's him,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">he's crazy.</font></i>

70
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,615
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He has no morals,</font></i>

71
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,450
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he has no feelings, he--</font></i>

72
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,561
What do you think
about this?

73
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,397
Let's go and kill
that motherfucker.

74
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,212
Hey, Uncle. Hold up.

75
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:02,964
What? What now?

76
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,240
-No, nothing big.
-So?

77
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,260
I think we should keep him

78
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:08,095
locked up for a while,

79
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,912
get a couple of cooks
under our belt.

80
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,539
Peto, you seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

81
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,125
He ratted you out.
Personally.

82
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,351
No problem.

83
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,712
I know, I know,
but we still got

84
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,814
600 gallons of methylamine.

85
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,758
We can make a lot of
money here.

86
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,593
We've got all the money
in the world.

87
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,780
We won the lottery.

88
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,074
Who gives a shit about meth?

89
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,910
We can make a lot more money

90
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,079
with that meth.

91
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,747
What do you say?

92
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,500
No matter how much you got,

93
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,401
how do you turn
your back on more?

94
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,421
You little...

95
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,530
son of a bitch,
it's the other thing.

96
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,800
No.

97
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,636
It's that Lidia woman.

98
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,997
You're sweet on her,
you little bastard.

99
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,433
You just want to stay here

100
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,960
and keep seeing her
and talking to her
as if you were Romeo.

101
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,562
Right?

102
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,813
Look at his eyes sparkling.

103
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,425
Hey, it's all about this
right here?

104
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,904
Come on.

105
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,073
You can do better.

106
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,391
I mean,
that one's so uptight,

107
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,353
she's probably got a wood
chipper for a coochie.

108
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,313
- Nothing there.
- Ha, ha, ha.

109
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,606
You stick it in down there,
you're pulling back a stump.

110
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,709
No, I think it's the opposite.

111
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,778
She's one of those
who order you around in bed.

112
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,655
This way, that way,
more, less, more, more.

113
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,967
She's always like that.

114
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:29,968
Ha, ha, ha.

115
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,346
The heart wants

116
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,431
what the heart wants,

117
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,058
right?

118
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,893
Let's not get into that.

119
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,253
Let's go back
and watch some more

120
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,316
of that crybaby rat?

121
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,067
How sweet!

122
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,485
Ha, ha, ha.

123
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,966
What?

124
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,384
Nothing.

125
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,081
Don't you want to know
what happened to my hand?

126
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,267
No.

127
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,001
Just as well, it's none
of your business.

128
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:17,032
Make yourself useful.

129
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,854
Give me a list
of hitters,

130
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,108
mercenaries, gunmen,
precise people.

131
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,003
People that don't miss.

132
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,946
Then I need
a background check,

133
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,174
I need every detail.

134
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,009
Make sure there are

135
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,453
no undercover cops
on the team.

136
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:44,502
I need a list
of 15 men to pick from.

137
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,546
Five should do it.
Providing they're the
right men for the job.

138
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,880
- Job?
- Write it down.

139
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,482
Who are we hitting?

140
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,677
What do you mean
who are we hitting?

141
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,072
Who? Saúl.

142
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,326
We're hitting Joaquín.

143
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,744
Peto's uncle and his men.

144
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,997
What?

145
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,525
They murdered Henry,
they stole my money,

146
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,128
everything I worked for.

147
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,296
They have to pay!

148
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,382
Write!

149
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,800
I don't know any hitmen.

150
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,968
Yes, you do!

151
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,429
I'm sure you defended one,

152
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,205
you know a guy
who knows a guy....

153
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,516
Don't play the fool!

154
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,019
I'm paying top dollar.

155
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,313
People need to work, right?

156
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,647
Anyone can do it!

157
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,048
- Walter.
- Think, Saúl!

158
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,510
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

159
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:39,949
Just for old time's sake?

160
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,809
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

161
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,789
Don't leave.

162
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,278
What the fuck
are you talking about?

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,614
Some people might say you're
leaving her high and dry.

164
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,159
As far as the police
are concerned,

165
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,221
Cielo is fine.

166
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,890
She is a blameless victim.

167
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,850
She's not my accomplice.

168
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,311
Yes and no.

169
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,338
The phone call
was a smart move.

170
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,610
It exonerates her.

171
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,238
Odds are it was recorded.

172
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,721
It's gonna play great
for a jury.

173
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,950
But, Walter, this story

174
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,353
runs too deep,
it's too fucked up

175
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,955
to just go away.

176
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,001
What do you think will happen?

177
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,070
- They're going after her.
- She knows nothing, Saúl!

178
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,365
Well, too bad for her, then.
She's got nothing to trade.

179
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,301
This is serious.

180
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,970
There are two agents missing.

181
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,348
They have to show some results.

182
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,892
They will dig into Cielo's life

183
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,586
until they find
something on her.

184
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,672
If they can't catch
Walter Blanco, the big fish,

185
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,383
they will turn her
into the bad guy

186
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,152
to replace you.

187
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,888
She has nothing to do
with this! Nothing!

188
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,476
She must've had something
to do and they'll find it.

189
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,580
First thing they're gonna do,

190
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,356
they will RICO your wife
and kids out of the house.

191
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,817
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

192
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,463
Everything.

193
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,156
Her picture's probably
on TV right now,

194
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,841
next to yours.

195
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,844
Who's gonna hire her?

196
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,055
Saúl, money's no problem!

197
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,848
I know, I know.

198
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,625
I don't mean
to contradict you,

199
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,920
but getting it to her,
it's impossible.

200
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,674
The Feds are just praying
that you'll make contact.

201
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,654
For them to get something.

202
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:44,949
Internet, the phone--

203
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,828
It's all tapped.

204
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,647
If they receive one peso,
they will take it.

205
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,749
By now they must be working

206
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,067
together with the DPA
to try and find you.

207
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,320
They will take
everything you've got,

208
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,506
like they did with Mario.

209
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,299
So you propose what?

210
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,344
I propose what?

211
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:10,642
Stay. Face the music.

212
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,211
I mean, how much time
have you got left?

213
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,506
And you bring a barrel full of
drug money, maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

214
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,817
Maybe they let your family

215
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,571
stay in the house.

216
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,448
And your family can be well off.

217
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:33,271
You think I want to run,
Saúl?

218
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:37,401
I'm doing this
for the good of my family.

219
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,278
What I do,
I do it for my family.

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,365
My money
goes to my children.

221
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,259
Not just this barrel.

222
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,346
All of it!

223
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,456
I'm going to kill him
and his entire crew,

224
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,500
and I'm gonna
take back what is mine

225
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,253
and give it to my children
and then, and only then...

226
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,522
Am I through!

227
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,981
Until then!

228
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,526
Do you understand?

229
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,863
Everything good?

230
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,117
Define "good."

231
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,270
You're set, Saúl,
time to go.

232
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,873
You'll be a little longer.

233
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,274
I'm still working
on transportation.

234
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,626
Change of plans.

235
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,193
- Excuse me?
- Saúl's coming with me.

236
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,631
No, that's not--

237
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,366
Saúl, we're going together.
I can use him.

238
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,786
I'll give you
two or three minutes

239
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,556
to work this thing out.

240
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,332
I'll wait for you up there
or we'll talk later.

241
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,440
No, no, no, no, hold on.

242
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,859
Walter, listen to me.

243
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,679
I'm a civilian,
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

244
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,725
I'm nobody's lawyer.
The fun's over.

245
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,770
From here on out,
I'm Mr. Low Profile.

246
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,772
Just another douche bag
with a job

247
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:57,998
so no one can find me.

248
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,585
I have to start over!

249
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,903
You're still part of this.
Whether you like it or not.

250
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,658
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

251
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,927
You remember what I told you?

252
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,388
It's not over.

253
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:40,916
It's over, Walter.

254
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,211
It's over.

255
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,620
You cooperated
with the Justice.

256
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,673
We will take
all your assets...

257
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,091
Your houses,
your cars...

258
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,655
All your properties...

259
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,618
You have to cooperate...

260
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,335
Is she even listening?

261
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,075
Do you understand
what's happening here?

262
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,554
Yes.

263
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:47,674
I understand that you will use

264
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:44,313
I'm in terrible trouble.

265
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,692
everything in your power

266
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,510
against me and my children
unless I give you Walter.

267
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:41,311
Ma'am, is there anybody
else in the house?

268
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,874
What about your son?

269
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,234
If I go look in his room,
am I gonna see him?

270
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,547
Are you lying to me?

271
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,866
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

272
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:59,496
If this guy
takes his hand away,

273
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,099
are you gonna scream?

274
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,183
Scream or...

275
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,110
Please, my son is not here.

276
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,095
He's at his friend's house.
Please don't hurt my baby.

277
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,530
Shhh...

278
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,664
We got a lot of respect

279
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,166
for professor Blanco.

280
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,777
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

281
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,405
We know that you've
been talking to the police,

282
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,617
and that's okay.
You gotta do that.

283
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,720
But you've seen some people.

284
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:44,958
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,352
Remember her?

286
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,688
Yes.

287
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,982
You said anything about her?

288
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,276
No, I haven't.

289
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,320
You sure about that?

290
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,030
I swear, I didn't say a word.

291
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,267
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

292
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,269
I'm gonna
need you to say it.

293
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,082
I... will... not...

294
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,650
say anything about her.
Ever.

295
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,919
I swear it.

296
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,005
Okay.

297
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,551
When we leave,

298
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,136
you're not gonna go

299
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,162
running to those
police officers out front?

300
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,432
They're out front.

301
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:30,104
No, no, I swear I won't.

302
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,067
Okay. Okay.

303
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:37,111
You know what?

304
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,178
We don't want
to come back here.

305
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,948
Okay?

306
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,991
Mmhmm.

307
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,341
I don't like
the nocturnal meetings.

308
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,636
Stay there,
we'll talk this way.

309
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:25,475
I went to
professor Blanco's house,

310
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,869
we talked to his wife.

311
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,645
You don't...
have to say the name.

312
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,082
Sure.

313
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,419
The message?

314
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,918
was received loud and clear.

315
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,546
Yeah.

316
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,948
Look, I know
you did your best.

317
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,802
But I think right now

318
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,219
a message won't do.

319
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,287
Good evening,
will you have tea as usual?

320
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,957
No, I brought my own.
No, yes...

321
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,625
bring me one
and some sweetener,

322
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,894
I'm out.

323
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,436
Sure.

324
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,347
The person we're talking about
saw my face.

325
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,725
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

326
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,996
I know.

327
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,772
Really, if you'd been there,
I think you'd see it different.

328
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

329
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:18,111
You're not going to have
a problem with her.

330
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,321
I wish I had your
certainty,

331
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,782
but I'm not like
you and your uncle.

332
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,408
I'm not used
to this kind of risk.

333
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,786
We're gonna have
to take a break.

334
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,121
Util things
settle down.

335
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,831
I have 23 kilos
packed and ready to go.

336
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,975
I wish you luck with it.

337
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,977
It's 92%.

338
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,314
92%.

339
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,776
Tested it twice.

340
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:48,099
And it's blue.
Just like before.

341
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,451
Lidia...

342
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:54,355
-92%, that's Heisenberg level.
-Mmhmm.

343
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,916
He's not... with you?

344
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,463
Well, next best thing, Rosas.

345
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,924
They're looking for him.

346
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,869
Well, they're not going
to find him, he's with us,

347
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,473
and he's not going anywhere.

348
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,333
Lidia, this is what
your guys in Europe

349
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,436
have been begging for, right?

350
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,047
I just think
we work together... good.

351
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,898
We make a good team.

352
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,945
It's mutually good.

353
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,327
92%?

354
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:05,254
I'll show you the way,

355
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,238
the only entrance,
we'll unload later.

356
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:35,201
Welcome to your new identity

357
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,826
and your new house.

358
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:56,371
Kitchen, bathroom,
bedroom, deposit.

359
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,539
You got about a month's
worth of food on hand,

360
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,351
most of it's canned goods,

361
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,811
but there's steaks

362
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,604
in the freezer.

363
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,275
You got a generator outside,

364
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,194
ought to be enough in the tank

365
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,429
to last a month,
providing you save up

366
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,280
and use it moderately.

367
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:21,312
There's no heat
or chimney here,

368
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,481
there are some blankets
if you're cold.

369
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,359
There's no TV either.
Mountains won't allow us
to have any signal at all.

370
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,404
The reception's
pretty much nil.

371
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,465
There are some books here.

372
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,992
I hope they're good,
Literature is not my thing.

373
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,745
If you need anything
from the outside,

374
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:41,183
I'll need some notice.

375
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,542
That means I'm paying you
50 million pesos

376
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:47,046
to bring me food
once a month?

377
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,191
Well, yes.

378
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:53,112
It's a risk, Walter.

379
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,490
I'm protecting you.

380
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,285
It's no that I'm charging you

381
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,186
for the deodorant,
or the cans.
And we are very far away--

382
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,124
Yes, that's clear.

383
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,942
My clients and I don't usually
have an ongoing relationship.

384
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:11,171
Normally, you and I

385
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,906
would have already gone
our separate ways,

386
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,927
but you're you.

387
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,387
Where's the phone?

388
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,806
No phone, Walter,

389
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,891
there's no signal here,

390
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,625
so no one will be able
to trace you.

391
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,770
There's no car either

392
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,465
so you don't go running
into the wolf's mouth.

393
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,568
Whatever you need, just...

394
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,012
I know, you'll bring it
once a month.

395
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,115
Look, I have business

396
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,618
to conduct..

397
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,496
Your business is your business.

398
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,646
My business is keeping
you out of custody.

399
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,248
That's my business.

400
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,508
What if I need to go out?

401
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,135
If I want to go out?

402
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,387
You can walk up to the fence

403
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,621
or walk down
to the nearest town,

404
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,124
it's 15 kilometers away,
all I'm saying is,

405
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,001
if you leave this place,
you will get caught.

406
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,795
And, I gotta tell you,
if I find out that

407
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,898
you've left the reservation,

408
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,817
I won't be coming back.

409
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,111
You understand?

410
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,654
Sure.

411
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,032
Okay, fine.

412
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:23,809
Let's get the things
out of the truck,

413
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,354
you'll tell me what you need
and I'm off.

414
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,015
Tomorrow.

415
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,698
- Thank you, uncle.
- Come on.

416
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,118
Rosas, you awake?

417
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,578
Yeah.

418
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,537
Okay.

419
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:27,535
I wanted
to congratulate you, Jose.

420
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,246
That batch that you
just cooked was 92%.

421
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,516
Thanks.

422
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,100
You know what?

423
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,794
We just went
by the bakers' store

424
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,964
and got some donuts
fresh out of the oven.

425
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,776
Okay.

426
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:54,580
Peto!

427
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,666
What?

428
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,776
Would you mind
leaving the tarp off tonight?

429
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,045
Please.

430
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,529
I don't think it's
going to rain.

431
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,674
Might get cold.

432
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:09,285
I just...
I just wanna see the stars.

433
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,556
I like the stars too.

434
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,933
Sure. Okay.

435
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,433
See you tomorrow.

436
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,355
Got a whole new batch.

437
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,481
Sure.

438
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,940
Goodnight.

439
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,287
Run, run!

440
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,997
Come on!

441
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,169
Hold still!

442
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,920
Just kill me now!

443
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:11,574
What did you do
that for?

444
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,159
Kill me now because there's no
way I'm doing one more cook!

445
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,970
You psycho fucks!

446
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,872
What do you think
you're doing?

447
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,289
Where do you think
you're going?

448
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,584
You think
you're going anywhere?

449
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,061
Get walking.

450
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,145
Bring him over here.

451
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,523
Come on!

452
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,815
Do as you're told!

453
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,276
Where was he going?

454
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,240
Hi!

455
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,057
Hello.
You're Andrea Cantillo, right?

456
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,410
Yes.

457
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,286
How can I help you?

458
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,480
Hi, I'm Peto, I'm a friend of
José Miguel Rosas.

459
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,816
Are you a friend of Jose's?
How are you?

460
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,085
I'm fine, thank you.

461
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,294
How can I help you?

462
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,421
You used to date, right?

463
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:52,030
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here
so late.

464
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:56,410
I was calling him last week
but I got no answer.

465
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:57,804
That's why I'm here.

466
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,472
Do you know how Jose is?

467
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,040
Fine.
He keeps talking about you.

468
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,393
Peto Calderón.

469
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,811
Nice to meet you.

470
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:07,188
Do you know where he is?

471
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,881
Yeah, he's right...
over there.

472
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,650
In that truck.

473
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,217
He didn't want to get down,
he felt embarrassed.

474
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,486
Wait, he's here?

475
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,154
I wanted to meet you--

476
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,115
How come?

477
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,033
Andrea, no!

478
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,035
Andrea!

479
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,667
Andrea!

480
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,755
No! Andrea! No!

481
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,427
Andrea!

482
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:44,058
Now, now, it's over.

483
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,168
Hey, remember.
There's still the kid.

484
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,562
He's still in there.

485
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,730
Think about that.

486
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,146
Did you bring
the glasses I asked for?

487
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,941
Without a prescription,
I had to take an educated guess
and shotgun it.

488
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,193
One of these
ought to come close.

489
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,791
Do you have news
from Cielo?

490
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,895
Is she in a better place?

491
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,713
Nah, she's still at that
place with the kids.

492
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:57,776
There's no court date yet.

493
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,302
The news was talking
about a grand jury,

494
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:04,532
but they didn't say when.

495
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,977
I saw her
public defender on TV.

496
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,328
These will do.

497
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,705
Really?

498
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,879
What are they doing for money?

499
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:21,115
She's working part-time
in a call center.

500
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:24,427
She dispatches taxis.

501
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:29,123
Leaves the baby with a neighbor
when she goes in.

502
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:32,226
She looks pretty good.

503
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,105
It seems.

504
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:37,965
I took a run
by your old house.

505
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,359
And?

506
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,302
The auction's
still pending.

507
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,488
Put a fence around it.

508
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,573
They put up a fence?

509
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,891
To keep the homeless
from coming in,

510
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,144
they were using it
as a hotel.

511
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,787
The neighbors complained.

512
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,627
You ready?

513
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,214
Yeah.

514
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:08,745
Sorry about last time.
It should go better now.

515
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:14,210
I watched a couple
of YouTube videos.

516
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,629
It's all about
finding the vein.

517
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,399
That's the important thing.

518
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,402
Let's see.

519
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,520
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

520
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,565
Here.
You-- you do it.

521
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:45,074
I'll leave this here.

522
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,436
All right.

523
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,055
I will see you on
the afternoon of the 15th.

524
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:09,908
Stay a little longer?

525
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,850
Yeah, I got a long trip
ahead of me.

526
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,828
It's really far.

527
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:22,360
I'll give you
another 15 million.

528
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,047
Just for a while.

529
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,509
15 million.

530
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,304
One hour.

531
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,182
Cards?

532
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,183
Yes.

533
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,602
Well.

534
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:40,229
I guess I'll deal.

535
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,402
Poker?

536
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:50,306
One of these days when you
come up here I'll be dead.

537
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,267
And all my money
is over there.

538
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,495
What will you do?

539
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:01,483
Will you give it
to my family?

540
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,319
Would you do it
if I asked you to?

541
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,283
If I said yes,
would you believe me?

543
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,023
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class,
it's your Aunt María.
It sounds very important.

544
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,500
You can take it in here, okay?

545
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,920
Go on.

546
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,220
Hi!

547
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,430
Here he is.

548
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:50,729
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Aunt María?</font></i>

549
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,191
Junior, it's me.

550
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,902
Don't hang up, please.

552

It's so good
to hear your voice.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I...</font></i>

554
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:23,620
Son, the things

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I did wrong.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I made some terrible mistakes.</font></i>

556

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Things happened that...</font></i>

558
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:45,701
I-- I never... intended.

559
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:50,397
Junior, your friend Lucho,
does his family still live

560

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">in that same place?</font></i>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's a good kid.</font></i>

563

He'll understand.

This is what
we are going to do.

566
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,680
I'm sending Louis a package.

567
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,750
It's addressed to Louis,
but it's for you.

568
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:15,523
Your mother and your sister.

569
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,816
Okay?

570
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,404
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">There's money inside.</font></i>

571

572
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,326
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Some 200 million pesos.</font></i>

573
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,745
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It has to be a secret.</font></i>

574
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,206
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And if anyone says a word,</font></i>

575
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,458
then...

00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:35,793
the police will know

577
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,754
and they will take it.

578
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,965
You understand?

579
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:45,827
I wanted to give you much more,
but this is all I could do.

580
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:51,476

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes. Good.</font></i>

584
00:45:57,172 --> 00:46:00,485
You'll talk to Louis, right?

585
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,695
Why don't you shut up?

586
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,180
Junior, Junior,
your mother needs that money.

587
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,741
It can't all be for nothing.

588
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,578
Please, Junior.

589
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,121
Why are you still alive?

590
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,938
Why don't you just die
already?

investigation.

595

602
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,512
Double.
