1
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,773
Hello? Cielo, babe.

2
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,386
María, hi.
What?

3
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,447
She was born?

4
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,616
And how is she?

5
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:01,813
Is she all right?
Is everything okay?

6
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,916
Thank God!

7
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,877
No, no.

8
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,378
I'm stuck here on the 30.

9
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,823
I think there was
an accident. I don't know.

10
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:15,242
No, no, no,
don't wake her up.

11
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,929
Tell her I'm on my way.

12
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:20,472
I'll be there any second now.

13
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,334
Fine, thanks.
See you.

14
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,892
Cielo, babe.

15
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,981
Meet your daughter.

16
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,024
Hi.

17
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,705
Congratulations, Walter.

18
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,441
Ernesto, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

19
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,836
Don't worry.

20
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,447
Ernesto brought
me here.

21
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,909
Valentina wanted to come
out so hard

22
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,577
that we thought she was going
to come in the car.

23
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,220
Yes.

24
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,973
Almost like in the news.

25
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,558
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

26
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,977
Thank you, Ernesto.

27
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,395
No, it's my pleasure.

28
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,272
I'm going to leave

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,567
so you three are alone.

30
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:58,721
Thank you.
I can't thank you enough.

31
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,240
No, it's my pleasure.

32
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,950
It's what I had to do.

33
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,477
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

34
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:06,996
Bye, Walter.

35
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,041
See you.

36
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,908
Are you okay?
Is everything okay?

37
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,011
Yes, I'm perfect.

38
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,125
I just wish
you'd been here.

39
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,688
And the rest?

40
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,049
Henry and María
took Junior

41
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,093
to eat
something.

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,011
He has been
such a trooper.

43
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,679
He even changed
his first diaper.

44
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:45,810
- Did he?
- Yes.

45
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,228
You need anything?
You want me to bring you
anything?

46
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,372
The bag with Valentina's stuff.

47
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,565
Since it was going
to be a C-section,

48
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,709
I left it at home.

49
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,069
Just let me look at her
one more second

50
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,172
and I'll go for it.

51
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,093
You know?

52
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:05,537
I'm glad I did it
naturally instead.

53
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,665
It couldn't have gone
any better.

54
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,768
I'm so proud of you.

55
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,930
Hi, dad.

56
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,682
Hi, daddy.

57
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:36,461
I was in the shower
and didn't hear the phone.

58
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:40,340
I overslept, but
I'm on my way, I swear.

59
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,484
Yes, I'm on my way right now.

60
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,445
Okay, see you. Bye.

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,409
Baby, I have to go.

62
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,452
Bye.

63
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,710
Hey, I think somebody

64
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,962
broke in.

65
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,965
It's all right.

66
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,405
No, please, no.

67
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,407
Please, no!

68
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,662
Son of a bitch!

69
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,629
This week was tough.

70
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,052
Really tough.

71
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,055
It was my birthday and...

72
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,681
You know how everything

73
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,642
turns into a temptation.

74
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,645
I didn't feel good.

75
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,485
So I called my boss

76
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,488
and I told him

77
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,491
that I was sick.

78
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,063
I think my boss
didn't like it.

79
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,917
But what could I do?

80
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,612
As soon as I got out on the
street and met a friend...

81
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,173
Damn!

82
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,303
I'd fall back.

83
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,080
It's better to be alone
than in bad company.

84
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,546
I've got one year clean
to the day.

85
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,068
I'm clean.

86
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,029
I haven't fallen.

87
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,495
Bye.

88
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,497
So how are you?

89
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,067
Fine, daddy.
Fine.

90
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,278
Well, tell me something
about you.

91
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,630
There's not much to tell.

92
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,324
Everything is
just the same.

93
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,577
I just work on
my drawings,

94
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,887
a take care of my plants.

95
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,122
My days are
pretty boring,

96
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,641
but that's good news.

97
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,169
That means I'm doing
all right.

98
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,273
Yes, but you look tired.

99
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,508
- Are you getting enough sleep?
- Yes.

100
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,694
Yes, the thing is...

101
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,722
I'm working
an a new schedule.

102
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,699
I get inspired at night

103
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,326
and I'm working on a tattoo

104
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,643
that has me
sort of obsessed.

105
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,205
But it's almost finished.

106
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,483
I don't like you working
in that place.

107
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,860
I've already told you
it's not the same

108
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,546
as working at a bar.

109
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,156
Yes, but people
who get tattoos...

110
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,632
I don't think they're--

111
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,593
Look, I know, I know.

112
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,887
But I'm telling you

113
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,122
that not everyone
who gets a tattoo

114
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,639
is on drugs.

115
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,517
No, but most do.

116
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,168
I'm talking about
healthy students.

117
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,753
Nice little guys that go
and get a tattoo.

118
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,689
That's all.

119
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,006
It's not the same
it used to be.

120
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,591
- I hope so.
- Yes.

121
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,427
But let's talk
about something else.

122
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,844
- How's your job doing?
- Fine.

123
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,514
Sometimes I have to work
double shift,

124
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,599
they haven't raised my salary
in three years.

125
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,326
We have a lot of work.

126
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,979
Some are working abroad
and they get a better pay,

127
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,289
they have holidays.

128
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:27,292
Are you seeing anyone?

129
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,866
Look like we're playing
not to talk about oneself

130
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,285
and get information
from the other.

131
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,802
But I asked you first.

132
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,163
No.
- Yes.

133
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,664
No, I'm not seeing
anyone.

134
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,500
And you?
Is there anyone?

135
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,142
I'm just asking

136
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,128
because the other day
when I went to your place,

137
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,256
the guy next door
sort of wanted to talk to me.

138
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,316
Or kind of, right?

139
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:56,221
Must be because he knows
you're the owner.

140
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,282
You don't believe me?

141
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,057
Why would he want
to talk to you?

142
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,076
Dad, I'm not seeing anyone.

143
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,312
I don't want
to be with anyone now,

144
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,913
much less your tenant.

145
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,648
My life is way too
complicated

146
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,708
to get in deeper trouble.

147
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,278
I don't know.
I just think

148
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,197
sometimes it's good
to get someone

149
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,073
to be with you,
you get me?

150
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,342
At least to drink some wine.

151
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,286
- Whatever.
- Yes.

152
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,955
It's so weird to talk
about this with you, dad.

153
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,515
For real.

154
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,334
Just stop it.
Let's discuss something else.

155
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,169
Let's get some breakfast.
I didn't eat anything.

156
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,853
Fine, I'm sorry.

157
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,506
You didn't have breakfast?
That's what I'm talking about.

158
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,692
Are we starting all over?

159
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,470
- I'm hungry, that's all.
- Okay, I'll pay. Let's go.

160
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,894
She's just like her
mom.

161
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,425
I'll get it.

162
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:19,863
Hello?

163
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,620
Who was that?

164
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,623
They hanged up.

165
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,714
I won!

166
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,157
Watch your reflexes.
Hello?

167
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,925
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello, Walter. It's me.</font></i>

168
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,581
Hi, Carmen, did you
hear the news?

169
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,182
Can you talk now?

170
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:51,186
Yes, she's so beautiful.

171
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,814
Yes, she did it great.

172
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,508
Why are you calling me
home,

173
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,068
fucking junkie?

174
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,278
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, I know, I know, bitch.</font></i>

175
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,447
I called your cell phone

176
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,823
and you didn't answer.

177
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,367
It's an emergency.

178
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,311
Somebody broke in my place.
I got robbed.

179
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,870
What?

180
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,330
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, all the product.</font></i>

181
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,665
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The blue meth is gone.</font></i>

182
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,124
It's a mystery.

183
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,543
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Are you listening?</font></i>

184
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,944
This is serious
stuff!

185
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,362
They knew exactly
where to look for it.

186
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:20,324
It's as though
they were watching us.

187
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,576
Walter, say something!
Answer me!

188
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,868
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Scream at me!</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">So something!</font></i>

189
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,470
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Just react!</font></i>

190
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:29,974
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello? Walter? Walter?</font></i>

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,018
Damn!

192
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,830
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Family, chicken is here.</font></i>

193
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,792
Joint, legs, tights.

194
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,710
What do you want?

195
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,655
- Cool.
- Watch it. It's hot.

196
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,617
- Smells good.
- Yes, it smells delicious.

197
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,993
- Pollos Hermanos?
- Yes, yes.

198
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,412
The name is not that good,
but the moment you try

199
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,141
those tights,

200
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,585
you won't ever forget it.
Believe me.

201
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,587
We cops
eat lots of chicken.

202
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,173
- Right, babe?
- Yes.

203
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,066
She must be hungry.

204
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,927
- You think so?
- Yes.

205
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,865
Cielo...

206
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,241
Cielo, just hold on.

207
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,060
- Are you breasting her?
- Of course!

208
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,745
Babe, please.

209
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,855
The baby has to eat.
That's normal.

210
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,816
Yes, but it's
my sister-in-law's breast.

211
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,193
We're at the table.
Come on.

212
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,837
Then look aside, Henry.

213
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,572
That's even worse.
If you tell me "look aside",

214
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,173
I'll want to look.

215
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,366
Henry, can I ask
you something?

216
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,009
Sure.

217
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,786
You told me about
a security system

218
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,304
for the baby.

219
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,722
Yes, an intercom.

220
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,140
Yes, that's it.

221
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,809
Well, I was thinking

222
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,544
about something more
modern.

223
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,047
There are some alarms
with movement sensors

224
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,882
in case something falls
on the floor and--

225
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,426
- That sounds expensive.
- Thanks, aunt.

226
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,303
Yes, but that's the best
for Valentina.

227
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,948
Babe, we'll get that for you.

228
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,408
No, no, it's not necessary.

229
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,993
Come on, man!

230
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,229
No, No.
Besides, I'll go back to work

231
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,789
in a couple of days, so--

232
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,025
- Back to work?
- Of course.

233
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,986
Babe, you have
a scheduled surgery.

234
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,631
We have to pay for that.

235
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,408
We have to keep
that income.

236
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,343
Look.

237
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,830
We have to think about what's
best for the baby.

238
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,750
And the best is for her
to be with her mom.

239
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,294
At least during
the first year.

240
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,838
If we get organized, I can take
care of everything.

241
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,757
You guys got a printing press
in the garage

242
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,484
churning out 50s?

243
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,929
I wish, uncle!
mom's even talking

244
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,573
abut me getting a job.

245
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,643
- Really?
- Of course..

246
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,994
Some part-time job

247
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,705
that leaves him time to study.

248
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,483
But he should help us
with the bills.

249
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,444
Sure. I'll work
as a waiter.

250
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,962
I don't get it.

251
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,297
No one would hire me

252
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,259
in a job like that.

253
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,853
Give her the bottle.

254
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,855
I'll get her.

255
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,900
It's ready.

256
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,075
Hi.

257
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,077
Come.

258
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,121
Yes.

259
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,447
You want to see what daddy
did for you?

260
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:00,852
All this is yours.

261
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,814
Daddy got it for you.

262
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,554
This place
looks exactly the same.

263
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,556
At least get some
computers.

264
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,224
It's the 21st
century.

265
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,768
What the hell
are you doing here, asshole?

266
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,996
You took the meth!

267
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,647
I heard those messages
and figured it out.

268
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,106
- Did you?
- Yes.

269
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,942
Did you really
figure it out?

270
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,502
You're a genius!

271
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,378
You should work at the CIA!

272
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,655
You left me freak out
all day long,

273
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,616
like I dropped the ball!
I was about to go nuts.

274
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,410
You can't break
into someone's house

275
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,595
just like that!

276
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,164
Shut up!
And lower your voice.

277
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,808
Stop saying

278
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,643
"as I'd dropped the ball".

279
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,980
You always drop the ball!

280
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,965
We were about to lose
the most important deal

281
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,441
we've had so far

282
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,946
because of you.

283
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,032
What did you do this time

284
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,852
that you didn't even react
with my yelling?

285
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,229
What was that shit?
Heroine?

286
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,481
- Damn.
- You know what?

287
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,024
I was on my day
off

288
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,402
and I can do
whatever I want.

289
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,363
- Your day off?
- Yes..

290
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,923
Don't be so shameless.

291
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,383
You knew perfectly well

292
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,159
that we had
an important meeting,

293
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,803
piece of shit!

294
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,332
And I was there and solved it
without your help!

295
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,393
By the way, thank you.

296
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,170
You made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

297
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:32,844
- How much?
- How much what??

298
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,142
How much did they pay you?
1.2 million dollars.

299
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,769
So I get half
of that,

300
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,245
right?

301
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,872
No.

302
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,650
We have to take Saúl share.
That's 20%.

303
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,755
So where's the money?

304
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,496
Are you really
fucking kidding me?

305
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,957
You really think
I'll give you that money

306
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,375
so that you go and spend it
on heroine,

307
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,436
on coke, on some shit?

308
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,896
You'd be dead

309
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,313
in a week.

310
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,815
No, sir.

311
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,843
I tried heroine
once

312
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,053
and I didn't like it
because it made me...

313
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,613
Sick.

314
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,931
- Really?
- Yes.

315
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,617
And I'm clean of meth.

316
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,435
I no longer do that.
I'm clean.

317
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,270
- Are you?

318
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,373
- Yes.

319
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,273
- I'm clean.

320
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,294
Pee in that.

321
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,279
Can't you stop saying
so much bullshit?

322
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,881
Have it tested

323
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,340
at a drugstore.

324
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,801
Show me you're clean

325
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,536
and I'll give you
every last dime

326
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,722
of your share.

327
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:47,251
What is it?
You can't do that?

328
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,671
From now on
you'll have to ask some friend

329
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,189
to pay for you to high.

330
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,232
You should begin

331
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,010
with that junkie girlfriend
you have.

332
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:14,253
you'll wake her up.

333
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,153
Walter, be careful,

334
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,655
María,
I won't wake her up.

335
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,281
I have to change
her diaper.

336
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,176
Yes, but she's sleeping.

337
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,013
Give me a towel.

338
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,931
Hey, these towels...

339
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,557
They sell

340
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,976
hypoallergenic towels.

341
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,393
This is old stuff.

342
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,854
It doesn't matter.

343
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,714
It's good enough.
Give me one.

344
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,273
Grab this for a second.

345
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,692
Clean your hands first

346
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,695
and then get one.

347
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,602
Done.
Can you give me one?

348
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,248
You have to see this.

349
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,608
It's something Junior did.
Come.

350
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,169
Babe, I'm changing her diaper.

351
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,528
Just leave her.
I'll change it.

352
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,963
- Cover her.

353
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,840
Come, come.

354
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,218
What did he do?

355
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,720
Come.

356
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,513
Look.

357
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,999
Mom, I told you
it wasn't ready yet.

358
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,935
Honey, show your dad.

359
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,980
It's so sweet, Junior!

360
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:21,012
- Morgan...
- I mean, Morgan.

361
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,099
No,
wait a second.

362
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,059
You're not asking for money,
are you?

363
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,019
Yes, done.
It's for the donations.

364
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,996
There's the account number

365
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,414
so that hey make the deposit.

366
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,066
No, no,
we can't do this.

367
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:37,795
Hey, Walter.

368
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,199
But it's okay.
The page is really nice.

369
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,385
Thanks.

370
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,137
What else will you add?

371
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:50,541
Why don't you put a picture
of the whole family?

372
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,627
- What is it?
- Babe.

373
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,420
He worked really hard
on that project.

374
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,022
Let him help.

375
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,966
- Cielo, it's--
- Please.

376
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,761
If you don't let him,
he'll get really sad.

377
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,571
That's beggary.

378
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,365
That's such a hard word.

379
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,892
I don't know.
Charity.

380
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,037
What's wrong with it?

381
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,856
Or do you have
extra money?

382
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,589
This makes no sense.

383
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,049
I have so much money

384
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,509
that I can't even count it.

385
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,996
I had to weight it
in the bathroom scale.

386
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,999
Even like that,
I can't use it.

387
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,543
I can't tell my family
I have it.

388
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,061
People think

389
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,105
I'm starving and I--

390
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,550
Look, you never thought
about telling your wife?

391
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,069
No, not by any chance.

392
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,555
Why don't you get a lover
then?

393
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,973
What does that have to do
with it?

394
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,992
What does it have to do?

395
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,102
Some fresh meat
is always welcome.

396
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,412
Besides, you'd have someone

397
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,814
to share your
secrets with

398
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,315
and that would help you
get it all out.

399
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,626
I have enough problems

400
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,128
to keep on adding.

401
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,946
- No way, Saúl!
- Fine, fine.

402
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,547
I was just brainstorming.

403
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,008
We don't have to buy

404
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,993
the first option
that comes to mind.

405
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,845
I know!

406
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,996
What about telling
them you found a bag

407
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,957
full of money at
the bus terminal?

408
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,433
Get serious, man!

409
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,603
That has worked for me.

410
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,464
The uncle!
That's it!

411
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,633
You got an inheritance
from a depraved uncle

412
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,594
that abused you
when you were a child.

413
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:28,014
No! it can't be something
out of the blue!

414
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,974
Besides, I never had
a pervert uncle.

415
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,119
No, I earned that money!

416
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,771
Me, the one that appears
on that page

417
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,689
my son designed
to ask for charity.

418
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,791
SalvemosaWalter.com.

419
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,193
- No.
-Yes.

420
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:43,129
Just look at this.

421
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,948
There's even an
account number.

422
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,674
Very good!

423
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,160
Good?
Good for what?

424
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:52,805
To beg?

425
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,708
Walter, I think we have
the solution

426
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,043
right in front of
our noses.

427
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,853
No, forget it, Saúl!

428
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,964
I'm not putting my money in
there.

429
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,007
It'll look like some benefactor
saved me.

430
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,051
No, I'm not talking
about one benefactor,

431
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,694
singular.

432
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,138
I'm talking about
lots of benefactors,

433
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,697
do you get me?

434
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,974
Unintentional
figureheads.

435
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,034
All we need

436
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,894
is an illusionist,
a hypnotist,

437
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,040
a miracle wonder.

438
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,359
Don't look at me
like that.

439
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,693
I'm not asking
you to parachute.

440
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,254
Listen to me.

441
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,796
I have a cousin in Venezuela

442
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,615
that knows this
business pretty well.

443
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,052
He knows a hacker

444
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,912
than can get in any
personal computer

445
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,998
in the world
and make them do

446
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,125
whatever he wants
without them realizing it.

447
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,127
An illusionist,
a miracle wonder.

448
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,087
Can you imagine
getting donations

449
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,897
from anywhere in Colombia?

450
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,134
Or from other
Latin American countries?

451
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,593
They're all so
good-hearted.

452
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,720
Or 1,000 or 2,000
dollars

453
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,240
from some American.

454
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,309
Or Euros from any part
of the world.

455
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,435
There are generous
people everywhere.

456
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,481
Solitary people that
will be really happy to be part

457
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,942
of the salvation
of Walter Blanco,

458
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,003
the martyr of cancer.

459
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,590
That guy's an idiot.

460
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,634
He's always judging me.

461
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,411
- Okay, fine.
- Who does he think he is?

462
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,513
I taught him all this.

463
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,290
So now what?
I'm the slave?

464
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,891
No, no way.

465
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,335
- Okay, stop it.
- Right?

466
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,255
- So now what? The needle?
- Yes.

467
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,441
I don't understand

468
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,926
what you need
that guy for.

469
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:33,181
Exactly.
That's the point.

470
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,617
I don't need that dude.

471
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,520
- Ready?
- Yes, your arm.

472
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,875
Flat against your skin

473
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,110
so it doesn't
wiggle around

474
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,962
too much.

475
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,906
- This way?
- Yes.

476
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,910
How much does he owe
you?

477
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:58,515
480 thousand.

478
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,333
I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me

479
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,336
480 thousand
pesos.

480
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:08,816
Not pesos, dollars.

481
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,943
What?

482
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,804
Hold on, hold on.
How much?

483
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,867
480 thousand dollars.

484
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,329
Bay, turn.

485
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,980
On your side in
case you throw up.

486
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,082
That's it.

487
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,658
He tells me
not to preach him,

488
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,803
not to tell him off,

489
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,764
but he doesn't get it.

490
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:50,216
But I tell him
I'm not preaching him.

491
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,969
Part of the process
is taking about things,

492
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,072
facing them.

493
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,506
Hi, daddy.

494
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,132
I was sleeping.

495
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,551
I overslept

496
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,843
but I'm coming.

497
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,846
Okay, bye.

498
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,906
Wait, wait.

499
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,911
No, no, no...

500
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,710
No, no, let him go.

501
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,254
Let him go!

502
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,489
Let me go!
What's wrong with you?

503
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,533
Just leave him.
Come on.

504
00:26:56,657 --> 00:27:00,661
What's up with this
dude, Juana?

505
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,221
You're a fucking junkie!

506
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,722
Get out of my house right now!

507
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm not going anywhere!

508
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,310
I pay for my rent!

509
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,852
You're bullshit!

510
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,313
I have my human right!

511
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:15,218
Juana, you'll start rehab
right now!

512
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,736
Daddy, this just happened.

513
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,030
We were talking about it.

514
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,640
- I was going to tell you...
- Were you?

515
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,701
I was going to tell you, yes.

516
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,703
If you'd just let me.

517
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:28,747
Juana, what happened?

518
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,859
You were clean for 18 months.
18.

519
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,363
Why do you do this to you?
To me?

520
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,074
I'm using again,
I accept it.

521
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,201
But do you think
I do it because I like it?

522
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,661
You think I do it
on purpose?

523
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,847
You think I'm proud of myself?

524
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,474
That's why

525
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,791
you mess around
with this bastard.

526
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,419
You must know that for
yourself.

527
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,688
He's José.

528
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,633
You can't judge him
because you don't know him, dad.

529
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,177
We talk about rehab
all the time.

530
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,530
Sure, you talk.

531
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,448
That's wonderful, isn't it?

532
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,992
So you talk?

533
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,354
Thanks for trying
to understand.

534
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,707
That's just what I need.

535
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,982
Someone judging me
all the time,

536
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,043
telling me I'm weak.

537
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,545
Damn!

538
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,549
Juana, don't manipulate me.

539
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,700
I've spent ten years,
ten years!

540
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,827
trying to do
the best I can for you

541
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,388
in the good way.

542
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,830
But if you want
the hard way,

543
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,432
I'll do it.

544
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,933
Let's call the police.

545
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,252
- No, no.
- Mr. Diego.

546
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,629
Let's calm down,
please.

547
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,731
Please, dad, no.

548
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,549
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">National Police.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">How can I help you?</font></i>

549
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,108
This is Diego Maldonado.

550
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,319
There's a stranger at home

551
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,679
and I need you to come
right away.

552
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,264
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Is he dangerous?</font></i>
- He's dangerous, yes.

553
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,699
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Give me your address, please.</font></i>

554
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,158
Sure, the address...

555
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,661
I'll start rehab tomorrow.

556
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,439
- Hello? Hello, Mr. Diego?
- Just a moment, please.

557
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:56,193
- Today!

558
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,333
- Tomorrow.

559
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,293
- I have to pack.

560
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,920
Just let me pack

561
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,047
and hand in

562
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,074
the design of the tattoo
I'm working on.

563
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,093
And I'll find someone

564
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,744
to take care of my plants
because you let it die.

565
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,346
Remember?

566
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,306
I don't want this one to die,

567
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,725
so, please, tomorrow.

568
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,586
I swear, okay?
I swear.

569
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:27,157
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

570
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,478
Juana...
Juana, listen to me.

571
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,956
You and I have each other.

572
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,458
There's no one else.

573
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,901
People who get in your life
are just that,

574
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,087
they get in and out.

575
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,407
You can't be an ex-dad
or an ex-daughter.

576
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,703
Do you have an idea
how much I love you?

577
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,345
Yes.

578
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,207
- You'll keep your promise?
- Yes, sir.

579
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,168
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

580
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,534
Juana...

581
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,453
Do you really mean

582
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,314
everything you've
just said?

583
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,458
If we had enough money,

584
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,276
nobody could make us
do anything.

585
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,421
Are you okay?

586
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:42,841
- Just let it ring.
- No, I'm going.

587
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,840
No, don't worry.

588
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,866
I think he'll be glad
to help you.

589
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,426
Just hold on a moment.

590
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,011
Babe, it's an ex-student.

591
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,680
She's studying journalism

592
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,014
and wants to interview you.

593
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,185
What?

594
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,964
- I think she's hungry.
- Come, babe.

595
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,012
Hello.
Who's this?

596
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,973
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is Juana,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">José' girlfriend.</font></i>

597
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,909
Or how you like to call me:

598
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,351
"The junkie".
How are you?

599
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,228
Yes, yes.
Of course I remember
you.

600
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,872
How are you?

601
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:43,193
Tell me, how can I help
you?

602
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,946
Who gave you this number?
José Miguel?

603
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,575
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">José,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">he likes being called José.</font></i>

604
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,369
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Whatever.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You don't have to call me</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">home,</font></i>

605
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,304
so please--

606
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,265
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Wait, wait.</font></i>

607
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,083
If you hand,
it'll be worse for you.

608
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,769
What do you mean?

609
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,379
I'm calling to ask
for what belong to José.

610
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,523
No more, no less.

611
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,716
What are you talking
about?

612
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,568
Don't pretend

613
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,428
you don't know
what I'm talking about.

614
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,447
We're talking about José money.

615
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,532
His half.

616
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,975
José told you about
the money?

617
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,828
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He tells me everything.</font></i>

618
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:21,148
You tell everything
to the person you love.

619
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,527
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Is this some sort</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">of blackmail?</font></i>

620
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,445
No, no,
I wouldn't call it that way.

621
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,088
This is just someone telling you

622
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,841
to do what's fair.

623
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,743
And what are you thinking
of doing with that money?

624
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,845
Waste it on heroine?

625
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,346
That's not your business.

626
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,915
For your
information,

627
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,584
I am holding Jesse's money
for his own good.

628
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,879
He will receive
every last dollar of it.

629
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,814
He will, not you.

630
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,315
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Once he's clean.</font></i>

631
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,175
You know what?
I'm tired of this.

632
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,093
Let's put things
the way they're.

633
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,695
This is blackmail.

634
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,347
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know lots if things</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">about you.</font></i>

635
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,991
For instance, I know

636
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,226
your brother-in-law
works in anti-narcotics.

637
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,937
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know stuff</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">that will be of interest</font></i>

638
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,898
to the police
and the press.

639
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,125
Tell me something.

640
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,443
Does José agree with
what you're doing?

641
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,447
We're a team.
That's it.

642
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,425
So this is quite simple.

643
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,370
You either do
what you have to do

644
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,248
or you'll have to stand
up to the consequences.

645
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,993
Are you in Mars already?

646
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,373
What are you thinking?

647
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,443
I'm worried
about that call to Mr. Blanco.

648
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,003
We had to do it.

649
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,447
He didn't want
to do things right.

650
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,841
Wasn't it too much?

651
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,368
What he did first
was too much.

652
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,055
No, I don't know.

653
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,497
I've had arguments with
him but...

654
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,666
I've been through a lot
with him

655
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:06,587
and I don't want things
to end badly.

656
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,439
He's a school teacher.

657
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:13,636
What's he going to do?
Send you with the principal?

658
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:17,473
No, Juana, this man
is not as dumb as you think.

659
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,991
For real.

660
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,994
Are you scared?

661
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,670
You were not serious

662
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,614
when you said
you'd call the cops,

663
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,173
right?

664
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,633
It won't be necessary

665
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,552
because he'll bring the money.

666
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,413
And if he
doesn't?

667
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,933
José, it's your money.

668
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,936
Look, he...

669
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:53,843
He's the bad guy.
You're the good one.

670
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,240
What?

671
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,160
Don't you want your money?

672
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,204
Look, we'll get it

673
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,915
and give it to poor kids

674
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,875
all over the world

675
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,318
and then we'll become monks
or shit.

676
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,295
But you can't let him

677
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,382
keep your money.

678
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,342
I don't know.

679
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,887
This is not me.

680
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,372
It doesn't feel
like me.

681
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,475
He's my partner.

682
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:34,483
I'm your partner.

683
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:50,082
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The diaper...</font></i>

684
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,708
We ran out of diapers?

685
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,073
No, we just have
one diaper left, babe.

686
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,853
Hi.

687
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:13,772
What are you watching?

688
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,816
Elephants?

689
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,437
Babe, can you please go
and buy diapers?

690
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,580
We're out.

691
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:19,046
Where's José Miguel?

692
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,173
José!

693
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,451
- José!
- Congratulations!

694
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,513
Nice job wearing the pants.

695
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,084
How do I know
you'll keep quiet?

696
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,294
I guess you
don't know.

697
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:38,774
You'll never hear from us again.

698
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,400
You'll regret this.

699
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,094
Listen to me!
You'll regret what you're doing!

700
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,239
José!

701
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,162
José, you know what
this means?

702
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,265
That we got paid.

703
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:19,048
This is freedom.
Freedom.

704
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,841
We can do
whatever we want.

705
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,444
We can go to Europe.

706
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,304
We can travel through
South America.

707
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,366
We could go to the Moon!

708
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,123
Let's go, let's go...

709
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,858
Let's go to an island
in the Caribbean.

710
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,542
Let's go to Galapagos!

711
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,044
Right away.

712
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,547
That one's in the Pacific.

713
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:48,051
So let's go to Cuba.

714
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,719
Let's go to Cuba!

715
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:53,707
You'll paint,
I'll write.

716
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,793
- We'll stay there. Okay?
- Yes, Cuba.

717
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,796
The land of
freedom.

718
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,221
But first
we have to get clean.

719
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,032
Did you hear me?

720
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,658
Yes.

721
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,102
But not because anybody
is telling us yo.

722
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,020
We'll do it for us,
right?

723
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,248
Yes, right.

724
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:21,068
We can't waste all that
on drugs.

725
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,627
No, of course not.

726
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,822
- I mean it!
- Yes, for real.

727
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,242
Because we can be
better than that, right?

728
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,120
You and I can be much better
than that.

729
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:50,239
We don't need this, right?

730
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,125
Good night.

731
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,087
Can I have a beer please?

732
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,720
Thanks.

733
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:17,140
Hi, babe.

734
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,892
Yes, yes.

735
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,628
I've been
to three different places

736
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,314
and I can't find any.

737
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,549
Do they have to be diapers
for newborns?

738
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,986
What if we went up a size?

739
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,488
Hum.

740
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,741
Yes. No, I'll get them.

741
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,436
In fact, I'm getting in
a supermarket right now.

742
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:44,109
Fine, see you.
Bye.

743
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,212
That was good.

744
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,180
Did it sound credible?

745
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:00,834
It's just that
you never know women completely.

746
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:04,171
Sometimes I think they have
some kind of superpower

747
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:06,231
to read minds.

748
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,732
Yes, that's right.

749
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,176
I don't have that
problem

750
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,470
because mine has been living
in the U.S. for years.

751
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,863
But you're totally right.

752
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,324
It did sound credible

753
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:17,434
but don't get home
drunk.

754
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,397
NO, I'll just drink this one
and leave.

755
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,834
I just needed a little break.

756
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,920
Yes.

757
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,881
Yes, that's necessary.

758
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,515
They found water in Mars.

759
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,725
Would that be good or bad?

760
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,978
Actually, they theoretically

761
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,172
can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen

762
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,965
and process that
into providing fuel

763
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:50,317
for man's space flights.

764
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,235
At least that's interesting.

765
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,736
Turning Mars

766
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:56,156
into a giant gas station.

767
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,740
You know about the subject.

768
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,784
Are you a scientist?

769
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,812
I'm good at Science.
I like it.

770
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,622
I can tell.

771
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,584
That's good information.

772
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,423
A boy or a girl?

773
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:16,659
- What?
- The owner of the diapers..

774
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:21,764
It's a girl.

775
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,667
- Newborn.
- Yes.

776
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,144
Congratulations.

777
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,645
Thanks.

778
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,066
I have a daughter too.

779
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:33,985
She'll turn 27 next month.

780
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,516
I have another son,
he's 15,

781
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,994
almost 16.

782
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,456
It's incredible.

783
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:50,919
How can they grow so fast?

784
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,196
You have any advice?
Having a daughter.

785
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:55,298
I just have the impression

786
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,426
they're so different.

787
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:59,844
Yes, sure.

788
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,913
You must always accompany
them, be with them.

789
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:05,708
Give them good advice,
listen to them.

790
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:09,646
And talk to them.

791
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,106
After a certain age

792
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,509
they make their own
decisions.

793
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:19,348
Some are right,
some not so much.

794
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:21,224
That's when you have
to be understanding

795
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,369
and be with them.

796
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:28,331
- Be family.

797
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,965
I also have this nephew.

798
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,204
He screws up
once and again.

799
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,747
One mistake after the other
and...

800
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,309
But he's a grown up.

801
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,628
I can't treat him
like a child.

802
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,841
What do you do
in that case?

803
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,886
I get you
perfectly well.

804
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,013
I know what you're
talking about.

805
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,324
Nobody said it'd be easy.

806
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:03,866
All you can do

807
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:07,870
is always stay alert.

808
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:12,250
What do you exactly mean?

809
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,669
Always be with them.

810
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,253
Be by their side

811
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,072
in good and bad
times.

812
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:22,035
Stand, help,
give good advice.

813
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,138
Be always there.

814
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:01,883
José!

815
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,552
José, open up!

816
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:06,513
I just want to talk to you.

817
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,508
José.

818
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:06,531
José.

819
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:09,534
José, wake up.

820
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,856
José,
I want to talk.
