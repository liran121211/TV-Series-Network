1
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,615
José!

2
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,117
Come out!

3
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,753
Is everything all right?

4
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,505
It's all clear.

5
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,590
Seems so.

6
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,533
I'll take the car
to the boss then.

7
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,801
Stewart, do me a favor.

8
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,079
Can you go
to my son's high
school

9
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,788
and check
everything is fine?

10
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:43,873
I just want to
check.

11
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,390
Sure, no problem.

12
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,126
And you told me the
car wash

13
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,686
is also secured, right?

14
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,337
Yes, I have
some people there

15
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,464
but there're
no signals of Rosas.

16
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,233
Find him, will you?

17
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,860
Please, find him.

18
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,096
I will.
See you.

19
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,547
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Voice mail.</font></i>

20
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,699
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Leave your message</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">after the tone.</font></i>

21
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,220
José, it's me.

22
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,598
You obviously

23
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:30,044
changed your mind
about my house...

24
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,271
You didn't do it,

25
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,524
so thank you for that.

26
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,443
But we have to talk.

27
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,821
We have to fix this.

28
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:46,244
Whatever it takes, all right?

29
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,413
So, for now,

30
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,375
just sleep it off

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,713
and then call me.

32
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,881
Be safe.

33
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,262
How's it coming?

34
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,097
Fine, sir.

35
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,123
I'll change the hinge
and the lock.

36
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,266
Good.

37
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,474
Excuse me.

38
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,169
Are you interested
in a new master key

39
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,104
for all locks?

40
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,547
No, no, no.
I'll keep the exact same keys.

41
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,466
It's just that usually
with a break in,

42
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,384
people like to get new keys
and--

43
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,095
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

44
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,197
Just leave the original keys,

45
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,198
the original locks.

46
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,491
As though nothing had happened.

47
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,557
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

48
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,796
Good, good.

49
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,134
Perfect.

50
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,557
No, no, no, hey!

51
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,643
Turn that off!

52
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,894
Guys, guys,

53
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,646
you'll have to go over this

54
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,106
again.

55
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,607
We made three passes already.

56
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,360
Gasoline's tricky.

57
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,929
I know, but I don't care.
Do it again.

58
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,405
My wife is coming home

59
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,765
and I can't have any odor,
any stain,,

60
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,559
any sign that something
happened here.

61
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,328
Nothing, no traces.

62
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,247
As though nothing happened here.

63
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,582
I know I'm asking you

64
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,127
for a special service,

65
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,444
so there's no problem.
Here.

66
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,698
Walter, no.
Thanks, for real,

67
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,076
but no matter how much money
you give us,

68
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,827
there's nothing
else we can do.

69
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,929
Until you pull this up

70
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,789
and get new carpet, new
padding,

71
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,724
this is as good

72
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,310
as it gets.

73
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,922
Mariano, let's pick
things up.

74
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,577
Hi.

75
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,647
You can't imagine
what a mess this was!

76
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,731
What
happened?

77
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,876
This country is really--

78
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,169
Why do we have to be like this?

79
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,321
We don't do
anything right.

80
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,614
We'll be consumed
by mediocrity.

81
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,882
It's unbelievable.

82
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,327
- What's that smell?
- Gasoline, gasoline.

83
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,053
- No, no, no.

84
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,888
You have no idea, Cielo.

85
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,250
No, watch out!
That's wet.

86
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,459
What
happened?

87
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,353
I went to the gas station

88
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,047
and the guy who was supposed
to fill up the tank

89
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,482
wasn't there,

90
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,800
so I had to get off the car
and fill it myself.

91
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,969
I have no idea
how that thing works

92
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,072
so when I squeezed the--

93
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,434
I don't know, that trigger,
and all of a sudden

94
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,785
I had gasoline all over me.

95
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,871
The brackets around the hose

96
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,831
were loosen.

97
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,208
But no one told me!

98
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,694
That could have been a lady
with a baby, I don't know.

99
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,529
Who knows
what could have happened?

100
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,966
So I was soaked in gasoline.

101
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,634
You get the girl out of here.

102
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,786
I don't think this smell
is good for her.

103
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,930
Yes.

104
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,348
No, this is a mess.

105
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,183
I'm a beast.

106
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,710
Just hold on,
I don't get it.

107
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,339
If you got soaked
at the gas station,

108
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,925
then why does the house
smell of gasoline?

109
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,801
Wait, I didn't tell you
the rest.

110
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,070
I was soaked,

111
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,280
so I raced home

112
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,282
and my skin was burning,

113
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,392
so I stripped off my clothes
here.

114
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,019
I stripped them off
here in this room

115
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,579
and I jumped in the shower.

116
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,540
And when I was showering,

117
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,566
I realized I had left
the clothes here

118
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,984
and there was noting
I could do--

119
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,194
- Walter!
- What?

120
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,504
Why are you such a liar?

121
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,488
- What?
- Hi, babe.

122
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,506
Hi.

123
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,049
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,825
You fainted because
you're sick again.

125
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,035
- What?
- Just admit it!

126
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,828
- Stop lying about it.
- No

127
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,097
Hey, for real!

128
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,807
I didn't faint.

129
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,560
Dad, you inhaled the fumes.

130
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,436
You got dizzy and fainted.

131
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:07,005
And then you soaked your clothes
in gasoline.
Just accept it.

132
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,316
Hey, little man.

133
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,068
I might have inhaled the fumes,

134
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,430
but I didn't faint
because of that.

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,515
You have to believe me,
it's important you do.

136
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,617
Fine, I believe you.

137
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,452
Fine.

138
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,064
The thing is that I don't think
I can clean this smell

139
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,024
from the carpet
tonight.

140
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,834
No. And it's so strong.

141
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,902
- Yes, I know.
- Right?

142
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,504
I don't think

143
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,172
we can stay here.

144
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,258
No, not at all.

145
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,426
Let's go to the uncle's house.

146
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,245
- Yes, could be.
- Could be.

147
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,971
Do we go to the auntie's?

148
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,098
What about a hotel?

149
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,266
A hotel?

150
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,293
Yes. Why don't we go
to a hotel?

151
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,395
If it's a good one.

152
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,047
Fine, okay. A hotel.
Yes, baby?

153
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,399
Yes.

154
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,716
That's it!
Let's go to a hotel then.

155
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,026
Cool.

156
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,512
- Shall we pack?
- Yes.

157
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,929
I'm really sorry
for this mess.

158
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,573
I didn't mean it.

159
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,811
No, don't worry.
Those things happen.

160
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,205
Let's pack, baby.

161
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,282
Think this
will leave a
scar?

162
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,450
It'll change my
looks.

163
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,385
I liked my nose.

164
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,204
It had personality,
character.

165
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,932
Boss, if you don't mind,

166
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,044
I have a good cream for scars
at home.

167
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,563
I can bring it tomorrow.

168
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,008
I should have never
left my karate lessons.

169
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,319
You practiced karate?

170
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,528
Just once.

171
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,574
There he is.

172
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,317
What happened to you?
Did José do that to you?

173
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,211
Yes, he did,

174
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,322
but I know he loves me
deep down.

175
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,283
And I'm sure this hurt
him more than it hurt me.

176
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,926
So what?

177
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,037
Do we know anything?
Did you find him?

178
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,763
We're still after him.

179
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,849
Where did you search?

180
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,974
At his place,

181
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,667
at his friend's,
at his parents'.

182
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,354
Everywhere they sell drugs.

183
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,397
Even at that place

184
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,757
where he had those meetings
for addicts.

185
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,551
Even at Andrea's,
his ex-girlfriend.

186
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,569
Did you check at...

187
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,530
Those friends of his.

188
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,931
Not Intestinos,
the other one.

189
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,057
- Tripaseca.
- That one.

190
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,225
- Tripaseca and Mono.
- And?

191
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,826
No, they have no idea.

192
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,203
Aren't they covering his back?

193
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,621
No.

194
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,122
I posed as an employee

195
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,374
for the phone company

196
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,068
and put a bug
at Mono's mom's place.

197
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,837
All they talk about

198
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,574
is zombies, hay pets
and zombie cats.

199
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,008
What?

200
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,552
I didn't get it either.

201
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,512
And what else?

202
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,915
I checked with a pal
at the Police.

203
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,267
He's not in their system.

204
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,170
That means
that if he's not in the system,

205
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,938
they cops don't have him.

206
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,024
At least not yet.

207
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,235
Maybe he changed his mind

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,029
about leaving

209
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,764
and got back in touch
with the Borrador.

210
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,016
No, no.
When somebody

211
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,143
misses their first
chance with that guy,

212
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,394
there's no second
chance.

213
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,022
We have to keep on searching,
Saúl.

214
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,166
And then what?

215
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,875
What do you mean?

216
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,379
José is like a herpes.

217
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,780
He might
disappear,

218
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,283
but sooner or later he's
going to turn up again.

219
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,996
So we have to decide
what we'll do then.

220
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,748
José is just upset
about the boy.

221
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,127
I need to explain to him
why I did what I did.

222
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,563
He'll understand.

223
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,922
The kid's not up
for a discussion

224
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,383
of the virtues
of child poisoning

225
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,445
for your own benefit.

226
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,929
His plans are
stabbing you
to death

227
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,324
with a pointing stick.

228
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,310
If that's so,
what shall we
do?

229
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,770
I don't know.
Any suggestions?

230
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,873
We could do

231
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,734
what we did
with Confite.

232
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,002
Who's Confite?

233
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,212
I never told you?

234
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,714
Confite was a dog.

235
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,549
I had him at home.

236
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,701
He was somewhere
between a French Poodle

237
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,345
and an Alsatian.

238
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,622
It was really nice,
we loved it,

239
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,875
but one day
he showed up rabid

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,169
and he became
very dangerous.

241
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,048
So, for the sake of
the family

242
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,176
we had to...
You know.

243
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,553
You're full
of colorful metaphors,

244
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,113
aren't you?

245
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,240
The Caribbean Islands,

246
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,075
a rabid dog...

247
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,495
Just brimming with advice, Saúl.

248
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,732
You should be writing
self-help books.

249
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:35,957
Listen carefully.

250
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,152
Don't you ever
suggest that to me again.

251
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,655
Find him!
Damn it.

252
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,683
Hello.

253
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,186
I'm sorry I took so long.

254
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:01,592
Those people at the
pharmacy were incredible.

255
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,802
They didn't want
to give me change.

256
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,571
Not even buying the pills.

257
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,740
No, they didn't have change.

258
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,684
I had to buy some jam,
can you believe it?

259
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,412
I knew we didn't need any but...

260
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,039
Unbelievable!

261
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,982
They prefer not selling.
They're--

262
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,504
I checked in on Junior.

263
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,342
Hey, they got him a suite.

264
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,747
That boy
seems a sheik.

265
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,376
Digital TV,
video games, Wi-Fi.

266
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,587
Thank God
he doesn't have porn.

267
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:42,106
Don't worry about that.

268
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:46,194
How's Saúl?

269
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,112
Saúl?

270
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,865
You mean the lawyer?

271
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,157
Mm.

272
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,619
No idea. Why?

273
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,162
No?

274
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,441
You were just out talking
to him in the parking lot.

275
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,151
Cielo,
were you saying on me?

276
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,488
Yes, and I feel just
awful
about it.

277
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,200
Walter,
let's get serious.

278
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,996
I played along with you
with that gasoline story

279
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,056
because Junior was there.

280
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,768
But it's enough now.

281
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,728
Tell me what's going on.

282
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,963
Nothing.
Nothing serious, Cielo.

283
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,174
We're in a hotel
just for caution.

284
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,276
That's all.

285
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,803
You know how overly cautious
I am.

286
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,237
I'm exaggerated, that's all.

287
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,264
- Tell me what's going on.
- Nothing.

288
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,751
José Miguel Rosas,

289
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,628
the boy with whom we were--

290
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,196
We had dinner with him at home,
remember?

291
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,574
I know perfectly well
who he is.

292
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,426
Well, José is...

293
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,579
He's mad at me
because he thinks I did...

294
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,391
Well, I did something,

295
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,336
but it was
for a good reason.

296
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,980
It's complicated, Cielo.

297
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,756
I can't explain it
just like that.

298
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,399
No, hold on, hold on.

299
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,985
Just a moment.

300
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,972
What are you trying
to tell me?

301
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,409
That José Miguel...

302
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,061
tried to burn down
our house or...?

303
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,204
Burn down?

304
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,667
No, that sounds terrible.

305
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,460
José just had a bad moment.

306
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,989
He didn't think clearly.
That's all.

307
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,884
Yes, he did have the intention,

308
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,703
but he didn't do it,
he changed his mind.

309
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,914
Why did he change
his mind?

310
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:41,543
What made him think

311
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,641
change his mind?

312
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,643
things through?

313
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,480
Cielo, it's not that easy.

314
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,733
José is quite a particular guy.

315
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,528
he's got lots...

316
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,722
He's got lots
of personal problems.

317
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,642
Emotional problems.
He's a drug addict.

318
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,686
But he has always been
more of a danger to himself

319
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,747
than anyone else.

320
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,249
He just losses control

321
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,794
and then gets it back,

322
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,155
but he poses no threat
for anyone.

323
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,241
He's never hurt
anyone?

324
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,886
No, never.

325
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,042
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

326
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,980
Maybe she likes hotels.

327
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,566
Walter, look.

328
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:34,095
What's your
course of action
here?

329
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,281
Cielo, calm down.

330
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,684
Saúl and his guy
are tracking him down,

331
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,079
they find him,

332
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,773
they'll bring him along
and I'll talk to him.

333
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,499
I'll make him see reason.

334
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,501
End of story.

335
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,320
When you say
you'll take to him

336
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,071
and make him see
sense,

337
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,408
does it mean you'll do
what I think you'll do?

338
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,119
- Or what?
- What?

339
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,346
No! No!

340
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,666
My God!
How could you think that?

341
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,768
I knew it!

342
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,170
I knew it, Walter!
I told you thousands of times!

343
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,089
I told you they'd get home
and hurt us.

344
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,549
- No.
- And that day is today!

345
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,027
And now we're here.

346
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,154
Cielo, listen to me.

347
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,974
José Miguel Rosas
would never hurt us.

348
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,308
He poured gasoline
all over our house.

349
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,201
He tried to set it on fire!

350
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,646
But he didn't.
He changed his mind.

351
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,065
What if he changes his
mind again?

352
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,442
And this time
he doesn't think it over.

353
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,695
What if he burns Valentina?
What would you think of
that?

354
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,963
How much have you been drinking?

355
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,965
Doesn't matter.

356
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,924
It does matter

357
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,994
I really don't know where
this conversation is going.

358
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,096
This makes no sense.

359
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,914
haven't I explained it all
well enough?

360
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,308
What did I tell you?

361
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,893
This is a big overreaction.

362
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,352
It has nothing to do

363
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,771
with what's going on.

364
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,189
Cielo,

365
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,257
José Miguel Rosas
is not a rabid dog

366
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,719
like Confite,
do you get me?

367
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,012
What the hell
are you talking about?

368
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,304
I don't know!
It doesn't matter!

369
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,639
José is a person,
a human being.

370
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,449
¡No!

371
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,144
He's a threat
to our family.

372
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,563
I'm tired of
lying.

373
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,023
Just look
where we're now

374
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,416
with María and Henry.

375
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,003
We made an awful tape.

376
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,822
After all the bad things
we've done,

377
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,365
you can't just tell
me

378
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,659
that you'll talk to
him.

379
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:25,540
"I'll make him
come to sense."

380
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,059
What are you saying?

381
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,211
Cielo,
What do you mean?

382
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,339
Be precise, please.
You want me to...

383
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:38,845
We've come this
far.

384
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,240
For us...

385
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,616
What's one more?

386
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,229
Son of a bitch!

387
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,222
Stop!

388
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,332
Stop what you're doing
and turn around!

389
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,310
José Miguel!

390
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:59,217
You want to know what your

391
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,232
what he did?

392
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,317
fucking brother-in-law did?

393
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,570
Put that out!

394
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:07,200
He poisoned a little boy.

395
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,768
He poisoned
a 6 year-old boy

396
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,453
just as a move!

397
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,579
Fine, fine.

398
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,272
We all know
Walter is a bastard.

399
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,793
We'll talk about it.

400
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,863
He can't keep on
winning.

401
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,823
he can't keep
getting away with it!

402
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,177
Not anymore!

403
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,720
That won't happen.

404
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:32,042
If you want to burn him down,
end with him,

405
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,852
let's do it together.

406
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,332
This is yours, isn't it?

407
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,850
Here.

408
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,442
So you've been following me.

409
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,904
Since Saul's.

410
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,866
Where are we going now?

411
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,118
Anti narcotics

412
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,786
So I'm arrested?

413
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,956
You know how this works.

414
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,776
Be a good witness for me,
it'll go better for you.

415
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,002
All right?

416
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,962
Sure.

417
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,339
I'll be absolutely relaxed,

418
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,824
waiting to be a witness
against Walter.

419
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,801
Hey, you're with me now.

420
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,913
Nothing will
happen to you.

421
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,849
You still have no idea

422
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,893
what he's capable of doing.

423
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,091
So you're angry.

424
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,410
I can't sleep.
I'm not eating.

425
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,679
Last night I was online

426
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:38,835
for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

427
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,561
This close family friend

428
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:45,049
had been keeping a secret
from you and Henry,

429
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:49,095
So now,
somehow this person's secret

430
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,723
became known,
and now you're sad

431
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:58,829
and hurt and angry.

432
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,791
Am I right?

433
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,793
How could it be?

434
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,404
How can you think
you know someone

435
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,781
and in fact you have
no idea who he is.

436
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,092
In the long run,

437
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,219
we all live double lives.

438
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,163
No, not me.
Not like him.

439
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,181
Not like that person.

440
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,517
María, I think it's time

441
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,544
you filled me in
on some more details here.

442
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,104
Who and what

443
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,939
are we exactly talking about?

444
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,799
I can't.
I can't do that.

445
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,676
This person made it clear
in that video

446
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,136
that we couldn't talk
about him,

447
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,762
if not, Henry
will be in danger.

448
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,074
I don't want that.

449
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,475
And yes,
I'm stupid.

450
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,643
I feel so idiotic,
so dumb

451
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,746
because I didn't see it.

452
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,815
It was in front of me
and I didn't see it.

453
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,901
And now the boy and the girl
are in that house

454
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,919
and I can't believe it.

455
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,130
I can't believe it.

456
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:53,784
But if I think about it,
that betting story made sense.

457
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,678
How couldn't I see that?

458
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,540
Why not?
Why?

459
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,892
Tell me about that video.

460
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,420
I don't want to
talk about that!

461
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,271
Just not anymore.

462
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,881
Let's talk about my
feelings

463
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,758
or let's change the
subject.

464
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,402
Fine, good.

465
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:14,071
So how's work?

466
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,573
Last week you were upset

467
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,950
about the new parking rules.

468
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,912
María.

469
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,418
It's called saxitotoxin.

470
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,213
It paralyzes the body

471
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:33,074
but the person
stays conscious

472
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,510
and starts choking slowly

473
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,495
because it causes
respiratory failure.

474
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,846
María, look,

475
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,790
if you're not ready
to fill me in here,

476
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,475
that's fine.

477
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,477
But I want you to listen.

478
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,063
There is no problem,

479
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,923
no matter how difficult
or painful

480
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,234
or seemingly unsolvable,

481
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,820
that violence won't make worse.

482
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,156
I know.

483
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,450
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

484
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,894
But it just feels good
thinking about it.

485
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,996
It just feels good.

486
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,921
Hey, babe.

487
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,465
Hi, babe.

488
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,468
What's this?

489
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:16,469
What?

490
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,676
What's this?

491
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,304
Something's come up.

492
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,248
I thought you might want
to get out of the house

493
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,475
for a day or two.

494
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,602
Okay.

495
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,087
You thought I might want
to pack up

496
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,856
and move out of my own house?

497
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,358
What's going on, henry?

498
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,051
I don't want to talk
about that now, babe,

499
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,362
but it's related to Walter.

500
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,281
There's been a development.

501
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,890
What happened?
Are you in danger?

502
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,809
No, no, no.
Not at all.
Don't worry.

503
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,936
We're just working
on the case.

504
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,496
We're moving forward,

505
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:49,108
so I thought it'd be
easier for everyone

506
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,568
if you weren't here
for a couple of days,

507
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,670
do you get me?

508
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,422
And I have a surprise for you.

509
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,382
Since you're so fond of spas,

510
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,117
I booked you three days
at Spacio,

511
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,427
that one you like so much

512
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,095
so they put masks on you,

513
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,473
you get some massages,

514
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,666
those river stones,
everything.

515
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,562
It's all included.

516
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:16,594
Henry Navarro,
what the hell is going on?

517
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:21,073
Henry.

518
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,742
We have a guest.

519
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,902
I gave him
some sleeping pills

520
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,837
because he was too disturbed.

521
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,664
Babe, I need
your help.

522
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,958
If I bring him to the
office

523
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,853
and put him in the system,

524
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,922
Walter will find
out
in five minutes.

525
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,341
Remember what happened
with the 10 witnesses

526
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,468
I had in prison?
They killed them.

527
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,612
I can't risk that.

528
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,947
I can use a safe house

529
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,559
because I'd have to ask for
permission in writing

530
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,103
and explain everything
that's going on.

531
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,454
And I can't risk

532
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,706
taking him to a hotel.

533
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,899
This is the only option
I have.

534
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,359
I have to keep him here.
Please.

535
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,736
It'll just be one
or two days.

536
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,655
Stop, Henry.
I have a question.

537
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,049
Is this bad for Walter?

538
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,176
Would this hurt him?

539
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,886
Pretty much.

540
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,930
Okay. Good.

541
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,475
I'll prepare lunch.

542
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,823
Babe, answer.

543
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,009
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You have one new voice mail.</font></i>

544
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,179
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">To listen to your mess--</font></i>

545
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,515
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">José, it's me..</font></i>

547
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,420
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">what you intended to do</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">at me house.</font></i>

548
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,021

549
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,482

550
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,067
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But we have to talk.</font></i>

551
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,069
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We have to fix things.</font></i>

552
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,906
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Whatever it takes.</font></i>

553
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:30,703
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Just rest for now</font></i>

554
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,413
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and call me when you can.</font></i>

555
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,123
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Be safe.</font></i>

556
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,484
Hey, dad.

557
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,611
Hi.

558
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,071
What are you still doing up?

559
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,032
I couldn't sleep.

560
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,312
That makes two.
Sit.

561
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,216
Why are you so meditative, dad?

562
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,427
Everything's okay?

563
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,138
Yes, I'm fine.

564
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,890
I was just thinking

565
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:38,437
about some business stuff.

566
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:43,233
Going over some options.

567
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,721
You're still thinking
about buying the car wash?

568
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:52,476
Yes.
I don't know.

569
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,037
We'll see.

570
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,791
We'll see?

571
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,169
What does that mean?

572
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,196
Is it because you're ill
again

573
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,240
and you don't know
whether yo buy it or not?

574
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:11,078
No, no, no.
I'm not talking about that.

575
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,081
Junior,
what did we say?

576
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,208
You promised me
you wouldn't worry.

577
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,544
How can I not
worry, dad?

578
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:23,173
You think I came all this way
just to let a lung cancer

579
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:28,195
take me down?

580
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,282
I'm not going anywhere.

581
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,479
Get that in your head, Junior.
Don't worry.

582
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,527
See you in the
morning.

583
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,629
Have a nice rest.

584
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,798
I won't take long.

585
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,383
Okay.

586
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,368
Hey, do we have
breakfast together?

587
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,596
Hum.

588
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,783
Good morning.

589
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,242
Hi.

590
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,995
You want some coffee?

591
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,913
Okay.

592
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,420
Gómez, good morning.

593
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,545
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Good morning.</font></i>

594
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,635
What's up?

595
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,013
You want some coffee?

596
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,806
The lady has offered me one.

597
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,099
I think she's your wife.

598
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,599
You take cream and
sugar?

599
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,492
Black's fine.

600
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,005
Thanks.

601
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,256
Babe, you want some coffee?

602
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,383
No.

603
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,468
Gómez?

604
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,012
Thanks.

605
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,013
Babe?

606
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,098
Mm?

607
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,598
This will take a while.

608
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,350
Okay.

609
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,936
I'll go make some errands.

610
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,504
- Fine. Bye.
- Bye.

611
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,939
Bye, guys.

612
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,524
Bye.

613
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,069
You remember Gómez?

614
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,112
Of course.

615
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,821
So how are you?

616
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,239
Your head's clear?

617
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:20,492
Better.

618
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,829
This can't be what you mean

619
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,064
by burning him to the ground,
right?

620
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,458
I've got stories

621
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,210
that'll make your toes curl,

622
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,822
but it's just my word
against his word.

623
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,616
I don't really have
any proof or anything.

624
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,259
Why can't I see anything?

625
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,329
You know he's retired?
He's no longer cooking.

626
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,915
You're never going to catch him
with a camcorder.

627
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,333
Of course
I'm going to catch him,

628
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,351
and the first thing we'll do

629
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,462
will be this video.
So please, take a seat.

630
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,777
That's it.

631
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:59,823
Tell me about you.

632
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,034
You can tell me

633
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,560
about business
dealings

634
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,454
or personal stuff.

635
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,524
Any criminal activity
you were in with Walter

636
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,985
or anything you witnessed
Walter doing.

637
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,736
I need you
to tell me everything.

638
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,715
Everything is useful.

639
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,745
So first, start by telling me
How you met Walter Blanco.

640
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,982
Here it goes.

641
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:38,946
I met professor Walter Blanco

642
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,015
in junior year chemistry
at Los Monarcas,

643
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,533
the school I went to.

644
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,577
He was my teacher.

645
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,006
You believe him?

646
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,966
Yes, I do.

647
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,702
And I hate to admit
he's right.

648
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,538
There's no physical evidence,
nothing.

649
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,540
If only we had a body,
a gun,

650
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,459
a working lab,
something.

651
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,295
All we have
is the word of a drug addict

652
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,481
with a head full of meth

653
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,441
against a chemist teacher

654
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,902
with lung cancer.

655
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,696
We're screwed.

656
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,973
So what do we do
then?

657
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,809
Do we go
to see Lidia again?

658
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,811
Do we investigate
Peto?

659
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:33,067
Do we believe him?
Where do we start?

660
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,295
I say we start with this.

661
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,340
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">José, tomorrow at noon</font></i>

662
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,509
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll be at Los Pinos park.</font></i>

663
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,969
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I hope you'll give me the chance</font></i>

664
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,055
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to explain myself.</font></i>

665
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,540
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I want us to talk face to face</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and calmed.</font></i>

666
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:52,144
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll be alone and unarmed.</font></i>

667
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,687
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">So if you want to come</font></i>

668
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,564
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">and shoot me in the head,</font></i>

669
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,607
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">that's up to you.</font></i>

670
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:01,804
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Either way,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm in your hands.</font></i>

671
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,661
What?

672
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:13,415
No, don't even think about it.

673
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,734
I'm not meeting him
He's nuts.

674
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,586
I'm not going to that park.

675
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,589
Go and listen.

676
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:25,327
We put a wire on you
and you just let him talk

677
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,721
and explain himself.

678
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,224
All right?

679
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,502
That's all?
That's the plan'

680
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:37,173
So your plan
is to do his plan?

681
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,925
You really think
he wants to meet me to talk?

682
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,552
Really?
No, man.

683
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,154
Why not?

684
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,655
How co--¿

685
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,574
I can't believe you two

686
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,451
are falling in this trap.

687
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,312
He wanted me
out of Bogotá

688
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,439
before I tried
to burn his house down.

689
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,750
I'm just a threat for him now.

690
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,527
I know him.
I know the professor.

691
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:01,171
He's got a zero-tolerance policy

692
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,882
on threats.

693
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,326
The moment I go to that park,
I'm dead man.

694
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,886
Look, we all know

695
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,512
Walter is ruthless

696
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,514
and that he'd do anything

697
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,058
to protect his interests,

698
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,684
but this is different.

699
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,728
You know why?

700
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,562
Because this is about you.

701
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,423
And Walter
worries about you.

702
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,400
Can't you see it?

703
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,028
So what you mean

704
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,639
is that when he's
not ripping me off

705
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,326
or calling me an idiot

706
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,561
or poisoning people
that I care about,

707
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:36,065
all that means
that he cares about me?

708
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,292
How couldn't I see that before?

709
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,985
Sure, José,
he worries about you.

710
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,129
I'm just based

711
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,213
on everything you told us.

712
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,507
First of all,

713
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,118
you said
he paid for your rehab.

714
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:49,511
Didn't he?

715
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,080
That was the first time
he saved your life.

716
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:52,956
He ran over two drug dealers
with his car.

717
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:56,143
He saved your life again.

718
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,937
He made you his partner.

719
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,298
He gave you
half of the money.

720
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,425
He had no reason
for doing that, did he?

721
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,135
Yes.
You know why he did it?

722
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,653
Because I'm the only person

723
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,904
who's close enough

724
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,599
and good enough
to cook just like him.

725
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,326
I don't know.

726
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,287
According to what you told us,

727
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:18,607
Walter has been manipulating you
all this time.

728
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,876
He doesn't want to lose you.

729
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,752
He wants you to stick around.

730
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,130
Just look at his moves.

731
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,616
Why would Walter
help you find

732
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,177
the ricin cigarette?

733
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,720
Better still, what for?

734
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,123
So you think
he's a good person,

735
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,640
that he's kind,

736
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,142
that you can trust him.

737
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:41,021
And this message

738
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,731
is the same thing.

739
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,234
What if it's about killing me?

740
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,762
For real,
What if I get there

741
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,114
and he's hired a sniper?

742
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,642
Or have me sit
on a poison needle?

743
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,394
Noting's going to happen
to you.

744
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,231
It's a public park,
full of people.

745
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,000
It's middle of the day.

746
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,320
Gómez and I
will be there.

747
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,780
Nothing's going to happen
to you.

748
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,840
You really don't get it.

749
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:13,220
You two are just common people.

750
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:17,166
This man,
professor Blanco,

751
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,768
he's the devil.

752
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,395
I know why I'm telling you.

753
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,440
For real.

754
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,758
That man
is the most intelligent person

755
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,193
I've ever known.

756
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,945
He's more intelligent than you,

757
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,115
He's more intelligent than me.

758
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,280
than Gómez.

759
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,517
Whatever you think
is supposed to happen,

760
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,520
the exact reverse opposite
of that is going to happen.

761
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,189
I can assure than.
That man is--

762
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:43,192
Rosas!
We're not brainstorming

763
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:46,044
to see what we're going to do.

764
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,446
I'm not asking you
whether you want to or not.

765
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,799
This is how we're doing it.

766
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,135
Did you get me?

767
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,078
Unless you have
some other way

768
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,679
to catch him.

769
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,792
Unless you want to spend
the rest of your life

770
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,937
singing hip-hop in prison.

771
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:08,175
We can get you that ticket
right now.

772
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,346
I have to piss.
Can I piss?

773
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,531
Down to the left.

774
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:25,567
We need another card
for this.

775
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,753
What?

776
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,714
What if the kid's right?

777
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,967
What if it's a trap?

778
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,718
This kid?

779
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,304
You call him kid now?

780
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,556
Which kid?

781
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,724
The junkie murderer

782
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,127
that's dribbling
all over my bathroom floor?

783
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,645
That kid?

784
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,968
Well, if the kid's right,
he gets killed.

785
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:55,489
And we'll get it all on tape.

786
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,307
Do we need evidence
against Walter?

787
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,701
There it is.

788
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,111
Look, dude,
I know you're hurt,

789
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,713
you're angry

790
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,465
and all that shit,

791
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,218
but you're here for answers.

792
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,161
So don't push him
with questions

793
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,888
because he'll get suspicious

794
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:23,625
and we'll screw all this up,
you got me?

795
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,545
Just let him talk
and yo relax.

796
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,314
One more thing,

797
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,024
don't cross your arms

798
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,817
because there's the wire.

799
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,903
Let's try the audio.

800
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,988
Say something.

801
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,366
One, two, three.

802
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:43,686
That's it.
Perfect.

803
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:49,859
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Piqué over to Shakira.</font></i>

804
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,959
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Do you copy, babe?</font></i>

805
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,961
Loud and clear, idiot.

806
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,047
How is it looking?

807
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,633
He's just sitting there,

808
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:01,012
relaxed.

809
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,915
So?
Are you ready?

810
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,376
Ready to take revenge
over that mother fucker?

811
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:07,520
I don't know.

812
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,506
You don't know?
Go.

813
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,357
Time to go.

814
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,551
- Are you sure about this?
- Go!

815
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:22,867
Close, close.

816
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,442
Henry, what happened?
He's just standing.

817
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,426
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He's taking off, Henry.</font></i>

818
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,262
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">He won't do it.</font></i>

819
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:28,375
Where is he doing?
Don't!

820
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,793
Just lend me your phone
a second.

821
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,812
Thanks.

822
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,154
He's making a call, Henry.

823
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,098
He can't call anyone.
He'll ruin this.

824
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,366
Who's he calling?

825
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:48,620
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hang up!</font></i>

826
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,520
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Mother fucker!</font></i>

827
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,289
Hello?

828
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,500
Nice try, bitch.

829
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,236
José, where
are you?

830
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,962
Walter stood up, Henry.

831
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,006
Son of a bitch!

832
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,950
I just want us to
talk.

833
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,052
Just you and me.

834
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,219
Walter, shut up.

835
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,722
I'll never again

836
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,930
do what you want,

837
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:10,141
did you get me?

838
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,018
This is just a heads up

839
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,269
to let you know

840
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:15,146
I'm coming for you.

841
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,898
I didn't burn your house

842
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,608
because I decided

843
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,109
that was nothing.

844
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,111
Remember I know you, bitch.

845
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,014
I'll go for what you care
about the most.

846
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,450
Remember this.

847
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:30,437
No, José. Wait, José.
Don't hang, José.

848
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:07,073
Get on!

849
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,409
Are you stupid?

850
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,703
Fucking junkie.

851
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,314
What the hell
was that all about?

852
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,524
What were you
thinking?

853
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,025
- Just stop it.
- Fucking idiot.

854
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,419
There's another way.

855
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,612
- What?
- Yes.

856
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,656
There's another way
to catch him.

857
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,866
A better way.
I know him.

858
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:57,733
Beto, it's me.
Walter Blanco.

859
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:00,877
Yes, fine.

860
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,963
I think I might have

861
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,741
another job for your
uncle.
