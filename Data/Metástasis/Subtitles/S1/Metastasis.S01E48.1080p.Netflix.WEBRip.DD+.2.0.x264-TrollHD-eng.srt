1
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,573
Honey mustard.

2
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,893
That would be the name
for its commercialization.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,520
Clearly, this is not
the real flavor.

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,565
We have reduced
the mustard level

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,862
and we have increased
the fructose level.

6
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,421
In the second sample,

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,132
we've been more creative,

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,384
and we are satisfied

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,886
with the results.

10
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,288
It's a mixture
between tartar sauce

11
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,290
and some additive
very popular in Latin
America

12
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:42,251
made by mustard and
mayonnaise.

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,755
We've called it:
"tartarise".

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,172
Clearly, we will leave
the name decision

15
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:51,636
to the marketing department,
as usual.

16
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:56,390
Do you have some
comments
about the "tartarise"?

17
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,309
The third sample is
a mixture

18
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,829
between wasabi and avocado.

19
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,791
We have called it "aguasabi".

20
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,569
We are aware
this is a weird name,

21
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,714
but...

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,038
The fourth sample
is ketchup, basically.

23
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:22,141
Tomato sauce.

24
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,144
Simply that.

25
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,190
They're back, sir.

26
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,510
And not just the police
this time.

27
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,429
They are with
some Interpol detectives.

28
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,779
Sir, are you there?

29
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,281
Mr. Bisbal, the police

30
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,101
insist on talking
with you right now.

31
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,432
Teacher, it's starting

32
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,892
to drive me crazy.

33
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,810
It keeps me awake at night.

34
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,796
I lay there thinking
"Where is it? Where did it go?"

35
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,756
I can't stop
thinking about that.

36
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,926
Jose, Jose, please,
relax.

37
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,611
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Did you check your house?</font></i>

38
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,387
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It might be in any</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">place.</font></i>

39
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,264
No, man.
I've looked
everywhere.

40
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,824
I've seen it all.

41
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,701
Did you check your car?

42
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,662
I almost dismantled it,

43
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,664
I swear it isn't there.

44
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,416
Did you look thoroughly?

45
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,653
Look, it's not in my house.
It's not in my car.

46
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,171
And the more I think about it,

47
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,672
there's no way

48
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,466
it fell out in my locker.

49
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,926
Do you get it?

50
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,677
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That cigar with the poison</font></i>

51
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,054
must be on the street.

52
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,014
What if a kid finds it?

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,917
Some innocent person
could die because of me.

54
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,919
No, that is a strange
possibility.

55
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,463
Yes, but it's still
a possibility.

56
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,023
Listen, Jose,

57
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,441
stop thinking that.

58
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,943
You're being paranoid.

59
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,679
What if some kid
dies because of me?

60
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,181
I would kill myself,
I couldn't stand it.

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,017
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Jose, Jose...</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Take a deep breath.</font></i>

62
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,660
Relax.

63
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,354
This is what we're going
to do.

64
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,831
Jose, do you hear me?

65
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,374
Yes, yes.

66
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm going to come
over there, okay?

67
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,570
And we're going
to look
for it. Right?

68
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,172
Yes, please.

69
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,699
I'll be there in half
an hour.

70
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,618
Okay, thanks.
I'll wait for you.

71
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,054
What's up?

72
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,739
Shit, I can't find it.

73
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,742
What am I going to do?

74
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:06,237
Jose, how do you clean
your house?

75
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:09,240
I mean, do you have
a vacuum cleaner?

76
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:12,243
Yes, I have one,
and I have already checked it.

77
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,161
When was the last time
you checked it?

78
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:19,250
I don't know,
last week.

79
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,211
Do you have somebody
that helps you cleaning?

80
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,256
Yes, some lady
comes on Wednesday.

81
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,341
That means that the last
time
she came here

82
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,444
was three days ago?

83
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,467
Here it is, damn it!

84
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,826
- Is that it?
- Yes.

85
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,847
Are you sure?

86
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,099
Yes.

87
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,643
Take it. Careful.

88
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,312
Is it intact?

89
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,131
- I think so.
- Didn't it break?

90
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,466
- Let's see.
- Here it is.

91
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,609
Let me see.

92
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,074
Good.

93
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,535
Good!

94
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,786
Problem solved.

95
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,748
Let me get rid of this.

96
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:37,261
What a luck.

97
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,288
It's like taking a piano
off my shoulders.

98
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,014
I tell you, Jose.

99
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,725
Do you want some beer?

100
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,270
Jose...

101
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,565
Jose, what's wrong?

102
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,775
I almost killed you...

103
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,236
No, man, no.

104
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,639
- I almost shot you--
- No.

105
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,811
No, Jose, Jose, Jose,
it was a misunderstanding.

106
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:07,024
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

107
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,753
Don't say that.

108
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,738
I don't know
how I could be so stupid.

109
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,715
Jose, it's over.

110
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,009
I'm really sorry.

111
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,011
You don't have to be.

112
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,581
What happened,
happened for the best,

113
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,434
you hear me?

114
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,728
I wouldn't change a thing.

115
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,649
This was for the best.

116
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,468
You and me having
each other's back.

117
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,236
Working together.

118
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,862
This had to be like this.

119
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,492
This saved our lives.

120
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,120
I need you to understand that.

121
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,871
I want you to think about that

122
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,416
as we go forward.

123
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,419
Go forward where?

124
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,160
Thanks for coming
to this meeting, Mario.

125
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,515
I'll cut to the chase.

126
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,666
We asked you to come
here today because...

127
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:13,231
We're here to talk partnership.

128
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,568
- Thanks.

129
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,820
Partnership?

130
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,973
we figure we're going to start
cooking again.

131
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,617
Why not?

132
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,952
It would be an equal society.

133
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,622
You, Jose and me.

134
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,040
We have a good product, Mario,

135
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,417
there's a market to be filled.

136
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:33,793
A lot of money

137
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,212
to be made.

138
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,755
All of it.

139
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,450
The tasks would be
clearly divided.

140
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,286
Jose and I, we cook,
that's what we do,

141
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,205
but there's still
distribution, support,

142
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,267
logistics, that sort of thing.

143
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,936
I'll give you an example.

144
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,481
We'll need a steady supply

145
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,941
of methylamine.

146
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,386
With your experience
and connections,

147
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,739
you would be a great help.

148
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,391
Granted, there's
a lot of work ahead.

149
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,577
There's a lot of rebuilding.

150
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,937
And, no doubt, our profits
will be smaller.

151
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,581
At least at first.

152
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,567
But each of us will receive
a larger cut.

153
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,671
Owners, not employees.

154
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,632
Thanks, but no, thanks.

155
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,953
Mario, I know
you don't care for me.

156
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,099
We've had our issues.

157
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:33,462
I would suggest
that you leave emotion

158
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,021
out of this decision.

159
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:41,486
Walter, you are trouble.

160
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,806
I'm sorry Jose here
doesn't see it.

161
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,908
You are a time bomb.

162
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,286
Tick, tick, ticking,

163
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,022
and I have no intention
of being around for the
boom.

164
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,696
I'm going to give you
some piece of advise.

165
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,573
Seep on it.
Don't answer now.

166
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,425
Don't forget

167
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,661
this is a great opportunity
for you.

168
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,721
This is a big business.

169
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,222
However,

170
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,226
Jose and I are pressing on.

171
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,187
You know where to find us.

172
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,928
Welcome, buddy!

173
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,288
- Hi, Gómez!
- How are you?

174
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,765
What are you doing here?

175
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,725
Why aren't you upstairs?

176
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,502
I came to see
if you needed any help.

177
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,103
If you wanted something.

178
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,922
No, I'm good.
I can do it alone.

179
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,674
Do you know
what I need?

180
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,926
Don't you have the phone
of one of those masseuses

181
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,863
you use to visit?

182
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,682
Brother, it's good
to see you walking.

183
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,826
Yes, little by little.

184
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,311
Not exactly running
marathons.

185
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,163
When have you run one?

186
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,498
Unless it was for the beer.

187
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,543
Let's see.

188
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,130
You know what?

189
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,466
I'm proud of you, brother.

190
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,512
Homosexuality behind,

191
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,514
are they here already?

192
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,793
You should see their cars
and their assistants.

193
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,919
- All of them have one?
- All of them.

194
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,479
Let's do something.

195
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,898
We're going to go there

196
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,674
and you'll be my
assistant.

197
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,217
- What?
- Hold my arm.

198
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,261
But don't caress me,
brother.

199
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,555
Are you of those
who like to caress?

200
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,599
Look at
that.

201
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,200
Claudita, how are you?

202
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,203
Mr. Antonio, I hired

203
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,666
Manolo Bisbal in 1992.

204
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,585
Almost single-handedly,

205
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,237
he grew up a little
restaurant division

206
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,423
into an industry leader

207
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,493
and a source of great
personal pride.

208
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:14,539
I am shocked and saddened
by his death

209
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,936
and the circumstances of it,

210
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,312
but also outraged

211
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,591
by the damage his actions
have brought

212
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,651
upon my grand-father's company.

213
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,653
Alleged actions.

214
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,154
No more lies.

215
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,975
An innocent man
does not kill himself.

216
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,035
My people and I

217
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,706
are here to help.

218
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,542
We'll help you in anything

219
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,835
you need for this investigation.

220
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,714
Through your investigation

221
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,217
I pledge Madrigal's full

222
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,636
cooperation and transparency,

223
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,664
not only
at an international level,

224
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,249
but also
in the Colombian branch,

225
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,045
represented in this table
by Lidia Barrera,

226
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,090
the logistics'
director in Latin America.

227
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,967
Thank you very much,
Mr. Kristoff.

228
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,112
I confess I have

229
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,073
my selfish reasons.

230
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,242
On the one hand,

231
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,770
I don't want that
the international attention

232
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,289
this case has drawn

233
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,792
affects our image

234
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,418
in the Latin American market,

235
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,630
one of our favorites.

236
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,700
But, on the other hand,
I want to prove

237
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,453
that Manolo Bisbal
was a lone anomaly.

238
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,138
But if that is not the case,

239
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:45,338
I want to know it, Mr. Antonio,

240
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:41,559
who is involved too.

241
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:45,438
just as you do.

242
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,364
Do you like it?

243
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,117
And this one?

244
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,953
I'm leaving, dad.

245
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,480
- Aren't you eating all of it?
- No, I'm fine.

246
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,900
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

247
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,127
Bye, baby.

248
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,005
Say bye to mom.

249
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,341
Yes, I'll tell her.

250
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,952
- Have a good day.
- Same to you, dad.

251
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:18,055
Have a good day.

252
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,522
Could you wait here for me?

253
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,483
I'll be right back.

254
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,300
Cielo...

255
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,096
Cielo, get up.

256
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,874
The car wash will open
in 15 minutes.

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,521
I told Mariano he can open it.

258
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,733
You have to get up anyway.

259
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,277
Come, the shower is delicious.

260
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,114
Come on.

261
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,117
Come on, get up.

262
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,538
Boss, thanks a lot

263
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,248
for the whisky.

264
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,942
So when are you going
to announce it?

265
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,002
As I'm walking out the door

266
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,172
with my big cardboard box.

267
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,674
You know damn well

268
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,164
we're going to throw you
a big party.

269
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,918
Henry, I want to congratulate
you for you great work

270
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,838
in the investigation
of Gustavo Cortés.

271
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,940
I blame myself every day

272
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,652
for not listening to you.

273
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,262
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

274
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,573
Tell me one thing.

275
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,701
What was that giant magnet

276
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,955
in the evidence room?

277
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,248
It seems that they were going

278
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,708
for all the information

279
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,210
in the personal laptop

280
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,253
of Gustavo Cortés.

281
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,630
Anything left of the laptop?

282
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,009
They erased it all.

283
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,052
Let me get it straight, Henry:

284
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,455
Héctor Salamanca
killed Gustavo Cortés,

285
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,767
but who gave him the bomb?

286
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,020
Whole lot of questions

287
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,755
and not much in the way
of answers.

288
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,924
They are checking
his bank accounts

289
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,900
to see if any name pops out,

290
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,902
any data, any hint.

291
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,571
Unbelievable!

292
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:45,284
I had him out to my house.

293
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,330
We cooked out in the backyard.

294
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,526
And he's somebody else
completely.

295
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,837
I can't imagine

296
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,422
how you feel about that.

297
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:02,635
Being betrayed like that?

298
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,596
Not even to my worst enemy.

299
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,869
Hi, what can I get you?

300
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,313
Just tea,
please.
Chamomile.

301
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,123
We don't have chamomile tea.

302
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,275
Then some sort of bergamot,
but not Earl Grey.

303
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,127
What?

304
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,947
I like soy milk
instead of dairy.

305
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,632
We work with dairy milk.

306
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,134
Hard.

307
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,095
Do you have skimmed milk?

308
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,679
No, just dairy milk.

309
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,139
Let's do this.

310
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,557
I want a cup of tea,

311
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,975
but with filtered water.

312
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,435
Do you have stevia?

313
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,881
Never mind. I brought my
own.

314
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,776
Lidia.

315
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,761
Are you coming to me
or am I coming to you?

316
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,781
We'll talk like this.

317
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,824
I'm coming.

318
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,377
Relax.

319
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,364
Take a breath, will you?
This place is safe.

320
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:26,077
No one's going to see
you here.

321
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,971
Alberto, what a coincidence!

322
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,289
How did I not see you
sitting back there?

323
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,291
A friend of mine,
I just met him.

324
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,211
Mario, do you want
anything else?

325
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:37,939
No, darling. Thanks.

326
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,718
Okay, let's do
something.

327
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,136
Take that shawl off
your head,

328
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,739
and that sunglasses also

329
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:51,978
because you're only
drawing the attention.

330
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,580
Good.

331
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:58,042
Breathe in, breathe out.

332
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,044
Very good.

333
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,047
Drink your whatever.

334
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,218
Who killed Gustavo?

335
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,970
Haven't I told you

336
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,513
not to worry about that?

337
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,291
Let's cut to the chase.
Why did you call me?

338
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,394
What is so important?

339
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,404
What is this?

340
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,267
A list of 11 names.
You know them all.

341
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,894
I do.
So what with them?

342
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,288
Those men know us, Mario.

343
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,665
They can hurt us.

344
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,210
What?

345
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,669
No specific.

346
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,088
I'm just pointing out facts.

347
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,383
These men were on the payroll,

348
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,426
very publicly.

349
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,387
They trace back to Pollos

350
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,929
and the laundry.

351
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,249
They trace back to Madrigal,
and then to us,

352
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,309
because they're going to talk.

353
00:22:56,334 --> 00:23:00,355
They're going to blame us.

354
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,341
What can we do
to erase them from the list?

355
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,484
Do you understand me?

356
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,945
And I'm not saying all of them.

357
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,639
But there's always
a weak link somewhere.

358
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,199
These are the 11 I know of,

359
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,285
but I'd love your input.

360
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,062
I never met your chemist,
for instance.

361
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,580
I don't know who he is.

362
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,499
I'd love your input.

363
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,236
You want me to kill every
man
on that list?

364
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:33,346
Do you think we should?

365
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,181
You're scared, right?

366
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,807
Yes, of course.

367
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,603
You're very upset,

368
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,299
which I'm going to
factor
into my response here.

369
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,651
These are my guys,

370
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,820
and they are solid.

371
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,074
I trust them.

372
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,810
- Got it?
- Are you sure?

373
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,396
What about Carlitos,
at the warehouse?

374
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,857
Didn't one time you have
to shoot him through the hand?

375
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,067
You think that didn't
stick
in his memory?

376
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,610
What about Jairo,
the one with the nickname
"Paleta",

377
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,296
at the laundry?

378
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,298
They're sure to pick him up.

379
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,468
They already have. Last night.

380
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,885
I tell you again.

381
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,553
My guys are solid.

382
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,747
I vetted them with great
care,
and Gustavo made sure

383
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,892
they were well compensated

384
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,420
in the event of a situation
such as this.

385
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:23,896
They're paid

386
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,356
to keep their mouths shut.

387
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,233
And they will.

388
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:31,404
How can we be so sure?

389
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,432
I don't know what kind of
movies you've been
watching,

390
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,809
but here in the real
world

391
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,437
we don't kill 11
people

392
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:43,649
as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

393
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,695
First, because that's not
good.

394
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,032
Besides, that's not
a good strategy

395
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,411
if you don't want
to draw the attention.

396
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,264
Got it?

397
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,808
Yes, I got it.

398
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,560
Good.

399
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,380
So we're off
that very silly idea?

400
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,320
Yes, sir.

401
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,365
Good.

402
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,742
My treat.

403
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:22,079
Next time, drink coffee.

404
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,647
We drink coffee
here.

405
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,525
Drink tea
when you're in England.

406
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,521
Good morning, lady.

407
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,381
I'm looking for
detective Henry.

408
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,815
No, no, no--

409
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,817
Hi, Carlitos!

410
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,160
How's everything?

411
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:05,773
Mario, they talked to
me,

412
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,233
but I
don't--

413
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,544
You can't smoke in here.

414
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,295
Careful with that, Carlitos.

415
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,297
Go walk.

416
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,341
Yes.

417
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,979
Mrs., detective Henry, please.

418
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,470
Mario, have a seat,
please.

419
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,614
Thanks.

420
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,990
I can call you Mario, right?

421
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,701
Yes, that's my name.

422
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,538
Good.

423
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,149
Are you waiving your right
to have an attorney present?

424
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,027
Yes, I don't think
it's necessary.

425
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:55,114
Could you state that
to the camera, please?

426
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,907
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm waiving my right</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">to have an attorney</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">present</font></i>

427
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,384
in this conversation.

428
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,885
Thank you.

429
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,221
We just have a few questions.

430
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,722
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Okay.</font></i>

431
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,142
You're currently employed

432
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,645
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

433
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,271
Yes, sir.

434
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,523
And what do you do there?

435
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:16,486
Corporate security.

436
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,362
Corporate security?

437
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:23,226
And what do you do
in a place like that?

438
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,187
Do you avoid the food
flies away?

439
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,862
I conduct employees
background checks,

440
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,716
I oversee loss prevention.

441
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,427
And that's a full-time job?

442
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,205
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a
full-time job.

443
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,183
Yeah, well, if I were you,

444
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,459
I'd start sending out
those resumes.

445
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:52,229
They aren't valuing your work.

446
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:57,676
It says here you're
a private investigator?

447
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,196
Where you licensed?

448
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,890
Bogotá, but I can operate
in all the country.

449
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,435
Are you licensed
to carry a firearm?

450
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,413
Yes, I am.

451
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:14,335
Mario, if we take a look

452
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,086
at your bank accounts,

453
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,115
will you have
everything in order?

454
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,451
I'm guessing you've
already done that,

455
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:24,595
so you tell me.

456
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,805
Don't you see his face

457
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,769
a little bit familiar?

458
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,688
Am I right?

459
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,506
Here it says that you are
a former cop.

460
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,024
Were you a cop?

461
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,401
Yes, sir. Ten years.

462
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,943
Ten years.

463
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:43,514
We know that your tenure
as a police officer

464
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,617
ended dramatically.

465
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,245
Tell me all about that.

466
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,356
I prefer not to,
if it's not necessary.

467
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes, you're right.

468
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,627
You're right, Mario.

469
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,170
I'm more interested

470
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,130
in other kind of subjects.

471
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,299
For instance,

472
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,119
why Gustavo Cortés decided
to put a guy like you

473
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,038
in charge
of his corporate security.

474
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,725
I can't imagine you

475
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,476
investigating the background

476
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,353
of the employees.

477
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,006
Right?
You're not that kind of guy.

478
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,734
You have another profile, Mario.

479
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,778
You have an action guy profile,

480
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,029
in the streets.

481
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,823
With due respect,

482
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,601
you're like those guys
who get their hands dirty.

483
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,036
I believe Gustavo Cortés

484
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,414
hired you as security head,

485
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,500
but in his drugs society.

486
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,753
He must've needed help

487
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,423
running that drug empire of his.

488
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,325
First I'm hearing
about that.

489
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,702
I don't know
anything about that.

490
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,330
No, no, no, Mario,
not to us.

491
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,140
We have a guy that could put you

492
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,460
in that underground lab,
and he'll testify to it.

493
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,020
Do you remember?

494
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,022
So from here on out,

495
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:03,761
this can go hard or easy,
so what's it going to be?

496
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,684
If you have
something
against me,

497
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,746
you can handcuff me.

498
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,482
Please, I want to know
because I don't
understand.

499
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:21,504
Am I under arrest?

500
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,656
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Please, state that</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">for the camera.</font></i>

501
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:27,092
No, you're not under arrest.

502
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,678
Currently.

503
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,582
Do you have
any more questions for
me?

504
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,959
Because you've got me
very stirred up with all these
false accusations.

505
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,729
I'm not young.

506
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,339
If I'm not under
arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

507
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,860
Yes, you can leave.

508
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,653
Excuse me.

509
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,112
Although we could talk

510
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,156
about the two million dollars

511
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,559
in your
granddaughter's name

512
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:57,064
in some Cayman
islands bank.

513
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:04,296
I seems Gustavo Cortés

514
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,866
had all these
secret
offshore bank
accounts

515
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,511
in those tax heavens.

516
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,388
And they're all in the names

517
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,164
of certain people
on his payroll.

518
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,934
People he trusted.

519
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,352
He gave money to them.

520
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,563
The manager of the laundry

521
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,314
has a bank account,

522
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,551
the distribution manager
of Los Pollos Hermanos,

523
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,595
Carlitos, the one
from...

524
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,513
The owner of a
chemical warehouse.

525
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,031
All of them have an account.

526
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,933
And the strangest
thing

527
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,394
is that, in this list
of people,

528
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,913
your granddaughter pops out.

529
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,981
I don't get it,
among those men.

530
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,499
Do you understand?

531
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,376
And it's also strange

532
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,405
that she has more money
than anybody else.

533
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,407
So my partner here

534
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,326
"No, no, this is really
weird".

535
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,329
- Right?
- A girl?

536
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,205
This girl is doing
all this stuff?

537
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,807
No, no, no.

538
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,351
A little criminal girl.

539
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,937
So I said:

540
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,797
"No, no, wait a minute.
Slow down, partner".

541
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,381
"Are you crazy",
I told him.

542
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:06,316
"Are you crazy?"

543
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,636
"Why are you blaming
the little girl?"

544
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,864
So suddenly I realized

545
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:15,852
that maybe it was
from her dear old granddaddy.

546
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,246
What do you say?

547
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,732
I don't know
what you're talking about.

548
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:26,111
Lucky for you, Mario,
because I'm telling one
thing.

549
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,071
That money was
seized
by anti-narcotics.

550
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,825
Two million dollars.
I can't believe it.

551
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,744
I would go crazy.
Right?

552
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,330
Okay, but let's see
the context here.

553
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,934
Mario didn't touch that money.

554
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,937
He didn't even smell it.

555
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,939
So you are not guilty.

556
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,398
The ones that are guilty

557
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,300
are the other men
on the list,

558
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,319
who have used the money

559
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,530
and they're in a big problem.

560
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,516
Here's the thing,
Mario.

561
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,353
One of your guys is
going to roll on you,

562
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,146
and then we'll
definitely handcuff
you.

563
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,165
Okay, but before that happens,

564
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,042
you can help us

565
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,336
and we can help you.

566
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,921
Do you understand?

567
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,757
You can tell us what you know,

568
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,509
for instance,

569
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,160
you can tell us
who's still out there

570
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,263
and we don't know about.

571
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,583
Tell us this story,
Mario.

572
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,102
You cooperate, we help you.

573
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,731
Your granddaughter might be able

574
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,108
to keep some of that money.

575
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,611
It's in her name, right?

576
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:37,182
Everybody loves
this kind of deal.

577
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:41,787
So what do you say?

578
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,982
I don't know anything
about any money.

579
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,125
Excuse me.

580
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,303
First order of business

581
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,681
is to find a new place to cook.

582
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,876
Before anyone says it,
no more RV's.

583
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,519
No more buses.

584
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,671
- Nothing like that.
- Wait a minute.

585
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,799
The crystal ship
did pretty good for us.

586
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,759
- "The crystal ship"?
- Yes.

587
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,819
Who called it that?

588
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,487
I did.

589
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,906
When? I never heard you.

590
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,533
I said it to myself.

591
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,602
It's a cute and suitable
name,
at least for me.

592
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,062
"Cute".
Okay, all right.

593
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,748
I'll admit it held us on

594
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,250
as a starter lab.

595
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,986
- Well...
- But it's too small.

596
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,879
Too dark.

597
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,114
We need something
much better, Saúl.

598
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,510
Someplace safe from prying eyes.

599
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,580
Saúl, no, no.
Before you ask,

600
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,750
I tell you I don't want
your amusement park

601
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,394
you are trying to sell us.

602
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,146
No!

603
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,715
Security against detection
is paramount.

604
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:55,594
Someplace that doesn't
attract the attention.

605
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,155
No jungle, no mountains,

606
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,407
nothing like a cocaine lab.

607
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,367
That's too complicated.

608
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,912
In town is trickier.

609
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:08,357
I mean, you got a lot more
of your prying eyes.

610
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:13,445
If Gustavo can manage it,
then so can we.

611
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,422
Materials.

612
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,966
Where are we with that?

613
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,093
Good.

614
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,329
Except methylamine.
No surprise.

615
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,289
I think our best
option

616
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,624
is to switch back
to a pseudo cook,

617
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,225
like in the old times.

618
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,727
No, no old times!

619
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,146
We're not lowering the level.

620
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,106
And what do we do?

621
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,966
We get it. There is methylamine
out there.

622
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,677
- Where?
- Jose, have faith.

623
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,570
Can I offer a thought?

624
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,865
Thanks.

625
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,492
Let's think about this:

626
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,452
Say a guy wins the lottery.

627
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,454
Ten million bucks.

628
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,039
The biggest prize.

629
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:53,360
The very next day, what's
the one thing he does not do?

630
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,004
What?

631
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,947
He does not go buy
another lottery ticket.

632
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,449
He counts his lucky stars
and sails off into the sunset,

633
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:03,662
which, seems to me, some advice
you two might take.

634
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,263
Saúl, tell me,

635
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,057
what lottery did I win exactly?

636
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,101
You're alive, Walter!

637
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,061
After all that has happened,

638
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,047
you are alive,
and that's the biggest prize.

639
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,193
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

640
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,887
I owe Jose the money
he gave me

641
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,446
to do the magnet thing,

642
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,532
and I have other debts.

643
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,393
And you're asking me
to stop right now?

644
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,438
Saúl, there is gold
in the streets,

645
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,776
just waiting for someone
to come and scoop it up.

646
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,570
And you think this is
the right time to stop?

647
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,630
Are you also asking Jose

648
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,132
to quit right now?

649
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,052
No, that's not going to happen.

650
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,066
Again.

651
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,554
Wait a minute,
darling.

652
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,700
What's up, Carlitos?

653
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,660
Mario, can you talk?

654
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,704
One moment.

655
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,667
Yes.

656
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:16,902
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The anti-narcotics agents</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">called me again.</font></i>

657
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,129
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">They want to interrogate me.</font></i>

658
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,948
- Did you talk to your lawyer?
- Yes, of course.

659
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,450
But these people
and the Colombian police

660
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,494
took all my money.
I have nothing left.

661
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,370
What do you
want me
to do about
it?

662
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,181
I don't know.

663
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:32,584
We have to talk.
Not on the phone.

664
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,644
Can you come to my house?

665
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,022
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Give me two hours.</font></i>

666
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,024
Okay.

667
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,820
Cristian, give me your weapon.

668
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:29,532
Slowly.

669
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,451
Right.

670
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,412
Come on over, let's talk.

671
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,096
Have a seat.

672
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,730
Carlitos.

673
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,640
How much was Lidia
going to pay you?

674
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,202
Ten thousand a name.

675
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:16,646
How far did you get
down the list?

676
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,499
Just Carlitos.

677
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:24,196
For you, she was
going to pay 30.000.

678
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,073
I'm very sorry about this,
Mario.

679
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,050
But I needed the money.

680
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,410
The police and
anti-narcotics

681
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,887
took it all, man.

682
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,638
I know.

683
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,182
Are you ready?

684
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,000
Mario, let me explain,
please...

685
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,083
Lucy!

686
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,526
Luciana, come
and have some cookies.

687
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:08,115
Come
down.

688
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,134
I'm coming, mom.

689
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,178
Go.

690
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,714
Do not
speak.

691
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,598
Don't hurt my daughter,
please.

692
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:39,062
If you stay silent,
she's going to be fine.

693
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:43,942
Do you know why I'm
here?

694
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,778
If you have anything to
say
to me, now's the time.

695
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:54,244
Two good men died
because of you.

696
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,430
Don't shoot me in the face.

697
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,290
I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

698
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,292
Your daughter won't
see you.

699
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,794
Nobody is going to find you,
Lidia.

700
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,021
What? No.

701
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:08,384
No, no, no, Mario,
I'm a single mother.

702
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,303
- Lower your voice.
- She has to find me.

703
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,263
Do you want her
finding your body?

704
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,407
No, I can't disappear.

705
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:18,952
She has to know

706
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,242
I didn't leave her.

707
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,412
what happened to her mother.

708
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,997
Keep your voice down.

709
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,107
I'll scream
and I'll keep screaming.

710
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:26,276
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

711
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:27,836
You have to promise, Mario.

712
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:31,114
You have to promise me
I won't disappear.

713
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,617
Can you still get your hands
on methylamine?

714
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:38,080
Focus, Lidia,
I asked you a question.

715
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:42,767
Methylamine.

716
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,770
Maybe. Why?

717
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,380
Hello.

718
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:12,797
You still plan

719
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,175
to move forward?

720
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,677
Yes, why?

721
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,498
I've reconsidered.
I'm in.

722
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:24,642
Good.

723
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:38,556
Go with your kid.
And don't forget the
cookies.

724
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,980
Lucy, come here, honey.
Come with mom.

725
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,414
Were you
sleeping?

726
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,503
Well, you missed a good
meal.

727
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,422
The lasagna came out
very well,.

728
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,261
I wrapped some up for
you
if you'd like some
later.

729
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,453
You know, it gets easier.

730
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:25,770
I promise
you that it
does.

731
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,314
What you're feeling right
now

732
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,816
about Ernesto
and about what
happened...

733
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,919
Everything. It'll pass.

734
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,249
We don't have to be
worried
about anything

735
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,268
because we do what we do

736
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:52,272
for a very good reason.

737
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,716
There's no better
reason

738
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,860
than family.
