1
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,944
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Well, Mr. Walter,</font></i>

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,304
fortunately,
there was no need

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,015
to clean up the sticky
blood as last time.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,201
Sticky blood?

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,477
Yes, it's just that
a few days ago

6
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,079
I hit a stray dog.

7
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,231
- I told you that, remember?
Right.

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,292
This car is in good shape.

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,528
And as to Junior's call,
well,

10
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,672
the crankshaft was replaced,

11
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,423
also the break fluid

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,884
and the oil.

13
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,385
Haver.

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,745
What about the noise
I told you about?

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,080
It was a problem
on the door window.

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,415
- Right.
- That's all.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,017
Junior,

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,334
don't give me
that look.

19
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,086
This is a very fine
car.

20
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,713
It looks like
it's made for a woman,

21
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,773
but it's a very nice car.

22
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,010
Don't get carried away
by appearances.

23
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,596
And you're good to
go.

24
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,515
But if you stress out
with the city traffic,

25
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,559
that's not my
problem.

26
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,703
I ride her nice and slow, Haver.

27
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,204
Right.

28
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,873
This car, well,

29
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,191
she brings me
so many memories.

30
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,086
Memories?

31
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,113
Yes, this was my wife's car,
Junior.

32
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,575
She'll never forgive me
for selling it.

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,161
They don't make cars
like this anymore.

34
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,788
- This is a fine car.
- Haver,

35
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,347
let's do business.

36
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,766
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,183
What would you give me for it?

38
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,685
You know it well.

39
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,253
You know exactly
what it's worth.

40
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,380
What's more,
I'll give you a discount.

41
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,550
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm actually serious.

42
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,069
And this one.

43
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,529
Dad, what about me?

44
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,016
Don't you want a new
car?

45
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,700
Yes!

46
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,201
I do.

47
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,620
The thing is, Mr. Walter,

48
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,814
a minute ago
I wasn't thinking

49
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,732
- about buying a car--
- Perfect, then think it over!

50
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,460
Buy one, take two.

51
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,878
Walter,

52
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,296
are you nuts?

53
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,881
Why?

54
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,492
Are you the only one
who can have a new car here?

55
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,344
Are you being serious?

56
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,222
Very serious.

57
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,189
You're so slow!

58
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,769
Yes, of course

59
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,922
we'll be working closely
on the investigation,

60
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,924
and if there happens to be
any movement
or something strange,

61
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,399
we'll let you know in Spain.

62
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,401
Don't you worry.

63
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,531
Yes.

64
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,534
Yes, sir.

65
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,956
Yes, sir!

66
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,666
Yes, sir. All clear.

67
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,793
Don't you worry at all.

68
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,837
Goodbye.

69
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,705
I can't talk,
I'm at work right now.

70
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,473
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, I know.</font></i>

71
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,542
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">This is a heads-up.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">You've got visitors.</font></i>

72
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,561
Visitors? You mean today?

73
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,213
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- I mean 30 seconds.</font></i>
- Mario, Mario.

74
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,986
Come in.

75
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,362
Boss, someone's here for you.

76
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,406
Mrs. Lidia Barrera!

77
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,616
Remember me?

78
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,812
We met at the office
the other day.

79
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,496
Right?

80
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,873
Let me introduce myself again.

81
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,541
My name is Henry Navarro.

82
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,376
This is agent Gómez.

83
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,213
We're from Anti-Narcotics.

84
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,007
Yes, of course I remember you.

85
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,968
What can I do for you?

86
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,948
There.

87
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,184
The one over there
in the navy clothes.

88
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,165
This can't be.

89
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,421
Ahhhhh!

90
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,890
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes?</font></i>

91
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,418
They got Ronaldo,
Ronaldo is done, Mario.

92
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,170
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Okay.</font></i>
- Okay?

93
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,214
No, no, no,
this is not okay at all.

94
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,008
The look he just gave me
was the antithesis of "Okay."

95
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,651
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Breathe, Lidia.</font></i>

96
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,862
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No one's talking to the police.</font></i>

97
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,098
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Neither him</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">nor the ones we've got in jail.</font></i>

98
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:48,657
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I told you I'll handle it.</font></i>

99
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,450
Did you not understand?

100
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,477
Half a dozen cops
just came through the door!

101
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,897
Screaming and yelling at me,
and they made me
take them to the warehouse.

102
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,249
To the warehouse!

103
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,277
Look, Ronaldo
was my person of trust.

104
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,945
He was the one
who turned off the cameras,

105
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,571
the one who drove
the transport truck.

106
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,590
I can't do this alone!

107
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,577
Let's be real here, Mario,
this is messed up.

108
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,137
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Nothing's messed up.</font></i>

109
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,930
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'll send someone else in.</font></i>

110
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,587
Thanks, O
appreciate
it.

111
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,429
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">No, It's</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">just...</font></i>

112
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,015
How can you buy a
car

113
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,475
with only 500,
500 horsepower?

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,494
500 horse-- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

115
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,079
That 500-car,

116
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,539
it looks like a skate!

117
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,650
Horsepower isn't
everything.

118
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,485
You have to factor in
drag and torque

119
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,445
and suspension
and weight of the car.

120
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,047
I beat you good!

121
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,033
No, you drive
like a geezer--

122
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,634
What, a geezer?

123
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,995
Tell me, can a geezer
do donuts?

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,788
You've never done a donut
in your life, dad.

125
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,265
Never in your life!

126
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,726
Let's bet on that!

127
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,228
So you have done donuts?

128
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,587
- Never, never.
- I mean it--

129
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,898
What's more, if you behave,

130
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,800
if you show me
just a modicum of
respect,

131
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,260
I'll teach
you.

132
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,987
Okay, I take your word for it!

133
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,348
- I really do.
- Fine, then.

134
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,284
You've got a deal.

135
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,019
No, you know what?
I take that back.

136
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,478
- No, not that.
- No!

137
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,022
- No, no.
- No, come on... No.

138
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,233
- No, it's a deal.
- No, it's not.

139
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,402
We didn't sign anything,
we didn't shake on it--

140
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,695
- Yes, we did shake it.
- Hey, no cheating!

141
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,030
- You did now!
- That doesn't count!

142
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,589
Don't be a cheater, no--

143
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,133
No, it's a deal, dad.

144
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,177
No...

145
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,553
Walter...

146
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,931
Donuts.

147
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,145
Yes!

148
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,761
Um, I figured
out a way

149
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,822
to justify buying the cars.

150
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,034
No problem.

151
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,061
Mine, we'll call it
a birthday present
to myself.

152
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,355
Anyone can
understand that,
right?

153
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,857
And Junior's,
well...

154
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,709
His dad's too giving,

155
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,986
too soft,
who spoils him too
much.

156
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,130
What?

157
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,409
Sound
familiar?

158
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,703
So what do
you think?

159
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,374
- Don't be upset about it.

160
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,645
Wait.

161
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,231
Before I forget,

162
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,840
there's something
I want to give you.

163
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,112
Tomorrow we'll get more.

164
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,658
Did you start cooking again?

165
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,560
I had to,
yes.

166
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,772
We have to make up
somehow

167
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,108
what we lost
with that Ernesto issue.

168
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,264
Walter.

169
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,602
What do you think about...

170
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,104
a student exchange

171
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,981
abroad?

172
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,277
You mean for Junior?

173
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,096
There are great offers
for Canada.

174
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,226
Why's
that?

175
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:02,644
Junior
can manage with the language.

176
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,481
It's a
bilingual
school.

177
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,067
And the next year
he'd be off to
college.

178
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,486
I don't know,
Cielo.

179
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,197
What if he studies
abroad?

180
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,116
We'd miss out
on a whole year with him.

181
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,803
Right, but this exchange

182
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,788
is not only
about the language.

183
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,391
It's also about the culture.

184
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,518
If he goes to French Canada,

185
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,937
he could learn French.

186
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,609
Why are you considering this?

187
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,029
No, I don't know...

188
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,849
I just Just thinking
about the kids.

189
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,523
So have you thought
where we could send
Valentina?

190
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,525
A place for
eight-month-olds?

191
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,360
I don't know,
maybe a Norway school,

192
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,195
or something
like that?

193
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,134
I don't know, I just--

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,515
I'm thinking maybe--

195
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,832
I don't know.
Some other environment.

196
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,476
I just think they could be

197
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,520
better.

198
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,216
They could be better
in another
environment.

199
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,819
Cielo...

200
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,599
Cielo, I mean
it.

201
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,768
What's wrong
with this
environment?

202
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,495
No.

203
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,912
Nothing.

204
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,356
I know these last few
days
have been rough.

205
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,112
What happened to
Ernesto,

206
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,214
the threat to Henry.

207
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,536
But that's all
over,

208
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,372
and there's
nothing
to be afraid
of anymore.

209
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:31,960
From here on
out,

210
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,338
everything will be
easier.

211
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,066
I promise.

212
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,409
You know what I'd like?

213
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,730
I want us to try
and start looking forward
to things again.

214
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,692
I don't know,
plans.

215
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,655
Speaking of
which...

216
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,741
what have you
planned
for my birthday?

217
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,368
Okay, just
kidding.

218
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,910
With everything
that's been going on
lately,

219
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,706
I'd understand
if you haven't
even given it a
thought.

220
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,643
But we should.

221
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,836
You know? We
should...

222
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,131
I don't know,
celebrate.

223
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,010
I think it might be good
for all of us.

224
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,472
It would really
cheer us up.

225
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,432
Let's have a
birthday party.

226
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,393
What do you
say?

227
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,037
Alright.

228
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,982
I could
dare...

229
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,193
ask for
chocolate
cake.

230
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,529
How about
it?

231
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,673
Aha.

232
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,992
That's
it.

233
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,996
Life is good,
Cielo.

234
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,956
We have to enjoy
it.

235
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,728
Good night.

236
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,912
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's daddy's birthday.</font></i>

237
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,372
Look at this little flower.

238
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,191
- Happy birthday, dad!
- Aw, thanks!

239
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,985
That's tasty!
- Hey, mom.

240
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,572
Why didn't you do the
number
with dad's bacon

241
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,240
like you do every
year?

242
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,133
Don't worry, I'll do it.

243
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,869
But mom's always
done that.

244
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,013
You know? He's right.

245
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,641
Well, it is sort of a tradition.

246
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,476
Look, Valentina.

247
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,504
Watch what mom does with that.
Look.

248
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,149
It's five and one.

249
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,843
No, but that one
is too small.

250
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,528
Yes, that's true.

251
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,946
Hey!

252
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,808
- No!
- What do you mean "hey"?

253
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,784
Hey, young man. Easy now.

254
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,078
This is very good.

255
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,580
That's so you learn

256
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,082
how it's done in this house.

257
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,501
Making sacrifices.

258
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,590
Thanks.

259
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,635
Look.

260
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,971
Thanks.

261
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,014
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Man, this is unbelievable!</font></i>

262
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,183
This guy Gustavo Cortés,

263
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,918
six feet under
and half a face,

264
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,645
and he's still screwing with us.

265
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,522
No!

266
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,066
So, what's next?

267
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,593
Well, let's see
what we've got.

268
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,278
Take this, for example.

269
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,780
Manolo...

270
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,055
in Spain.
He kills himself.

271
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,741
Right.

272
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,726
And who's on the other side?
Gustavo Cortés.

273
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,745
You know what I need?

274
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,956
Someone here, in the middle.

275
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,192
Someone who connected
or introduced them.

276
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,944
I think we're not
seeing
the whole picture.

277
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,671
But what about someone else?

278
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,533
In Madrigal, maybe,
or what?

279
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,803
There!

280
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,996
What about that woman
we visited, what's-her-name?

281
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,223
The nervous one, with a ring.

282
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,683
The one who...

283
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,644
Who talked all "".

284
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,086
- Lidia?
- Lidia!

285
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,631
Lidia Barrera,
yes, sir!

286
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,007
- What do you think?
- No.

287
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,551
- What?
- No, not her.

288
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,444
She's too psycho.

289
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,946
Too uptight in bed, surely.

290
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,890
- No, what--?
- Uptight--?

291
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,309
Don't you underestimate
chicks like that, man.

292
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:20,772
Those women are usually
nymphos or sadomasochistic.

293
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,399
I mean this, man,
seriously!

294
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,942
She's the master
of being together.

295
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,585
Her?

296
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,086
How together can she be?

297
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,197
She was wearing
mismatched shoes.

298
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,699
Didn't you
see?

299
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,075
You call that
being together, Gómez?

300
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,452
Man--
- Gentlemen.

301
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,013
What's up, boss?

302
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,998
No, no,
don't get up, please.

303
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,018
How is the Cortés case?

304
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,477
We're on it, boss.

305
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,437
Working through the grief.

306
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,006
How soon
before you submit a final?

307
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,692
Well, we've been kicking around

308
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,652
a few ideas.

309
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,971
I wanted
to comment on something.

310
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,389
This Gustavo Cortés
case.

311
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,807
At first,, I
thought

312
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:59,118
this was just a mop-up job.

313
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,495
And then you changed your mind?

314
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,330
Yes, because now,

315
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,790
now that we've been questioning

316
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,959
all of Cortés' people,

317
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,627
no one is talking to us.

318
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,253
Nobody saw anything,

319
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,214
nobody knows anyone.

320
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,799
You know?

321
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,659
So we find that really
weird.
You know why?

322
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,995
If it had been
an enemy of Cortés

323
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,555
the one who killed him,

324
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,791
somebody
would have told out on
him.

325
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,350
So what, then?

326
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,352
Well, me and Gómez here think

327
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,879
it's likely
there's somebody out there

328
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,147
putting pressure on them,

329
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,108
forbidding them to talk,

330
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,218
keeping them in
line, right?

331
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,695
Here's what we think, sir.

332
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,889
It could be
Mario Arboleda.

333
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,075
The thing is he's a tough one

334
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,617
to get passed...

335
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,936
He knows how to move,
how to protect himself.

336
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,353
- He works on strategy.
- Aha.

337
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,122
We've got three men on him

338
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,942
as we speak,
watching on him 24/7.

339
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,236
And one more thing, boss.
Look.

340
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,755
About the Gustavo Cortés case.

341
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,658
This may have nothing
to do with it,

342
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,702
but there seems to be
a comeback

343
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,721
of blue meth on the streets.

344
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,389
Tell him, Gómez.

345
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,849
It showed up in Bogota, sir,

346
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,768
and in other nearby cities.

347
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,670
It's the same one
as last time.

348
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,463
We took it to the lab,
and it's the same one.

349
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,857
It could be old inventory

350
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,400
leaking out.

351
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,760
We don't
know that
yet.

352
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,595
Or it could be
somebody's rebooting

353
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,739
using former cooks

354
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,140
of Gustavo Cortés'
team.

355
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,909
I thought we had the cooks

356
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,326
in the burned bodies

357
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,787
found in the fire

358
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,789
over at the lab.

359
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,290
I even dared to believe

360
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,900
maybe one of them
was Heisenberg.

361
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,778
Well, everything's
possible.

362
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,781
There's still
a lot of questions.

363
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,034
- Gómez.
- Sir?

364
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,385
Could you give us a moment?

365
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,262
Excuse me.

366
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,687
Henry.

367
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,315
I've got to say your work here

368
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,651
has been excellent.

369
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,069
Thank you, sir.

370
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,113
But we've been thinking

371
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,241
it's time you made a change.

372
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,912
I'm working on my retirement,

373
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,081
and I think you'd be perfect

374
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,693
for the promotion
in this department.

375
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,534
I'm not sure what
to say.

376
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,261
No, no words to--

377
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,456
It's a very big step up,
Henry.

378
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,184
You'd have to supervise

379
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,145
every case that comes from here.

380
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,981
And you'd also

381
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,800
need to reassign
all your own cases.

382
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,445
Gustavo Cortés included.

383
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,532
I know, Henry.

384
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,476
We'd be losing
a good field man,

385
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,037
but we could also gain

386
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,746
much strategy at the office.

387
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,874
So what do you say?

388
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,943
Well, considering my
wife,

389
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:58,322
if I said "no"
to this offer,

390
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,366
she would
murder me,

391
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,177
yes, I accept, boss.

392
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,138
The job's yours, Henry.

393
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,142
Thanks a lot.

394
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,236
Hey, dad.

395
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,279
Hey.

396
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,647
Where's your
mom?

397
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,249
In the kitchen.

398
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,209
Hey!

399
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,002
Hey.

400
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,712
So what's the plan?

401
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,949
- Henry and María are coming.
- Aha.

402
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,993
Roasted
chicken,
mashed
potatoes,

403
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,870
and chocolate cake,
as requested.

404
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,972
Okay.

405
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,353
What are you doing?

406
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,547
Trying to download
a pirate game.

407
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,649
Pirate-- okay.

408
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,535
What's up?

409
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,579
Me? Nothing.

410
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,488
Thought you'd be
more jazzed
about the new job.

411
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,240
Baby, I'm so proud of
you.

412
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,550
Really, congratulations.

413
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,869
- María!
- Alright.

414
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,138
Careful.

415
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,539
I'm
sorry.

416
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,099
You can congratulate me later.

417
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,792
No need to crash
into something--

418
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,669
I'm
sorry!

419
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,483
Honey, what's the matter?

420
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,444
María, you're acting weird.

421
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,596
You look upset.
What is it? Tell me.

422
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,157
What's wrong?

423
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,432
I made a
promise to
someone.

424
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,077
I can't tell you.

425
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,955
Okay, you made a promise,

426
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,374
and you can't tell me anything?

427
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,836
To who?

428
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,256
María!

429
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,035
María,who did you make
a promise to?

430
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,179
Walter.

431
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,807
Walter.

432
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,309
I'll tell you what.

433
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,668
- Give me a clue.

434
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,312
- No.

435
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,212
- Well?

436
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,130
Just one little hint!
And I'll take a guess.

437
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,632
Just one clue!
Only one word!

438
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,276
Okay?

439
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,803
Starting now,
one, two, three.

440
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,267
Alright...
It involves
infidelity.

441
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,769
But I can't tell you
anything else.

442
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,913
But that explains itself!

443
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,623
That's absolutely obvious.

444
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,484
What's absolutely
obvious?

445
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,670
Walter's infidelity.

446
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,089
He had one going on.

447
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,700
Second cell phone.
We've known that
for a while now.

448
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,635
So no worries, it's okay.

449
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,595
You didn't break your promise.

450
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,291
I've wondered about that
for a long time.

451
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,059
You're moving,

452
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:59,587
and I was way ahead of you
on this one.

453
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,422
Right, because
of your cop training,

454
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,134
you know everything,
right?

455
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,693
Yes.

456
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,570
And...

457
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,613
instinct.

458
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,977
Well, you should check
your instincts

459
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,895
because it
wasn't Walter.

460
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,252
Nooo.

461
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,796
María...

462
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,549
You don't say! Really?

463
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,804
Cielo?

464
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,765
Nooo!

465
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,142
Well, will you look at her.

466
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,961
- Henry.
- No, but--

467
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,594
- How did you find out?
- You don't know about this!

468
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,305
- Fine.
- It's a secret!

469
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,722
You didn't hear a
word!

470
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,684
What did I hear?
Nothing.

471
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,203
Nothing over here.

472
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,621
So with who?

473
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,664
Henry!

474
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,736
- Hey.
- Hey!

475
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,672
Hey, Cielo!

476
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,284
[María
laughing]
What's up,
sister?

477
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,662
Where's the
birthday boy?

478
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,639
Walter!

479
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,602
Walter!

480
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,481
How's everything? Okay?

481
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,065
Great!

482
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,968
Hey, you never made
chicken like this here.

483
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,387
Henry.
- No, really.

484
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,014
You have no idea
how powerful that car is.

485
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,058
My dad's a master.
- He is.

486
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,809
When the highway's
empty,

487
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,145
you get out of town
with a blink of an
eye

488
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,730
- and bruuuummm!
- Really?

489
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,983
And with a blink of an eye
you get you license
taken away.

490
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,484
Uncle, but you'll
help me.

491
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,945
- Aren't you the boss?
- Sure I'll help you!

492
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,031
For my spoiled brat
car wash millionaire nephew?

493
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,908
Sure I'll help you.
Help you with what?

494
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,384
I'll make sure you get a cell

495
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,885
with a huge view.

496
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,346
They call it Buba.

497
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,721
Uncle.

498
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,000
Well, I'm out
of here.

499
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,127
- Congratulations, dad.
- Thanks.

500
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,921
Congratulations
for the promotion,
uncle.

501
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,839
- Thanks, buddy.
- Have a nice evening.

502
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,858
Drive safely, okay?

503
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,360
I will.

504
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,677
Slow down. No,
I mean it.

505
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,154
Slow down with the crutches.

506
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,655
Hey, hey,

507
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,307
Don't say that to
your uncle.

508
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,684
No, he's gotten
out of control.

509
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,061
Want some
more?

510
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,812
No. But really,
some cars!

511
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,481
- Did you see them?
- Both of them!

512
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,400
- Really?
- Truly fantastic cars!

513
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,460
Honey, take note!

514
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,086
For my next birthday

515
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,447
I want a private jet
and a Jacuzzi!

516
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,240
No, no,
no riding that!

517
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,300
To get those legs on fire!

518
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,329
Well, maybe I over did
it
a little with the cars.

519
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,889
The thing is,

520
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,208
with these new lease
rates,

521
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,419
they're too hard to
refuse.

522
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,812
You should think about it.

523
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,272
Right?

524
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,632
[laughing
]

525
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,234
Delicious dinner.

526
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,429
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes.

527
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,947
That's mom's recipe.

528
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,851
You sure make it
awesome.

529
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,981
Or do you have a secret
for this?

530
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,443
- No?
- No.

531
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,336
No.

532
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,717
Well, Walter,

533
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,428
congratulations, buddy!

534
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,204
- 51 years old!
- Cheers!

535
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,889
Thanks.

536
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,167
That's a whole lot more
than half a century.

537
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,252
- What are you--
- Much more than that!

538
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,978
That's old!

539
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,131
It's been almost a
year
since I got diagnosed
with cancer.

540
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:31,632
- My God!
- That's intense.

541
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:32,967
- Come on, that long?
- Incredible.

542
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:34,884
I can't believe it.

543
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,304
Tomorrow it'll be a
year.

544
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,390
It was a day
after turning
50.

545
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,017
I was told I had cancer.
It was awful.

546
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,868
What a year--!

547
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,854
- No.
- A horrible year!

548
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,898
But it wasn't just cancer,
it was also surgery,

549
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,359
you being
attacked.

550
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,902
- Imagine that!
- Truly awful days!

551
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,197
- Wow.
- No, man.

552
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,699
But there were also
fun moments.

553
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,201
Remember about
the pillow?

554
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,702
That.
- What was it called?

555
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,829
- The pillow session.
- The Talking Pillow!

556
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,747
No! That was
useful!

557
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,060
I didn't want treatment.

558
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,146
I was...

559
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,964
so afraid and so
angry

560
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,633
about what I was
going through.

561
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,178
And all I wanted
was to just give up,

562
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,390
call it quits
and forget about the whole
thing.

563
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,141
But you were
always there,

564
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,060
there was
always
someone.

565
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,980
Every time
I was about to lose it

566
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,732
someone or
something
helped me,

567
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,235
gave me strength,
pushed me through.

568
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,003
That's why were here, man.

569
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,363
- Yes.
- Thanks.

570
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,615
- No, man.
- And Cielo.

571
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,925
What a warrior.

572
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,512
Cielo, honey!

573
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,122
Remember that first night
of chemotherapy?

574
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,643
That night was...

575
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,170
maybe one of the
worst ever.

576
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,547
I woke up
on the bathroom floor,

577
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,064
just lying there.

578
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,943
It was so hard at first.

579
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,803
- No, I can imagine.
- But Cielo was always there!

580
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,557
She was always there
looking after me,

581
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,618
giving me support and strength.

582
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,244
And I remember this one night.

583
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,498
I had my head on her legs.

584
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,709
And I felt that night I'd--

585
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,569
Cielo, Cielo,
what are you doing?

586
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,028
That water must be
ice cold

587
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,921
- Cielo!

588
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,282
Cielo, what's
the matter?

589
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,658
- Cielo!
- No.

590
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,497
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Cielo! No!</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">- What's she doing?</font></i>

591
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,081
Cielo, get
out of there!

592
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,127
- Baby.
- What's going on?

593
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,796
- Come, come.
- Help me, I'll hold her.

594
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,173
- Get her out!
- I got her.

595
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,150
I got her.

596
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,969
- Let's go inside.
- What's going on?

597
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:42,448
- Good evening.
- Who are you?

598
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,950
What do you mean who am I?
The guy from around the corner.

599
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,410
Who sent
you?

600
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,970
What do you mean who sent me?

601
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,455
- Who do you think?
- Hey!

602
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,749
I'm asking you a question,
don't answer with another one.

603
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,267
Mario, Mario sent me.

604
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,793
So what's this Mario's
last name?

605
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,813
Listen, lady.

606
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,815
It's late, I haven't slept,

607
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,341
and I still have to
take
that truck.

608
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,719
Can we just make a
move on this?

609
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,827
Arboleda.

610
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,727
Mario's last name is

611
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,203
Happy now?

612
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:16,065
I'm not going to apologize
for being careful.

613
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,900
The way things are,
I'd better be informed.

614
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,903
You could be
one of those undercover people
they send into high schools.

615
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,463
Besides, I'd rather be careful

616
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,908
than get ganged
by prison guards.

617
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,177
Which one is it?

618
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,053
Three, three, two, five, six.

619
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,330
That's the one
I erased from the inventory.

620
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,557
Can you reach it?

621
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,518
With a forklift, yes.

622
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,660
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

623
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:56,522
- What's up?
- Come.

624
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,360
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

625
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,080
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

626
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,125
No, no, no,
never.

627
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,502
- Weird, isn't it?
- It is.

628
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,926
I don't know,
maybe it has to do with...

629
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,223
Lately, Cielo and I
have been having...

630
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,435
You know, certain
issues.

631
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,203
Right, I heard.

632
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,663
You did?

633
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,082
No, María told me...

634
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,568
What you're thinking,
that she...

635
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,462
More or less what you just said.

636
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:48,257
That you have some issues.

637
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,035
It may be good
to talk to someone.

638
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,747
Like a
therapist?

639
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,791
Right, right,
I...

640
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,627
Yes, I suppose
it would be good
to get professional help.

641
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,353
María has this therapist.

642
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,272
She seems really happy with him.

643
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,857
She's satisfied.

644
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,734
Well, not that María

645
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,554
is an advertisement
for advanced mental health.

646
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,599
I just had no idea
Cielo was taking it this hard.

647
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,034
No, I don't get it.

648
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,745
Some birthday present?

649
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,647
Tell me
about it.

650
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,399
She fell asleep,
she had calmed down.

651
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:23,776
She was?
Thanks.

652
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,335
You're soaking.

653
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,421
Yes, I have to change.

654
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,465
What happened was too weird.

655
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,741
- What was that?
- I don't know.

656
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,051
I have no idea.

657
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,596
Well, but we agree

658
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,331
in that
it might have been an attempt--

659
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,249
Wait, wait,
María, María.

660
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,502
Nobody tries to kill themselves
in a fountain, right?

661
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,254
We were talking with Walter
and said it would be good

662
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,691
that they spoke to someone.

663
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,151
Yes, you should!

664
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,261
You can have
my therapist's number.

665
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:54,264
- He's so good.
- Sure, thank you.

666
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,894
Maybe it's natural
for something like this
to happen.

667
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,978
There's always issues
within couples.

668
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,190
Long marriages...
It's normal.

669
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,485
But there's always a way
to solve things.

670
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,612
If you're thinking of
therapy,
that's a wonderful
idea.

671
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,213
I mean it.

672
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,299
I don't know if Henry

673
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,551
could guess these problems

674
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,286
- could happen.
- María, María.

675
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,180
He knows that I know.

676
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,892
Walter, I swear,

677
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,169
I swear I didn't tell him!
He guessed.

678
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,605
I don't know how, but he did.

679
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,608
Anyway, the point is,

680
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,844
I think it's a great
idea...

681
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,404
that we could take

682
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,823
the kids for a while

683
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,741
so you can be alone

684
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,853
and you know,
have some alone time
together.

685
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,289
No, wait, you're saying...?

686
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,483
Junior and Valentina
out of the house?

687
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,069
But we're talking
about two, three days,

688
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,529
or the time you
need.

689
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,155
We can take good
care of them.

690
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,009
I know, I know, that's clear.

691
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,119
I just don't see
how that's a solution

692
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,429
for Cielo and I.

693
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,806
Besides, María,

694
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,183
these kids are--

695
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,002
They're a burden,
they're hard to--

696
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,812
No.

697
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,939
No, I mean, take Junior.

698
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,592
He's independent,
does stuff on his own.

699
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,610
And Valentina...

700
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,387
I see Valentina
nearly every day.

701
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,280
I know how to take care of her.

702
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,850
In fact, I think
it's a great plan for
us.

703
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,685
Don't you think
it's a good idea, Henry?

704
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,161
Yes, sure, sure.

705
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,955
María.

706
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,790
Was this your idea?

707
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,253
No.

708
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,113
- No, it was Cielo's.
- I see.

709
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,701
But she basically
begged me, Walter.

710
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,803
Is that so?

711
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,494
I gave Henry and María

712
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,480
a case with Valentina's
clothes.

713
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,649
They'll get milk on the
way

714
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,985
and whatever else they
need.

715
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,863
I spoke to
Junior.

716
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:17,658
And after discussing a
lot,

717
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,760
he agreed to stay.

718
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:27,043
And so, voilá,
magically,

719
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,337
the kids are out
of this bad environment.

720
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,859
What a coincidence.

721
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,281
Cielo, look at me!

722
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,477
What was that about?
Can you explain it?

723
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,855
What was all that
situation?

724
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:53,861
I don't want
the children here
anymore.

725
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,863
- It's not safe.
- Cielo.

726
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:00,117
How many times
have we talked
about this?

727
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,011
They've never, ever,

728
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:04,705
ever been as safe
as now!

729
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,518
Never been safer than now?

730
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,965
A couple weeks ago,
we almost got murdered.

731
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,509
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming and laughing.

732
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,553
I told
you!

733
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,931
I dealt with him.
It's over.

734
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,116
No, it's not.

735
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,726
- You're still in the business.
- Yes.

736
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,937
But now I'm running
things!

737
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,457
Now that you're in charge,

738
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,959
everything will be fine

739
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,903
and it's going to be
smooth sailing from here on?

740
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,114
I don't see why
not.

741
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,991
I keep the work at work
and the rest elsewhere.

742
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,094
Nothing will ever impact you

743
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,971
or the kids.

744
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,707
- Nothing!
- You don't know that.

745
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,667
You can't make that promise,
Walter.

746
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:53,420
Yes, I can
promise that.

747
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,214
Gustavo Cortés
is dead.

748
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,802
And he was the
threat.
He was the danger.

749
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,946
I thought you were the danger.

750
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,948
Didn't you say that?

751
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,794
So that was it.

752
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,259
So all that show downstairs

753
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,262
was about that,

754
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,872
to, trying to protect
my children from me?

755
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:33,127
- To protect them from me!
- And from me!

756
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,231
There's blood on my hands too!

757
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,690
Blood? What blood?

758
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,635
- Ernesto's?
- Yes, yes!

759
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,762
Ernesto is at the clinic
because of me!

760
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,388
- No!
- Yes!

761
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,824
Because of what I did!

762
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,477
No, Cielo,
no, no.

763
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,063
You can't beat yourself
up
over this thing!

764
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,564
You
can't...

765
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,567
Cielo, you didn't set
out
to hurt anybody!

766
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,945
You made a mistake,
that happens!

767
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,465
Cielo, what you did,

768
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,160
you had to do
to protect
your family.

769
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,370
That doesn't make you
a bad person,
it makes you a human
being.

770
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,206
No, no, no!
Stop, stop it!

771
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,208
I don't need to hear
any of your bullshit rationales!

772
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,434
Stop it!

773
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,645
Alright, I'm in this business.

774
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,022
I'm compromised.

775
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,550
I will not have my children
living in a house

776
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,054
where dealing drugs
and money laundering

777
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,014
and killing people
is commonplace!

778
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,950
No!

779
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,535
And all that is shrugged off

780
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:33,996
as "it happens"?

781
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,856
- Cielo, Cielo.
- No, no, no!

782
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:40,085
You know what?

783
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,129
We're back at cooking meth?

784
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,381
Fine.

785
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,301
But the kids stay away.

786
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,660
- And that's that!
- That's that?

787
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,262
That's what?

788
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,848
They're no longer here.

789
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,457
They're gone,
that's the important thing.

790
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,253
So you think
that's the solution?

791
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,005
A sleepover
at their aunt and
uncle's?

792
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,340
Junior's
happy!

793
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,676
Nobody tells him
he has to go to bed
early!

794
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,320
And then what?

795
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,764
- Then we'll see!
- No!

796
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,934
No, I'll tell you
what will happen!

797
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,953
My kids come home.

798
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,606
To their parents
who love them.

799
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,983
They come back home,
where they belong!

800
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:23,112
No, I will not let
our business endanger them!

801
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,030
Cielo, how many times
do I have to say--?

802
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,840
I said no!

803
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,034
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here!

804
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,543
What are you going to do
to stop it?

805
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,088
- Whatever it takes.
- No.

806
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,465
Like what?
I mean, specifically.

807
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,403
What is your next move?

808
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,100
My next move
is maybe I hurt myself.

809
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,894
Make it clear
to Henry and María
that we need more time,

810
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,313
that we're still
struggling.

811
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,982
No, more like
you're still struggling!

812
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,442
And that could be
the perfect excuse

813
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,444
for me to send you
to a medical institution

814
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,280
if something like that
ever happens.

815
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,158
And I take care
of the kids myself

816
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,576
because
you're mentally disabled.

817
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,636
Is that what you want?

818
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:17,082
Well, I can change
my mind.

819
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:20,043
I show up with a
black eye

820
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,503
say that you
beat me

821
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,172
when you found out
about Ernesto!

822
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,190
Just great!

823
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,259
So you want
to involve the lover now?

824
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,194
Ernesto and the police!

825
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,571
That's just fun!

826
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,698
But not as much fun as telling

827
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,242
your 16-year-old son

828
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,144
that his father
is a wife-beater!

829
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,980
No!
You know what?

830
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,149
I don't like your idea.
What else have you got?

831
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,442
I could send him
away to school.

832
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,002
Really?

833
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,421
With what explanation?

834
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,339
How would you tell him?

835
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,908
"I know you've only got
one year left in high school,

836
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,536
but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

837
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,121
leave all your friends
and your father behind,

838
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,847
who was about to die,

839
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,475
and your baby sister

840
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,793
so I can send you
to rot in Canada!

841
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,561
Fantastic!

842
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,063
No, Cielo!

843
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,023
That's not a good plan either!

844
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,858
Give me more!

845
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,803
Because I'm not hearing
a solution to your problem.

846
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,571
Nothing!

847
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,350
How are you going
to save our kids
from this terrible environment?

848
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,951
How?

849
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,353
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

850
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,438
Will you take them away
to another country?

851
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,123
What country? Argentina?

852
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,501
Japan?

853
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,320
Or maybe you can change
the locks again.

854
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,301
Can't you be serious?

855
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,845
You want to take me on?

856
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,164
You want to take away
my children?

857
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,682
What's the plan?

858
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,918
I don't know! I
don't know!

859
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,753
This is the best
I could come up with.

860
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,343
I will count every minute
that the kids are away
from here

861
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:54,612
as a victory.

862
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,266
But you're right.
It's a bad plan.

863
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,683
It's a terrible
plan!

864
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,079
So what do I do?

865
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,899
I don't have any of
your magic!

866
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,778
I'm a coward,
a fucking coward.

867
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:12,797
I can't even...

868
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,258
I can't call the police.

869
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:17,635
I can't stop...

870
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,931
laundering your filthy money.

871
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,252
I can't keep you
out of this house.

872
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,587
I can't even keep
you
out of my bed.

873
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,367
All I can do is wait.

874
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,162
That's the only good option.

875
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,248
Hold on...

876
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:48,500
and wait.

877
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,960
Wait for what?

878
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,698
For the cancer to come
back.

879
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,473
Hello?

880
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,602
Yes, alright.

881
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,103
Yes...

882
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,897
Calm down. Hey, calm down.

883
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,941
I'm on my way.

884
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,624
It's a tracker, isn't it?

885
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,085
Listen, if Anti-Narcotics

886
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,920
is tracking those barrels,

887
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,381
we're screwed.

888
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:21,493
Where will we get
another supplier?

889
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:24,120
You know all the methylamine
coming into this country

890
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:27,082
is controlled
or tracked in some way.

891
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,833
Why did they put
the tracker outside,

892
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,711
and not inside
where nobody would see
it?

893
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,714
Look, it's inside,
it gets wet and damaged.

894
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,441
They made these things

895
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,444
not to get wet and work.

896
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,930
What about the other
barrels?

897
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,573
I don't know.

898
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,283
That was the only one I saw

899
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,243
because Lidia showed it to me.

900
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,729
Once she spotted it,
she freaked out.

901
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,373
I put the barrel back

902
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:53,024
and we got
the hell out of there.

903
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:58,238
She found the barrel
and pointed at it?

904
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,674
Yes, she showed it to me.

905
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,951
She out the GPS
on the barrel...

906
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:06,329
so we thought
it was the cops

907
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,415
and leave her
alone.

908
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,517
You really think so?

909
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,378
We've got to get
another supplier

910
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,979
and put a halt in the meantime.

911
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,524
But that lady's dead.

912
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,442
I gave her a pass.

913
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,052
That's what I get
for being a gentleman.

914
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,779
Wait, wait, wait.

915
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:24,740
Mario, wait a minute.

916
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,476
Calm down, okay?
Just for a second.

917
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:30,895
How can you be so sure
that was her?

918
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,497
What if we're wrong?

919
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,566
We just kill her,
and that's that?

920
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,253
So?

921
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,796
Won't you say something, man?

922
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,407
Weigh in here, would you?
What do you think?

923
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:48,371
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

924
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:50,306
We're just getting started.

925
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,084
We are not ramping down
for anything.
