1
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,747
Fuck me!

2
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,582
Why's this one blue?

3
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,270
We used a different ingredient,
but it is every bit as pure.

4
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,006
It may be blue,
but it's even better quality.

5
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,720
My God, what a hit!

6
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,347
I want more of this!

7
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,726
Blue, white, pink, yellow,
however you want it.

8
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,269
Okay, how much does it weigh?

9
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,193
It's all there.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,493
Money will start raining!

11
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,328
Thanks.

12
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,290
But don't you forget
who you work for!

13
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,209
What did you say?

14
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,463
I'm just saying they got
to know who's boss, Tuco.

15
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,674
You think they don't know that?

16
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,134
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

17
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,345
That they know I rule
and that they're mine?

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,056
No, no. I'm just saying...

19
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,307
Wait, let me get this straight.

20
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,268
If they're not stupid,
are you saying that I'm stupid?

21
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,330
Because I don't make
myself clear with Colombians?

22
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,623
No, no... No,
Tuco. No, not that.

23
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,774
You're just speaking for me,
fucker?

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,943
Like I ain't got the damn
sense to speak for myself!

25
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,612
Tuco! Why don't
we all just relax?

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,951
Heisenberg says relax. I'm relaxed,
I'm relaxed.

27
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:41,954
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

28
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,719
Learn how to shut the fuck up,
motherfucker.

29
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,975
Fights. Champion.

30
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,854
Gonzo, give me that.

31
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,649
Bring him! I'll see you on Friday,
Heisenberg!

32
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:40,638
This money is
my family's future.

33
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,515
I need to make sure my
kids can go to college.

34
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,310
I want them to study abroad.

35
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,648
That should be
around 37 grand a year.

36
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,610
Times five, that's 185 grand...
For both kids, that's 370.

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,572
Remaining mortgage on the home,
that's 55 grand.

38
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,783
Cost of living

39
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,995
food, clothing, utilities,
health, that's...

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,124
I don't know,
maybe seven grand a month, so...

41
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,877
in a year,
that's 28 grand... Ten years.

42
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,463
For ten years,
that would be 280 grand.

43
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,175
37 grand for college,
so 65 grand

44
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,301
plus 55 for the mortgage...

45
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,722
that's 120... More
or less around that.

46
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,766
That sums up

47
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,393
to around two million dollars.

48
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,812
That's what I need.

49
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,481
Now we're making about...

50
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,692
Maybe two and a
half pounds a week?

51
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,528
If we double the production,
we could make...

52
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,948
I don't know... Maybe
do it in three months?

53
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,534
Three months would be perfect!

54
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,744
But... Let's just say it's six.

55
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,832
Six would be just fine.
That's it! Six months.

56
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:54,419
And listen,
call it 11 in a public place from now on.

57
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,005
Let's go!

58
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,018
Damn it, what do we do?

59
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,478
What do we do? Tell me.

60
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,605
Hold it! Hold it!

61
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,040
Heisenberg!

62
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,605
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

63
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,963
You can't take an ass-beating,
bitch?

64
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,924
Tuco, that was too much,
brother.

65
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,425
Shh.

66
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,597
No, he has no pulse.

67
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,807
- Do something, Heisenberg!
- Do something?

68
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,852
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital!

69
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,979
No, no, no! No hospital...

70
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,731
Do that to him.

71
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,202
It's not working.

72
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,913
Breathe into his mouth!

73
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,999
No, Tuco, that's no good!
They don't teach that anymore.

74
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,336
You, come here! Breathe
into his mouth and save him!

75
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,061
God damn it!

76
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,189
This asshole dies out here!

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,988
Gonzo, get rid of him..

78
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:48,450
We can't do him like that, man. Buzzards
and rats and all that. Let's bury him.

79
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,745
Tuco,
that man lying there was Christian.

80
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,956
If we don't bury him, brother.

81
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,667
Don't argue with me, Gonzo.

82
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,962
- Alright, Tuco. Fine.
- You guys help.

83
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,932
Hurry up, asshole!

84
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,605
Are you in a hurry?

85
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,404
I think we're done here, Tuco.

86
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,123
Right.

87
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:22,169
You're... done.

88
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,247
Walter?

89
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,927
Walter, is that you?

90
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,904
Honey, you scared me.

91
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,203
Hey... I'm talking to you.

92
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,039
Walter!

93
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,627
Is something wrong?

94
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,466
Are you okay?

95
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,635
Fine... I'm fine.

96
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,558
- New hat?
- Yes.

97
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,435
I got some grilled
chicken. Want some?

98
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,169
Where were you?

99
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,050
Walter...

100
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,972
Honey...

101
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,183
Wait, let me take off...

102
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,727
Let me wash my face, honey...

103
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,481
Calm down. Junior's
about to come. Hey...

104
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,691
Hey!

105
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,818
Walter!

106
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,447
Wait. Wait! No...

107
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,408
Stop it, damn it!

108
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,220
Walter.

109
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,433
I know you're scared,

110
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,060
and you're angry,
and you're frustrated.

111
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,773
And I know none of this is fair.

112
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,692
But you can't take it out on me.

113
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,617
I'm home!

114
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,804
Dead, man! We're done,
we're through!

115
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,139
I'm telling you!

116
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,909
- No! This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

117
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,268
Conjecture!

118
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,521
And conjecture
isn't helping at all.

119
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,690
We need simple facts.

120
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,815
- You want facts?
- Yes.

121
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,651
Fact number one:

122
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,046
My phone rang, like, eight times
last night. Hang ups every time.

123
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,488
So what?

124
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,031
Fact number two:

125
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,836
At three in the morning
a truck pulls over.

126
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,826
Just like Tuco's. At my house.

127
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,271
And if it wasn't the same one,
it was another just like it!

128
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,171
- You're being paranoid, José.
- Yes, right...

129
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,602
Okay, if Tuco wanted to kill us,
he would've done it at the junkyard.

130
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,253
What is that?

131
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,963
Are you basing that on that
he's got a normal, healthy brain?

132
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,676
Did you not see him
beat a dude to death?

133
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,053
For nothing!

134
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,765
Please think, remember...

135
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,016
He just kept staring at us.

136
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,143
Remember what he said,

137
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,231
"Yes, you're done."

138
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,983
You want to know
what that means?

139
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,570
That means exactly
how it sounds!

140
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,072
That we're done, screwed.

141
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,033
We were witnesses
of what happened.

142
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,077
We are bait now.
We are loose ends.

143
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,247
Right now, Tuco's thinking,

144
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,833
"Yeah, hey, they cook good meth,

145
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,876
but can I trust them?"

146
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,963
What happens when he decides no?

147
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,382
- No, I don't know!
- It's him or us!

148
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,050
It's him or us, dude!

149
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,637
Alright,
then! How would you do it?

150
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,555
- What do you mean?
- Step by step!

151
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,516
Specifically,
how would you do it?

152
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,811
I don't know. Say we
set up one last sale.

153
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,604
Every time we
bring in a new batch,

154
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,790
he always tests the product,
right?

155
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,148
- Aha...

156
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,375
So, as his head - is down,
you know...

157
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,358
Bam, bam, bam!

158
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,359
Bam, bam, bam.

159
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,986
- Right...
- Three shots?

160
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,922
- Three shots, or, I don't know, two.
- No, no!

161
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,074
- Three or two?
- Alright, then, two shots.

162
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,869
Two. Where? In the head,
on the chest, on the back?

163
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,354
I don't know. I'm
not that experi--

164
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,124
I'm just trying to understand
exactly how this works.

165
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,836
What about Gonzo?

166
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,104
Gonzo will react there and then.

167
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,338
- So what about him?
- Well...

168
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,006
I can turn and shoot him too.

169
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,258
How many shots for
him? He's a big guy.

170
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,511
- Three!
- Three shots. Perfect!

171
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,014
So we got Tuco and Gonzo down.

172
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,183
Now, is there anyone else there?

173
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,268
I mean,
Tuco is usually with someone else, right?

174
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,854
What'll you do then?

175
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,691
No, don't tell me yet!

176
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,818
How many shots have been fired?

177
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,155
- Five, I think...
- Five, no! Five exactly.

178
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,032
How many bullets
does that gun take?

179
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,036
I don't know,
this thing's jammed.

180
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,041
How can you suggest that we kill a man,
when you can't even handle a gun?

181
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,085
It's not that easy, is it?

182
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,548
Well, no, Walter,
but you did it.

183
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:16,768
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already.

184
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,645
I just wanted to tell you

185
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,398
the big lug and I are going
to try a new restaurant.

186
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,567
It's supposed to be amazing.

187
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,527
So let me know if
you guys want to hang.

188
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,737
See there? I said "hang".

189
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,989
Junior would be
proud. I know the lingo.

190
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,409
Okay......

191
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,785
It's Chinese, the restaurant.

192
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,579
I don't know. I just
feel like Chinese.

193
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,831
So it would be great
for you to come with us.

194
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,250
I had this really crazy idea.

195
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,253
Do you think that people in
China ever just feel like Colombian?

196
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,047
You know,
order ajiaco and eat it with chopsticks?

197
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,341
Okay, so call me and tell
me whether you're coming.

198
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,301
Big kiss, Cielo. Call me, chao.

199
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,138
She didn't answer?

200
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,182
How could she pick up?
Obviously she's not home.

201
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,233
- Honey, listen...
- Yes.

202
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,069
What was that about
Chinese? Dinner tonight.

203
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,071
That new place.
I want to try it.

204
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,382
Really? What time are we going?

205
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,824
I don't know, maybe eight.

206
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,869
- Don't you have therapy?
- No, not today.

207
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,621
Honey, you've got therapy--

208
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,457
No, it's on Thursday. Remember,
Thursday.

209
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,351
That was last week,
and then they changed the day.

210
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,877
Remember they called us

211
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,880
Yes, honey, you've got therapy.

212
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,091
Cheer up,
baby you've only got six more sessions.

213
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,219
And I'm doing them, I am.

214
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,513
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

215
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,223
That's not helping.

216
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,897
Wait, wait, wait, no...

217
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,191
Honey, this therapy with David,
the therapist,

218
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:51,613
that's really helping you.
You look much better.

219
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,991
And I think it's
important for you to go.

220
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,909
Okay. Bye.

221
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,961
Shit!

222
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,053
Sorry about that,
kid. It's just that...

223
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,055
my wife's a bit...

224
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,397
Here, take this.

225
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,026
- Come on?
- Chop-chop.

226
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,575
Look, this is a technical issue.

227
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,245
Look,
takes out the ten? And leaves a midfield?

228
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,873
- Gómez!
- The ball gets lost there.

229
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:46,209
- And then those here... What's up?
- Gómez.

230
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,879
Gómez! I'll see
you in my office.

231
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,756
Good morning.

232
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,842
- That coach is a bomb. A bomb!
- Gómez!

233
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,220
Coming, man, coming.

234
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:01,099
- Where is this?
- Farmagalería Industrial.

235
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,101
- Just off the highway?
- Right.

236
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,478
Have you noticed
when you go by there

237
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,939
the whole place
smells like feet?

238
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,776
- Careful with that...
- What's this?

239
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,320
It's called thermite.

240
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,114
Excuse me?

241
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,950
So I get up early and
do some research,

242
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:24,288
so I did this. Burns at
about 5,000 degrees.

243
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,374
The kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

244
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,961
Remember the one with the bridge? There,
bam.

245
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:34,298
No,
I didn't see it because I do night shifts.

246
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,637
Nice! Guys who know their trade.

247
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,639
I take that back.

248
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,685
They're rather some
idiots! Hello. Hey!

249
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,520
That's a barrel!

250
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,481
Barrel's roll!

251
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,443
Some jerks these two!

252
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:57,030
So what did they get in that?

253
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,032
Methylamine.

254
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,827
- 30 gallons.
- Methylamine?

255
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,122
P2P?

256
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,873
I researched that
stuff when meth

257
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,084
was just starting in Colombia.

258
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,297
They're cooking
old-school biker meth.

259
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:19,260
I mean, chemistry book,
test tube... That's weird.

260
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,806
Who could be cooking in Colombia,
with that method?

261
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,849
Nobody.

262
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,810
I've been researching
with Mexican colleagues,

263
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,020
and all the
old-timers are dead--

264
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,356
Well, that's even weirder,
even weirder still!

265
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,820
Pseudo's in short supply,
so these two make do

266
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,905
by changing up the formula.

267
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,533
That way they stand out in
the market. If that's the case,

268
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,577
and there's this...
What's it called?

269
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,206
- Methylamine. Aha.
- No, no, no, the thermite,

270
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,708
it means these guys,

271
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,378
I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

272
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,547
- To steal?
- To steal. What do you mean?

273
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,217
They'd get beaten in the
Paralympics. You know why?

274
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,760
For being disabled.

275
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,473
They might know
about the periodic table,

276
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,184
manganese, magnesium,

277
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,020
boron, all that stuff,
but they've got no street skills.

278
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,449
Your daughter's saying hi.

279
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,705
Good morning, honey.

280
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,999
- Were you here all night?
- No.

281
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,335
Not all night.

282
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,588
I just got a stomachache,

283
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,091
and since I knew I'd be
up and in bed all the time,

284
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:08,221
I came down for a while
so I didn't wake you up.

285
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,153
How would he know where I
live? Did you give out my address?

286
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,989
- And my name? To Gonzo?
- No!

287
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,367
- What about the dead guy?
- No!

288
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,370
Tuco must've put out,
you know, feelers.

289
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,455
He's got his ways and means,
and he's closing in.

290
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,999
He asks, finds out.

291
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,960
That dude's a bee,
he does whatever he wants.

292
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,879
And what happens when he finds
out that my brother-in-law is a cop

293
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,090
and that he also
works in Anti-narcotics?

294
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,883
That's all there is to it!

295
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,719
No, man, no way!

296
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,307
Look, it's got six bullets.

297
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,600
I finally figured
how to open it.

298
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,895
Say we get a second gun for you. Double
our chances. I mean, mathematically.

299
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,315
Just as you like it,
with precise science.

300
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:04,443
- We get one for you. How about it?
- No, no, I don't want guns.

301
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,988
I've got a better idea.

302
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,407
Thank God! Let's hear it.

303
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,242
Beans.

304
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:15,079
No... Beans? That's
your plan? Beans?

305
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,248
Castor beans.

306
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,268
So what are we going to
do with them? We plant them

307
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,085
and hope for a magic
beanstalk to grow

308
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,087
to climb it and escape?

309
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,381
Nice plan, man!

310
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,841
We are going to
process them into ricin.

311
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,509
Rice and beans? Ricin.

312
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,304
It's an extremely
effective poison.

313
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,557
It's highly toxic
in small doses.

314
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,642
Also fairly easy to
overlook during an autopsy.

315
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,521
- Really?
- Absolutely.

316
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,565
- This?
- Don't touch them!

317
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,876
But why? Is it that poisonous?

318
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,485
Too poisonous, man!

319
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,297
Ricin was used to assassinate
a Bulgarian journalist

320
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,865
back in the late '70's.

321
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,827
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella

322
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,663
to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

323
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,249
He died instantly.

324
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,251
And we're talking
about an amount

325
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,337
not much bigger
than the head of a pin.

326
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,190
- But it killed him.
- Now we just need to figure out

327
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,050
a delivery device to
get it into Tuco's body.

328
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,053
Then no more Tuco
or any of our problems.

329
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,318
Ricin it is.

330
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,913
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,543
Sorry I had to knock.
You didn't hear the bell?

332
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,127
Come in.

333
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,753
Thanks.

334
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:16,844
I should've called
first. I'm sorry.

335
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,846
What can I do for you?

336
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,600
Maybe we ought to...

337
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,478
Are we going to
talk about María?

338
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,063
She sent you, didn't she?

339
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:30,191
No, no, no, no... No,
hell, no. She...

340
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,860
She's barely even talking to me.

341
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,862
That's why I'm here.

342
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,240
Self-preservation.

343
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:41,160
This is instinctive for me,
you know?

344
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,581
No... No, you don't understand.

345
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,083
Look,
I know you girls have your ups and downs,

346
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,211
and that's okay
because you're sisters.

347
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,213
And believe me,
the last thing I want

348
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,632
is to get between you
two when there's an issue.

349
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:59,053
But you have no idea how much I'd
appreciate it if you answered her calls.

350
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,013
No. I'm not ready for that yet,
Henry.

351
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,682
What happened to communication,
Cielo?

352
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,102
All that about
the Talking Pillow,

353
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,521
everybody saying what they felt,
you know?

354
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,231
Look, don't do it for her.

355
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,941
Do it for me, okay?

356
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,360
You can yell at her.
Just call her back.

357
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:18,072
Tell her anything you want,

358
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,324
but just answer the damn phone.

359
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,910
That woman is going
to drive me crazy.

360
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,663
María is a shoplifter.

361
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,625
That's right.
Remember the diadem?

362
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,793
That tiara she gave
me at the shower?

363
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,920
She stole it from
a jewelry shop,

364
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,981
and I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

365
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,757
Firstly, she won't admit it.

366
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,926
And then, she won't apologize.

367
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,305
If she'd thought you
were going to return it,

368
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,349
maybe she would have never...

369
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,768
You knew about this?

370
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,689
She's got this therapist.
We're doing all we can

371
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,401
so she can move on with
this. His name's David.

372
00:28:55,526 --> 00:29:00,114
- The therapist. I think you know him.
- I do.

373
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,493
He says it's an ongoing process.

374
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:07,079
And we have got
to be understanding.

375
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:11,292
Each and every one of us, you,
me, we have to support her.

376
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,918
- As a family, you know?
- Really?

377
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,837
Right, so that she...

378
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,798
I'm the one who
needs support her.

379
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,926
The almost 40-year-old pregnant woman,
with the surprise baby,

380
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,804
in case you forgot. And the
husband with the lung cancer

381
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,449
who disappears for hours on end,
and I don't know where he goes.

382
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,619
And he barely even speaks to me
anymore when he does show up.

383
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,311
With the moody teenager son

384
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,854
who does the same thing.

385
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,731
And the overdrawn
checking account

386
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,056
that makes me want to cry.
And the lukewarm water heater

387
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,902
that is rotting out the wall,
and we can't even afford to fix it.

388
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,364
But, I see! Now I'm supposed to go,
"Henry, please.

389
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,115
What can I possibly
do to further benefit

390
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,701
my spoiled,
kleptomaniac bitch sister

391
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,286
who always manages to
be the center of attention?".

392
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,789
God knows she's the one with
the really important problems.

393
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,458
Not me!

394
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,556
No, Cielo, come here.

395
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,319
I can help you fix
the heater if you want.

396
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:28,077
It's okay...

397
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,831
Could that be enough?

398
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,874
Yes, that's enough.

399
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:22,298
Now what?

400
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,259
Now, we arrange our next meet.

401
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,345
In a quiet public
place this time.

402
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,972
Business as usual.

403
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:34,477
We take the same
amount as we always do,

404
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,854
and give him this.
"The new meth formula

405
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,356
we've been working on.
Would you care to try it?"

406
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,570
So what does this new
formula have that's special?

407
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,575
If Tuco asks us,
we have to know what to say.

408
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,703
I don't know, anything. That...

409
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:56,874
It gets the user insanely
high. I don't know.

410
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,794
That degenerate snorts
anything he gets his hands on.

411
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,047
Okay,
we'll just put a pin in that, then.

412
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:09,011
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72, he'll be dead.

413
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,766
It'll look like natural causes.
That's the good thing about it.

414
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,354
What...

415
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,732
Like a heart attack,
something like that?

416
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:25,152
like a heart attack?

417
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,029
Nobody will notice.

418
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,534
Not if Tuco kills us first,
that is.

419
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,848
Hey, Henry. What's up, buddy?

420
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,853
<i>Hey, man. You been home yet?</i>

421
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,521
No, why? Something happened?

422
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,023
<i>No, because...</i>

423
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,360
I really screwed up. I...

424
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,697
I apologize in
advance for the earful

425
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,825
you're going to hear from Cielo.

426
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,993
It's just that...

427
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,372
<i>I'm just trying to get her
and María talking again.</i>

428
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,668
<i>You know? Big mistake.</i>

429
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,628
I should have
just kept out of it.

430
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,088
You know me.

431
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,840
<i>Well, that happens,
Henry, Don't worry.</i>

432
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,675
These things happen.

433
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,802
<i>Listen...</i>

434
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:35,556
Well, thanks,
man. And I'm really sorry.

435
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,434
Who told us to
mess with these girls?

436
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,521
Right, Henry. Look, right now

437
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,232
I'm in a bit of a situation.
Can we talk later?

438
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,734
<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

439
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:50,821
I'm also working here, yes.

440
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,282
What's more, listen,

441
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,619
want me to show you
something really freaky?

442
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,956
Yes, I would, but again,
I'm kind of busy.

443
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,248
No, no, no.

444
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,459
Hold on a second. I'm right here

445
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:06,128
with Gómez, we're in the middle

446
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:10,299
<i>of a crime scene.
You have to see this?</i>

447
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,301
Wait, I'll send you a picture.

448
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,804
Okay...

449
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:24,187
So how do I send
it? With...? There...

450
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,648
There...

451
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,611
Hey, I just sent it to you...

452
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,494
<i>Hello...</i>

453
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,454
Walter... Hello?

454
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,166
<i>Hello?</i>

455
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,643
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm taking it.

456
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,269
No, no! That mine!

457
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,105
I need it,
Jose! You have to get out of here.

458
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,358
Pack your bags now, get lost!

459
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,987
If Tuco killed Gonzo,
we're next on the list.

460
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,572
- I have to stick up for my family!
- No, wait...

461
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,212
Come on!

462
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,305
Hey, may I?

463
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,510
- Do you have the pictures, Fierro?
- Yes, sir, I do.

464
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,730
Let's see...

465
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:57,155
Just a minute,
I recognize these two.

466
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,243
Gómez...

467
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,747
This is the Mexican's company.

468
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:08,792
Yes, sir, Mr. Tuco Salamanca.

469
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:12,755
- Guess he got tired of associating.
- I suppose so.

470
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,048
Alright...

471
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:19,887
This big one here!

472
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,973
This one's much fresher.

473
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,767
Sure, much fresher!

474
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,310
I'm wondering about one thing,
Gómez.

475
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,480
Why is there so much blood

476
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,983
when there's no bullet hole?

477
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,903
No bullets anywhere.

478
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,325
Petrochelli,

479
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,328
can we take a closer look?

480
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:49,083
Sure, guys, come around..

481
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,303
Look at that...

482
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:04,681
This is beautiful!

483
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:09,812
Now that's poetry! Look.

484
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:10,938
Come.

485
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,319
This guy wasn't murdered.

486
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:20,697
You know how this was,
Petrochelli?

487
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,992
The big one was
moving this guy's body,

488
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,953
who was dead,
who knows if it was from over there

489
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:29,081
or going that way.

490
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,792
When he's this close,

491
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,171
the stack must have
shifted and boom! Look.

492
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,589
Crushed his arm.

493
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,091
Look at his arm here.

494
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,552
Ding! He gets caught,

495
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:50,393
cuts his trapped arm, bleeds to
death and ends up on the other one.

496
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,231
- Holy justice. Like it should be.
- That must have been...

497
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,650
Here, now, Fierro,
take me a picture with...

498
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,819
- Stop it now! Come on...

499
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,737
I'll light up here

500
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,743
Now with the arm here.

501
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,872
I'll send these to Walter.
This shit is broken.

502
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,421
They're too good!

503
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:21,175
What do you think,
Gómez? Just look at that.

504
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,260
It's like a poster to
hang in the bathroom.

505
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,139
Cielo?

506
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,731
Cielo!

507
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,798
Junior?

508
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,764
Cielo!

509
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,203
Hi.

510
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,291
Where's Junior?

511
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,839
With Lucho, or so he said.

512
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,636
The house was alone, so...

513
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,725
Where were you? If I may ask...

514
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:39,980
Walter...

515
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:43,733
Walter!

516
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,118
Walter, would you talk to me,
please?

517
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,976
Walter Blanco,
I'm talking to you!

518
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,561
Coming!

519
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,210
Talk to me.

520
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,547
I mean it, Walter, talk to me.

521
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,770
I don't know where to begin.

522
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,543
What the hell are
