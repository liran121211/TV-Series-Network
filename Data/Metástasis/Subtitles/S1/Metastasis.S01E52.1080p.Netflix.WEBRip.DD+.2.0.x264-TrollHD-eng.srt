1
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:39,553
You guys didn't tell me
that acid smells like cat piss.

2
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,752
That's life, right?

3
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,923
I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

4
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,341
Obviously,
some of you

5
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,677
don't agree
with what I did.

6
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,471
But I didn't see
any other choice.

7
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,349
It's not like
I wanted to.

8
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,185
The kid was
on a dirt bike.

9
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,744
He could've just been gone

10
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,856
before we even
had a chance to blink.

11
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,232
I saw a threat,
I dealt with it.

12
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,833
A threat?

13
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,627
A threat, asshole?!

14
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,987
The kid
was waving at us.

15
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,048
He wasn't going anywhere!

16
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,011
You don't know that.

17
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,513
Not even you.

18
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,750
I didn't want
to take that chance.

19
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,878
It was you who said
that no one

20
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,213
had to know
what we were doing.

21
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,022
Yes or no?

22
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,608
That, if anyone saw us

23
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,469
the whole mission
failed.

24
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,933
How could we have let
the kid go?

25
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:11,036
It was him or us.

26
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:16,167
And I chose us.

27
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:19,170
Wait outside.

28
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,080
I just want you
to know something.

29
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,725
You're the kind of people

30
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,921
I've always dreamed
of working with.

31
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,506
You told me
to show my guts.
That's what I did.

32
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,650
Thanks, Peto.

33
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,736
And I've got connections.

34
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,056
My uncle's got
his hookups in prison.

35
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,682
They could be of help
to us if--

36
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,785
Take off, bro!

37
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,583
So what?

38
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,444
That dude? Whack-job.
He's totally insane!

39
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,113
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

40
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,964
You want to stick to the facts?

41
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,741
How about the fact
that the man

42
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,301
shot an innocent kid, bro?

43
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,927
Jose, the boy had seen us.

44
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,429
Understand?

45
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,930
What if he told somebody?

46
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,459
We can't know,

47
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,473
what could've happened.

48
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,459
because that asshole
shot him, Walter!

49
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,878
I understand you're upset,
trust me.

50
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,897
And besides

51
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,799
what was that crap
about his uncle

52
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,592
with the prison connections?
Some intimidation move?

53
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,969
And we'll let him
intimidate us?

54
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,945
It's true, though.

55
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,556
Peto does have
some connections.

56
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,742
Is this a problem?

57
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,520
They're not a threat.
I checked them out.

58
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,164
It seems to me

59
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,983
that we have
three options here.

60
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,792
One, we fire Todd.

61
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,737
- Yeah, right away.
- It's not so easy.

62
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,297
He knows way too much.

63
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,258
Knows the whole operation.

64
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:50,161
We'd have to pay him
to keep quiet.

65
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,497
We've got enough of that
going on.

66
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,141
Option two

67
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,169
- we dispose of him.
- No, no, no.

68
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,811
So what, Walter?

69
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,588
We'll keep on
adding dead bodies to this?

70
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,133
Okay.
That leaves us option three.

71
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,026
We keep him on payroll.

72
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,427
Put him back
on tenting houses

73
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,596
setting up the lab
and so forth.

74
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,474
We keep him
under our control.

75
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,269
Option three
would be my choice.

76
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,122
Shall we vote?

77
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,692
- I vote three, kid.
- No shit!

78
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,377
So what?

79
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,821
A subordinate
can do our job?

80
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,073
They take liberties
and make decisions?

81
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,758
Just say it!

82
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,788
If that's the case,
I'm out of this.

83
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,309
Fucking unbelievable!

84
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,935
Peto, come in.

85
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,938
Go fuck yourself.

86
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,821
You're still in.

87
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,557
Thank you so much.
It's very important
for me.

88
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,495
The next time

89
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,147
you bring a gun to a job
without telling me

90
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,900
I will stick it
up your ass sideways.
You understand?

91
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,086
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,947
Now, go.
See you later.

93
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,255
Wake up, Contreras,
isn't that hard!

94
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,399
Hey, boss. What's up?

95
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,926
- Anything going on?
- No, same thing.

96
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,470
He's hanging out
with his granddaughter.

97
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,573
Nothing else.

98
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,031
Here, let me see.
It's a dead drop.

99
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,550
What?

100
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,511
He's writing something.

101
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,878
He's leaving a message.
Roll on it.

102
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,522
Yeah, yeah, sure.

103
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,965
- Roll on it!
- Okay, okay.

104
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,816
Write the time down.

105
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,861
Okay.

106
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,993
You have it?

107
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,370
Yeah, I do.

108
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,829
All right.

109
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,566
Listen,
boss.

110
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,876
Why don't you help me see

111
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,696
if anybody's coming
for it?

112
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,177
Wait for me here.

113
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,221
All right.

114
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,156
GO FUCK YOURSELVES

115
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,230
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I know everybody</font>

134
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,836
How have they been?

135
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,796
Fine, they're all right.

136
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,965
Valentina's so sweet.

137
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,784
She brightens
my day.

138
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,079
To see her waking up,
sleeping. I love it.

139
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,581
- She's cute.
- Yes.

140
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,166
Then, Junior,
I don't see much of him.

141
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,851
With that car of his

142
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,170
he's always going out
here and there.

143
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,980
I see.

144
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,399
What about you?

145
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,860
How are you doing?

146
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,612
I'm okay.

147
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,197
Yeah?

148
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,266
It's great you're seeing
a therapist.

149
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,184
Mine helped me
so much, Cielo.

150
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,453
How's your guy?

151
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,314
- Pedro.
- Pedro, right.

152
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,040
Walter told us.

153
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,567
Pedro;
just keep working through it.

154
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,488
When you start
and keep on going

155
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,282
then you start realizing
that's doing you good

156
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,908
that the therapy
is working for you.

157
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,035
Babe, what is
it?

158
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,679
Cielo, what...?

159
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:33,170
What's going on,

160
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,889
wrong?

161
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,517
happening?

162
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,270
Cielo?

163
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,692
The thing is...

164
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,445
I just...

165
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,265
I need to make
the right decision.

166
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,161
I need them to be safe.

167
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,955
Safe?

168
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,233
What do you mean?
Of course they are.

169
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,152
Cielo, you just
have to tell me

170
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,070
and I can bring them
back home.

171
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,449
- You can have them back.
- No, no.

172
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,552
They need to stay with you.

173
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:10,123
I don't know
what to do here!

174
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,250
I need to make
the right decision

175
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,269
and it seems like...

176
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,382
whatever I choose
is wrong.

177
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,469
Cielo, tell me
what's going on.

178
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,347
I know you think
I have a big mouth
sometimes

179
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,182
and that I am
overly communicative.

180
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,809
But if you don't talk
to me

181
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,770
I don't know
how to help you.

182
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,330
What's all that

183
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,791
about protecting the kids?

184
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,753
From whom or what?

185
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,673
From us.

186
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,257
From Walter and me.

187
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,551
No, no, Cielo.

188
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,662
No, not even
close.

189
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:54,125
Don't think that.
You're excellent
parents.

190
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:58,104
María.

191
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,259
There are things
you just don't know.

192
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,136
That if you knew,
you'd never speak to me again.

193
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,367
Try me.

194
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,250
No.

195
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,129
Okay, okay, Cielo.

196
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,465
Let me help you out.

197
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,426
You feel like this

198
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,204
because
of your affair
with Ernesto.

199
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,334
- What?
- Yes.

200
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,171
You can't keep
beating yourself up
over that.

201
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,815
It happens.

202
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,384
It was just a fling.
It's over.

203
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,986
It's all over.

204
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,222
- Walter told you.
- Yes, he did

205
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,141
but I practically
forced him to.

206
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,393
And if I'm telling you
right now

207
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,186
is because

208
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,896
I cannot stand

209
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,286
to see you like that.

210
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,996
to watch you blame

211
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,982
and torture yourself
like this.

212
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,067
You have to forgive

213
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,586
yourself.

214
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,486
Forgive

215
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,129
Makes sense.

216
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,157
Walter and you
were having
all these problems

217
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,409
and this really
good-looking man

218
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,622
treats you well,
he's a perfect
gentleman.

219
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:18,376
It's normal

220
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,682
normal.

221
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,476
you fell for it.

222
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,587
I've thought about it,
Cielo, sometimes.

223
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,564
But I can totally get

224
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,800
why you
fell into
temptation.

225
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,677
- Yes.
- Yeah.

226
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,361
I feel better.

227
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,221
You had to get it off
your chest

228
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,991
or you'd choke with it.

229
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,476
- I love you. Don't worry.
- Thanks.

230
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,771
I'm here
and the kids are fine.

231
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,673
Jose, come on.

232
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,425
Break's over.

233
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:52,870
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Euro is worth twenty pesos</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">more than yesterday.</font></i>

234
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,512
Go, go!

244
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,783
Nothing can change
this, Jose.

245
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,385
Yo, it's just...

246
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,955
Everyday I think about
that kid's parents.

247
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,709
- I know. Believe me.
- It's so hard.

248
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,421
Exactly the same thing
happens to me.

249
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,257
I haven't been able
to sleep
the past few nights.

250
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,552
But we have
to get through this,
Jose.

251
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,053
There are
other things.

252
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,889
Now, finally, we're
self-sufficient.

253
00:16:54,013 --> 00:17:01,396
We have

254
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,159
everything that we need.

255
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,496
no one to answer to.

256
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,749
I mean, except ourselves.

257
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,292
Listen to me

258
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,737
in a year,
year and a half

259
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,421
once we've cooked through

260
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,283
all this methylamine,
we'll have
plenty of time

261
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,927
for self-analysis

262
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:20,139
and deep soul-searching.

263
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,541
Until then,
we keep going.

264
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,502
We can't afford
not to, Jose.

265
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,755
We've got
a business

266
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,757
and we have
to manage it smartly

267
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,010
so this
never happens
again.

268
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,930
Something like this
can never happen again.

269
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,849
Definitely,
it won't happen
again.

270
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,705
Look, let's do this.

271
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,149
Why don' you go home
and rest a little?

272
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,692
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

273
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,837
You go on.

274
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,600
Hey.

275
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,187
Yeah, I'm on my way home.

276
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,230
Okay.

277
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,917
What are you doing here?

278
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,962
What's up?

279
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,383
We need to talk to you.

280
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,430
What's going on?

281
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,724
Anti-narcotics are all over me.

282
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,226
What?

283
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,602
Did they follow you here?

284
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,062
No, I threw them.

285
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,480
I'm not so dumb, Walter.

286
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,882
How long has this
been going on?

287
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,466
Since about the time
we started here.

288
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,194
What?!

289
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,762
Your dear brother-in-law
seems to be in love with me.

290
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,222
And you're just
telling me this now?!

291
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,642
What, you didn't think
this information
would be of interest?

292
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,896
How can you be
so irresponsible,
Mario?

293
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,356
Did you know
about this?

294
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,209
Mario just told me.

295
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,527
- So absurd?!
- Calm down.

296
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,588
I've got it under control.

297
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,924
And I've already decided.

298
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,384
I'm out.

299
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,627
Okay, Mario,
sorry to see you go.

300
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,631
But I really don't see
any other way.

301
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,966
This makes things
complicated

302
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,986
you get it, right?

303
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:23,848
Jose, you'll have
to take over
the distribution task.

304
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,225
I trust that you'll
bring him
up to speed.

305
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,146
That's also
gonna be complicated.

306
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,083
I'm out too.

307
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,484
You're
what?

308
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,527
Yeah, bro, I can't do this
anymore.

309
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,256
I'm retiring.

310
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,408
You know
how much methylamine
we've got here?

311
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,869
When cooked,
it's worth billions.

312
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,664
And you tell me
you're walking away
from it?

313
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,708
We walk away from the meth,
not the methylamine.

314
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,795
Jose and I will be selling
our two-thirds.

315
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,048
I've got a connection
from my time
with Gustavo Cortés.

316
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,134
He has the capital,
and he's motivated.

317
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,693
Mario's thinking we'll clear

318
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,528
like five million. Each.

319
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,182
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

320
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,350
You won't have
to worry about that anymore.

321
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,061
And then
I will be going on my way.

322
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,996
Jose too.

323
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,372
Yo, you should think about it.

324
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,874
It's a solid plan.

325
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,418
Retire once and for all.

326
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,696
You'll be selling
to my competitors.

327
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,949
Whole lot of meth-heads
for everybody, Walter.

328
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,452
They're offering you
pennies!

329
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,538
That's what
you're gonna
sell out for?!

330
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,874
Five million
isn't pennies for me.

331
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,809
Really, yo.

332
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,145
And when it comes down to it

333
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,964
are we on the money business
or in the meth business?

334
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,450
Relax, kid.
There's no one here.

335
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,552
You sure?

336
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,263
Yeah.

337
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,124
I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't.

338
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,231
Look, they're here.

339
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,237
The gallon.

340
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,614
Glad to see
you could make it out.

341
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,158
I was
surprised
to get your
call.

342
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,178
Good surprise, I hope.

343
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,181
Well, as discussed

344
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,474
there's one gallon.

345
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,476
You take that back home

346
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,520
to your people, test it.

347
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,672
If you're satisfied,
I can get the rest.

348
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,108
That's fair enough.

349
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,652
Then shall we talk money?

350
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,572
That one's free.

351
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,934
The price for the rest
is ten million dollars.

352
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,520
A round figure.
Makes it easier
for my partner and I to split.

353
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,581
That's steep.

354
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,124
Mm.

355
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,835
It's worth it.

356
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,628
We good?

357
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,256
I'll talk to my guys

358
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,449
but I should be able
to put together
that cash.

359
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,077
- Perfect.
- Of course...

360
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,996
you'd get
your blue stuff

361
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:41,145
off the market.

362
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:41,045
I need that crystal

363
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,757
Let me
get this straight,
Mario.

364
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,902
The first time we talked

365
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,305
you told me you had
six thousand gallons.

366
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,101
And that you could
even get nine thousand.

367
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,188
Where are the other
three thousand gallons,
Mario?

368
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,773
That's not
all the methylamine

369
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,417
you have.

370
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,877
Right?

371
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:08,739
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

372
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,826
This other party wouldn't be
a problem for you.

373
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,329
His territory
won't impact yours.

374
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,747
You see,
that doesn't work
for me.

375
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,042
I'm not just buying this
for the supply.

376
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,253
I'm buying this
for the demand, Mario.

377
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,214
I'm looking to increase
my market share here

378
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,065
you see?

379
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,259
I don't know
what to tell you.

380
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,986
I want you to tell me

381
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,113
that Gustavo's blue glass

382
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,572
will be off the streets.

383
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,367
I'm paying fifteen million

384
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,811
for all the methylamine
you have.

385
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,579
I can't sell the rest.

386
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,958
It's not mine.

387
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,819
Well then, no deal,
Mario.

388
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,120
Let's
go.

389
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:13,988
Yes?

390
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,033
Yes.

391
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,370
I don't know.

392
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:23,706
I guess.

393
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:27,526
Why don't you come over
to my house?

394
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,629
Yes, seriously.

395
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,261
Sit down.

396
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,478
You sure this is okay?

397
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,979
All right.

398
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,608
This is what happened.

399
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,218
Something's come up
and Mario wanted to come

400
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,777
to give you the hard sell

401
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,596
but I figured
if it came from me

402
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,323
you would take it better.

403
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,824
Tell me.

404
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,978
Mario's connection
said

405
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,606
he won't buy
mine and Mario's shares

406
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,108
unless he
gets your share, too.

407
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,485
He wants the entire
nine thousand gallons.

408
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,836
That is totally unacceptable.

409
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,738
Yeah, I figured
you'd say that.

410
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,325
But I've been thinking
about it

411
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,244
and it really makes
sense.

412
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,762
Really.

413
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,472
Kinda.

414
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,374
Not
completely.

415
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,460
You remember
when we started this thing

416
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,922
with the bus
and everything?

417
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,801
Did you ever
dream of having

418
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,780
five million dollars?

419
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,434
You
didn't.

420
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,077
And I know it for fact

421
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,079
because I remember you

422
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,148
doing the maths beside me,
on the bus

423
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:51,027
and all you needed
was 1,300 million pesos.

424
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,530
I remember
you worked it
all out

425
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,407
mathematically,
the way you like
to do things

426
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:00,703
and you didn't
even reach
the million dollars.

427
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:05,291
Yo, these are
five million dollars.

428
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,626
Think about it
like this.

429
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,897
If you ask me

430
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,925
if selling
the methylamine

431
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:20,764
means that no one else
ever gets killed
because of us

432
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,642
then I vote for that,
man.
Hands down.

433
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,438
Don't you
think?

434
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,873
And the best part is

435
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,960
that if you say yes today

436
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,839
we could have it tomorrow.

437
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:40,159
Just figure
you could be here

438
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,705
spending time
with your family,
your kids.

439
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,584
No more worrying
about having to hide.

440
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,589
No more worrying
about our safety.

441
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,219
Isn't this what we
have been working for?

442
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,115
No.

443
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,560
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out,
Jose.

444
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,521
No, it's not selling
out.

445
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,356
On the contrary,
this is doing
the right thing.

446
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,543
We have suffered and bled...

447
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,613
We have literally bled
for this business, Jose.

448
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,450
I will not throw it away
for nothing.

449
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,827
I don't think
you understand me here.

450
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,557
How else can I say it?

451
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,933
It's five million dollars.

452
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,686
It isn't nothing.

453
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,547
It is a whole lot
of money.
Big time.

454
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:38,067
Really.

455
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:41,429
Have you heard
of a company
called "Atomic Number"?

456
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,365
- No.

457
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,060
You want me
to tell you the story?

458
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,871
I co-founded it

459
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,773
in grad school
with a couple of friends.

460
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,209
We decided to create it.

461
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,627
It was just small-time.

462
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,130
An emerging company.

463
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,741
We had a couple patents
pending and stuff.

464
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:08,289
'Course, we all knew
the potential.

465
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,224
We went step by step.

466
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:15,463
We didn't want
to risk too much.

467
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,341
However,
we were absolutely sure

468
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,843
that some day,
we didn't know exactly when

469
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,613
but some day

470
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,931
we were gonna take
the world by storm.

471
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,577
Well, all of a sudden

472
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,438
we started having
some problems.

473
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,190
I'm not gonna go
into detail.

474
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,108
But I decided
to leave the company.

475
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,211
And I sold my share.

476
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:46,118
I took a buyout
for ten million pesos.

477
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:51,957
Ten million pesos
at the time,
was a lot of money for me.

478
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:57,714
Care to guess
what that company
is worth now?

479
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,189
Millions?

480
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,691
Billions.

481
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,110
Billions, with a "B".

482
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,139
I know because I look it up
every week.

483
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:11,243
And I sold my share for ten.

484
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,246
I sold my kids' birthright

485
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,248
for a few months' rent.

486
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,109
This isn't
the same thing, bro.

487
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,037
You asked me if I was
in the meth business

488
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,665
or the money business,
right?

489
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,393
Neither.

490
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,356
I'm in the empire business.

491
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,595
Walter,
if you ask me

492
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,264
a meth empire
isn't something

493
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,182
to be that proud of,
really.

494
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,873
Cielo?

495
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:00,000
Hi.

496
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,794
You remember José Miguel?

497
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,529
Jose, she's my wife,
Cielo.

498
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,255
Mrs. Cielo, how are you?

499
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,966
Hey.

500
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,426
You have a lovely home.

501
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,288
The plants there
give it a cool touch.

502
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,914
I'm sorry
you run into me here.

503
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,725
I was just heading out.

504
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,184
No, no, stay.

505
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,269
No, I've got some stuff to do.

506
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,730
Stay.

507
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,651
Seriously, stay.

508
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,179
We'd love
you stayed for dinner.

509
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,240
Wouldn't we, Cielo?

510
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:32,891
We'd love him
to stay for dinner?

511
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,185
We don't have anything
special planned tonight.

512
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,664
Sure, we'd love to.

513
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,699
Mm!

514
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,743
Mrs. Cielo

515
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:19,580
this salad's great.

516
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,039
Really.

517
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,625
You see, I'm not

518
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,652
such a fun of vegetables,
but I liked it a lot.

519
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,737
I know they're good
for your health and stuff.

520
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,047
But the thing is...

521
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,383
I live by myself

522
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,536
so if I buy
too many vegetables,
they go bad.

523
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,638
Sure.

524
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,997
This dressing is--
How did you do it?

525
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,750
What did you put there?
It's delicious.

526
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,270
Lemon.

527
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,548
They say lemon
fixes everything,
right?

528
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,049
Not that it needs
fixing

529
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,968
'cause it's delicious,
but, I mean...

530
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,827
Um!

531
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,162
Let's say I feed

532
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,790
mostly on delivery

533
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,249
frozen food and stuff.

534
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,527
I know
it's usually pretty bad.

535
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,545
They say the nourishment

536
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,964
isn't so concentrated

537
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,882
and they go bad and...

538
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,845
But it is what it is.

539
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,222
You know what?

540
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,724
I just hate the people

541
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,559
from the frozen food industry.

542
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,061
Really.

543
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,646
They're lying bastards.

544
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,356
You go to the fridge

545
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,842
and it seems like
the perfect lasagna

546
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,401
with all the cheese on top.

547
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:34,889
Then you nuke it
and it's not
like that.

548
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,684
The cheese gets
all rubbery.

549
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,686
One should be able
to sue them.

550
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,329
As a consumer

551
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,523
I feel insulted
by those men.

552
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,442
Really,
that is called...

553
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,235
Misleading
advertising, right?

554
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,113
Really, it's an insult
for the consumer.

555
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:04,018
So how's business?

556
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,063
It's a car wash, isn't it?

557
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,715
The man here says
you're a great manager.

558
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,358
He did?

559
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,135
Yes, he speaks
very well of you.

560
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,737
He says you've got it running

561
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,054
like a machine.
Like, well-oiled.

562
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,723
As if you were
a great mechanic.

563
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,282
I mean, you're the manager

564
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,101
so I guess
it's like a metaphor, right?

565
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,479
But still, he speaks
very well of you.

566
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,106
That you are
a great person.

567
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,525
What else
did he tell you?
Tell me.

568
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,820
When he speaks,
he says just good stuff.

569
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:34,865
That you are
such a great woman.

570
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,534
Did you also tell you
about my affair?

571
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,469
About your what?

572
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,513
Affair.

573
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,696
Excuse me.

574
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,878
You know my kids are gone?

575
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,364
Yo, I don't judge them.
I'd done the same thing.

576
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,741
You're a crazy
couple.

577
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,619
I don't mean
they're out for the night.

578
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,345
They're gone.

579
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,664
They were taken
to the house

580
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,557
of my wife's sister.

581
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,125
The one that's married
no less

582
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,186
than with Henry Navarro.

583
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,800
She made me kick my own kids
out of the house.

584
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,969
And you know
what she told me?

585
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:40,180
That she was counting
the days

586
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:44,910
until my cancer came back.

587
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,898
She's waiting
for me to die.

588
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:53,151
This business is all
I have left now, Jose.

589
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,072
And you want to take it
away from me.

590
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,166
[Mario)
I thought you might try
something stupid.

591
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,542
- Look, Mario--
- Don't bother.

592
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,796
Come join me
in the office.

593
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,715
- No.
- That's not a request.

594
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,449
No.

595
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,452
On the stairs.

596
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,947
This deal
is going down tomorrow.

597
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,158
It's happening
whether you like it or
not.

598
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,493
There's nothing
you can do to stop it.

599
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,011
Got it?

600
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,721
Yeah, got it.

601
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,624
- You're stealing
my methylamine.
- No-one's stealing anything.

602
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,168
And to ensure that,
you and I

603
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,711
are gonna spend
the rest of the night
together.

604
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,479
Like it's my birthday.

605
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,065
Look, Mario--

606
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,427
When the deal is done,
you'll get your money.

607
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,096
I guarantee that.
I promise.

608
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,199
Mario, let me cook it.

609
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:51,854
I'll double your five
and you still walk.

610
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,271
I've never seen anybody
work so hard

611
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,857
not to get
five million dollars.

612
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,566
Mire, you need to listen
to me, okay?

613
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,376
Please, listen to me.

614
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,738
The last thing I need
is listen to you,
Walter.

615
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,841
Sit down and be quiet.

616
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,273
Walter.

617
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,693
Wake up.

618
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:33,478
I've got something

619
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,783
a bit of a quandary here.

620
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,478
I need to attend to
before this deal happens.

621
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,289
But I don't trust you

622
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,525
so I'm gonna have
to restrain you.

623
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,153
You gotta be
kidding.

624
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,714
Stand up for me.

625
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,676
Stand up, goddamn it!

626
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,434
Arms up and out to the side.

627
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,296
This is
unbelievable.

628
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,288
Sit down.

629
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,714
Give me your wrist.

630
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,061
Sorry.

631
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,709
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

632
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,128
Gentlemen,
we're here

633
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,754
to discuss
the illegal harassment

634
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,547
to which you're
subjecting
my client.

635
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,649
This should be good.

636
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,443
Mister Mario Arboleda

637
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:34,944
has become the victim

638
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,222
of a vicious, relentless,
and, above all

639
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,115
unwarranted persecution

640
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:42,018
from the Anti-narcotics
Department.

641
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:45,522
Gómez, that sound
right to you?

642
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,442
Don't tell me
you're doing things
behind my back.

643
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,069
I have no idea
what he's talking about.

644
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,837
No, no idea.

645
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,197
Nothing?
Zero, zip?

646
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,924
Come on, we all know

647
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,952
you've been following
my client day and night.

648
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,954
The poor man
can't even spend

649
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,205
a few minutes
with his granddaughter.

650
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,890
Why?

651
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,208
'Cause you're
playing
hide-and-seek

652
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:06,726
behind the bushes

653
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,504
sneaking away,
hiding

654
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,256
peeping through
your little
binoculars.

655
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,857
It's disturbing.

656
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,568
You should feel ashamed.

657
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:19,014
And it's taken a toll
on his mental
and physical well-being.

658
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:22,100
- He looks fine to me.
- It's possible.

659
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,227
Why?
Because some hurts

660
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:25,854
only show
on the inside.

661
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,524
And generally,
those hurt the most.

662
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,375
Let's see.

663
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,068
You guys
don't even have warrants

664
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:34,237
for these tails,
do you?

665
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,798
Theoretically

666
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,201
to do these tails
we don't need a warrant.

667
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,619
It's within
the bounds
of the law.

668
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,639
We don't need a warrant

669
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,832
to follow somebody
through a public place.
You know that, doctor.

670
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,459
Yeah, that is
theoretically correct.

671
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,311
But a surveillance

672
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:52,381
so open-ended and unrestricted
turns into...?

673
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:53,898
Stalking.

674
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,594
You're so funny, buddy.
Really.

675
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,698
And stalking is illegal.

676
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,659
I don't know what it is

677
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,686
you find so interesting
about my client.

678
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,897
But I'm not here
to judge anyone.

679
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:11,233
Different strokes
for different folks.

680
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,692
Men with men,
women with women.

681
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,503
The problem is that, sadly

682
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,212
he's just not that into you.

683
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:18,632
So, I have filed for an order

684
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,469
a temporary restraining order

685
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,179
against Anti-narcotics

686
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,915
and on behalf
of Mr. Arboleda.

687
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,725
Look, Saúl.

688
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,794
Where'd you get
your law degree?

689
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,063
The same clown college

690
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,524
you got that suit?

691
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:36,983
Hey!

692
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,860
Let me tell you.

693
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,388
You know who likes
this suit
very much?

694
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,407
Judge Débora Peña.

695
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,285
She admires my motley

696
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,162
dress sense, let's say.

697
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,440
I agree with her
in that.

698
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,943
You know what
Judge Peña hates?

699
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:59,573
When senior citizens
are being harassed

700
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,491
sorry about
the senior part

701
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:03,593
by the police.

702
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,011
Therefore, gentlemen

703
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,555
that's all for today.

704
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,082
You can expect
the written notice soon.

705
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,142
Let's go.

706
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,671
You should have it
within the hour
over your desks.

707
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,548
That is, if you have desks,
which I don't think.

708
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:19,842
Maybe over your school desks
or your T squares?

709
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,685
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What the hell</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">kind of judge</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">would issue this thing?</font></i>

710
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,995
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That Débora, man.</font></i>

711
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,397
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">She's always finding</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">fault</font></i>

712
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:34,524
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">with every security</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">organism.</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">She's shit.</font></i>

713
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,110
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- So what we do?</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Well, not a lot of choice.</font></i>

714
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,628
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">We back off for the moment.</font></i>

715
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,046
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Anyway Saúl knows that TRO</font></i>

716
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,548
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">won't stand for long.</font></i>

717
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:42,991
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">What we've got to do,</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">Gómez,</font></i>

718
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,867
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">is knowing</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">what they're playing at here.</font></i>

719
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,703
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">And if Mario Arboleda</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">wants a fight</font></i>

720
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,722
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">he's gonna get one.</font></i>

721
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,873
That was
a hell of a gamble.

722
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,684
Risky, right?

723
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,394
Worked at least.

724
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,005
Not for long.
He's right about that TRO.

725
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:01,092
It's gonna get tossed
toute suite.

726
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,471
That Henry Navarro has
a hard-on for you, right?

727
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,223
What you gonna do?
How you gonna get rid
of him?

728
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:08,742
How much time I got?

729
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,411
Maybe 24 hours.

730
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,938
- It's enough.
- It better be.

731
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,399
Whatever you got
on your mind

732
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:19,152
or have planned,
you better do it quick.

733
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,656
Playtime's about to be over
for you.

734
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,452
Where is it?!

735
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:53,895
Mario, please!
Hold on, okay?

736
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,314
- Get out of my way!
- Mario, please, listen to me!

737
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,775
- I am gonna count to three.
- The man's got an idea.

738
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,376
One, two...

739
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:01,737
Mario, don't shoot,
please!

740
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,446
Just hear him out!
It's a solid idea!

741
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:05,907
We both get
our five million each

742
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,451
he gets his methylamine
and we're out of this.

743
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,929
Just hear him out.

744
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,182
Is that true?

745
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:17,185
Yes. Everybody wins.
