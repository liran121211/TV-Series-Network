1
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,492
Shit!

2
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,895
MISSION FAILED
CONTINUE/ABANDON

3
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,341
And you'll polish it
yourself, okay?

4
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,359
Thanks.

5
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,429
They'll make anything
for you to deliver it.

6
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,034
Hey, and how's Junior?

7
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,812
Well, he's not talking to me
since I told him
we had to deliver the car.

8
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,315
Let's hope
he'll get over it soon.

9
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,418
I spoke to the dealership.

10
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,878
They didn't want to take it.

11
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,504
How come? Why?

12
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,574
It's got 17
miles
on the odometer.

13
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,828
Well yeah, I spent more than
an hour talking to the manager

14
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,263
about the restocking fine.

15
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,083
What? A fine?
They're collecting a fine?

16
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,643
Five million pesos.

17
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,186
What?

18
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,147
For two days?

19
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,465
Well, the law says
they don't have
to take it back at all.

20
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,525
But that was in the fine print!

21
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,111
or keeping the car.

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,237
Bunch of thieves.

23
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,599
Look, here's all the paperwork
and the bills.

24
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,435
Talk directly to the manager,
his name's Jairo.

25
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,079
Jairo.

26
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,191
And please, just don't
tangle with anyone.

27
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,587
Call me if there's a problem.

28
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,009
And give the boy his tip.

29
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,994
Hey, would you change me
a 50 dollar note?

30
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,303
I've no change.

31
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,828
Woooo!

32
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,849
Fuck!

33
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,944
Hello, miss, I need a cab.

34
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,529
Walter Blanco.

35
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,893
I'm at the exit for Bogotá,
three miles after the tollbooth.

36
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:55,314
Yeah, exactly.
Next to the wineries.
La Nacional.

37
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,900
No, don't you worry.
I'll wait here.

38
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,548
Hello. No, look.

39
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,034
No problem. I'm sure
he'll find me.

40
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,220
I'm next to a huge bonfire.

41
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,264
Thank you very much.

42
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,755
He's so sorry!
He's really sorry,

43
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,091
He's even willing
to pay for it, literally,

44
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,009
so that this doesn't
become known.

45
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,887
Besides, he swears
it won't happen again.

46
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,989
Sure. In cash?

47
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,016
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll make sure you get the
suitcase.

48
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,286
Thanks, mate. Cheers!

49
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:37,273
We have to thank
I've been working
on the campaign

50
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,110
for the mayor
and in the traffic department.
They owe me a few things.

51
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,655
Well, you'll have to pay a fine
or throwing garbage away,
how's that?

52
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,448
You won't have to attend
the educational course.

53
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,784
They get rid of the car,
and you

54
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,745
are sending my friend
a thank-you present
with some zeros on the right.

55
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,347
That's it!

56
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,167
The arson thing was only news
for a school radio program.

57
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,477
Not even students listen to it.

58
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,229
To sum up...

59
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,632
this little game
cost you three times
the price of the car.

60
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,234
Okay.

61
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,136
Saúl,
I don't want any details, okay?

62
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,846
The main thing is,
it has to be fixed.

63
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,431
Excuse me,
I woke you up.

64
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,284
What a shame, I'm sorry.

65
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,395
You haven't realized
what's just happened here.

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,996
What did I do?

67
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,898
Magic!
I work miracles.

68
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,527
Not even your wife
will find out.

69
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,781
You could at least tell me,
"Bravo, Saúl, bravo."

70
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,591
Okay, give me that.

71
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,430
Let me see...

72
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:40,211
And what's keeping
your head so busy? Gustavo?

73
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,980
Yes.

74
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,841
I'm sure he must have already
figured out a plan
on how to kill me.

75
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,987
And I've nothing to do about it.

76
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,141
The only thing I can do
is wait.

77
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,702
Are you sure about that?

78
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,148
Because José says
they really need you.

79
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,000
José...

80
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,237
José Miguel has no idea
where his head is.

81
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:07,712
So what are you thinking of?

82
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,927
Saúl, I was thinking...

83
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,955
I don't know.
Could you happen to find me...

84
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,767
s troubleshooter?

85
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,271
A troubleshooter?

86
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,298
Is than an euphemism
for hit man?

87
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,967
Yeah, well, I don't know,
do you still call them that?

88
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,595
No, no, no.
It's a really bad
idea..

89
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,223
We're dealing here
with high-level people,
these people are dangerous.

90
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,393
No, no, no. Saúl,
I just need a phone.

91
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,286
I'll handle the rest.

92
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,230
And you'd have
a good commission.

93
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,484
Walter, let's suppose
there's no other choice.

94
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,112
I could give you
a couple of names...

95
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,197
two guys from Cali,
they're good boys.

96
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:54,534
The thing is,
Mario knows them
and they know Mario.

97
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,703
Well, now it turns out Mario
knows the whole human kind?

98
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,389
For God's sake!

99
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,458
Mario's the one
who game me their names.

100
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,043
Besides, he taught them
everything they know.

101
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,728
Let's just think that--

102
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,465
whoever we find,
if we happen

103
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,884
to find anybody,
will end up facing Mario

104
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,720
and that will represent
a problem for all of us.

105
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,822
Now, Gustavo...

106
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,435
Gustavo's got tentacles
and we don't even
know about them.

107
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,187
It's most likely
he'll find out

108
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,898
you're hiring someone
to get him killed

109
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,858
even before you actually
find them.

110
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,668
So what shall I do?

111
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,256
Shall I sit and wait?

112
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,741
I've already tried
to do it personally.

113
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,494
I couldn't get
even close to him!

114
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,097
Well, if we're talking about

115
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:44,602
getting pretty close to him--

116
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,003
why don't you talk
to your partner?

117
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,817
Yeah, I met Gustavo.

118
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,597
And you preferred
go telling Saúl
than coming to me?

119
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,684
Let's see,
let me explain myself.

120
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,811
The thing is, Saúl's
pissed off because Mario

121
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,023
would break his legs
because he lied
about my whereabouts.

122
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,275
So every time I enter
this man's office,

123
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,820
Saúl hassles me
about talking to Mario,
wants me to speak well of him.

124
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,739
So in order to soothe him
a little,

125
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,700
you well know
Mario doesn't like to talk,

126
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,536
the only thing I do
is telling him the latest.

127
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,744
That's everything
that's going on.

128
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,597
So don't take it personally.

129
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,684
What happened exactly?

130
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,339
Nothing happened.
I was there,

131
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,174
at a bar with Mario,
and...

132
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,967
Well, nothing,
this guy arrived.

133
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,970
- And "this guy" is Gustavo?
- Yes.

134
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,474
They came in, started to talk
and took me out for a while.

135
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,951
So that happens regularly?

136
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,828
No, mate.

137
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,897
Not regularly.
I don't have weekly meetings
with the big boss.

138
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,666
No, that's not what's going on.

139
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,920
How close were you to him?

140
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,380
Close enough.

141
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,367
Closer than you and me
right now.

142
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,910
Did you talk?
Did he tell you anything?

143
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,288
Yeah, we talked
for like ten seconds, that's it.

144
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,332
What did he
say?

145
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,893
José, what did he say?

146
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,463
He told me he saw
things in people.

147
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,650
Things? What people?

148
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,364
Me, mate. I'm the people.

149
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,906
He said he saw something in me.

150
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,242
He saw like--.

151
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,687
I mean, one month ago, Gustavo
was about to kill us both.

152
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,776
And now he pulls you
out of the lab
and employs you as...

153
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,295
What, an assistant gunman?

154
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,673
A junior bodyguard?

155
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,325
I mean, it's completely
meaningless.

156
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,344
Face it, man!

157
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,555
Gustavo coming to tell you

158
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,974
he sees something in you...

159
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,519
There must be something else!

160
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,631
I mean, he can't believe
you're so naive.

161
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,691
Let's see.

162
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,217
I don't understand
where you're going
with all this.

163
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,362
Well, José, I mean this:

164
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,180
I don't understand.
I can't believe

165
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,392
Gustavo thinks
you suddenly forgot

166
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,994
he was going to kill you.

167
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,747
What about Guido's death?

168
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,164
And Víctor's?

169
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,320
Not to mention
your girlfriend's brother.

170
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,422
Tomás?

171
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,574
I still hear him
in my head...

172
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,785
when he told you,
looking directly into your
eyes,

173
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,888
"No more children."

174
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,375
That same night, "Bang!"
Tomás got killed.

175
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,312
I can't believe

176
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,022
Gustavo really thinks

177
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,550
you'll forget about all this,
just like that.

178
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,345
- Enough, mate.
- No! It's outraging.

179
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,222
This prick Gustavo
thinking you're so weak-willed--

180
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,517
Well, enough!
I've already told you to finish!

181
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,977
Drop the sales pitch.
Leave it for some other time.

182
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,689
- I told you I'd do it.
- What are you going to do?

183
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,540
I'll kill him.

184
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,527
First chance I get,
but drop it right now.

185
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,078
- Done, look.
- Thanks.

186
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,765
Thank you, come back.

187
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,626
I don't get it why people love
this bubblegum scent so much.

188
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,878
I find it repulsive, smells
like a school bus, right?

189
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,298
- Yeah, but they buy it.
- Really?

190
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:23,387
And this one's rice pudding
with cinnamon? Can't believe it!

191
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,056
Yeah, I couldn't
believe it either.

192
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,075
But the customer's always right.

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,077
Speaking of customer,

194
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,079
I think it's not too late

195
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,998
to have a grand opening.

196
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,609
We could have a barbecue
right over there

197
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,319
with balloons,
and we could have them bring

198
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,863
girls with hot pants
to serve the customers,

199
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,157
we could have a discount,
something really chic.

200
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,344
And tell me, how's Henry?

201
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,495
- Much better.
- Really?

202
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,514
He is.

203
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,584
He's doing better,
he's on a better mood.
He's changed attitude.

204
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,587
He's like a maniac
with his physical therapy. He's
doing better.

205
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,188
That's good news.

206
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,923
It's not easy.
I'm telling you this

207
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,759
because it's a slow process,
but I feel that...

208
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,134
we're finally getting
to the right path.

209
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,178
- Hey.
- Hi.

210
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,447
You're a hard worker.

211
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,182
- Hi.
- Hello.

212
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,059
- Everything alright?
- Just fine.

213
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,730
Let me tell you, your wife
is quite the salesperson.

214
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,857
He almost talked me into buying
a rice pudding air freshener.

215
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,192
With cinnamon.
How do you like it?

216
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,711
Nice.

217
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,363
That's the salesperson
we needed here.

218
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,132
Well, may I congratulate you?

219
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,119
Let me say hi.
Hello.

220
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,583
Thanks for bringing the
order.

221
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,167
- Shall we organize it?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,503
I'll let you work.
My car must be ready right now.

223
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,713
- Yeah, bye.

224
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,089
- Bye.

225
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,189
- Cheers.

226
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,467
Would you please give me that
to show Henry?

227
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,844
- Sure.
- Kiss Walter Junior from me.

228
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,563
Ramiro was making
19 cars during the rush hour.

229
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,082
We're making 22.

230
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,792
22. Real.

231
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:03,862
That difference
covers it well for us.

232
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,989
Yesterday I deposited
like ten million pesos.

233
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,469
Hey, hey, how much?

234
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,889
How much do you have there?

235
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,958
I don't know exactly. They paid
three hundred thousand dollars.

236
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,961
At today's rate,
you do the math.

237
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,422
It must be more or less
600 millones.

238
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,691
Wait, wait, wait.

239
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,569
We have to count it again.

240
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,096
And you're bringing this
how often?

241
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,031
Every two weeks.

242
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,617
Thursday's good for a drop-off?

243
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,204
Are you serious?

244
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,483
Are you going to earn
like 15 thousand million a year?

245
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,945
I don't know exactly.
The negotiation
was made in dollars.

246
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,214
That makes eight million a year.

247
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,133
Sort of, yeah.

248
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,886
Sort of?

249
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,346
Yeah, more or less.

250
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,875
It depends
on the output factors, Cielo.

251
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,896
Walter, that's too much.

252
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,273
It's too much, Walter.

253
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,926
You're earning more
than what you expected,

254
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,970
and now you think that's what?
Bad news?

255
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,557
No, that's not the point,
Walter.

256
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:18,812
The point is, no car wash
in the world can make that much.

257
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,940
I don't know what happens
in other countries,
but it's impossible here.

258
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,875
It'll take me years

259
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,585
to clean this money.

260
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,965
I don't know.

261
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,533
Put away some part
of the cash

262
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,093
and save it for a rainy day.

263
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,995
- I don't know...
- Rainy days?

264
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,851
There are no rainy days ahead.

265
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,337
And where do you want me
to keep that?

266
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,340
I can't put it in a bank,
I can't have it here...

267
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,695
Cielo...

268
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,097
I didn't ask you
to do that.

269
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,392
I thought you had it
completely under control here.

270
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,519
But I didn't think it was
so much money.

271
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,039
Look, whatever,

272
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,816
our work is split
from the very beginning.

273
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,736
I bring in the money,
you launder the money.

274
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,713
This is what you wanted, right?

275
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,131
I never wanted any of this.

276
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,202
But you accepted it,
at some point.

277
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,846
And that's real.

278
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,852
Now, think it through.

279
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,797
Really, if you feel
this is too much for you,
just tell me.

280
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,859
It's okay.

281
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,010
You want to get
out?

282
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,670
You made this in the lab?

283
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,254
Why not?

284
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,090
We've the best equipment there.

285
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,661
Besides, I thought making it
in your own lab would be...

286
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,721
Appropriate.

287
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,375
There's not much of it.
We had more for Tuco.

288
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,353
It's enough, believe me

289
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,672
Besides,
it's most efficient.

290
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,233
You go after Gustavo with a gun,

291
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,053
you won't make 100 feet
and you'll be shot.

292
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,599
You can slip this
into his food or drink,

293
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,726
there shouldn't be
any taste or smell.

294
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,245
In 36 hours he'll be...

295
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,233
Besides, a man like Gustavo,
working as hard as he does,

296
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,111
no one will be surprised
if that happened to him.

297
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,591
What about Mario?

298
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,843
Mario.

299
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,123
He will surely be suspicious
but he won't do anything.

300
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,169
Wouldn't it be better
to recover health
once and for all?

301
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,354
One psycho at a time, okay?

302
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,720
I don't know when I'll see him
again, if I ever do.

303
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,599
It doesn't matter.
You just keep this with you
all the time.

304
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,018
When you have the opportunity,
be ready.

305
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,750
What if they search me?

306
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,920
Will they do that?

307
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,757
I don't know, they may.

308
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,713
No, it's the wrong way around.

309
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,284
Don't you see
that's my lucky cigarette, man?

310
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,913
Well, whatever you do,
don't smoke it.

311
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,806
I'd give you a hand,
but I'm busy.

312
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,532
Relax, brother...

313
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,951
I can do it on my own.

314
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,106
Maybe this thing helps me
stretch my legs a bit.

315
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,734
Hey, you know?
I liked that driver stuff.

316
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,402
No, no, no, really,
I felt good.

317
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:04,323
That stuff puts you
on a higher level?

318
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,578
Hey, that stuff from here
to there, it'll take
an eternity.

319
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,831
We'd better still be hungry
when we arrive, then...

320
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,168
You must love this chicken.
Coming all the way here...

321
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,354
Just a whim, brother.

322
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,217
I'm not telling you
it's the best car
I've ever driven.

323
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,177
It was the best car
I've ever gotten into.

324
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,904
it was like a spaceship, uncle!

325
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,389
And where did you get
that car from?

326
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,892
I mean, suddenly your dad
said, "I wanna buy this car"?

327
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,227
And he bought it,
just like that?

328
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,729
No, the worst thing is
I couldn't even drive it.

329
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,732
Mom said we couldn't
afford a car like that,

330
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,485
and she made him give it back,
I couldn't drive it,
not even for 30 miles.

331
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:46,157
Well, at least you drove it.
When I was your age,

332
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,826
I wasn't even allowed
to touch my granddad's car.

333
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,579
Really.
Not even park it.

334
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,165
And I had a girlfriend,
buddy,

335
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,543
she lived outside Bogotá.
It took me an hour and a half
to get to her.

336
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,145
I had to take the bus.

337
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,090
But when I didn't have
the money,
I had to use my legs.

338
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,634
Well, sure, but my legs
are sort of like this...

339
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,179
Yeah, I know.
Really.

340
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,015
Listen, seriously,
why did your dad buy that car?

341
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,451
I just don't get it, why?

342
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,744
I don't know, uncle.

343
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,771
He was taking me
to school and...

344
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,440
all of a sudden, we saw
some cars there, and well...

345
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,418
I told him I needed...

346
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,545
I needed one be-because...

347
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,881
I have a pro-problem?

348
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,299
Stop being an asshole, man.

349
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,077
- Uncle, don't start on me.
- What is it, bro?

350
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,122
Look, you know what?
This car business
didn't work for you.

351
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,790
And you know why?
Because you're ambitious.

352
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,835
If you had chosen
a simpler car,

353
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,728
you'd have your car today.

354
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,131
And you wouldn't need
a ride with your uncle

355
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,690
in order to drive it.

356
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,067
Am I right or what?

357
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,845
Am I?
You're ambitious!

358
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,264
That happened to you
only because of that.

359
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,782
Hell, no?

360
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,285
Agent, I'm glad to see you here.

361
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,520
Don Gustavo! Too bad
I can't get up, man.

362
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,647
- Don't you worry.
- Remember my nephew?

363
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,025
- Of course. How are you?
- Hi. Fine.

364
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,085
Glad to see you're recovering.

365
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,570
Well, no,
you know, brother,

366
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,074
broccoli and cauliflower
make you feel better.

367
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,679
I love telling that joke!

368
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,456
If I had seen you
when you entered the restaurant,

369
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,001
I'd have served you
personally.

370
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,171
You're a very special customer
here at Pollos Hermanos,

371
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,632
and I'd like to tell you
you can eat for free
whenever you want.

372
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,468
Careful with what you say,
I'll surely come.

373
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,279
You'll be welcome.

374
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,696
So, how are your parents?

375
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,031
They're fine, sir, yeah.

376
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,517
- Tell them I say hi.
- Yes, sure I will

377
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,186
Are you okay?
Want a drink?

378
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,372
No, I'm fine, thank you.

379
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,360
Well, if it's okay,
I'd like to have
some more soda.

380
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,778
Of course.
Same one you're having?

381
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,340
Yes, diet soda. Thanks.

382
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:51,508
Excuse me.

383
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:10,885
You
ready?

384
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,238
I'm ready.

385
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,254
So, what's today's plan?

386
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,714
Today's a very important day.

387
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,466
Big doings today.

388
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,092
The order of the day is...

389
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,871
eyes open, mouth shut.
Not the other way around.

390
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,750
Sound testing.

391
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,113
- Testing.
- Mario.

392
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,683
Leave the snacks on the table,

393
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,187
where everyone can reach them.

394
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,548
Jose, you know
how to make coffee?

395
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,258
There's the machine.
Make some, please.

396
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,408
Both strong, no sugar.

397
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,661
Want a report?

398
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,313
Besides the men
you can see there,

399
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,773
we've three men
camouflaged by the door.

400
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,652
And five by the rear,
camouflaged and backed up.

401
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,613
There's also Mosquera
on the roof, he carries a .50.

402
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,824
They're here since last night
in case anyone arrived early.

403
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,572
Jose.

404
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,016
Weapons don't grow from trees.
Don't you throw it away.

405
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,354
If you're here,
you have to be armed.

406
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,915
Sir, is this loaded?

407
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,171
Keep it where nobody can see it,

408
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,281
and show it only
when I show mine.

409
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,091
Understood?

410
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,052
Only in case of emergency.

411
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,662
Well, there's the first car.
Let's go.

412
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,674
Lots of weapons.

413
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,909
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

414
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,706
You want to sweep the place
before you bring in your guy?

415
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,433
I am the guy.

416
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,854
Let's go then.

417
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,698
Welcome.

418
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,659
Where's the rest of the group?

419
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,369
There's no rest of the group.

420
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,315
The only person representing
the cartel's interests
in Colombia is me.

421
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,041
Good.

422
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,710
Have a seat, please.

423
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,375
By virtue of
our previous relationship,

424
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,771
I have an offer for you...

425
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,174
An only payment.
Fifty million dollars.

426
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:23,137
In return, we'll be in peace
and safe and sound.

427
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,474
No more payments,
no more commitment.

428
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,452
No communication.

429
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,579
A total break-up.

430
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,625
Yeah.

431
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,154
Accepting any kind of break-up
from you would mean

432
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,658
you can partner up
with any other cartel.

433
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:48,371
Or you could export
the meth yourself
into America.

434
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,416
That means,
you'd be the competition.

435
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,644
My offer's a big one.

436
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:58,255
No. You know pretty well
what the cartel wants:

437
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,858
employees.

438
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,635
Talking of something else
would be wasting our time.

439
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:09,684
The way you're putting it,
it's hard to negotiate.

440
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,729
There's no negotiation
to make here.

441
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,315
It's a question of deciding.
No shades of gray here...

442
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,709
It's either yes or no.

443
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,054
You've something
that belongs to me.

444
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,701
Yeah, here it is.

445
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:34,952
Glove compartment.

446
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,110
Figure I better teach you
how to shoot.

447
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,571
Could be things
are gonna get hairy.

448
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,048
See. what is this?

449
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,327
Slow down, bro,
'cause I don't get it.

450
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,329
First you give me a gun
and tell me to pay attention,

451
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,623
'cause I may have
to kill someone.

452
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,668
Now you're giving me
shooting lessons

453
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,711
At least I deserve
an explanation, don't you think?

454
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,772
Am I part of a team or what?

455
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,526
And apart from all that

456
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,970
Gustavo comes and tells me
he sees something in me.

457
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,682
What is it
that he sees in me?

458
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,976
If I had to put it in a word
I'd guess it's "loyalty".

459
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,104
- Loyalty?
- Yeah, only maybe...

460
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,373
you got it for the wrong guy.

461
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,808
Jose?

462
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,100
Nice to see you around here.

463
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,878
- It's a miracle!
- What else?

464
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,713
Yeah, I've been
working hard.

465
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,188
Sure.

466
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,066
So, how's everything going?

467
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,736
It's all fine.

468
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,488
Good.

469
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,766
Well, we're inside.
If you wanna join us...

470
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:58,118
you're welcome.

471
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,369
Okay.

472
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,463
We can't change the past?

473
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,298
In life, what's done...

474
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,634
is done.

475
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,803
It's no use to be

476
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,248
our own judges
and executioners.

477
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:24,587
It just ensures we're going
to repeat the cycle.

478
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,272
It's no use to tell yourself,

479
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,359
"I'm hopeless, useless,

480
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,778
I won't be able to make it".

481
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,822
Those burdens

482
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,533
are totally worthless.

483
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,478
Well, who wants
to share something with us?

484
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,163
How about you, Jose?

485
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,899
Tell us what's been
going on lately.

486
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,921
Well...

487
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,172
I went back to meth.

488
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,467
I'm using it again.

489
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,095
But, are you sober right now?

490
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,765
Yeah.

491
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,060
For four days.

492
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,769
I should get a medal?

493
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,132
Well, four days
is four days.

494
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:14,094
You're finally here,
and that's what matters.

495
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,779
Are you still working?

496
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,658
How's that doing?

497
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,246
Sucks ass.

498
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,582
Sounds goos.

499
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:30,110
Is there anything special
you want to talk about?

500
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,381
Well...

501
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:42,431
A couple of weeks ago

502
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,682
I killed a dog.

503
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,047
How come? You hit him
with the car or something?

504
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,775
No.

505
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,068
I put him down.

506
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,514
I watched him go
as he was looking into my eye.

507
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:06,080
The poor thing didn't...

508
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,898
He didn't know,
he didn't understand.

509
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:14,171
He was just scared...

510
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,636
And then he was gone.

511
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,597
But was he suffering?

512
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,417
Sometimes you just have to
be merciful.

513
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,062
No.

514
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,855
No, the dog wasn't sick.

515
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,026
He was just...

516
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,199
He was a troubled dog.

517
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,560
What did he do?
Did he bite someone?

518
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,750
No, the dog never bit anyone.

519
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:57,447
If you give in to temptation,
you end up crossing
to the dark side.

520
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,549
And there's no way back.

521
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,911
No, I wasn't tempted
to kill the dog.

522
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,954
So, what's the matter?
Why did you kill him?

523
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,331
- Hey, Ursula.
- Why?

524
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,667
Maybe it's not the details
that matter,

525
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,503
how the dog died.
Maybe...

526
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,356
the important thing here is...

527
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,718
How do you feel about
what you did, Jose?

528
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:21,055
- I don't know.
- Who cares how he feels?

529
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,848
- Who cares?
- Hey, Ursula.

530
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,102
What kind of a person
kills a dog for no reason?

531
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,437
- Ursula, please.
- No, you take it

532
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,664
to a shelter...

533
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,333
Give it for adoption.

534
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,154
You just don't sit there
and talk about killing him.

535
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,907
Relax, Ursula. We're not here
to sit in judgment.

536
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,092
Why not?

537
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:45,179
Seriously, why not?

538
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,973
Maybe she's right.

539
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,833
Maybe I should've done
something different.

540
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,229
You know what the thing is?

541
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,107
If you just do bad stuff

542
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,734
and nothing happens,

543
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,863
then what's the point?

544
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,573
What's the point there?

545
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,146
I understand
we're all here...

546
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,065
to get to know
and accept ourselves, right?

547
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,859
Well, Jose, we do understand
how you're feeling,

548
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,070
but beating the hell
out of yourself
is useless.

549
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,838
No, so what shall I do?

550
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:23,617
I just stop judging
and start accepting myself?

551
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,719
That's a good start.

552
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,289
So it doesn't matter
what you do?

553
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,974
I just have to feel happy

554
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,627
because I'm a good person
down deep?

555
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,173
I can kill the dogs I want
and just keep a record...

556
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,234
I accepted it.

557
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,302
Camilo, you killed
your own daughter.

558
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,763
You knocked her down!
So what? You're accepting it?
That's it? Bullshit!

559
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:48,142
Hang on a sec, Jose.
They're two different things.

560
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,021
You know what?
Let me finish.

561
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:55,291
You wanna know why I'm here?

562
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,571
I'm here to sell you all
some meth.

563
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,783
You're nothing to me
but potential customers!

564
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,011
And you, Camilo.

565
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:11,289
I used you, bro.
I made you my bitch.

566
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,959
You okay with that?
Are you accepting it as usual?

567
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,603
Sure, right?

568
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,188
No.

569
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,024
I'm not accepting it.

570
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,469
About time, bro.
About time.

571
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,675
Jose!

572
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,636
Jose.

573
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,055
Bring me the torch, please.

574
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,890
I need some light in here.

575
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,892
I think it's full of residue,
but I can't see it.

576
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,270
- That way.
- Where?

577
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,871
On the bottom.

578
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,497
Down there, lower.

579
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,108
- Here?
- Get down, man.

580
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,650
- There?
- Jose.

581
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,711
It's been a week

582
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,323
and I haven't heard from him.
What's going on?

583
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,634
I haven't seen him, bro.

584
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,037
Yeah, I can't see
anything strange here either.

585
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,763
I guess it's already clean.

586
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,481
That...

587
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,926
Look who's coming.
Gómez.

588
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,219
- Congratulate him.
- How come?

589
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,470
He got promoted,
now he's...

590
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,738
a doorman.

591
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:52,991
It's unbelievable...

592
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,951
to miss one of those guys?

593
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:57,646
- María.
- Hi. Nice to see you, Gómez.

594
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,373
Welcome, bro!

595
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,565
Thanks.
How's it going?

596
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,651
- Real fine.
- Good.

597
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,487
No, honey, I'll take it up
with Gómez from here.

598
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,864
Really? Take this.
Come this way, for support.

599
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,533
No, no, no. No touching.
No touching.

600
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,802
He's a real fox, you know.

601
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,997
He may end up touching up
the disabled.

602
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,598
Bye, love.

603
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,083
Take care.
Call me if you need anything.

604
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,584
- Sure I will.
- Take care of him.

605
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,086
- Bye, hon, thanks.
- Bye.

606
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,812
You already got the news?

607
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,381
What, Gómez?
Finally got your period?

608
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:27,317
Really?

609
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:31,513
I got promoted. Er...
I'm going for Internal Affairs,

610
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,032
for the whole Latin America.

611
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:39,813
That's great news, bro.
Come here.

612
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,858
Congratulations, bro,
you really deserve that.
You're brave.

613
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,376
Henry, but...

614
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,903
Gómez said you also
have some news for us.

615
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,072
It's more than that.
What I'm going to do...

616
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:51,300
is drop some theories,

617
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,868
and you'll give me
your opinion.

618
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,577
- Okay?
- Okay.

619
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:59,124
I've a friend at the Homicide
Department. Remember Rozo?

620
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,394
He's working on a murder case,

621
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:05,381
a 34 year-old male,
by the name of Guido Bermúdez.

622
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,217
Last month,
this guy was at his apartment,

623
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:12,095
the bell rang,
he opened the door, and bang!
He got shot in the face.

624
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,390
End of story
for Guido Bermúdez.

625
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,867
Now, it may look...

626
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,286
as a case for Homicide.

627
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,021
Yeah, right.
But hang on a minute.

628
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,524
On analyzing
Guido Bermúdez's profile,
I found out the guy...

629
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,693
was a bona fide
chemistry genius.

630
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,571
A strange guy,
weird and extravagant.

631
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,366
He's a vegetarian, a vegan,
his tastes for music...

632
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,259
are quite singular.

633
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:38,121
I'd say the guy's
sort of gay,

634
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:40,957
if you can ever be
"sort of" gay, right?

635
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,172
You know what's
the weirdest thing I found?

636
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,107
Well, this guy

637
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,844
was also the best meth cook
in the whole country.

638
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,905
His specialty product's blue.

639
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,534
Heisenberg!

640
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,660
No, it's not that.

641
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,230
I thought about it,
but then said,
"No, this isn't Heisenberg."

642
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:07,000
He was Heisenberg's former cook.

643
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,337
And he'll take us to Heisenberg.

644
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:13,949
Behold, amidst the weird stuff
we found at the scene,

645
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,658
there's something
that's not matching

646
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,554
Guido Bermúdez's profile.

647
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,971
Pay attention.

648
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,475
This is it.

649
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,088
I searched for this number
on the Internet

650
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,689
and I analyzed it.

651
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,343
Turns out, it's a serial number
for a machine.

652
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,153
So here's...

653
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:39,074
the copies...

654
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,368
Right?

655
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,828
From the catalogues.

656
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,898
Industrial air
filtration system.

657
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,251
High volume.

658
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:51,945
It's called HEPA,
it's an acronym.

659
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,282
It costs around
three hundred thousand dollars.

660
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:58,218
Used by pharmaceutical farms,

661
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,429
food processors...

662
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,305
Or otherwise,

663
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:07,043
to make the biggest meth lab
in Colombia.

664
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,062
Mm-

665
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,632
The filter is manufactured
by an international concern,
Madrigal.

666
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,469
The've a subsidiary
here in Colombia.

667
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,737
I obviously called them,

668
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,781
a very nice woman answered.

669
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,576
One of those pretty voices...

670
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,103
I don't know why
these women love me...

671
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,689
She ended up
helping me a lot.

672
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,666
I started asking questions,

673
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,652
and then told her,
"Help me with this case,
I don't know...

674
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,947
if you know about the filter."
And she suddenly went, "No,

675
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:39,742
well, we shipped one of those
to Bogotá, six months ago."

676
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,803
Guess who signed

677
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,597
the receipt...?

678
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,099
Mr. Guido Bermúdez.

679
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,337
I kept on searching.
I said, "Come on, help me,

680
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:54,674
why don't you look up
who paid for the filter?"

681
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:59,179
So she called me up later
and said, "You know what?
Nobody."

682
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,433
Boss, no one paid
for that filter.

683
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:06,936
I kept on asking.
Called her the next day.

684
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:10,273
Surprise! She wasn't
working there anymore.

685
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,526
I got an answer
from the Legal Department,

686
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,777
was asked to give up
my badge number.
A couple of questions.

687
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,963
I mean, brick wall.

688
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,342
There's something else.

689
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,787
This kind of companies
don't give in information
without a legal warrant.

690
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,664
- If there's no pression...
- What did you find?

691
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:31,794
Madrigal is
an international corporation
based in Madrid, Spain.

692
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,174
They work
with industrial machinery,

693
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,734
they handle chemicals,

694
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,554
they're also
in the construction business,

695
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,641
and they're even investing
in South America.

696
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,977
Among those investments,
they're here in Colombia,

697
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,205
in the fast-food business,

698
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,249
especially in broaster chicken.

699
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,959
Most specifically...

700
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:58,588
in Pollos Hermanos.

701
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,131
Too much coincidence.

702
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,425
Or we're splitting hairs.

703
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:04,702
Both, both.
I back the two theories,

704
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,955
none of us
have no proof

705
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,125
there's a meth lab.
You're right.

706
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,212
The only thing I want
to tell you is something

707
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,299
that's spinning in my head,
I can't sleep because of it.

708
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,551
Well, break it through.
It'll help you sleep.

709
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,195
Tell me one thing, boss.

710
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,933
Guido Bermúdez's a vegetarian,
a vegan, he's obsessed
with the subject...

711
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,852
What the hell
was he doing

712
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:34,149
at a broaster chicken place?
Los Pollos Hermanos?

713
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:37,777
Well, maybe
he had his meeting there.

714
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,046
Who with?

715
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:44,634
With this guy here?

716
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,664
Let's see, what do we know
about this Gustavo Cortés?

717
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,584
Apart from him being
"the police's best friend."

718
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,019
Is he making donations?

719
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:59,257
Boss, this guy has the dough
to finance an operation
like this one.

720
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,193
The guy has connections.

721
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:06,431
All I say is, he may be
the guy we're looking for.

722
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:11,811
With all due respect,
I think it's sort of
a weak argument.

723
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,538
I...

724
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,374
I think that...

725
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,569
We'd have the same suspicion,
wherever he'd gone to.

726
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:23,381
Well, you're right, okay.

727
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:27,285
Gustavo Cortés, meth lab,
Guido, yeah.

728
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,039
It must be the drugs cocktail
I was given in hospital,

729
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,208
it's making me
rave a little.

730
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,418
But I don't want to leave
this place

731
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:40,382
without you taking a look
at my last proof over here.

732
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,025
This glass

733
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,112
has the fingerprints

734
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:50,283
of Mr. Gustavo Cortés.

735
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:54,396
And you know what I found?
Gustavo Cortés' fingerprints

736
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:58,441
were also present
in Guido Bermúdez's crime scene.

737
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,253
I just want to...

738
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,964
I hope you...

739
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,924
also have trouble to sleep.
