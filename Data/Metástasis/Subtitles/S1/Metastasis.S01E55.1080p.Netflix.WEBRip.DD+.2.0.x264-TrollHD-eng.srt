1
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,904
Miss Rebeca, how are you?

2
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,379
Where were you?

3
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,298
Were you out playing?

4
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,782
You were?
Look what I got for you.

5
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,884
Mm-

6
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,720
I know you like it!

7
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,541
- A kiss for your aunt.
- Let's see.

8
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,960
- Beautiful, Valen!
- Another one for daddy.

9
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,129
- Another one for mom.
- Give her a kiss.

10
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,981
That's it!

11
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,025
Beautiful!

12
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,530
Aren't you going to eat that?

13
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,890
- No.
- What do you mean no?

14
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,600
- No, no.
- Are you throwing it away?

15
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,310
No, Walter.
You can't do that.

16
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,313
- No, no, no.
- Maria, look at this.

17
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,815
- No.
- Give yourself into temptation.

18
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,043
No.

19
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,197
What's
up?

20
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,674
What happened?

21
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,576
Your woman is going
to leave you no dessert,

22
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,136
hurry!

23
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,265
No, I'm not really--

24
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,600
I'm not feeling so good.

25
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,295
- You want some coffee?
- No, no, no.

26
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,213
I hope it's not something you
ate.

27
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,731
No, no, I'm fine.

28
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,149
Come on!

29
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,235
We have Pepto.

30
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,054
I'm sorry, I hate
to leave you with--

31
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,513
Don't worry.
I have plenty of help.

32
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,182
And by that, she
means me.

33
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:31,616
No, me.

34
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,160
Let's go.

35
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,495
Thanks a lot, family.

36
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,998
Let's do it again!

37
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,151
Walter, will you give
Valentina to me?

38
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,626
Of course.

39
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,087
Lovely!

40
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,631
She fell asleep!

41
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,367
Why don't we do something
on Thursday?

42
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,910
That sounds
great.

43
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,453
It's just that
Henry,

44
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,538
he's stuck with work
and I can't make him see

45
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:57,684
he can't go on like this...

46
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,379
Are you okay to
drive?

47
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,939
You sure?

48
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,383
- Maria!
- Coming!

49
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,235
Easy now.

50
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,279
Bye!

51
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,937
All
right,

52
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,940
let's get started
on those dishes.

53
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,084
I'll dry. You wash.

54
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,086
No.

55
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,404
Miss Rebeca,
how are you?

56
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,365
Walter,
how you doing?

57
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,549
How are you?

58
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,551
Have a good day.

59
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,640
How's everything?

60
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,750
Europe.
I can't believe it!

61
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,812
That's great!

62
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,314
You knew, right?

63
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,773
Yes.

64
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,191
Did you hear that?

65
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,026
It's just you were

66
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,721
so long in the bathroom
I don't know if you heard.

67
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,556
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

68
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,617
This is great!

69
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,828
Funny how life is.

70
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,146
And, you know,
where they were

71
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,206
three or four months ago.

72
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,442
And now a second Honey Moon
in Europe.

73
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,377
We need to go to Europe.

74
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,962
We could go.

75
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,714
I'm dying to know Paris or...

76
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,216
Rome.

77
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,135
Any city in Europe, really.

78
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,220
Everything's gorgeous there.

79
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:17,039
You know what
though?

80
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,266
I may get fat over there.

81
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,335
Food over there
is delicious.

82
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,771
I'll gain 28 kilos.

83
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,507
Not 30, but some 28 for
sure.

84
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,551
Henry, you okay?
Henry, Henry.

85
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,220
Henry, what's wrong?
Henry!

86
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,448
Henry, you okay?

87
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,117
Are you okay?

88
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,870
What is it, Henry?

89
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,413
Are you okay? Are you okay?

90
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:42,956
Call an ambulance!

91
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,791
You okay, honey?

92
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,251
Just take a breath.

93
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,112
[breathing
heavily]

94
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,174
Relax, relax, I'm here.

95
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,177
Relax. Relax.

96
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,774
Sit down now.

97
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,860
Wait for me.

98
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,071
Lay down a while.

99
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,240
You rest until you feel better.

100
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,201
I'm fine, okay?

101
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,036
I don't know.

102
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,829
I'll make the appointment

103
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,123
for next week.

104
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,042
I think it's strange--

105
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,502
I can't stand these heels.

106
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,820
What second opinion
Maria?

107
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,905
Three hours in the
Emergency Room?

108
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,424
All for nothing?

109
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,593
All they did

110
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,968
was check your heart

111
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,678
to rule out

112
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,056
a heart attack.

113
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,724
Just that.

114
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,851
Listen to me, Henry,

115
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,587
don't be stubborn,
what happened today

116
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,147
was no indigestion, okay?

117
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,342
Maria, it's just work,
I'm stressed out.

118
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,093
I have to ask you one
favor.

119
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,029
Do not tell Cielo, okay?

120
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,698
What? Why?

121
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,158
Just don't.

122
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,827
Do it for me.

123
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,329
Okay.

124
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,789
Where are you going?

125
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,983
Why don't you lay
down?

126
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,127
Jesus!

127
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,761
Morning, guys!

128
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,246
Enrique,
happy birthday!

129
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,039
- Thank you.
- Fine.

130
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,332
- How are you?
- Good morning.

131
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,933
- Hi.

132
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,669
- How's everything?
- Fine.

133
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,563
I was thinking,

134
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,382
why don't we
reorganize the shelves?

135
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,236
I was thinking,

136
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,696
air fresheners

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,406
are high margin, right?

138
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,807
But you can't
see them.

139
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,184
So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display.

140
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,562
The banana one
is the most popular.

141
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,938
- What do you think?
- Whatever.

142
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,856
Speaking of the
business,

143
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,668
Cielo,

144
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,487
you said the story comes
first.

145
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,505
So we can explain our income,

146
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,923
right?

147
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,175
The story is

148
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,745
that we are car wash
owners,

149
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,847
pure and simple.

150
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,249
- Yes.
- Great.

151
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,210
What do successful
car wash owners do?

152
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,672
They buy more car
washes.

153
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,716
You
know?

154
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,610
I don't know, Walter.

155
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,695
Cielo, Cielo.

156
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,597
We have a pile of
money

157
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,074
that we need to wash.

158
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,268
We'll be laundering
that money

159
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,161
for years.

160
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,580
Wouldn't two

161
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,040
be better than one?

162
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,001
There's one on the highway.

163
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,547
I do love that location.

164
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,592
So let's buy it!

165
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,220
I'll think about it.

166
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,247
Why don't we go
and check it out?

167
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,015
Let me think about it.

168
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,793
Think it over
and come back to me.

169
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,596
Angie, I'm
coming.

170
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,698
Come on, honey, to work.

171
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,308
- No, no, no.
- Okay, fine.

172
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,327
Feel well--

173
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,829
Sure, sure

174
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,205
What is it?

175
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,566
What's
this?

176
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,375
Some papers I have to sign

177
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,152
so they don't back up
in the office.

178
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,671
Honey, you are recovering.

179
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,072
- I know.
- So...

180
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,199
you can't be working
all day,

181
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,076
- non stop.
- Fine, honey.

182
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,012
Hi, guys.

183
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,139
Let's bring the other ones.

184
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,900
There, there, there.

185
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,843
Boss, your secretary
says

186
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,554
there may be some
boxes

187
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,614
without a label on them,

188
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,848
we can help you
organize that.

189
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,535
No, no, no, leave that.

190
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,952
Come on, come on. Thank you!

191
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,229
See you. Get
better.

192
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,231
- See you.
- Bye.

193
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,004
Thank you very much!

194
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,007
Have a great day.

195
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,831
A simple car wash with
waxing.

196
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,978
That would be 70,000 pesos.

197
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,255
We have a drop in
quality.

198
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,357
We are at 68%.

199
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,401
And falling.

200
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,570
That is 100.

201
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,948
Here's your change, 30.

202
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,766
I knew there would
be a drop in
quality,

203
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,952
but 68%?

204
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,103
This is not what I
agreed to.

205
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,123
I left a viable operation.

206
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,901
The rest was up to you,
Lidia.

207
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,862
- We need you.
- Here's 30,000.

208
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,006
Please, help us.

209
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,866
I'm asking for a few
days, a week.

210
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,301
Call it a tutorial.

211
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,578
Get the ship back
on course.

212
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,288
We'll make it worth your
while.

213
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,849
Is there anything else

214
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,184
or that's it?

215
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,270
An air freshener, please.

216
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,881
Listen, this is
a complicated
situation.

217
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,215
There are a lot
of moving parts, Walter.

218
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,942
None of which are my concern.

219
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,819
I'm out.

220
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,136
You're putting me
in a box here.

221
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,656
You know what could happen.

222
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,659
Again, none of my concern.

223
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,894
- Please.
- That's 20,000 pesos.

224
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,039
Here's your air freshener.

225
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,648
- Thank you.
- I'm asking you, please!

226
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,400
They'll give you
your car in the back.

227
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,778
There's some complimentary
coffee, if you like.

228
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,379
Thank you.

229
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,240
Thank you,
have a great day.

230
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,012
Who was that?

231
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,513
Don't lie to me,

232
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,164
she looked
suspicious.

233
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,960
She's a former business
associate who wants me to go
back.

234
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,936
And I won't.

235
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,980
Good.

236
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,572
Get out of here. Now.

237
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,115
Excuse me?

238
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,993
Never come back here.

239
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,813
- I just--
- Do you understand me?

240
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,059
Tripa, my man.

241
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,061
I think it's time.

242
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,520
Time for what, man?

243
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,314
To make a drastic decision.

244
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,733
I'll get a pet.

245
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,568
Really?

246
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,403
I have a lot of love to give,

247
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,072
and so

248
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,849
if I have a little creature
to love

249
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,308
and respect
as long as I live,

250
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,061
that will help me
grow as a person.

251
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,329
Man, man, man, man.

252
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,732
What kind of pet
were you thinking?

253
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,944
I can't have a dog,
we have no time,

254
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,570
we are very busy people,
right?

255
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,672
So get a cat, man.

256
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,992
Those bitches practically
take care of themselves.

257
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,243
A cat is very dangerous,
Tripa.

258
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,845
Is it?

259
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,513
It makes you gay, man.

260
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,099
Does it?

261
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
And here I was thinking
that you're gay

262
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
when you have sex
with other men.

263
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,338
No, but you sleep
with other men

264
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,507
once you are
already gay,
right?

265
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,968
But what makes you
become gay

266
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,428
is when you change
your lifestyle.

267
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,238
Like when you get a cat.

268
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,932
Think about
this.

269
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,518
He starts sleeping in his bed
and I sleep in mine,

270
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,228
but then he comes closer,
you see?

271
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,688
And then you end up
cuddling.

272
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,606
What does that
have to do with it?

273
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,627
There's the physical part.

274
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,171
Listen.

275
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,323
You start by stroking
the cat all day

276
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,117
and the hand
turns this way,

277
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,161
and then you can't
straighten that out.

278
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,806
So you start like this,

279
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,750
and then suddenly
it turns the other way around.

280
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,476
Sss!

281
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,504
I hadn't thought--
Uy, no!

282
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,215
Uuuh!
I'm dazzled!

283
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,678
And then,
on the other hand,

284
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,139
there's the spiritual part
as well.

285
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,740
Cats are so elegant,

286
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,727
they give you
that same elegance, man.

287
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,453
And then you start

288
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,232
cleaning after yourself,
pussy.

289
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,026
And when a man
watches after himself

290
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,753
that's because he's gay.

291
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,797
Sure, but...

292
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,010
But think about this.

293
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,513
You know.

294
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,332
Being gay isn't
such a bad deal.

295
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,769
What do you mean?

296
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,731
Do you get along with women?

297
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,984
No, not at all.

298
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,569
There.

299
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,054
You may not get along
with men either,

300
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,114
but at least you'll be

301
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,284
elegant and clean, right?

302
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,952
What does that have to do

303
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:31,664
with getting a pet?

304
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,709
You can take

305
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,837
one of those little bold ones,

306
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,031
they're all skinny
and they look like a chicken.

307
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,217
And there's your pet.

308
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,494
Can't you do that
with a female?

309
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,705
Mm, mm, no, man,
that is so macho.

310
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,016
You are right!

311
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,503
Jose, where are you
going?

312
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,422
Come on, Jose,
don't be a homophobe.

313
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,404
How much longer
do I have to wait?

314
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,801
Hey!

315
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,261
How much longer?

316
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,080
Can you tell Saul,
please?

317
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,454
Stewart.

318
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,457
Stewart!

319
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,044
Man,

320
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,822
you know you can't
smoke that up in here.

321
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,746
Are you messing with me?
Turn it off.

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,460
I know, but Jose Miguel Rosas
is out here,

323
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,314
smoking pot.

324
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,399
Mm-

325
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,261
Rosas, come
on.

326
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,539
Come on.

327
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,957
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

328
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,500
How about that?

329
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,877
I'm kidding about the bong.

330
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,755
Don't be doing that.

331
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,074
Sorry to keep you
on ice out there.

332
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,285
If I'd known it was you,
well...

333
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,994
Francisca.
I've warned her before.

334
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,263
But you know her,

335
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,182
she orders me around.

336
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,142
Thank you, girls.

337
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,311
Barn door open.

338
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,729
Again?

339
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,860
Okay.

340
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,738
So...

341
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,990
how is the maestro?

342
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,310
Things have been quiet
on this end.

343
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,228
I haven't seen
him.

344
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,996
Just as well, probably.

345
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,497
You know...

346
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,608
That whole thing
in the jails--

347
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,027
What happened
to Mario's kids

348
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,129
was too much.

349
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,382
I mean,

350
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,326
when they start
to whack the lawyers,

351
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,428
that's when I draw the line.

352
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,221
That really hurt,

353
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,872
it's a professional hurt,
you see?

354
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,642
I had to draw the line.

355
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,644
You done, Saul?

356
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,356
Yes.

357
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,400
Great.

358
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,051
This goes to Mario's
granddaughter,

359
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,179
and that goes to
Agustin Herrera's
parents.

360
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,805
A total of five million
dollars.

361
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,365
Divided in half,

362
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,409
it's 2 1/2 million each.

363
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,187
It's all in pesos,
you can go through it.

364
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,000
All right.

365
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,337
Hold on a minute.

366
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,838
Who's parents?

367
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,549
Agustin Herrera.

368
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,051
Agustin Herrera,

369
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,995
that's the kid
that's been missing,

370
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,972
right?

371
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,599
It's no longer news.

372
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,019
People forgot about that.

373
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,355
What those folks want

374
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,107
is to know

375
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,926
what happened
to their boy.

376
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,845
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep--

377
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,764
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

378
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,619
Why wake that up?

379
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,358
The other one's
for Mario's granddaughter?

380
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,712
So this is his money?

381
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,173
Mario's.

382
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,674
It's mine.

383
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,576
It's your money.
Okay.

384
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,120
And you're giving it
to Mario's
granddaughter.

385
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,556
It's what Mario wanted.

386
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,518
You've been in touch?

387
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,981
No.

388
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,674
So we're just
talking about charity?

389
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,860
A donation.

390
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,031
Okay, look.

391
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,725
Shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy

392
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,243
like you did with Andrea,

393
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,246
I kinda get it.

394
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,789
I mean, kinda.

395
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,792
Not quite, but kinda.

396
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,962
But this

397
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,156
is a bridge too
far.

398
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,926
I'm sorry to say, kid,

399
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,554
but you're still gonna be

400
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,913
two miracles short of
sainthood.

401
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,459
If you know what I
mean.

402
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,668
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

403
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,087
And my advice
is...

404
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,590
Come on,
already.

405
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,193
Come on!

406
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,928
Mario left one step
ahead

407
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,389
of the boys in
blue,

408
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,990
and you better believe

409
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,060
his family's on the
radar.

410
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,187
A couple million bucks
shows up,

411
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,940
they're gonna snatch
it.

412
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,067
The feds have already
taken

413
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,403
their money
twice.

414
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,114
What are you
you going for a hat
trick?

415
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,825
-God.
-So what?

416
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,301
I'll freaking do it myself.

417
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,303
No, no, no!

418
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,804
I'll do it.

419
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,681
I was thinking out loud.

420
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,141
Enough bullshit, Saul.

421
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,018
Are you gonna do this or not?

422
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,478
Yes, yes, absolutely.

423
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,938
That's what I do.

424
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,898
I live to serve.

425
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,942
Good.

426
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,735
Hey.

427
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,638
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

428
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,973
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

429
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,075
You've looked better.

430
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,036
Just get it done.

431
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,501
Aah!

432
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,932
You know who this is?

433
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,602
Don't hang up on me.

434
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,604
Yes, yes.

435
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,939
There's a problem.

436
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,633
There's five million of them
here in my office.

437
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,278
No.

438
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,180
Don't. Just hold
onto it.

439
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,825
Yes.

440
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,827
Hold onto it.

441
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,272
I'll handle
it.

442
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,207
Yes.

443
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,876
Yes, easy.

444
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,878
I'll handle it.

445
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,591
All right.

446
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,542
What's up?

447
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,681
Déjà vu?

448
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,143
I feel I've lived this before.

449
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,093
You wanna talk me
through this?

450
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,822
What you were thinking?

451
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,659
What you asked Saul to do?

452
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,620
Jose, it's just nonsensical.

453
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:55,209
It's incredible.

454
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,612
You have any explanation
at all?

455
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,947
It's like you said.
It's blood money.

456
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,425
What?

457
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,134
You said it,

458
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,553
it's blood money.

459
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,929
Excuse me? I said that?

460
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,972
Yes.

461
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,542
When I went to collect,
remember?

462
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,604
Don't you remember?

463
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,880
You said we'd see
each other in Hell.

464
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,857
You said it was blood money.

465
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,176
-Yes.
-Okay.

466
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,944
But it was in--

467
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,096
in the heat of the moment,
Jose.

468
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,906
Remember?

469
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,100
It was in the heat
of the moment,

470
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,702
I was trying

471
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,121
to win an argument, all right?

472
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,831
But I may...

473
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,499
I may have acted

474
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,795
a bit childishly.

475
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,714
And I was wrong.

476
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,907
Jose,
this is your money.

477
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,009
You've earned it!

478
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,919
-That boy--
-Agustin Herrera.

479
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,438
He had a name.

480
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,173
Yes, of course,
Agustín.

481
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,567
That is a terrible memory,

482
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,861
no doubt about it.

483
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,697
A tragedy.

484
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,074
That needn't have happened.

485
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,243
But, son...

486
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,621
you need to stop focusing

487
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:17,207
on the darkness behind you.

488
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,544
The past is the past.

489
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,546
It's the past!

490
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,550
Nothing can change

491
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,553
what we've done.

492
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,059
But now that's over.

493
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,229
You're out, and so am I.

494
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,940
That's right.

495
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,443
I'm done.

496
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,263
I've been out
for about a month.

497
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,702
And there is nothing left

498
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,162
for us to do

499
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,997
except to try to live...

500
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,792
ordinary, decent lives.

501
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,795
To have decent lives.

502
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,260
Why Mario's granddaughter?

503
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,581
She needs someone
looking after her.

504
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:17,267
No, man...

505
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:20,003
Mario is capable of looking
after his own granddaughter.

506
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,092
I don't
think so.

507
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,764
I don't think he's
coming back.

508
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,699
What are you saying?

509
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,768
Walter, you doing what
you did--

510
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,870
offing Mario's guys?

511
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,957
If he was out there,

512
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,445
you would have to look
over your shoulder

513
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,031
for the rest of your
life,

514
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,633
and that's not

515
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,511
how you do things.

516
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,096
Actually, you seem

517
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,099
quite at ease.

518
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,477
That means you're not scared

519
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,479
of him coming back.

520
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,316
So I think

521
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:09,027
Mario's dead.

522
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,429
And I think you
know that.

523
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,889
-No, no.
-Yes.

524
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,851
Jose,
I don't know that!

525
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,581
Listen to me.

526
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,584
I did not kill Mario.

527
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,755
The last time that I saw him,

528
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,948
he had his bag--
the one that I brought him--

529
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,717
and he got into his car,

530
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,720
and he drove away.

531
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:39,291
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

532
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,435
He surely is.

533
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,507
And if-- and if
he does come back,

534
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,485
and he doesn't understand

535
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,194
why I had to do what I did...

536
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,572
well, then, that's on me.

537
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,783
We'll settle that.

538
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,076
Jose,

539
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,622
I need you to believe this.

540
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,624
So you're saying...

541
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,527
he's out there,
he's okay.

542
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,195
Wherever he is,
Mario is fine.

543
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,697
Mario--
We both know

544
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,632
that he can take care of himself

545
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,884
just fine.

546
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,454
And he's certainly capable
to provide for his family.

547
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,307
Jose.

548
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,143
Jose, I need you to believe me.

549
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,187
Yeah.

550
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,107
Like you said.

551
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,526
Mario's alive.

552
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,362
Yeah, Mario's alive.

553
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:45,499
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">When are the tests?</font></i>

554
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:49,236
I don't know,
I wrote it down.

555
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,197
Are they going
to prepare you?

556
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,635
A precollege or something?

557
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,428
I don't know.

558
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,472
No? No.

559
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,625
Do you know something
about the exam

560
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,335
that will determine
you getting into college.

561
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,979
Mm-

562
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:10,257
Without that test,
there's nothing.

563
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,026
There's a minimum score,

564
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,178
depending on your major,
did you know that?

565
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,822
Mm-

566
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,199
Junior, your mother is right.

567
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,535
College is very important.

568
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,498
Ay, Henry cancelled.

569
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,752
He's still not feeling well.

570
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,236
-Right?

571
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,197
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

572
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,883
Don't smile.

573
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,300
So you're spared.

574
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,971
I'll be right back.

575
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,057
Mm-

576
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,455
Did you see
my William Blake book?

577
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,307
What?

578
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,209
Complete poetry
by William Blake.

579
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,311
It's a special edition.

580
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,671
It's a nice
edition.

581
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,190
I didn't even know we had that.

582
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,050
I don't know where
it is.

583
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,778
You don't think Junior...

584
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,199
You're kidding, right?

585
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,285
Well, it'll show up.

586
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,430
What's wrong with Henry?

587
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,130
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

588
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,107
He hasn't been to work all week.

589
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,193
No?

590
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,354
Hey, mister.

591
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,925
Can you help me
out?

592
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,680
Spare some
change?

593
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,296
Hey.

594
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,047
Come back.

595
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:45,507
Yeah. You. Come here.

596
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,550
What?

597
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,681
I got something for you.

598
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,850
For me?

599
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,977
Take it. Go ahead.

600
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,838
-All that?
-All that.

601
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,440
Thank you, sir!

602
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,484
That's fine.

603
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,404
Have fun.

604
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,722
Anything you want us to
tell Gomez? He's worried
about you.

605
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,682
Tell him
more work and less worry.

606
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,201
That's Gomez' problem,

607
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,036
he worries so much

608
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,562
-and doesn't do anything.
-Insensitive.

609
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,273
You too,
get back yo work

610
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,234
-They'r working.
-Let's go.

611
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,695
-Walter.
-Hey, guys.

612
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,589
How are you? Good to see you.

613
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,258
Very good.

614
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,967
I'm glad!

615
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,344
How's your wife?

616
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,845
Good.

617
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,622
-And the baby?
-Growing!

618
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,208
-She must be beautiful.
-To work!

619
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:19,851
Sure.

620
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,712
-See you later.
-Bye.

621
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,052
They're good guys,

622
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,987
I like them.

623
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,822
They're great.

624
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,657
How you doing?

625
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,059
How you
feeling?

626
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,477
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

627
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,789
You look better.

628
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,691
Did you get to see a
doctor?

629
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,068
When one of these things
lasts more than three days

630
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,237
you really should
get that checked.

631
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,506
Yeah, no, I did and I'm fine.

632
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,300
It's a virus.

633
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,717
I'm getting better.

634
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,845
Good. Good to hear.

635
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,431
When I heard

636
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,666
you weren't going in
to work, I--

637
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,545
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

638
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,483
Perks of being the boss?

639
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,343
Yeah,
you
know...

640
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,447
What about you?

641
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,433
How's things at the
car wash?

642
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,495
Good. Yeah, really good.

643
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,579
Hey, did you have

644
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,815
any of that potato pure Cielo
made the other day?

645
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,376
I don't know. Ma-- maybe.

646
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,505
No one else got sick,

647
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,699
so you probably shouldn't worry
about it.

648
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,802
That's probably not it.

649
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,055
I don't remember.

650
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,724
Okay.

651
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,086
Cielo will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

652
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,562
She was worried.

653
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:48,023
Sure.

654
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,859
Which reminds me.

655
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,903
I better get back to it.

656
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,516
Henry,
If there's anything

657
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,660
I can do...

658
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,247
Okay.

659
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,816
I'm glad you're
feeling better!

660
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,918
Thanks.

661
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,962
See you.

662
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,372
Henry,
one other thing...

663
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,501
You're gonna
laugh,

664
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,421
but I have to ask you
about this.

665
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,192
I found this on my car.

666
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,844
Believe it or
not.

667
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,513
I mean, it looks
just like
the GPS tracker

668
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,974
that we used on
Gustavo Cortes.

669
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,810
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

670
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,482
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you?

671
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:15,527
You okay?

672
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,140
I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

673
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:24,411
Aagh!

674
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,379
It was you.

675
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,048
All along, it was you!

676
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,450
You son of a
bitch.

677
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,094
Calm down, Henry!

678
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,040
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that
laundry.

679
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,875
That call I got
telling me

680
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,460
Maria was in the
hospital...

681
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,395
that wasn't Rosas.

682
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,897
You had my cell number!

683
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,551
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

684
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,094
You bombed a nursing
home.

685
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,821
Jaisenberg.

686
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,990
¡Heisenberg!

687
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,033
You lying,

688
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,768
two-faced sack
of shit!

689
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,704
A damn hypocrite!

690
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,747
Aagh!

691
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,695
I don't know where this is
coming from,

692
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,006
but just--

693
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,200
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the
jail.

694
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,579
If it's the last thing
I do.

695
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,790
Henry,
just take a breath, okay?

696
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:31,645
Just listen to yourself.

697
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,606
These wild accusations--

698
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,316
they could destroy our family.

699
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,902
family?

700
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,802
You're talking about

701
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:43,056
Like you give a
shit about family!

702
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,907
My cancer is back.

703
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,994
Good.

704
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,980
Rot, you son of a
bitch.

705
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,666
I wanna beat this thing.

706
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,502
I'm back on chemo,

707
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,212
and I am fighting like hell.

708
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,863
"I'm fighting,
I'm fighting".

709
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,882
Shut up!

710
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,885
Shut the fuck up.

711
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,055
Think about it, Henry.

712
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,392
In six months,

713
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,211
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

714
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,524
Don't you lie.

715
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,068
Even if somehow

716
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,719
you were able
to convince anyone

717
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,431
I was capable
of doing these things,

718
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:27,892
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

719
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,703
I'm a dying man

720
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,162
who runs a car wash.

721
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,831
My right hand to God,

722
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,833
that is all that I am.

723
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:46,035
Have Cielo
bring the kids here,

724
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,137
and then we'll talk.

725
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:51,558
That is not going to happen.

726
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,715
I don't know who you
are.

727
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,677
[heavy
breathing]

728
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,554
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

729
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,826
If that's true,

730
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,413
if you don't know who I am...

731
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:19,235
then maybe your best course
would be to tread lightly.
