1
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,599
Yes!
This is Heisenberg's waltz.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,686
Let's dance it
while we can.

3
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,719
Well done, Heisenberg!

4
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,247
Let's give him
a round of applause!

5
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,934
Ahaha!

6
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,535
Heisenberg,

7
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,327
this is just a warning.

8
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,204
We've already told you this.

9
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,750
I hope you're listening.

10
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,875
Haha!

11
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,874
Come on, come on.
Poor Heisenberg.

12
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,686
He should hide very well.

13
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,397
These men are very tough.

14
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,633
The king's wish
is their command.

15
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,285
Hydrogen and oxygen
make a bond and produce...

16
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,224
Do you know what a bond is?

17
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,919
A bond
is a strong force of attraction.

18
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,688
And there are

19
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:18,134
different types of bonds.
There're covalent bonds,
ionic bonds...

20
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,303
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

21
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,907
Chemical bonds

22
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,078
are what make matter be matter.

23
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,980
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

24
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,691
Yes, yes.
Bonds, relationships.
I know it.

25
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,297
Your test says otherwise.

26
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,951
I only needed two points more.
I was close.

27
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,552
Close?

28
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,888
There's no "close" in science.

29
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,583
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

30
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,253
"Close" didn't put men
on the moon.

31
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,549
Two points are meaningless
if you think it through.

32
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,235
I swear I've studied a lot.

33
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,137
A lot.
I really like chemistry.

34
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,932
I think
I have a learning problem.

35
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,451
Sure.

36
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,186
Can you help me
by scoring me higher?

37
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,789
I wasn't born yesterday.

38
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,318
It means the answer is no.
Next time, do it right.

39
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,544
You have to study!

40
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,568
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello, what's up?</font>

43
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,992
José Miguel, this is
the third time I call you.

44
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,955
This is my third message.
What's the matter?

45
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,707
I'll be in this telephone number
15 minutes more. Call me.

46
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,254
That business I asked you
to take care of...

47
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,214
forget about it;
don't do it.

48
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,741
José Miguel!

49
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,522
José Miguel, open the door.
I know you're there.

50
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,065
Hello,
can I help you?

51
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,253
No, thanks.

52
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,114
- Jose!
- Hey, hey, hey!

53
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:31,785
I'm the owner. I really
appreciate if you lower
your voice. Thank you.

54
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,578
I'm sorry.
Are you the owner?

55
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,846
Yes.

56
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,475
So yes, you can help me.

57
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,018
Look...

58
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,480
I very much need to get in

59
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,631
to see the person
who is inside.

60
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,677
If you have a master key,
it would really help me.

61
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,404
Do you have a key?

62
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,265
Yes.
I do have a key.

63
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,644
I understand
you don't trust me.

64
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,816
But it's very important
for me to see him.

65
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,837
So...

66
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,924
And you knocked, right?

67
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,885
You heard me.

68
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,302
And he doesn't open.

69
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,040
Madam,
I'm José Miguel's father.

70
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,479
Are you Mr. Mercado?

71
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
Yes.
Walter Mercado.

72
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,094
I'd be happy
to let you use my phone.

73
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,096
No. I don't want to talk
on the phone with him.

74
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,223
I want to...
let's see.

75
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,768
I'm worried. I'd like to check
on my son's well-being.

76
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,316
I'm going to say this clearly.
I understand you're his father,
and he's your son,

77
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:49,447
but I don't want to be involved.
If he doesn't open,
there's nothing I can do.

78
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,345
What's up, dad?

79
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,890
Thank you.

80
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,017
It's okay.

81
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,192
Walter Mercado...

82
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,429
Mercado?
I mean, I'm Walter Mercado.

83
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,409
You do have a phone.

84
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,396
Those machines are to be
answered if someone calls.

85
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:25,149
Whatever, man.
Don't bother me.
Leave me alone!

86
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,237
What are you doing?
Give me my pipe back!

87
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,655
Don't move,
or I'll break it!

88
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,926
Is that what you've been doing?

89
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,994
That's why you didn't answer.
Fucking junkie!

90
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,663
No, do you know
what I was doing? My homework.

91
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,516
- What homework?

92
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,042
Have you already forgot?
The homework you gave me.

93
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,271
Don't you remember?

94
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,938
Okay!

95
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,092
This homework, pal!
This homework!

96
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,094
Now you remember,
don't you?

97
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,823
Did you...?

98
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,557
You told me
to take care of it.

99
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,492
I meant intimidation.

100
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,645
I told you to scare them
so that they return the money!

101
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,523
Now you don't want
anybody to be killed.

102
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:09,443
- No!
- Too late.
That man is already gone.

103
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:13,280
- God!
I almost forgot.

104
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,285
Take it!
That's your part.

105
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,744
Eight million.
Four thousand dollars.

106
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,872
With all those conversions
you like so much.

107
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,415
I hope you enjoy it,
son of a bitch!

108
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,805
- Jose.
- What?

109
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,616
The gun has all the bullets.

110
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,577
I didn't say I killed someone.

111
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,730
So?
Tell me what happened.

112
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,584
The dude's woman...

113
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,695
The dude's woman
crushed his head

114
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,922
with an ATM machine.

115
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:59,117
- Crushed his--?
- Yes, she crushed his head.

116
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,095
She crushed his head

117
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,289
with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

118
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,642
The sound...

119
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,772
It's still in my ears.

120
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,840
And the blood.
The blood...

121
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,302
There was blood everywhere.
I didn't know
you could bleed so much.

122
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,805
Are you saying
that you didn't kill anyone?

123
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,849
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

124
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,394
No, no, no.
I called the cops, and left.

125
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,312
- Did you call the cops?
- Yes, yes.

126
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,082
And they came very fast.

127
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,666
They took her away.

128
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,711
Walter, that woman was crazy.

129
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,862
I've never seen
someone like that.

130
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,757
She killed him for nothing.

131
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,825
All he did
was calling her "bitch"...

132
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,579
Honestly, I do think
she was a bitch.

133
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,790
Do you think
she may identify you?

134
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,001
Is it possible
that she remembers that
you were in the house?

135
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,337
No, she couldn't identify
her own ass.

136
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,611
She was so zonked.

137
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,262
I've never seen
someone like that.

138
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,407
And the worst part is...

139
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,810
that they had this kid.
They didn't feed him.

140
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,580
I don't understand.

141
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,939
If she was in that condition,
why didn't you stop her?

142
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,125
She had a gun on me!

143
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,737
Yes, yes, Walter.
She had my gun on me!

144
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,634
Say it. I'm good for nothing.

145
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,757
I'm not Tuco or Loco.

146
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,534
I can't run a crew.

147
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,434

151
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,430
- Jose
- What?

152
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,349
Are you going
to get back up on that horse?

153
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,784
What horse?

154
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,996
All I want is to forget.

155
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,438
You take care of it.
It's about time.

156
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,753
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,610
What's up with that?

158
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,512
Jesús Malverde, patron saint
of Mexican drug dealers.

159
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,406
Yes, I know who he is.

160
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,685
All the Mexicans kneel down
and pray to him.

161
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,705
"Please, make me strong

162
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,540
so that I can fuck

163
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,750
one of those gringos,

164
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,711
motherfucker."

165
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,038
I'm just asking
why he is on your desk.

166
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,060
Sun Tzu.

167
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,773
Tzu, who?

168
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,926
Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> The Art of War</font></i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> .</font>

169
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,345

you'll fight without danger

171
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,830
Where's the Colombian?

172
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,874
Agent Henry Navarro.

173
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,612
Here I am!
Like Cantinflas who--

174
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,322
Welcome! How did they
receive you? All right?

175
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,034
Yes.
They've been nice.

176
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,204
Great group of guys
and "gals".

177
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,961
You couldn't have picked
a better time to arrive.

178
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,921
We're about to catch
a cartel.

179
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,757
- Right, Javier?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,523
- Would you like a beer?
- Sure!

181
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,233
- Let's go.
- Let's go

182
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,670
Come on, man.

183
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,468
These motherfuckers...

184
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,972
I used to come here
when I was a boy.

185
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,075
Don't tell me, man.

186
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,726
I spent the days here
shopping around.

187
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,120
What did you shop?

188
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,188
Small things
that fit in my pockets.

189
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,709
Hello.

190
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,295
I'm Heisenberg.

191
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,008
Of course.

192
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,409
You're Jose's friend,
the cook.
Nice to meet you.

193
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,411
Let's go straight
to the point.

194
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,079
- Where's Jose?
- He's busy.

195
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,582
It's okay.
- Yes, it's cool.

196
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,125
- Where's my stuff?
Yes.

197
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,462
What are you doing?
Put it on the cart.

198
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,551
There it is.
You can count it.

199
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,010
Do you want me
to count it here?

200
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,180
I don't know.
We're good people.

201
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,074
That's good pasta.

202
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,662
Grab the bag.

203
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,829
Yes, man.

204
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,833
We're serious people.

205
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:25,652
Yes, we're very respectful.
We work with good people.

206
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,362
We don't want
to get into trouble.

207
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,158
What do you know?
What have you heard?

208
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,183
This cough is killing me.

209
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,337
It's been said that Jose
squashed a dude's head
with an ATM machine.

210
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,800
- Who's saying that?
- Everybody, everywhere.

211
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,528
Yes, man. Look.

212
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:54,055
I don't even need
to ask people to pay me.
People come for me.

213
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,268
Is it true
that he squashed a man's head?

214
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,105
Don't tell anybody
that I say so.

215
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,352
Thank you.
I can do it.

216
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,292
I'm done, madam.

217
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,126
Excuse me, please.

218
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,799
Liliana, bye.

219
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,340
Goodbye, engineer.

220
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,259
Have a nice day.

221
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,681
Yes.

222
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,266
I've completed the form.

223
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,558
Okay.

224
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,730
Okay, Mrs... Blanco.

225
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,089
I'll give it
to Human Resources.

226
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,925
They'll call you.
Have a nice day.

227
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,969
I'd like to highlight
that I've already worked here.

228
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,030
When?

229
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,076
About... four years ago.

230
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,245
I spent about four years here.

231
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,289
At the Accountant Department.

232
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,607
I had to leave
because of family issues.

233
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,959
I can see.

234
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,048
When are you due?

235
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,800
Er... Several months.

236
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,885
Congratulations.

237
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,039
We'll definitely let you know.
Have a nice day.

238
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,142
Is that Ernesto's office?

239
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,562
It's our boss's office.

240
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,588
- Doctor Ernesto Silva.
- Yes.

241
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,799
- Yes, that's it.
- Thanks.

242
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,384
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

243
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,448
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yes, that's it.</font></i>

244
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,992
Madam!

245
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,476
Madam, you can't go in there.
Madam, stop.

246
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,897
Madam, you can't go in there!
Stop.

247
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,500
Madam, you can't be here!

248
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,192
- Doctor, look, she--
- Liliana, it's okay.

249
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,612
- I can't believe it! Hi.
- Hi.

250
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,073
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

251
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,423
Please, come in.

252
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,701
Liliana,
no calls, okay?

253
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,344
Sure, doctor. Okay.

254
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,581
- Sit down right there.
- Thanks.

255
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:40,597
How are you? Boy or girl?
You don't know?

256
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,823
Girl.

257
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,725
Okay!
One of each.

258
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,870
Yes. Yes.

259
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,271
- How did Walter Junior take it?
- Fine.

260
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,709
Walter is a big boy now.

261
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,818
He's in high school.
He's beautiful.

262
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,295
Yes, he has your genes.

263
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,842
Are those your twins?

264
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,120
- Look at them.
- Yes.

265
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,622
Beautiful!
They're really gorgeous.

266
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,667
The worst part
is they know it.

267
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,461
And they use it
perfectly well.

268
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,815
How have you been

269
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,024
dealing with the company?

270
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,152
Very well...

271
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,681
But I still feel
it belongs to my dad.

272
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,895
Your father
was a wonderful man.

273
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,372
Yes, he was.

274
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,167
I'd like to think

275
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,003
that he'd be very proud of me.

276
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,029
- Of course!
- Yes?

277
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,465
Of course he'd be.

278
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,616
Last year
was a wonderful year.

279
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,801
I'm glad.

280
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,013
How's Walter doing?

281
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,890
Fine. Fine.

282
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,000
- Does he still teach?
- Yes.

283
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,645
You tell him I said hello.

284
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,895
Okay. Thanks.

285
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,924
I haven't offered you
something to drink.

286
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,843
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Really?

287
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,695
Actually, I...

288
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,557
- I didn't stop by to say hi.
- So.

289
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,560
I was applying
for the filing clerk job.

290
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,831
Really?

291
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,174
The problem is...

292
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,951
Honestly, you're overqualified
for that job, Cielo.

293
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,456
You were the best
at your department.

294
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,144
This is life.

295
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,813
And the crisis.

296
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:41,592
Yes, but offering
that job to you

297
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,511
would be a mistake
I can't accept.

298
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,893
How about getting
your old job back?

299
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,189
We're expanding.
The whole company is a mess.

300
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,107
The files are impossible
to understand.

301
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,360
I need someone like you,
who will help me
put everything in order.

302
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,503
Really?

303
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,672
Yes.

304
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,092
Sure!

305
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,636
It's perfect.

306
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,514
Okay.

307
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,715
Currently,
this is our territory, isn't it?

308
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,427
Come on, Jose.
Wake up, focus.

309
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,239
Okay, okay. It's okay.

310
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,307
I want to know
what's going on here...

311
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,202
and here.

312
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,644
- That isn't our territory.
- No!

313
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,206
Do you know what's going on?

314
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,732
We aren't selling there
because we lack initiative.

315
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,401
Initiative.
You keep on repeating that.

316
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,445
It's the initiative
over and over again.

317
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,697
Yes!
We need vendors here.

318
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,717
They aren't "vendors", Walter!

319
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,785
They're "dealers."
They're called "dealers."

320
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,412
I don't care
what their name is.
Dealers! Whatever!

321
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,307
We need dealers there!

322
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,726
Those three I met today

323
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,712
should have three sub-dealers
working for them.

324
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,632
Exponential growth.
That's the key here.

325
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:07,220
Which part of "that isn't our
territory" don't you understand?

326
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,472
Do you think we can go there
and that's it?

327
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,309
- That they'll welcome us?
- No, of course not!

328
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,994
But they won't hurt us either.

329
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,621
Yes, sure.

330
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,897
Listen to me.
Don't do anything. Don't.

331
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,774
Wait.
You don't understand.

332
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,945
Rules have changed, Jose.
You're a killer.

333
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,756
What?

334
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,326
A killer.
That's what people say.

335
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,996
Someone bothered you,
and you crushed his skull.

336
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,181
That's not how it happened.

337
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,766
It doesn't matter!

338
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,668
As long as it's our competitors
who believe it, not the police.

339
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,755
Competitors and police.
You're going from bad to worse.

340
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:46,343
Jose, don't you see
how great this is?

341
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,070
Don't you understand?

342
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:51,324
You are like a blowfish.

343
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,615
What?

344
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:57,854
The blowfish is small,
slow, not cunning.

345
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,539
Thank you for the compliment.

346
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,940
- Let me finish.
- Okay.

347
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,319
The blowfish
has a secret weapon

348
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,904
that makes it special:
it seems weak,

349
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,532
but it has something.
What?

350
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,202
I don't know what it is!
I don't even know
what fish that is.

351
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,011
The blowfish puffs up

352
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,790
five or six times
larger than normal. Why?

353
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,853
To be intimidating.

354
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,314
To scare the other fish.

355
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,340
It doesn't matter
if they're aggressive.

356
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,817
Do you understand now?

357
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:32,055
- You're a blowfish!
- I'm a blowfish.

358
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,572
Who messes with the blowfish?

359
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:35,933
- Nobody.
- Nobody!

360
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,286
Exactly!

361
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,079
It's just all an illusion, Jose.

362
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,831
You're a blowfish. Repeat it.

363
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,082
I'm a blowfish.

364
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,483
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm a blowfish.

365
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,610
- Yes, sir. Exactly!
- I'm a blowfish!

366
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,697
As I'm a good blowfish,
I'll puff myself up.

367
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,718
A blowfish!

368
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,856
There are too many men here.

369
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,426
Next time,
bring some girls.

370
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,155
I like watching.

371
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,014
Stop it, Tortuga.
Let's do business.

372
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,491
Calm down.

373
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,075
Hey, you.

374
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,456
What?

375
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,377
Juárez, please.

376
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,446
The newbie
doesn't speak English.

377
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,382
You don't speak English?

378
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,718
You better learn English, boy.

379
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,931
It's the language of love.

380
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,723
At least, of my love.

381
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,351
Do you know what I mean?

382
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,523
I'll teach you.

383
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,987
Let's make a deal.

384
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,936
Look at this.
I want one.

385
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,041
Item number 332L.

386
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,119
Chaps with gold buttons.
I want a pair.

387
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,373
Write it down.
Item number:

388
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,601
342L.

389
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,010
Look at this hat, 5000X;
it's the best.

390
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,238
I want twenty for my team.

391
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,363
Twenty?

392
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,033
It's two thousand each, Tortuga.

393
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,285
You won't pay for them.

394
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,411
You'll get three.

395
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,079
Five!

396
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,664
Five.

397
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,124
Five, or there is no deal.

398
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,874
Okay. Deal.

399
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,154
One is for you.
You must protect from the sun.

400
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,368
Okay, okay.
Stop wasting our time.

401
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,344
When and where is the meeting?

402
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,539
You don't know
how to do business.

403
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,684
I'll kick your ass

404
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,644
if you don't speak clearly.

405
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,254
- What's up?
- Hey, hey, hey. Sit down.

406
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,730
Calm down, Colombian boy.

407
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,653
They call me Tortuga.

408
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,279
Do you know why?

409
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,408
You'll know why.

410
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,409
Because I take my time,

411
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,912
and I'll still defeat the hare.

412
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,958
That reminds me of something.

413
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,294
What?

414
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,155
I saw a pair of crocodile boots
that are beautiful!

415
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,132
You're a son of a bitch.

416
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,380
Henry is doing
great in Mexico.

417
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,524
That's wonderful.

418
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,609
He deserves it.

419
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,051
After all the work
he has done.

420
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,280
Are you going there?

421
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,973
No, without mariachis
and margaritas,
there's no María.

422
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,394
Besides,
it seems it's horrible there.

423
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:10,523
It's a desert full of dust
with nasty men.

424
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,401
He's on an important operation;
very busy.

425
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,236
Yes?
Isn't it dangerous?

426
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,421
It isn't worse than here.

427
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,175
Apparently, it's an office work.

428
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,869
Between us,
that's what I wanted.

429
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:30,501
Hey, speaking of office work,
I got myself a job.

430
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,935
No way!

431
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,880
Who gave you a job
as big as you are?

432
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,065
Thank you.

433
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,944
You know what I mean.

434
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:42,888
Seriously, who gave you a job
in your condition?

435
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,617
Ernesto Silva.

436
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,976
No...
Mr. Grabby-Hands?

437
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:51,105
María.
It only happened once,

438
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,083
in the New Year's Eve party.

439
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,818
He was so drunk,
he could barely talk.

440
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,279
It's okay
if you justify him.

441
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,031
No, María,
he apologized plenty of times.

442
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,909
He's married.
He has a family now.

443
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,872
The last thing he wants
is a sexual harassment lawsuit.
It won't happen again.

444
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,103
Is money that tight?

445
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,301
Cielo,
you know we can always help out.

446
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,970
All you have to do
is tell Henry and me.

447
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,948
Thank you, María.

448
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,932
You know Walter.
He wouldn't accept money.

449
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,661
Speaking of the devil.

450
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,856
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Cielo?</font></i>
- Hello! In the kitchen.

451
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,361
- Hello, María.
- Hello, Walter.

452
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,321
- How're you?
- I'm fine.

453
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:41,739
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.

454
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,201
I'll wash my hands
and be right back.

455
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,308
Don't you dare to tell him!

456
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,103
I wouldn't do that!

457
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,253
Mom, is this cheese
a different brand?

458
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,963
I think so.
But it's the same cheese.

459
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,008
No, it tastes different.
It's not the same.

460
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,361
My dear.

461
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,303
Next time,
you'll go to the market

462
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,222
so that you buy
the brand you prefer.

463
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,325
So we all win, okay?

464
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,184
- Good morning.
- Hello.

465
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,814
Walter, don't you
notice anything?

466
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,837
Honey, is there a funeral today?

467
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,158
A funeral?
Do I look that bad?

468
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,910
No, no, no,
just the opposite.

469
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,345
You look very well.

470
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,097
Mom got a new job.

471
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,602
A job? Why?

472
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,922
Do I need to show you
the bank statements?

473
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,051
It's not
that I don't want you to...

474
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,805
Honey, I'm just thinking
on your condition?

475
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,783
I'm afraid for the baby.

476
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,142
The doctor said I can work
as long as I'm not in pain.

477
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,271
I'm just going to be sitting
in an office.

478
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,774
I'll be better there
than here cooking brownies.

479
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,999
Where?

480
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,502
Construcciones Silva.

481
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,593
What about the welding fumes?

482
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,594
Isn't that why you had to quit?

483
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,997
Yes, they were building
the place then.

484
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,642
They've finished now.

485
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,710
And the office
is a clean and safe place.

486
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,565
Didn't Mr. Silva pass away?

487
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,716
- Yes.
- Who took his place?

488
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,359
Ernesto, his son.

489
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:19,396
Right. I don't want
to be late my first day back.

490
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,648
- Bye, honey.
- Have a nice day.

491
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,832
Bye.

492
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,531
Hello.

493
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,535
You left your cave.

494
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,249
Yes. It's too empty inside.

495
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,834
I'll buy a new television.

496
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,654
I know. It isn't easy
to live without Sesame Street.

497
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,746
What are you doing?
Are you drawing?

498
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,027
Can I see it?

499
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,660
It's really nice!

500
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,663
It looks like...

501
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,334
It's like a tattoo.

502
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,194
- That's the idea.
- Really?

503
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,154
I work part-time
at a tattoo place.

504
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,049
That's great!

505
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,325
It's a really good draw.
I used to draw, too.

506
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,261
Really?

507
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,973
What stopped you?

508
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,310
Things happened.

509
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,066
I suppose you have tattoos.

510
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,512
You don't?
A tattoo artist with no tattoos.

511
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,280
It's a big commitment.

512
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,350
You have to take it
very seriously.

513
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,995
I do have one. Look.

514
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,125
José Miguel Rosas!

515
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,279
Everybody's been talking
about you.

516
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,200
I respect you
for what you did.

517
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:38,971
Well-done.

518
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,303
Okay.

519
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,933
Rosas?

520
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,100
Yes.

521
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,602
I thought your name was Mercado.

522
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,609
I have to go.

523
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,654
Bye.

524
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,486
Tortuga is really earning
his nickname.

525
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,532
Wait.
He'll show up.

526
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,201
As long as he doesn't want
more stuff from the catalogue.

527
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,061
Calm down.

528
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,853
He's a good cop in Colombia.

529
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,190
I'm not so sure.

530
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,900
Compared to us,

531
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,028
Colombian are girls.

532
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:39,304
Okay, okay, calm down.
Is there a problem?

533
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,681
Why don't you speak
face to face?

534
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,909
What's up, man?

535
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:46,078
Calm down. Take it easy.

536
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,420
What's that shit?

537
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,304
There's our man.

538
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,748
- Hey! Come, come, come.
- What's up?

539
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,959
- Look.
- What?

540
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,920
Look over there,
next to the leaves.

541
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,379
- Look.
- Let me see.

542
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,929
- That's our man.
- Didn't I...?

543
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,304
- Come on.
- Let's go.

544
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,569
Look... Look at it.

545
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,784
Look!

546
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,748
Look the end of Tortuga, man!

547
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,026
Step by step.
He ended up here.

548
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,671
What's the matter?

549
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,339
- Poor him!

550
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,492
Poor Tortuga.
Where are you going, Colombian?

551
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,344
I'll get an evidence bag.

552
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:33,002
What is it, Colombian?
You've never seen
a head on a turtle?

553
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,437
Welcome to Mexico, man!

554
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,147
Let's take a picture!

555
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,942
The Colombian feels sick.

556
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,489
Look at it.

557
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,553
Guillermo!

558
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,223
My leg!

559
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,934
No, no.

560
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,817
I can't feel my leg!

561
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,778
No!

562
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,128
The game has changed.

563
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,198
This is our city now,
all right?

564
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,135
Bogotá is our territory now.

565
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,953
We sell where we want to
and when we want to.

566
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,413
Understood?
We're the kings.

567
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,517
Well, I'm the king.

568
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,169
You will be
the princes or princesses.

569
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:58,771
Let's say we're the princes.

570
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,648
No, I want to be a knight

571
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,358
with his sword and armor.

572
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,885
Okay, okay.
Let's begin.

573
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:07,530
We need more people.

574
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,639
We need people on the streets
working for you.

575
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,409
They work for you,

576
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:15,645
and you work for me.
Layered, like a lasagna.

577
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,440
This is called
exponential growth.

578
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:23,112
- Am I clear?
- Clear as water.

579
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,923
Yes. Just one thing, man.

580
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,949
Let's think of a water
clearer than Bogotá river's.

581
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:30,702
Okay. It's all set.
Begin.

582
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,498
Okay. See you.
Let's work.

583
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,852
Okay.

584
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,520
Let's do it.

585
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,511
Ready.
They'll do the job.

586
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,781
We'll be rich!

587
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,768
Pesos, dollars.
You understand me, don't you?

588
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,619
We are not charging enough.

589
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,457
Really?

590
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,191
First,
you monopolize the market.

591
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,295
Then, you raise the price.

592
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,378
Simple economics.

593
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,645
- May I come in?
- Of course.

594
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,148
As if you were
in your company.

595
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,877
You're all set up.

596
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,697
Yes.
The office is beautiful.

597
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,784
It's close to the bathroom.
I don't have to walk far.

598
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,661
Yes, I thought
that would be important.

599
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,515
Yes, thank you.

600
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,127
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

601
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,753
You don't have to thank me.
I need you here.

602
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,731
You need a bib.

603
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,403
This happens

604
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,571
every time I'm with the girls.

605
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,324
Do you have some paper or...?

606
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,075
No, no.

607
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,476
Hey, and Diana?
How is she doing?

608
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,289
We split up a year ago.

609
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,067
I didn't know it.
- Yes. Yes.

610
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,752
I'm sorry.

611
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,278
No, no...
She was...

612
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,406
She's happier now,
and calm.

613
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,881
So am I.

614
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,802
I have some crisis.

615
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,786
We've been together
since high school.

616
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:37,829
- I remember that.
- Yes.

617
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,875
I don't know.
People change.

618
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,606
Well, we're here to work.

619
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,443
And to work hard, right?

620
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,195
I'll see you by the cafeteria.

621
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,362
Yes, sir.

622
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,638
Welcome.
Keep on creating.

623
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,057
- Thanks.
- Take care.

624
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,541
We should have lunch one day

625
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,043
and remember the old times.

626
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,923
Yes, sure. I'd love it.

627
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,673
Okay. See you.

628
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:23,993
Hello.

629
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,415
Hello.

630
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,422
My name is not Jose Mercado.

631
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:41,203
I'm José Miguel Rosas.
I like to be called Jose.

632
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,874
The man you met the other day
isn't my father.

633
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,397
Don't kick me out.

634
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,608
I really like this place.

635
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,806
I don't make it my business
what you do.

636
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,933
But if you're doing
illegal things,

637
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,161
don't do it here, okay?

638
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,622
Okay.

639
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,630
I bought a new television.

640
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,201
- Really?
- Really.

641
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,953
I've hired cable television.
I have all the channels.

642
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,474
Do you want to see it?

643
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,887
I was told the blacks in
this TV were really good.

644
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,197
They're the best.

645
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:47,185
And the sound is even better.
But...

646
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,040
Well, I'll keep it down,

647
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,274
so that neighbors
don't complain.

648
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,321
I don't know why the signal
is taking so long to appear.

649
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,828
When you were a little girl,
didn't you pretend

650
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,624
to have magic and that you
were able to turn on the TV?
