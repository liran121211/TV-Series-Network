1
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,073
More.

2
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,075
Careful, sir.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,660
Hot day like today,

4
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,896
too much oil in the machine
can cause it to blow a gasket.

5
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,206
Look, man.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,315
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

7
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,359
Those who drink
and those who pour.

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,320
Shut up and fill my
glass.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,600
Hey, you two.

10
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,602
I used to be just like you.

11
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:44,979
Worked dirt for the man

12
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,147
till my hands bled.

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,607
But no more.

14
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,818
Do you know why?

15
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,277
Because I learned

16
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,654
that a man can never

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,197
drink his fill

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,225
by waiting in line
for the tap.

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,311
That's
it!

20
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,022
Listen to him.
He can teach you
something!

21
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,583
Boss.

22
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,319
Good to see you,
my friend.

23
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:11,906
And to hear that great
speech of yours.

24
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,492
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

25
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,037
Such a philosopher,
right, Tortuguita?

26
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,668
I keep thinking
I should write a book.

27
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,544
I just need to learn
how to write.

28
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,446
So, what brings you

29
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,598
to this burro's ass hole
of a town?

30
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,450
You'll see.

31
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,993
Can we talk,

32
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:44,104
or do you have
something to deliver?

33
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,748
Lots of time.

34
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,833
Tortuga has his pace.

35
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,318
Tortuga may be slow
out of the gate,

36
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,445
but he always finishes
first.

37
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,282
I like the way you
talk, Tortuga.

38
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,410
You've got
such a way with words.

39
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,621
They just pour
out of your mouth.

40
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,878
They flow like a
waterfall.

41
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:09,421
But that's a talent,
isn't it?

42
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,965
- You think so?
- He!

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,901
Cheers to that!

44
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,101
Did you think I'd
forgotten

45
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,853
- about your birthday?
- My birthday?

46
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,330
Of course not, man.

47
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,357
So bad I came all the way
here

48
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,775
to this burro's ass
hole

49
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,402
to give you your
present.

50
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,964
Present?

51
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,908
No need to go
through the trouble.

52
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,759
Forget it,

53
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,845
I wanted to.

54
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,663
I have it for
you in the back.

55
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,086
- Back there?
- Yes.

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,105
Come.

57
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,619
Follow me. Come.

58
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,955
look, look, look.

59
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,417
Is that my present?

60
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,652
Yes, do you
like it?

61
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,796
A pet.

62
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,742
You won't be able
to take this one

63
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,702
to the park and throw
a ball for it.

64
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,080
It has the same pace
as you.

65
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,250
The pace of the turtle,
which is the best.

66
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,794
This is a very
special animal.

67
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,353
Why is that?

68
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,922
Imagine that its little
head

69
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,381
doesn't fit in its
shell.

70
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,300
- It doesn't?
- No, look.

71
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,403
Look at it.

72
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,310
Boss!
No, let me go!

73
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,786
Let go, let me go!

74
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:51,582
Boss!

75
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,792
Boss, no, let me...!

76
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:32,414
It's alive and kicking.

77
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,568
By the looks of him, he has
no idea how close he came.

78
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:42,116
I'm assuming
Saul doesn't need to know.

79
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,051
Mum's the word.

80
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:48,097
It never happened.

81
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,790
Son of a bitch!

82
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,095

No, no, you're not
back,
get out of here!

87

Cielo.

88
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,302
Just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, ok?

89
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,945
No!

90
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,305

92

Look, this is also my house.

93
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,162
I have every right to be here.

94
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,606
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But Walter,</font>

you made on your own,

97
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,740
It takes two people
to make an agreement, Cielo.

98

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">But come,</font>

No!

101
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,663
No, there's nothing
to talk about!

102
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,473
What I need is that you

103
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,518
get out of my sight now!

104
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,630
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">That's really what you</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">want?</font></i>

105
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,734
Yes.

106
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,736
Walter, Walter!

107
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,964
What's the matter with you?

108
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,425
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,243
I have every right to be
here.

110
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,578
No, this is not your house
anymore.

111
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,497
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

112
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,915
I don't want a
divorce.

113
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,975
Well, that's not up to you!

114
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,921
Cielo, this is all pretty
unfair, and you know it.

115
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,048
Look, Walter, if you don't get
out of here right now

116
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,843
I'll have to make
dramatic decisions.

117
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,095
You kicked me out of
the house,

118
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,055
you're asking me
for a divorce,

119
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,432
and now you're talking about
dramatic decisions?

120
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,326
I'm warning you!

121
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,496
It could be worse for you.

122
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,107
Anything that's worse for
me is worse for both of us.

123
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,126
Please, be reasonable!

124
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,919
No, I'm calling the police,

125
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,946

absolutely everything.

There's the phone.

00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,327
We were called
about a disturbance?

173
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,179
Yes, yes, that was me.

174
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,688
Good afternoon.

175
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,857
You called the cops on Dad?

176
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,599
I came home from work
and he was back.

177
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,100
He had just moved back
into the house.

178
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,478
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen.

179
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,954
Well, there's a couple questions

180
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,456
I need to ask you, ma'am.

181
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,734
- Tell me.
- Did he strike you??

182
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,377
No.

183
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:53,878
Has he ever hit you?

184
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,422
No.

185
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,924
This is not about violence.

186
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,928
This is about trespassing.

187
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:06,333
I asked him to leave
but he wouldn't, that's it.

188
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,794
Let me get this straight.
You're divorced, then?

189
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,089
- Separated.
- Legally separated?

190
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,007
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

191
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,675
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks,

192
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,110
each on their own.

193
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,780
I changed the locks.

194
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,240
Sorry, another question.

195
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:26,645
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

196
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,330
Both of us.

197
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,108
But I need you
to please get him out of here!

198
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,918
Ma'am, we can't arrest a man

199
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,280
just for breaking
into his own house.

200
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,657
Not without a suit
or court order

201
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,300
requiring he stays away.

202
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,870
The baby!
No, calm down,
I'll handle this.

203
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,514
Please, I'm begging you!

204
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,791
Help me get this man
out of here!

205
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,586
Yes, ma'am,
but we need a reason to do that.

206
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,671
Are you sure
he hasn't threatened you

207
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,314
or your children?

208
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,483
No. But having him in the house

209
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,302
is not a good thing.
Trust me.

210
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,154
Officer.

211
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,781
I'm aware that lately

212
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,100
I haven't been
the best father in the world.

213
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,062
But you know, this happens
in every family.

214
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,081
Ma'am,

215
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,609
is there anything
you'd like to tell us privately?

216
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,277
Would you like us
to have a word outside?

217
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,178
No.

218
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:29,015
No, I'm fine right here.

219
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,559
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

220
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,628
If you want him
out of the house,

221
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,813
you'll have to help me.

222
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,856
Something to justify this.

223
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,551
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws or committed a crime

224
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:43,763
that you know of?
Even if it's just a suspicion.

225
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,533
It's my mom's fault!

226
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,436
She won't even talk because
he didn't do anything.

227
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,496
Mom's going crazy, dad!

228
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,814
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

229
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,125
Junior, no, sir.

230
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,711
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

231
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,341
No.

232
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,218
I don't know what to say.

233
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,289
Well, that being the case,
there's no legal basis

234
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,583
for us to remove your
husband from the house.

235
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,101
So if you'll excuse us,

236
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,378
we have other cases
to attend to.

237
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,254
- Reyes.
- Thanks for coming.

238
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,715
At your service.
Let's go.

239
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,175
- Excuse me, sir.
- Please, I'm sorry.

240
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,593
No problem.
Excuse me.

241
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,865
Okay.

242
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,325
Dad!

243
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,045
Ma'am, excuse me.

244
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,407
If you still wish to provide
me any information,

245
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,966
please call me.

246
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,826
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

247
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,396
Mom, I hate you!

248
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,023
You're the worst ever!

249
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,359
Why did you call the police?

250
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,068
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

251
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,488
Junior, come on now.

252
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,307
Don't blame your mother
for this.

253
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,249
I'm so sorry.

254
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,537
Welcome
home.

255
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,070
Come in.

256
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,742
Hey!

257
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,284
You're alive!

258
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,705
Thank you, Lord!

259
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,499
Happy housewarming.

260
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,252
Here is okay?

261
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,070
Interesting decor
in the house.

262
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,798
It's really subtle.

263
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,325
Minimalist, I think
that's what they call it.

264
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,885
Minimalist.

265
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,302
It's the latest trend

266
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,764
in New York and Paris.

267
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,223
So?

268
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,683
How are you doing?

269
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,436
"Talk to Saúl", he he!

270
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,838
So are you still
in all that

271
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,715
"Say No To Drugs,
Say Yes To Life" thing?

272
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,175
- Yes.
- That's real good

273
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,552
because you were missing
in action

274
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,055
and didn't answer
my calls,

275
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,516
so I got
worried.

276
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,769
I thought you'd gone
back to...

277
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,395
You know,
dope.

278
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,899
And that's not good.
You know why?

279
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,400
Why what?
What's not good?

280
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,444
Do heroine.
It's like logical, isn't it?

281
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,963
Of course not.

282
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,464
I don't mean that.

283
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,324
I can tell you're still
not too good.

284
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,159
You realize how
stupid it is

285
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,161
is to ignore the
phone calls

286
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,206
from your counselor,
that's me?

287
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,208
What if I was trying to
warn you

288
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,670
that the police was gonna
kick down your door?

289
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,313
What then?

290
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,841
Why don't you spare me
the sermon?

291
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,176
Sermon?
Sermon, me?

292
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,154
When?

293
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,390
Remember when I
brought up the idea

294
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,308
of you getting back in
touch with your partner?

295
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,187
No, no, no,
wait, easy, easy!

296
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,623
Just calm down.

297
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,483
I'm not suggesting
you to get back to cooking.

298
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,252
Of course not.

299
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,987
I mean, you being in rehab
and all.

300
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,756
I only want you

301
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,467
to convince the master chef

302
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,202
to get back to cooking,
to do his thing.

303
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,556
What's that sigh for?

304
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,224
Alright, whatever.

305
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,585
Ok, you
know what?

306
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,503
I need to be alone,
so please...

307
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,022
Yes, yes, yes, sure thing.

308
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,982
Just one more thing, one more.

309
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,859
Don't give me that face.

310
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,944
Look around.

311
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,012
You invested a lot of money in
buying this house,

312
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,157
and it's empty.

313
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,368
You can't live like this.

314
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,870
Look,

315
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,105
if you get Walter
cooking again,

316
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,415
I swear...

317
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,959
I'll help you improve

318
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:10,839
that Minimalism big time.

319
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,009
I'll make it worth your while.

320
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,761
I'm going, I'm going.

321
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,665
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi, it's Juana.</font></i>

322
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,610
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I'm not able to answer you</font>

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Bye.</font></i>

325
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,603
Boss.

326
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,813
Yes, sir.

327
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,680
Yes, yes,
yes.

328
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,598
No, no,
you can imagine, boss.

329
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,951
Yes, sure.

330
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,562
No, really
happy.

331
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,205
No, no, no.

332
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,192
When have I ever failed
you, boss?

333
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,570
Count me in.
Yes, I appreciate it.

334
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,505
Okay, boss.

335
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,967
See you.

336
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,350
Ha ha!

337
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,169
So you gonna keep me
in suspense or what?

338
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,796
- About what?
- You're not telling?

339
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,314
About what?

340
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,679
I'm being sent to
Mexico again, brother.

341
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,223
- No way!
- Aha!

342
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,450
Nice, brother!

343
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,853
The damn bastard is
going back to Mexico!

344
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,622
To drink tequila, dude!

345
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,415
That's fantastic, brother.

346
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,669
Congratulations!

347
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,379
Great, just great.

348
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,948
Salamancas.

349
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,950
Mr. Héctor.

350
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,499
Welcome, gentlemen.

351
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:37,320
- Gustavo.
- It's a pleasure.

352
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,696
How was your trip?
Any problems?

353
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,298
No, no, no.

354
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,092
The day I have a problem

355
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,785
to get into Colombia
is the day I retire.

356
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:44,929
Perfect.

357
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,246
Well, welcome.
Please, come in.

358
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,441
First of all,

359
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,359
we owe you an apology, Gustavo.

360
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,720
We should have informed you
we were performing
a few actions

361
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,281
here in Bogota.

362
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,390
It's just that
we had no idea

363
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,186
that you were working
with this man...

364
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,896
Heinsenberg,
or whatever.

365
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,748
Is that with an I?

366
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,583
It's with an E and an I.

367
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,736
Gentlemen, let's try
to focus on this again.

368
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:23,033
- There is another matter.
- Let me fill you in.

369
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,993
Mr. Héctor
had a nephew,

370
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,220
Tuco, Tuco Salamanca.

371
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,222
Yes, I know who he was.

372
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,890
He had his area and sold

373
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,517
what little meth you sent him.

374
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,061
We never had a problem.

375
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,048
The thing is that Mr. Héctor
loved him like a son.

376
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,092
When Mr. Héctor
had to come to Colombia because,

377
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,927
well, because that's how it was
decided up there,

378
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,570
he brought him.

379
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,973
And when he was paralyzed,
Tuco took care of him

380
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,866
and took his place.

381
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,243
We could say that Tuco

382
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,869
was our trusty man here.

383
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,398
I thought
I was your trusty man here.

384
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,817
Sure you were,
of course you were.

385
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,961
But I mean at a smaller scale,

386
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,130
a symbolic one.

387
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,382
It's a thing between Mexicans.

388
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,509
It's logical.

389
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,870
The thing is that
I don't know how or why,

390
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,998
this Mr. Heinsenberg,
or Walter Blanco,

391
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,725
became Tuco's supplier

392
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,061
and he betrayed him.

393
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,980
Now we all know what happens

394
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,982
in cases like that, don't we?

395
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,193
Blood must be repaid by blood.

396
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,510
I mean,
we're talking about

397
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,446
personal reasons.

398
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,809
It's about feelings,
not business.

399
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:36,439
It's the same thing
sometimes, Gustavo.

400
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,775
Oscar Luis and Luis Oscar
are Tuco's cousins,

401
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,777
and they want
exact vengeance.

402
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,586
They have the right, don't they?

403
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,656
At least in that,
everyone up there agrees:

404
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,952
the Salamanca family
and the Tapatío Cartel.

405
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,809
Mr. Héctor, gentlemen,

406
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,687
I feel your loss deeply.

407
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,814
Please accept my condolences.

408
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,674
But I must say
I am presently

409
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,027
engaged in big business

410
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,305
with this man
Walter Blanco

411
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,181
and his death
would be inconvenient to me.

412
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,017
We have all
gone through similar situations,

413
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,577
and we know we must

414
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,271
choose the mind
over the heart.

415
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,540
But we need an option from you.

416
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,584
We won't take no for an answer.

417
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,086
All I can tell you right now

418
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,487
is that this situation
must not change

419
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,906
until our business
with Mr. Blanco is done.

420
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:30,509
For now, I need him alive.

421
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,593
Gentlemen,
excuse us for a second.

422
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,117
Look, Gustavo...

423
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,935
I don't tell you how
to cook your chickens,

424
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,578
whether fried or roasted,

425
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,358
so you should leave matters
of my organization to me.

426
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:06,237
We're talking about an
exclusively financial situation,

427
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:11,742
of running a territory
you consider mine.

428
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,829
I've never worked
for anyone else in Mexico.

429
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,790
I'm unconditional
to the Tapatío Cartel.

430
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,376
Yes, yes,
Gustavo.

431
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,711
Your loyalty is not being
questioned here, understand?

432
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,005
But I recommend you
finish your business

433
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,689
with the man quickly.

434
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,425
Or you risk losing the
good graces of the cartel.

435
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,261
My financial interests
are the same as the cartel's.

436
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,555
The things is, Gustavo,
these kinds of things,

437
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,349
we handle them differently
in Mexico.

438
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,076
Family is family?

439
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,395
And being things
as they are,

440
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,812
I can't guarantee
anything

441
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,772
with the boys up
there.

442
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,488
They are not like you
and I, Gustavo.

443
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,397
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi, it's Juana.</font></i>

444
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,217

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">or will answer. Bye.</font></i>

453
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,348
Coming, my love, coming.

454
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,851
I'm sorry, honey.

455
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:29,672
Yes, mommy's here,
mommy's here.

456
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,105
Cielo, want some
help?

457
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,546
It's occupied.
Use the one downstairs.

458
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,775
What do you mean

459
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,677
he did it
against your will?

460
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,154
Was there physical retention

461
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,656
or verbal mistreatment?

462
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,267
No, no, no, no,
not at all, no.

463
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,619
Then what?

464
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,563
Cielo,
I need you

465
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,898
to gather your thoughts,
please.

466
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,401
I told him not to come back,
and he showed right up.

467
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,612
And doesn't want a
divorce.

468
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,490
I had to call the police
and was about to--

469
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,259
About to what?

470
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,304
No, nothing.

471
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,627
Cielo,
I can't advise you properly

472
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,296
if you don't give me
all the facts.

473
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,855
Um?

474
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,315
Understand, I'm bound

475
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,775
by the attorney-client privilege

476
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,843
to keep everything
you tell me confidential.

477
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,138
Everything you tell me
is in absolute secrecy.

478
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,198
I can't tell a soul

479
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,033
unless you authorize me to.

480
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,061
- Even if it's illegal?
- Especially if it's illegal.

481
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:52,373
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

482
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,334
My job is to protect you.

483
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,114
What I'm about to tell
you

484
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,117
might not sound
nice.

485
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,179
That is part of the job, Cielo.

486
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,310
Walter makes meth.

487
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,354
What?

488
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,590
Methamphetamine
s.

489
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:22,052
It's a widely used drug in
Mexico and the United States,

490
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:25,264
and now it's in Colombia.
It's new,

491
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,184
but it's getting
very strong.

492
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,205
Your husband's a drug dealer?

493
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,940
A manufacturer,
technically.

494
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,485
He says he has nothing to do
with the selling business.

495
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,797
They call them cooks.

496
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,574
I looked it up
on the Internet.

497
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,951
This is my advice,
and you should take it.

498
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,845
File for divorce immediately

499
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,372
and sue your husband
to the police.

500
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,873
This is more than enough
because with this

501
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,891
he will get a restraining order

502
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,628
and won't be able to come
near you nor the kids.

503
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,547
No, no, no,
I can't do that.

504
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,089
Do you think
he might put in danger

505
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,842
- you life, something like that?
-No, no, absolutely not, no.

506
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,011
Because if you do,
what we can do...

507
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,613
Well, we can fill out papers

508
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,098
to exchange information
for protection,

509
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,933
and we can also do this
with the Anti-Narcotic area.

510
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,038
No, no, no, I...

511
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,314
I don't want my
son to find out

512
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,857
that his father
is a criminal.

513
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,819
I just...
I can't do that to him.

514
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,239
He will find out
some other way.

515
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,324
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

516
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,217
Maybe not the best way,

517
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,828
but this country
has plenty of cases like this.

518
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:34,016
Walter has lung cancer.

519
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,001
His treatment
bought him some
time,

520
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,103
but the doctors...

521
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,734
What I mean is...

522
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,111
I can't see why

523
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,180
I should lay all
this on my family

524
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,825
when things...

525
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,770
may resolve themselves
on their own

526
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,188
without anyone else
knowing.

527
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,082
Right?

528
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,843
Gentlemen, your order.

529
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,720
Did you ask for all this?

530
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,789
Do you want to kill me with
so much cholesterol or what?

531
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,957
The heart blows up with that
for sure, no!

532
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,542
Come on, eat and stop
fussing, man.

533
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,686
Can I get you anything else?

534
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,504
No, honey,
not for now, thank you.

535
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,523
Okay, excuse me then.

536
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,982
Very nice.

537
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,609
Let me ask you.

538
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,763
When a woman tells you
"anything else",

539
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,181
will she give you
something else or not?

540
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,643
- Should I call her?
No, no, no, no.

541
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,228
If I eat that
I won't be able
to sleep tonight.

542
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,022
Come on, relax,
grandpa.

543
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,166
When are you going to Mexico?

544
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,377
In two seeks.

545
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,754
Two weeks?

546
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,296
Hey!

547
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,925
Congratulations, brother!

548
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,202
Straight to action,
just how you like it, man!

549
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,973
Cheers!

550
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,353
I have to take a leak.

551
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,875
Those two guys over there...

552
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,339
are double-crossing.

553
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,049
Come on.

554
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,301
Stop being paranoid, man.

555
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,303
Trust me.

556
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,264
They were double-crossing.

557
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,860
What are you doing?

558
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:33,262
Calling the police in this
area, see what happens.

559
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,864
Hey, since when

560
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,933
can't we both
handle a couple of guys?

561
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,393
It's called
protocol, sir.

562
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,938
A good education,
you might say.

563
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,873
Let's suppose so.

564
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,457
So what if

565
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,776
they're doing an undercover
operation here?

566
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:51,321
And we're in
the middle of it?
What then?

567
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,383
You know what? Forget it.

568
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,344
Let's just leave.

569
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,889
I invited, you pay.

570
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,756
Thanks for waiting.

571
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,382
I have to take a leak.

572
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,343
You could use a diaper instead.

573
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,437
What have you got there?

574
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,007
- Stop bothering!
- Bothering?

575
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,194
Hey! What's going on
there?

576
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,737
Let him go, let him
go!

577
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:17,033
Hey, show some respect
in my business!

578
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,343
Police!

579
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,695
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hi, it's Juana.</font></i>

580
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,724

586
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,177
There, honey,
we're going, we're going.

587
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,279
Just a second.

588
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:55,273
Yes, yes, yes, honey,
there, there.

589
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,918
Yes, we're leaving.

590
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,253
We're leaving, sweetheart.

591
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,712
Come.

592
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,298
What, what, what?

593
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,258
Let's go, darling.

594
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,386
Come.

595
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,389
Yes, yes, yes.

596
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,575
Cielo.

597
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:17,022
Internal Affairs
is waiting for you.

598
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,124
This is the deal.

599
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,335
We were hanging back,

600
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,338
saw a deal go down.

601
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,298
I went outside to call it in

602
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,491
because there was no signal
outside.

603
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,179
That's when they attacked you.

604
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,185
What I didn't say...

605
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,187
is that you left your gun

606
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:44,967
under the seat
before you went back inside.

607
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:52,532
I've done a terrible thing.

608
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,493
But I did it for a good reason.

609
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,456
I did it for our family.

610
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,500
Cielo...

611
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,544
That is college tuition

612
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,963
for Junior and Valentina.

613
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,340
That is health insurance

614
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,384
for you and the kids.

615
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,263
For Junior's physical therapy.

616
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,249
It's money
for house maintenance,

617
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:19,059
the basic stuff,

618
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:24,340
groceries and gas,
that kind of thing.

619
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,842
But I want you
to know especially

620
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,970
that there's enough money
for the mortgage.

621
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,696
When I'm gone, your salary

622
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:35,117
will not be enough for that.

623
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,270
- Walter--
- No, no, no, let me finish.

624
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,814
Cielo, I didn't steal
that money.

625
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,360
That money
doesn't belong to anyone.

626
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,211
I earned it

627
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,464
doing what I know.

628
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,966
Maybe it's the only thing...

629
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,118
I've achieved
with excellence in my life.

630
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,761
You know?

631
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,788
You picked the wrong
talent.

632
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,083
You'll hurt so many
people.

633
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,144
I know.

634
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:05,897
That's a burden I have to bear.

635
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,274
But that doesn't matter.

636
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,359
None of that makes sense.

637
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:11,887
All the sacrifices that I have
made would be for nothing

638
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,638
if you don't accept
this money.

639
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,495
Don't tell me anything now.

640
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,497
Think about it.

641
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,998
Think about it good,

642
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,942
and tell me
after you come back from work.

643
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:37,346
Didn't you have lunch?

644
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,140
No.

645
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,053
Some coffee?

646
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:21,290
No, this one's
enough, thanks.

647
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,896
Yes.

648
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,153
Alright.

649
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:42,852
- Well, Cielo, I, I...
-No.

650
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:46,356
Will there be anyone
at home?

651
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:51,736
- No.

652
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,417
- Your kids?

653
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:51,836
- No?

654
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,468
Hi!

655
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:40,702
Hi, Cielo, how are you?
Good evening.

656
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:44,347
Hi.

657
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,916
- Hey, Lucho, all good?
- Good.

658
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,060
Hey, honey.

659
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,983
Cielo?

660
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,485
Hi!

661
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,278
How are you?

662
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,056
Can you come with me
to the kitchen for a second?

663
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:13,710
I'm making a feast here.

664
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,170
Listen, I hope you don't mind

665
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,821
I invited Lucho
over for dinner.

666
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,674
You know, as a thank-you

667
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,244
for driving Junior
to school.

668
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,429
Aha.

669
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,374
Cielo,
I just wanna say that...

670
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:30,960
I feel good about our talk
this morning.

671
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:32,754
I'm very thankful
for you giving me a chance

672
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,566
to explain all this.

673
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:39,469
I'm very eager to hear
what you think.

674
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,347
No, no, no, no,
whenever you're ready,

675
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,033
of course.

676
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:47,035
On the contrary.

677
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:57,170
I think what I mean to say...

678
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,240
is that I'm thankful
that you let me be honest.

679
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:05,537
I think we should always,

680
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,593
be honest.

681
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,637
always tell the truth,

682
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,640
no matter what.

683
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,563
I slept with Ernesto.

684
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,489
Guys, dinner is ready.
