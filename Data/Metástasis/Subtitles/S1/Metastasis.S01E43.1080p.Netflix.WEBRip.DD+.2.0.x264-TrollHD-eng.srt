1
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,155
Have you brought your passport?

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,559
This is a private jet,
but the entry is legal.

3
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,952
Yes, it's here.

4
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,164
What's the matter?

5
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:25,610
Will we travel alone?
Aren't we going to take
our escorts?

6
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,153
We don't need them.
Let's go. Let's go.

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,528
Jose, you can do this.

8
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,348
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">You have reached</font>

<font face="monospaceSansSerif">please pick up.</font></i>

14
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,573

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">but Junior is awake</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">and he will notice it.</font></i>

16
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,093
I'll do it on my own.

17
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,331
- Hi, mom.
- My love!

18
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,767
Happy birthday!

19
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,103
Thanks, mom.

20
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,964
I thought you might sleep
through your 16 birthday.

21
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,385
And I thought that moms
would not bother much by now.

22
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,346
That is never going to happen,
my love.

23
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,490
Well, honey.

24
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,144
since it's almost noon,
I think your first
big birthday decision

25
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,230
- is breakfast or lunch.
- Breakfast.

26
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,732
Great!
Can you do me a favor?

27
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,583
I never got the paper.

28
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,778
They must have left it outside,
can you grab it for me?

29
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,404
- Sure.
- Thanks.

30
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,306
Hey! There's no paper here!

31
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,976
Surprise!

32
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,436
Honey, this is a present
from your father and myself.

33
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,248
What do you think?

34
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,316
I really did
a lot of research.

35
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,736
This car just really
stood out to me.

36
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,322
I also picked up the color.
Come, take a look.

37
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,970
Later we'll install the alarm.

38
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,625
That's it now.
Take a look.

39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,796
It's got a ton
of electric features,

40
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:18,425
a solid engine,
a really big one
that makes a lot of noise.

41
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,886
And it's automatic,
so it's easy for you to drive.

42
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,223
And for your music,
it has 'RP4.'

43
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,158
MP4, mom.

44
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,952
Isn't it cool?

45
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,536
'Cool'?

46
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,856
Cool.
Isn't that what you say?

47
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,317
Yes, mom, cool.
Chévere.

48
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,961
You want to take it for a spin?

49
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,655
Why don't we first
have breakfast?

50
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:47,496
Yes, yes. It's not good
to drive on an empty stomach.

51
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,806
Yes, yes.

52
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,432
Come on, my love.

53
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,962
- Yes, Francisca?
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- He's here.</font></i>

54
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,091
Bad idea.
This is a bad idea.

55
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,110
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Hello.</font></i>

56
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,512
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- Saúl, what should I tell him?</font></i>
- Send him in.

57
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,727
Hehe! Mr. Silva!
Come in!

58
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,188
- Nice to meet you. Sit down.
- Thank you.

59
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,737
I'm truly sorry,
but I really

60
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,989
have no idea
what am I doing here.

61
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,366
Does it have something to do
with my creditors?

62
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,410
- Creditors?
- Yes.

63
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,454
Ehm... No.
I'll cut right to the chase.

64
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,598
Please.

65
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,350
I have some bad news.

66
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,254
Lately, that's nothing new
in my life. Believe me.

67
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,147
Your aunt Virginia is dead.

68
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,690
I'm sorry, who?

69
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,525
Your great-aunt.

70
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,595
Virginia.
She lived in Chile.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,389
This happened
some eight years ago,

72
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,142
and you are the only family
she has left.

73
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,370
No. I've never heard of her.

74
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,981
Well, maybe your family
is quite reserved, right?

75
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,943
Now that I think about it,
I do have good news.

76
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,487
Your aunt left you
a sizable state.

77
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,156
- What?
- Yes.

78
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:07,492
This patrimony was frozen
all this time

79
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,537
while they were looking
for an heir.

80
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,597
And now they've found you.

81
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,921
I'm sorry,
but this is quite odd for me.

82
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,548
The Chilean authorities
were tracking her family

83
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,484
and they've found your father,

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,861
but he's dead, right?

85
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,471
Yes, my dad
died a while ago.

86
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,183
That's right.
So you are
the primary beneficiary.

87
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,770
Are you telling me
that I will receive money
from an inheritance?

88
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,773
And do I need
to pay taxes for that?

89
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,109
I'm only asking
because I'm currently

90
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,154
putting in order my
situation
with the National Tax
Agency,

91
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,948
and I like to keep
everything...

92
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,118
- good.
- I understand. Yes.

93
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,788
The Chilean authorities
solved all the problems
related to taxes,

94
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,874
and the Colombian too.
But my fees...

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,128
are also covered.
So you'll receive
a clean amount.

96
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,797
- A net amount
- Okay.

97
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,066
How much are we talking about?

98
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,359
It's...

99
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,570
621,372...

100
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,350
- US Dollars.
- What?

101
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,243
With 33 cents.

102
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,360
God!
I can't believe this.

103
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,510
This way, Mr. Gustavo.

104
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,392
This way, please.

105
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,645
Follow me.

106
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,637
- Gentleman, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

107
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,156
That's nice to hear.

108
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,704
And where's Mr. Eladio?

109
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,998
Let's do the cooking first.

110
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,876
Who's the chemist?

111
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,752
The kid is the chemist.

112
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,283
I don't fucking believe it!
This fucking kid?

113
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:55,202
Are you fucking with me
or what?

114
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,555
Am I laughing?

115
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,791
Well, we've had the pleasure
of meeting each other.

116
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,976
Let's get to work!

117
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,686
Is that okay, Mr. Gustavo?

118
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,084
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

119
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,294
We develop it ourselves here.

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,738
We have all the ingredients
in order to do so.

121
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,327
Gustavo, I really don't know
how to work like this.

122
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,786
I need to work
like we do in Colombia.

123
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,763
What's going on, gentlemen?

124
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,503
Mr. Rosas thought
the phenylacetic acid
would be synthesized
on his arrival.

125
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,423
Any kid with Chemistry
from school can do that.

126
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,217
I won't allow these rookies
to come into my kitchen
and tell me how to do things.

127
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,470
Least of all an escuincle
crying like a baby

128
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,763
who knows nothing
about mixing acid.

129
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,767
Listen, man,
things are quite simple.

130
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,437
If you want to learn
how to do my product,

131
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,606
you are going to have to do it
my own way,
the right way, okay?

132
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,403
You're over your head, cabrón.
You're being disrespectful.

133
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,575
Either you get me what I want
or we won't cook shit.

134
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,827
How long will it take you
to get him what he needs?

135
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,705
I don't know.
Several hours at least.

136
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,432
How can you not know?

137
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,976
We're not going anywhere.

138
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,046
We have all the time
in the world. We can wait.

139
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,591
It'll give us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

140
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,801
Now, let's get to it.
This place is disgusting.

141
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,679
Don't you have
cleaning standards?

142
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,891
The first thing that we'll do
is to clean all the surfaces.

143
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,727
We'll clean
all the work instruments.
Look at this shit!

144
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,646
I'd tell you to clean up
every possible source
of contamination,

145
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,525
like flies and all that,
but it's impossible to do that
in the open air.

146
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,194
We'll make this place
shiny as a new penny.
Only then we cook.

147
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,947
Listen, pinche escuincle,
who the fuck
do you think you are?

148
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,200
"Listen, pinche escuincle,
who the--".

149
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,538
I have no idea what 'pinche'
or 'chingada' means.
I don't know what you're saying.

150
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,083
But you know who I am?
I'm the person your chief
brought in from Colombia

151
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,144
to show you how it's done.

152
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,756
If this is how you run your lab,
I wonder why you're not cooking

153
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,300
but tacos in Tijuana,
or someplace else.

154
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,010
There's still time
for that, though.

155
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,887
If you want to learn
how to do things right,

156
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,974
stop acting
like a soap opera diva
and get to work, alright?

157
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,110
Come on, motherfuckers!
Let's get to work.

158
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,128
Do what he says.

159
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,696
You've heard him.
Let's get to work.

160
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,004
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Walter!</font></i>

166

171
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,846
Come in if you're coming in.

172
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,366
What happened?

173
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,785
What happened to you?

174
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,414
I got into a fight.

175
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,460
A fight?

176
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,086
What do you mean a fight?

177
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,240
Are you going
to talk to me here?

178
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,636
Junior, not now.

179
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,054
Okay.

180
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,625
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling mom.

181
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,435
Don't do that.

182
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,088
Let's talk this out
you and me.

183
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,064
Well, then talk.

184
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,384
Look, I appreciate
that you're concerned,

185
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,613
but I'm fine.

186
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,532
Just don't call your mother.

187
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,200
Why not?

188
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,205
I was gambling.

189
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,442
If you tell your
mother...

190
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,363
I would never,
never hear the end of it.

191
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,591
You know that.

192
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,120
So please,
can we just keep this
between us?

193
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,930
Please.

194
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,932
I don't understand.

195
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,334
How'd you get into a fight?
And with who?

196
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,235
I made a mistake, okay?

197
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,513
And it's my own fault.
I had it coming.

198
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,954
No.

199
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,246
Dad, it's okay.

200
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,081
It's all my fault.

201
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,568
The thing is
I just... I'm sorry.

202
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,461
Dad, it's okay.

203
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,697
- No.
- Calm down.

204
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,802
No, don't cry.

205
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,647
That's it.

206
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,072
Are these the painkillers?

207
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,533
Yes.

208
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,493
When did you take the last one?

209
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,122
Yes, it was...

210
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,585
Around... Ehm...

211
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,088
It's fine.

212
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,972
Junior, Junior.

213
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,810
How was your birthday?

214
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,002
- It was fine.
- Really?

215
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,353
Yes.

216
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,926
- Get some rest.

217
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,982
- Yes.

218
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,026
Yes.

219
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,070
Hey, listen...

220
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,267
The new car?
Did you drive it here?

221
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,494
Yes.

222
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,539
You like it?

223
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,584
Sure. I do.

224
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,085
It drives great.

225
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,698
That's good, Jose.
I'm glad for you.

226
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,678
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,902
The important thing
is that Chemistry
is an exact science.

228
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,780
The numbers must be precise
in order to do everything okay.

229
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,968
Yeah?

230
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,632
That's red
phosphorous.

231
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,161
It's alright.

232
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,914
We need to put in a bit

233
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,709
of potassium permanganate.

234
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,299
Please, put on the masks.

235
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,612
Excuse me.

236
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,059
There you go.

237
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,089
Let's see, pinche escuincle,
if you're as good as you think.

238
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,300
My personal record
is 88 percent.

239
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,844
Many tried to beat me,
but no one could.

240
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,805
Yes! 96 percent!
There you go, fucker!

241
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,161
Well done.

242
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,039
Very well done.

243
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,795
First of many.

244
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,446
- Great!
- What do you mean?

245
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,299
What do I mean?

246
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,618
You're staying
to work with us now.

247
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,960
You belong to the cartel now.

248
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,769
- Hello.
- Good morning.

249
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,707
How are you?

250
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,378
I'm fine, and you?

251
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,753
I'm fine. Yeah.

252
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,573
But your mom
is probably very worried.

253
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,091
No.

254
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,244
It's no problem.
I've talked to her last night.

255
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,970
You did?

256
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,832
I told her
I was staying at Luis'.

257
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,851
I've kept your secret.

258
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,090
So? Are you in pain
this morning?

259
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,467
No, no.
No, I'm perfect.

260
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,071
The thing is that...

261
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,764
I took some painkillers
for the pain

262
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,601
that I had
after the surgery.

263
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,686
Those painkillers
are quite strong

264
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,816
and I've made the mistake
of mixing them with beers...

265
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,002
Bad choice!

266
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,964
Look, I...

267
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,993
I'm really sorry.
Yesterday, I shouldn't have made
you go through everything I did.

268
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,536
- I screwed your birthday!
- No.

269
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,290
- No, you didn't, man.
- Junior.

270
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,226
I'm your father and...

271
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:44,507
Look, I don't want you
to think of me as if--

272
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,760
I don't want that
what happened yesterday--

273
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:48,946
You know?

274
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,596
What do you mean?
I don't get it.

275
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,185
My father died
when I was six years old.

276
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,036
You know that.

277
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,999
He had Huntington's disease.

278
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,211
What's that?

279
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,613
It's a disease that affects
portions of the brain

280
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,882
and muscle control.

281
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,911
Eventually,
after certain amount of time,

282
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,514
it leads to dementia.

283
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,582
It's horrible.
And it's a genetic disease.

284
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,978
And well, my mom...

285
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:25,356
Well, she was dying of distress,

286
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,675
and she was convinced
that I had the same disease.

287
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,387
So they made
several tests on me,

288
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,530
until, finally,

289
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,990
I came up clean.

290
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,617
And the truth is

291
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,022
that when I was
four or five,

292
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,957
my father fell very ill.

293
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,361
He would almost never
leave the hospital.

294
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,239
And I was never allowed
to see him.

295
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,508
And so my mother

296
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,077
would tell me stories
about my father.

297
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,705
She would tell me
all kinds of stories.

298
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,625
I knew about his personality,
how he treated people,

299
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,644
how he dressed.

300
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,090
He loved meat!
Just like you.

301
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:10,051
But the truth is
that when he died

302
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,448
somehow I remembered him

303
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,184
for all those things
that my mother would tell me.

304
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,036
And, deep down,

305
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,689
I think I was pretending.
I was pretending

306
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,485
and I thought that I had lived
all those things.

307
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,613
The only one real
actual memory of my father

308
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,617
it must've been
right before he died.

309
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,411
My mother took me
to the hospital.

310
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,455
And I remember
the smell in the hospital.

311
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,973
It was awful.

312
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,433
The chemicals...

313
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,770
It was...

314
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:48,356
a penetrating smell.

315
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,859
It was as if they used up

316
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,778
every single disinfectant

317
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,532
and cleaning product

318
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,577
so you could forget

319
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,246
they had sick people there.

320
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:07,817
Then, we went into the room
where he was,

321
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,252
and we saw him.

322
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,904
He was lying on the bed,
all twisted up.

323
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,951
And my mom
sat me next to him.

324
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,412
I remember
I was very afraid.

325
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,705
And suddenly,
he looked at me.

326
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,085
But I wasn't sure
the he knew who I was

327
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,671
because it was as if he was
looking into emptiness.

328
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,050
In the meantime,
my mom was trying to talk about
some cheerful stuff,

329
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,260
you know,
to ease up the situation,

330
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,596
but I only remember
his breathing.

331
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,491
It was a rattling sound.

332
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,935
It was as if you were
shaking a maraca.

333
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,999
But anyway...

334
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:52,028
Junior, do you why
I'm telling you this?

335
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,256
No, why?

336
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,992
Because I don't want you
to remember me
like you saw me yesterday.

337
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,872
I don't want that
to be the memory

338
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,291
you have of me
when I'm gone.

339
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,794
Remembering you that way
wouldn't be so bad.

340
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,230
The bad way to remember you

341
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,467
would be the way you've been
this whole last year.

342
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,845
At least last night
you were real.

343
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,493
A real person, you know?

344
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,413
And I prefer you like that,

345
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,540
like real person,

346
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,904
a person that feels,
that cries,

347
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,156
that doesn't hide
what's going on with him,

348
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,008
a person like everybody else.

349
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,304
I prefer you that way, dad.

350
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,604
Bye, dad.

351
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,758
Thank you for
everything.

352
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,177
- I love you so much.
- And I love you too.

353
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,778
Be careful on the way back.

354
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,699
See you.

355
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,266
Walter,

356
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,379
shouldn't you be
some place else right now?

357
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,724
Saúl, you can't come in here
like it's an every day thing.

358
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,769
Every person in Colombia
who watches bad television
recognize your face.

359
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,162
And that's about everybody.

360
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,290
They know that us, the stars,

361
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,067
need to wash our cars
once in a while, right?

362
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,404
Look, I wouldn't have come
if this wasn't important.

363
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,715
What's going on?

364
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,493
Well, I met with this guy,
Ernesto Silva,

365
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,869
just like you told me to.
And now it's a good time

366
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,872
to remember you
this was a bad idea.
A very bad idea.

367
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,349
You said that many times,

368
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,627
and I told you
I preferred that

369
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,295
to going to prison
for tax evasion.

370
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,631
- Let's move on.
- That's fine.

371
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,799
I gave him the money
you told me to.

372
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,610
Great, and what happened?

373
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,389
It's incredible, right?
He believed the story

374
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:28,601
of the great-aunt,
the inheritance and all that.

375
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,437
How naive!
That's the reason why
so many people get cheated on.

376
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,898
Well, that's perfect.
That's what we need.
He bought the story.

377
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:37,943
When you throw people a number
with many zeros on the right,

378
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,404
they are ready to
believe
anything you tell them.

379
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,699
Then what's the problem?
I don't understand.

380
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,368
Well since I'm not so good
as you are,

381
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,786
I decided to track
all his movements.

382
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,709
I wanted to see
if he would do with the
money
what we expected of him,

383
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,336
if he would pay
the Tax Administration.

384
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,171
- Did he pay?
- I have a friend

385
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,173
who knows a guy
who is a hacker.

386
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,525
And he got himself into

387
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,678
the personal banking accounts
of Mr. Silva,

388
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,473
and look what he found
three hours after
receiving the money.

389
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,163
He bought a car?

390
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,357
- A luxury car?
- A brand new luxury car.

391
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,000
He spent a lot of money.

392
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,195
He spent 200,000 dollars
in just this one thing.

393
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,947
Look, I hate to say this
to you,

394
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,033
but I have a moral
obligation
to do so,

395
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,702
and I'm going to do

396
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,970
"I told you so, Cielito."

397
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,144
Where's Ernesto right now?

398
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,393
Yes, it was short interval

399
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,295
that I had
due to a financial situation,

400
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,714
but in a week
I'll be 100 percent again.

401
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,149
Yes, in the same place.

402
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,110
Well, thank you.

403
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,265
Hey, I'm sorry about
this mess,

404
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,225
but I preferred
to bring it all here
and not renting a warehouse.

405
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,786
I understand.

406
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,313
So, how are you?
It's so nice to see you.

407
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,067
Well, I wanted to see
how you were doing.

408
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,460
So, tell me,

409
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,088
how's everything?

410
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,048
I'm perfectly fine, you know?

411
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,660
Some good things
have happened lately.

412
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,663
I think that fate
is trying to teach me
something really
important

413
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:54,913
because some good things
have been happening.

414
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,749
- Well, not good, fantastic!
- Wow!

415
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,502
Yes, in fact, my company
will be back in business soon.

416
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,420
- Really? That's amazing!
- Yes.

417
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,314
And how did that happen?

418
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,901
I received some money

419
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,652
I wasn't expecting.

420
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:10,763
I think that my dad
is helping me from heaven.

421
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,448
Yes, that must be it!

422
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,974
- Yes.

423
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,561
Is that why you have
a brand new luxury car
parked outside?

424
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,856
- Is it?
... yes.

425
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,567
That car is actually
a marketing action.

426
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,528
I wanted to get back
all my clients

427
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,297
and that's a sign of trust.

428
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,799
Sure.

429
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:32,743
- Economic trust.
Yes, I see.

430
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,621
So, and what about
the Tax Administration thing?

431
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,039
- Is it solved?
- It's fine.

432
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,124
It's really going on well,
on the right track.

433
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,001
- Is it?
- Yes.

434
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,462
- Did you pay?
- No.

435
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,841
But I'm waiting
for the right time to do it.

436
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,818
I see, and when is that?

437
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,694
I don't know.

438
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,305
I have other things
to take care of
which are quite important.

439
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,516
I'm trying to get
better advice

440
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,768
to see if they can
lower the interests.

441
00:32:57,894 --> 00:32:59,645
- Do you want more coffee?
- No! No, Ernesto, please.

442
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,665
They won't lower the interests.

443
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,692
You should be thankful
they gave you more time to pay.

444
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,837
You need to pay those taxes.

445
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,197
You have to pay the tickets
that you have,

446
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,758
and stay out of legal trouble.

447
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,343
That must be your priority.

448
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:16,370
No, my priority
is to save my company

449
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,121
and to save the employees
of my company.

450
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,098
That's my priority!

451
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:22,209
But in order to do that
you need to control
your financial situation.

452
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,295
I don't understand why
we are having this
conversation
in this moment.

453
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,883
Our relationship
ended because you wanted to.

454
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,051
I don't understand why now
you're getting involved
in my stuff.

455
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,195
Because this affect us both.

456
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,264
No, no. It doesn't affect
you.
I told you a thousand
times.

457
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,015
You are not going
to get involved in this.

458
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,450
Ernesto!

459
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,312
You have to pay the taxes
by the end of the month.

460
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:45,065
That's what you have to do.
It's quite simple!

461
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,736
- We'll see what we do.
- No, we won't see anything.

462
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,697
My company is affected
by your made-up accounts.

463
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,574
I need to leave this house
convinced that you'll pay.

464
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,326
I think you are out of place
at this particular moment

465
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,470
coming into my house

466
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,372
and getting yourself involved
in my stuff
and talking to me like that.

467
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,499
Cielo, I'm going to ask you
to leave through that door.

468
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,752
Get the hell out of here
and leave me alone!

469
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:12,426
Where do you think
you've got
those 621,372
dollars?

470
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,430
You really think
you have a great-aunt in Chile?

471
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,451
It was you?

472
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,079
He!

473
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:29,795
What do you think?

474
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:30,778
Fucker!

475
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,126
What's this then?

476
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,736
Don't I get to decide
if I want to stay here?

477
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,198
I promise you
that we will all stay
or we will all leave.

478
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,591
Calm down.

479
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,304
Get up.

480
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:26,391
Gustavito!

481
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,252
- Mr. Eladio.
- You look good, cabrón!

482
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,630
Thank you!
You too look wonderful.

483
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,067
Come here.

484
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,943
It's so nice to see you!

485
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,595
I'm glad you finally
came to reason.

486
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,639
I'm sorry what happened
with your friend that
time.

487
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,783
It's forgotten, right?

488
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,451
Of course, Mr. Eladio.

489
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,162
It's been many years.

490
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,830
It's forgotten now.

491
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,941
- Really?
- Of course.

492
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,485
And which one of these fuckers
is the cook?

493
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,945
Let me introduce him
to you.

494
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,448
Jose, this is Mr.
Eladio.

495
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,676
He's your new boss.

496
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:01,969
Nice to meet you.

497
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,014
He's a chemist with no degree.

498
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,957
And what the fuck do
I care?

499
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,585
He's better than you
with your degrees and shit.

500
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,004
Can you believe it,
Gustavito?

501
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,981
Welcome to the family, man.

502
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,941
Don't be shy.

503
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,195
And what's that?

504
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,680
- It's a gift, Mr. Eladio.
- For me?

505
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,116
Of course it's for you!

506
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,685
- Open it.
- And what's this?

507
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,370
Allow me, Mr. Eladio.

508
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,193
Get the fuck out of
here!

509
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,254
How did you get it?

510
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:40,049
It's a token of respect

511
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:43,052
to honor a renewed friendship.

512
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:46,747
Look, guys!
Bring the glasses!
Fuckers.

513
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,541
I wish I didn't
have to share this shit.

514
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,101
Can you believe it?

515
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,963
It's your choice.
It's your bottle.

516
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,008
- Let's share it then.
- Perfect.

517
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:01,737
Look.

518
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,656
Pour it to the guys.

519
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:08,102
And don't you fucking spill
a single drop
or I'll cut your hand off.

520
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,396
- Here, this one's for you.
- No, no. He can't drink.

521
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,874
He's a recovered addict.

522
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,318
He'll cook better
if he stays sober.

523
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,695
- I'm sorry. Help yourself.
- Perfect.

524
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,781
- Let's toast then.
- Of course.

525
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,242
- Well, then, cheers!
- Cheers!

526
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,267
Cheers, cabrones!

527
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,475
Cheers!

528
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,982
It's the nectar from the Gods!

529
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,483
Thank you, Gustavito!

530
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,470
Let's not talk
any more business.

531
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,281
I brought you a present, cabrón.

532
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,265
- And from Colombia too.
- No.

533
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,102
Yes!
Bring out the girls, fuckers!

534
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:03,281
Hi, handsome!
Do you want something?

535
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,117
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

536
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:06,635
Yes, I'm sure.

537
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,612
Pay attention to my guests!

538
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,365
Sebas, serve him!

539
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:34,104
Cheer up, Gustavito,
you're ruining my party.

540
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,081
I'm sorry, Mr. Eladio.

541
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,901
I think I'm just tired
from the trip.

542
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,028
I said I was sorry,
what else do you want me to do?

543
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,005
I did what I had to do.

544
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,547
This is business.

545
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,216
I understand.

546
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,160
I would have done the same
if I were you.

547
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,204
There's no room
for emotions here.
Really, Gustavo.

548
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,973
I know. Mr. Eladio, please.

549
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,625
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Sure!

550
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,835
- Miguel!
- Sir.

551
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,312
Come here!

552
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,424
Show my friend Gustavo
where the bathroom is, please.

553
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,859
Yes, sir.

554
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,219
- Thank you. I'll be back soon.
- Sure.

555
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,512
- Miguel.
- Yes?

556
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,639
- Keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,337
Get in.

558
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,087
Cheer up, man!

559
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,447
You are going
to have a good time in here.

560
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,775
Mr. Eladio!

561
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,361
Juan!

562
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,987
Mr. Eladio!

563
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,915
What's going on?

564
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,150
I don't know,
cabrón.

565
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,847
This is business.

566
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,891
No emotions.

567
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,188
Motherfuckers.

568
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,587
Listen to me!

569
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,090
Mr. Eladio is dead!

570
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,969
The bosses are dead!

571
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,913
There's no one
left to fight for!

572
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:24,017
Fill up your pockets and leave!

573
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:29,631
Or stay here to fight me,
and die!

574
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,447
Hang on. Hang on.

575
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,326
- Hurry up.
- Come on, come on.
