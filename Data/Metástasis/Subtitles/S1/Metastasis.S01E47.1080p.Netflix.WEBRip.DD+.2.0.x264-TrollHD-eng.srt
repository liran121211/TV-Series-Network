1
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,627
Enjoy!

2
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,199
Is everything all right?

3
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,311
- Yes.
- What's that?

4
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,621
It's a number.

5
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:06,042
52.

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,611
It's the years
I'm turning today.

7
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,030
Is it your birthday?
Congratulations!

8
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,590
Thank you.

9
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,700
We offer discounts
for people on their birthday.

10
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,053
No, thanks.

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,164
It's a small discount.
I need your I.D.?

12
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,391
What do you say?

13
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,270
Okay.

14
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,354
You were born in Cartagena.
Are you from the coastal region?
I didn't think you were.

15
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,916
Appearances can be deceptive.

16
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,820
- Do you want more coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

17
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,504
I'll be right back.

18
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:26,914
Thank you

19
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,893
Green like I like it.

20
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,854
Long live uncle Sam!

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,093
I forgot to ask you
for a guide.

22
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,612
It's a shame.

23
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,405
But I'm very intelligent.

24
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,893
I downloaded something
from the Internet.
It's with the toy.

25
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,744
Good.

26
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,996
Take it.

27
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,490
Do you know
what?

28
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,509
Good luck.

29
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,599
Mr Ricardo,
happy birthday.

30
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,204
Thank you.

31
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,421
- Hi.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- How are you doing?</font></i>

32
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,647
How am I doing?

33
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,065
No, how are you doing?

34
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,359
I'm fine.

35
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,152
I'm very well.

36
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,279
Have you seen the news?

37
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,156
Gustavo Cortés was killed.

38
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:39,311
He was blown up
with someone
from a Mexican cartel.

39
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,897
Anti-narcotics agents
don't know what to think.

40
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,195
- Walter, I need to know it.
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">- It's over.</font></i>

41
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,963
We're safe.

42
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,550
Was it you?

43
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,887
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">I won!</font></i>

44
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,274
Let's see, my friends.

45
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,942
You'll eat well.

46
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,654
Eat, eat, eat!

47
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,989
Yes, yes. I'll tell him.

48
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,479
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.

49
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,622
What is it?

50
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,582
Gustavo was killed.

51
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,753
- Dad, are you here?
- Yes. Hi!

52
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,465
- Where are you?
- Here, in the living room.

53
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,525
Hi!

54
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,942
What are you doing, boy?

55
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,778
Dad, did you see the news?

56
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,763
Er, no, no, no.
I was...

57
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,308
Mom, did you tell him
about Mr. Gustavo?

58
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,286
He knows it.

59
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,249
Hi.

60
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,375
Welcome.

61
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,835
Everybody is talking about it.

62
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,154
- Really?
- Did you see something?

63
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,923
No, no.

64
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,618
No. Listen. What matters
is that Henry is fine.

65
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,037
Nobody knows about it,
but uncle Henry

66
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,706
- says it's a drug dealer.
- Really?

67
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,307
It's crazy!

68
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,169
How does he know
he's a drug dealer?

69
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,213
Uncle Henry
was investigating him.

70
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,882
He didn't say it,
but he had his eye on him.

71
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,177
I had lunch with him
in Chicken Brothers and Co.

72
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,847
- Really?
- Henry's friends think

73
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,766
that Mr. Gustavo
was going to kill him.

74
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,495
But somebody got to him first.

75
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,856
It's terrible, isn't it?
Reality is terrible.

76
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,484
- Aunt María--
- It's so sad.

77
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,486
- Aunt María was scared.
- Wait.

78
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,588
Can I help you¡

79
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,031
Listen.
She was very scared.

80
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,949
She didn't want us
to leave the house.

81
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:07,329
But mom said it was time to go,
and it wasn't too dangerous.

82
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,165
Yes, er.
Sure, I see.

83
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,809
Okay.

84
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,935
There were a lot of cops there.

85
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,354
But everything is quieter now.

86
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,048
I'm glad.
I'm really glad.

87
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,317
I'm happy to have you back.

88
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,011
Look, dad.
I think when truth comes out,

89
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,263
- my uncle will be very famous.
- Of course!

90
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,973
Much more famous than now.
He's a super cop.

91
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,700
Exactly! Yes.

92
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,478
Why don't we watch the news
to find out what's going on?

93
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:35,148
Sure. Go ahead.
Turn the TV on.
I'll be right there.

94
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,858
Okay?
I'll say hi to the baby.

95
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,084
Sure.

96
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,720
Hello again.

97
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,138
Hello.

98
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,893
My baby is sleeping.

99
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,148
Hello, pretty girl.

100
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,328
Hey.

101
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,774
I deserve a special greeting
from my family that's back,
don't I?

102
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,958
"Hello."

103
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,946
That's it?
Won't you talk to me?

104
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,469
Cielo...

105
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,680
Aren't you going

106
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,934
to show some kind of... relief?

107
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,545
Some kind of happiness
that I'm alive?

108
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,528
I'm relieved you're alive.

109
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,989
But I'm scared.

110
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,575
Scared of what?

111
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,994
Of you.

112
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,485
Shit!

113
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,902
What happened?
Say it.

114
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,070
- I said it already.
- No, say it.

115
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,740
Say it quietly:
"Gómez, you're an idiot."
Say it.

116
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,950
- Gómez, you're an idiot!
- That's it! That's it!

117
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,912
Let everybody know it.

118
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,012
Say it. Say it.

119
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,472
"It was Gustavo Cortés."

120
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,016
I told you so, didn't I?

121
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,672
This looks like
Guido Bermúdez's drawings.

122
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,049
Look. The structure,
the beams.

123
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,468
Everything!
The stairs are here, too.

124
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,695
Are you sure?

125
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:14,866
Where did they find the bodies?

126
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,827
Over here. Look.

127
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,605
Do we still don't know anything?
Who were they?

128
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,399
Nothing.
According to the coroner,
at these temperatures,

129
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,709
you don't get even the teeth.

130
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,987
Who ever did this
knew what he was doing.

131
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,012
Look at that.

132
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,539
- What?
- Over there. What's that?

133
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,646
Son of a bitch.

134
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,773
Do you know what that is?

135
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,441
That's a camera.

136
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,068
Yes, sir.

137
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,153
Take some pictures.

138
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,706
Be careful with the computer.

139
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,084
There're treasures there.

140
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,948
No, no.
Don't put that face.

141
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,074
I'm not talking
about those treasures.

142
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,509
It isn't pornography.

143
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,805
Show me what you have there.

144
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,933
It's over, son of a bitch!
You're done!

145
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,018
- Calm down!
- Get out of my way, José.

146
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,037
Listen to him, please!

147
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,480
I'm tired of listening
to this asshole.

148
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,623
Mario, listen to him! Please!

149
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,443
Why? You don't have any idea
what this means.

150
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,795
Of course we know.

151
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,323
It means your life
isn't in danger anymore.

152
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,117
It means
nobody will kidnap you

153
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,411
- to make you work as slave.
- Shut up!

154
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,347
Mario... my friend.

155
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,974
If you kill him,

156
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,893
you'll have to kill me, too

157
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,394
What do you have to do with him?

158
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,647
Mario, can I talk?

159
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,066
Whatever differences

160
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,068
you and I had in the past

161
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,153
they won't change.

162
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,597
But right now,
we have to move on.

163
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,784
We've got bigger fish to fry.

164
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,310
- What are you talking about?
- The video cameras.

165
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,579
The video cameras from the lab.

166
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,732
The ones they used to control us
all the time, do you remember?

167
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,234
Those cameras
not only filmed Jose and me.

168
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,295
You were there, too!

169
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,656
We're all screwed up
with those cameras.

170
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,575
Listen to me.
Those video are in a file.

171
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:42,622
We have to get them
before the police does.

172
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,750
Walter, you're the worst thing
I've met in this life.

173
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,894
No, listen to me, Mario.

174
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,604
Those files

175
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,483
have to be in a hard drive.

176
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,027
Where did Gustavo keep them?

177
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,988
In his laptop.

178
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,697
He had it

179
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,449
at the office.

180
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,686
- At Chicken and Brothers Co.
- So?

181
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,872
Let's go there now.

182
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,939
No, there's nothing
we can do there.

183
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,836
I understand.

184
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,782
Okay, thank you
for the information.

185
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,635
I owe you one. Bye.

186
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,456
- What? What happened?
- We're screwed.

187
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,921
I'd say it was my pleasure
to meet you, but I'd be lying.

188
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,230
Mario.

189
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,343
Won't you say anything
about the laptop?

190
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,262
Mario, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

191
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,556
I'm disappearing,
and you should do the same.

192
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,308
- We're running out of time.
- Mario.

193
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,770
Please, tell me
where the laptop is.

194
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,230
Does it matter?
They have it.

195
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,110
- End of story.
- No! Tell me where it is.

196
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,945
Don't even say
that you're considering it.

197
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,994
It's at the office
of the district attorney.

198
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,805
It was labeled and filed.

199
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,142
It's in an evidence room.

200
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,393
Do you know the place?

201
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,336
Can you describe it?
How's the room they have it?

202
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,438
Describe it?

203
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,720
It's a place full of cops.
Don't you think it's enough?

204
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,906
What are you thinking of?

205
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,810
Will you come down from the roof
with a black mask?

206
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,522
What am I doing here
talking with you?

207
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,749
I'm leaving!

208
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,943
Mario, wait.
We have to do something.

209
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,569
I'm doing it.
I'm running away.

210
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,531
No. He's good
in these situations. Seriously.

211
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,383
Give him a chance.

212
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,886
Look, Jose, in this case,

213
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,623
it's the same if the laptop
is in Mars.

214
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:53,544
Evidence rooms
are like bank vaults.

215
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,272
Do you know why?

216
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,107
To keep men like him away.

217
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,801
But different from banks,
those evidence rooms

218
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,762
are watched by policemen
24 hours a day.

219
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,306
There's no way of entering
and taking the laptop.

220
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,825
Who said we have to take it?

221
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,395
We have to destroy
the information contained in it.

222
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,958
So, you want to blow up

223
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,652
- a place full of cops.
- No, no, no.

224
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,404
Aren't you happy
after putting a bomb
at the old people's home?

225
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,616
Those old men
will have nightmares
until their last days.

226
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,344
No, we won't kill anybody.

227
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:30,081
I'm just thinking
of introducing a device.

228
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,917
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

229
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,435
We put it there as evidence.

230
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,713
- Once inside the room...
- What about a magnet?

231
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,340
You want to commit another crime
to introduce a bomb
in the evidence room?

232
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,844
No, I didn't say a bomb.
I said device.

233
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,055
- What about a magnet?
- The idea...

234
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,390
The idea... I don't know.
I may design a device

235
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,727
capable of causing
a small fire.

236
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,063
Don't you think
they're ready for that?

237
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,065
They have a team
to deal with those situations.

238
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,458
Not only to suppress the fire,

239
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,402
but also
to avoid evidence destruction.

240
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,363
Okay.
We'll put a bomb outside.

241
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,866
You'll just ruin
the front of the building.

242
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,534
- Don't be a jerk!
- What about a magnet?

243
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,263
What can you do with a magnet?

244
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,333
I was thinking of those magnets
that make... and boom!

245
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,587
All the information
is destroyed, isn't it?

246
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,655
Giant magnet?

247
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,766
Yes, like those
you find in movies.

248
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,643
Those used to load vehicles
in places like this.

249
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,189
I know they appear on movies,
but they aren't used here.

250
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,249
We're screwed.

251
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,293
I can get you one.

252
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,612
Haven't you say
they aren't used here?

253
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,198
They aren't used
doesn't mean they don't exist.

254
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:49,327
In this corrupt country,
you can get anything.

255
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,955
Specially if it has to do
with scrap from the gringos.

256
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,165
How long will it take you
to get one?

257
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,876
It depends on the money
you're willing to pay.

258
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,316
- Hello.
- Lock the door.

259
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,943
What did we say?
You shouldn't come back here.

260
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,794
Yes, yes.

261
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,530
About things
that'll make you angry, Cielito.

262
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:30,868
I'm here to tell you
that police may contact you.

263
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,678
What?

264
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,373
Let me explain so that you know
what I'm talking about.

265
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,834
No, no. Why would the police
contact me?

266
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,170
They won't contact you.
They may contact you.

267
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,089
There's a possibility.
It's remote, but real.

268
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,443
I need you to be ready.

269
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,512
Ready for what?
What happened?

270
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,932
First thing you have to do
is nothing.

271
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,493
I mean.

272
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,478
"I see nothing.
I hear nothing.

273
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,772
I know nothing.
I speak nothing."

274
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,400
If you do so,
I'll be very proud.

275
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,377
Saúl, tell me what happened.

276
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,297
Well, there's been

277
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,867
a small incident
with your ex boss, Mr. Silva.

278
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,511
Ernesto?

279
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:17,081
We can't say
things have been done wrong.

280
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,101
It was fortuitous

281
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,212
I mean...
How can I say it?

282
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:26,174
I've never thought
something like this may happen.

283
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,611
Is he dead?

284
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,407
Dead? Ernesto? No.

285
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,159
No, no, no. For God's sake!

286
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,269
Just the opposite,
he just woke up.

287
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,748
Woke up?

288
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,085
Cielito.

289
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,200
With an activated load,
it's capable of attracting

290
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,328
- even a big car.
- Okay.

291
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,331
Do you think
what we want to do is possible?

292
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,042
With science progress,
everything is possible.

293
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,878
- The only bad thing--
- Yes, you said it.

294
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,980
It's expensive.

295
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,190
Very expensive!

296
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:10,427
Okay.
Where're we putting it?

297
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,571
I suggest this truck.

298
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,266
It has a motor
to take it everywhere.

299
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,284
What is the container made of?

300
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:23,080
It's aluminum and wood veering.

301
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,276
And the most important thing
is it doesn't have a plate.

302
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,445
Therefore, it's impossible
to track the owner.

303
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,241
Do you want to talk
about concrete numbers?

304
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,452
Let's go to the office,
and do the numbers.

305
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,636
Yes, just one second.

306
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,887
Jose.

307
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,793
I need a favor.
I don't have cash.

308
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,544
My wife had problems
with the tax division.

309
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,091
I have no money.
Can you pay for me,
and I'll pay you back?

310
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,427
- Yes, of course.
- Let's go.

311
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,489
Shall we go, Mario?

312
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,976
If I were you,
I'd take your money,

313
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,286
and leave.

314
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,787
That easy. Right now.

315
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,107
Don't you think
it's going to work?

316
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,917
Are you asking seriously?

317
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,920
Of course, Mario.

318
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,364
This is a job
for three people.

319
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,493
If you don't help us,
it's obvious it won't work.

320
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,702
If you do,
I think we'll succeed.

321
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,930
I'm confident.

322
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,167
Be confident.
This will work out.

323
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,560
Go!

324
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,631
- Ready.
- Okay.

325
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,156
Watches, rings and chains off.

326
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,894
- Hey!
- No, it isn't worth it.

327
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,664
They are non-ferrous.

328
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,648
- Okay.
- It's the same.

329
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,918
And you?

330
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,197
What about that stuff
that young men wear
on the end of their dicks?

331
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,199
If you have it,
take it off now.

332
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,868
Otherwise,
it'll be destroyed.

333
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,137
I don't have one of those.

334
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,122
Why would anybody
wear something like that?

335
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,337
What are you looking at me for?
I don't know!

336
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,896
Stop it!

337
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,607
Leave all kind of weapons, too.

338
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,010
- Guns, knives, machetes.
- In the car.

339
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,263
If you have plates in your body
as a result of an operation,

340
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,823
or artificial hips.

341
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,394
- Is it in the car, too?
- Go on.

342
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,771
Who will have the honor
of turning this on?

343
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,457
Me.

344
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,984
- Okay.
- Where do I stand with this?

345
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,779
Five meters away.
Five or six meters away.
We'll see.

346
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,758
I'll explain it.

347
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,469
You turn it on.

348
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,455
If you need more intensity,
you turn it

349
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,123
- this way.
- Perfect.

350
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:53,230
Ready?

351
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,276
Ready!

352
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,947
Is something going on?

353
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,199
No, not at all.

354
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,908
Approach slowly.

355
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,146
- There?
- No.

356
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,402
No. There, there, there!
It's working!

357
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,695
Is being erased.
It's gone!

358
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,841
Yes!

359
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,426
Great!

360
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,830
How many batteries
does it have?

361
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,307
21 wired in series.

362
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,294
They're about 250 volts,
approximately.

363
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,254
I need 21 more
wired in parallel. Okay?

364
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,047
It's expensive,
but I can do it.

365
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,550
- It's okay. Let's do it.
- Okay.

366
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,010
Everything goes flying
in that evidence room.

367
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,638
It's going to make
one hell of a noise.

368
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,556
There goes
your element of surprise!

369
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,741
It won't matter.

370
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,559
In a minute,
we're out of there.

371
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,437
I love magnets!
Wonderful, Professor!

372
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,224
Hello, how are you?

373
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,809
I'm fine, thanks.

374
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,269
Intensive care?

375
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,754
Straight ahead,
and to the right.

376
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,007
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

377
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,702
- Hello.

378
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,105
I'm a friend of Ernesto Silva.
I wanted to visit him.

379
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,358
If it isn't a good time,
I can come back later.

380
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,235
- Don't worry. I'm done.
- Okay.

381
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:39,362
- Come in.
- Thank you.

382
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,447
If you need me,
I'm down the corridor.

383
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,340
Thank you.

384
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,737
Hello.

385
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,070
Can you hear me?

386
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,031
Yes.

387
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,879
Ernesto... I...

388
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,494
- I...
- Cielo, I won't say a word.

389
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:36,168
I told everybody
it was an accident.

390
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,187
I slipped and fell down.

391
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,820
I have a family.

392
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,659
I have two girls.

393
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,526
I won't open my mouth.
I won't say a word,
I promise.

394
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,047
Don't do anything to me.

395
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,344
I understand it now.

396
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,521
Okay.

397
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,805
They're robbing!

398
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,391
Here, here.

399
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,751
Call the Central Station.
Do it!

400
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,937
They're robbing.

401
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,110
Unplugged the monitor.

402
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,229
Is this distance good?

403
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,924
Yes, yes. It'll work.
Don't worry.

404
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,485
Let's do it.

405
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,451
Seventy five.

406
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,603
What's this?

407
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,460
CARTRIDGES

408
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,426
VOLTAGE REGULATOR

409
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,975
Can you do it fast?
They'll catch us.

410
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,159
Easy, easy.

411
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,161
We have to do it slowly.

412
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,831
One hundred.

413
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,499
One hundred and ten.

414
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,159
It's enough!
Let's go!

415
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,453
No, no, no!
It isn't enough. Calm down.

416
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,599
Two hundred.

417
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,460
- It's the limit.
- Just a little bit more.

418
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,192
Turn this shit off!

419
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,485
Turn it off!

420
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,362
I'm trying!

421
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,936
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying!

422
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,214
Out, out!

423
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,287
No, it was like

424
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,232
getting drunk
and ride a roller coaster.

425
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,750
Shut up!

426
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,236
Mario, what's up?
It worked.

427
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,989
No, it didn't work perfectly.
Where's the truck?

428
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,133
It isn't a problem, Mario.

429
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,468
You've heard the scrap merchant.

430
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,954
The truck isn't traceable.
And neither is the magnet.

431
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,806
Here we are.

432
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,334
Your man
escaped in a motorcycle.

433
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,838
- What if they find prints?
- There're no prints.

434
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,317
Do I have to believe you?

435
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,261
- Take that on faith?
- Yes.

436
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,238
Why?

437
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,906
Because I say so.

438
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,788
07-66 432,

439
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,581
Vallejo, Felipe.

440
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,292
Hammer, undamaged.

441
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,585
In a bag.

442
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,217
32-257,

443
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,385
Cortés, Gustavo.

444
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,095
Personal laptop.

445
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,016
The screen is damaged.

446
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,127
And it's broken
in different parts.

447
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:53,896
Damaged.

448
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,733
In bag.

449
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:03,947
09-32 256,

450
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,991
Cortés, Gustavo.

451
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:09,519
Photo frame
with picture of two men.

452
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,038
The glass is broken.

453
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,581
The picture has moved.

454
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:13,999
The bag is broken

455
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,252
because of the glass.

456
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,380
This isn't in the inventory.

457
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,748
37010412
0004267821

458
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:36,130
First of all,
I'm not a marriage counselor.

459
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,008
Second,
and I'm not taking sides,

460
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,442
It was you

461
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,219
who put her in charge
of your money,

462
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,347
which I advised against,
if you'll recall.

463
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,307
I don't want it to be construed
as "I told you so."

464
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,285
But that's how it is.

465
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,120
I told you so.

466
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:54,523
Let's go to they point.
She came to me

467
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,416
because she had a big problem.

468
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,835
She's been manipulating

469
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:02,447
Ernesto Silva's accountings,
and soon there'd be

470
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,325
an audit
from the Revenue Office,

471
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,619
she thought
she might be caught, too.

472
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:11,640
It's a long chain of mistakes.

473
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,584
What did I do?
"Talk to Walter."

474
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,563
"No."

475
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,424
She wrote a check
to pay her debt.

476
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,678
In my opinion,
she was protecting you.

477
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,266
I'd love if you add something
to the conversation.

478
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,894
Just a little bit.
My mouth is dry.

479
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,580
Did you tell her:

480
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,249
"Speak to Walter?"

481
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,583
Yes, I told her.

482
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,919
"No."

483
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,113
And it didn't come to your mind
contradicting her?

484
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:46,883
I mean, didn't you think

485
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:50,287
of calling Walter
and telling him
what was going on?

486
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,831
I remind you
that you were very busy

487
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,432
trying to save your life

488
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,127
or solving one of those problems
you get involved into.

489
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:00,047
Then you took responsibility
on that matter,

490
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,524
and let her give money

491
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,677
to the man
she was sleeping with.

492
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,571
Walter, she's my client,

493
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,600
just like you,
it's a family group.

494
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,618
There're some confusion times.

495
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,620
But I can assure

496
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,789
that I did everything possible

497
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,442
from an ethical and professional
point of view.

498
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,711
Ethical?

499
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,421
I'm sorry.

500
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:28,366
Have you mentioned
the word "ethical" here?

501
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,552
Stop talking nonsense, Saúl!

502
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:34,748
You're my lawyer,
and you work for me!

503
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,750
Yes, but I never had clients
that make such requests

504
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,560
as difficult as yours.

505
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,980
Speaking of which...

506
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:50,097
What do you think of this?
Your mini-atomic bomb of poison.

507
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:54,184
I put my ass on the line
for you.

508
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,020
We could have been all dead!
Did I complain?

509
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,622
No. Why?

510
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,109
Because I'm a lawyer
who works happy

511
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:05,754
to satisfy his clients requests.

512
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:10,575
It would have been nice
if you told me that the kid,

513
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,331
the son of José's girlfriend
was going to end up in hospital.

514
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:19,417
Now that I think of it,
it was bad.

515
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,062
It was disgusting

516
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,840
and it's far away
from what I can bear.

517
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,758
So, please,
get your chemical weapon,

518
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,611
and take it away from here

519
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,014
because this partnership
is over.

520
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:01,584
This partnership ends
when I say so.

521
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:17,826
Hello.

522
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,371
I heard about Ernesto.

523
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,295
He wont' say a word.

524
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,864
He won't speak. I swear.
He won't say a word.

525
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,467
Good.

526
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,820
I forgive you.
