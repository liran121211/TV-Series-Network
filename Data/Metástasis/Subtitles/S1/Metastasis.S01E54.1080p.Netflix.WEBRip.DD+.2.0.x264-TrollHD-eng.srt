1
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,280
Boss?

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,815
I've already taken care
of the car issue.

3
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,526
Did you make sure
nobody followed you?

4
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,337
Yes, sir.

5
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,864
I stayed off the main streets
so that nobody is suspicious.

6
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,742
Did the old man
make questions?

7
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,678
No, sir.

8
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,788
I told him
what you said to me.

9
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,081
That you needed the same job
that he did on the bus.

10
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,018
And he put his men to work.

11
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,978
They took the car apart.

12
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,717
It's unbelievable
how they do it in a minute.

13
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,930
I've never seen
something like that.

14
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,560
Should we deal
with this other thing now?

15
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,709
Yes.

16
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,711
It's about time.

17
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,098
I don't want to talk about this.

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,851
Sure, sir.

19
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,812
It had to be done.

20
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,855
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,586
What's up?

22
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,715
I need to talk to you.

23
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,758
In private.

24
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,499
What happened?
Did you meet Mario?

25
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,978
Yes.

26
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,563
So.

27
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,547
How is he?
Did he run away?

28
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,108
Mario isn't here anymore.

29
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,111
He's gone.

30
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,613
All right.

31
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,240
I was thinking about this.

32
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,867
We have nine guys in jail.

33
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,410
Don't we?

34
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,561
They have no reason
not to talk now.

35
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,330
What are we going to do?

36
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,791
"We"?

37
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,251
As far as I'm concerned,

38
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,628
I'm the only vote left.

39
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,631
I'll handle it.

40
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,524
Prosecutor,

41
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,526
investigator Navarro.

42
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,028
My client is willing

43
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,614
to collaborate with the case.

44
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,450
He will supply vital information

45
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,078
relating to the production,

46
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,288
distribution and organization

47
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,207
of the criminal enterprise

48
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,026
of methamphetamine
that belongs to Gustavo Cortés.

49
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,419
All right! Wonderful!

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,071
In exchange,
we expect

51
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,382
all charges to be dropped

52
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,326
so that not only
he walks out of here a free man,

53
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,870
but also receives
blanket immunity

54
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,974
as regards this investigation.

55
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,916
You're good, man.
Do you work on stand comedy?

56
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,003
For all the information
he is going to give you,

57
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,272
this deal is fair.

58
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,383
All we can do
is to reduce his charges.

59
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,819
No, no, no, no.

60
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,403
All charges dropped.

61
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,430
We'll drop some charges,
and give him an individual cell.

62
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,075
No, please, gentlemen.

63
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,451
Let's talk seriously.

64
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,911
Okay.

65
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,705
I'm done here.

66
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,647
Where are you going?
Do you want to know?

67
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,692
I'll speak with someone
who tells me new things.

68
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,170
Excuse me.

69
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:19,713
Don't go! Wait!

70
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,531
I have information
that may be of your interest.

71
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,219
Listen.

72
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,679
Are you confused?

73
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,348
It's a supply and demand market.

74
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,666
You offer things,
and I buy them.

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,186
Do you understand?

76
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,961
I have eight other persons
who can talk

77
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,838
and want to talk.
Okay?

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,965
Four of them
are also in this jail.

79
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,401
And do you know what?

80
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,861
I also have the lawyer

81
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,803
who will give me
Mario Arboleda

82
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,555
and all the money.
What do you think?

83
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,825
So calm down.

84
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,327
And enjoy this beautiful resort

85
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:56,148
where you'll spend
the rest of your life.

86
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,210
Excuse me.

87
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,482
Order.

88
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,026
A coffee or something.

89
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,360
I don't want anything to drink.

90
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,862
If you order something,

91
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,989
we'll be less suspicious.

92
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,449
Nobody

93
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,909
will be suspicious.

94
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,786
I'm not thirsty.

95
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,581
Give me the list, please.

96
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,209
What happens?

97
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,668
Come on, Lidia.

98
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,254
We've already talked about it.

99
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,548
You're already here.

100
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,616
You have the list,
don't you?

101
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,094
Yes, I do.

102
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,511
Give it to me.

103
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,931
It's not written down.

104
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,432
Why is that?

105
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,251
It's in my head.
It's safer there.

106
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,378
Then I suggest
you pick up a pen,

107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,772
and write it down.

108
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,067
Not yet.

109
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,736
I think I'm misunderstanding.

110
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,595
I thought
you wanted to take care

111
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,615
of nine guys who are in jail

112
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,933
and who could get us in trouble
if they talk.

113
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,352
With the lawyer,
now they're ten.

114
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,745
Ten. Whatever.

115
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,372
Lidia.

116
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,832
I'm doing this

117
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,084
for mutual benefit.

118
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,152
We don't want
any loose end,

119
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,587
don't we?

120
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,131
Of course.

121
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,699
Specially,
if I'm one of those ends.

122
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,218
The way I see it

123
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,137
is that if give you the list,

124
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,055
and you do what you have to do,

125
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,431
I'll be the only person

126
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,100
who knows too much.

127
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,810
So?

128
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,770
What you're thinking right now

129
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,691
is that you'd give me the list

130
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,109
and the next moment

131
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,403
I'll murder you here.

132
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,179
- No, not here.
- Outside.

133
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,366
You don't see what I'm saying.

134
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,826
No, listen.

135
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,437
You made me swear
on my children's life

136
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,981
that I'd respect
your life and your safety.

137
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,458
Didn't you?

138
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,918
We were talking about Mario.

139
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,611
You swore that Mario
wouldn't hurt me.

140
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,240
- It's the same.
- No, it isn't. It's different.

141
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,051
May I know why it's different?

142
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,785
Because Mario wouldn't let you
touch anybody in the list.

143
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,263
And if you're doing this,

144
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,973
it means Mario cannot talk now.

145
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,333
Therefore,
I think Mario is gone.

146
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,852
Am I wrong?

147
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,794
Why don't we focus
on what's important?

148
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,629
- I knew it.
- Be clear, Lidia, please.

149
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,067
If you don't give me the list,

150
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,776
you aren't useful for me.

151
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,278
I can make your business

152
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,197
grow more than you can imagine.

153
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,680
- Give me the list.
- Listen.

154
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,849
I can make you expand
to a bigger market.

155
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,351
- More important.
- Give me the list!

156
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,019
What do you know
about the Czech Republic?

157
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,604
What the hell
are you talking about?

158
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,249
Did you know that there

159
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,666
they use more methamphetamine

160
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,210
than any place in Europe?

161
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,152
Five per cent
of its 10,000,000 inhabitants,

162
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,988
500,000 people,
use meth there.

163
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,469
If you keep your market here,

164
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,054
but also export,

165
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,956
I can make you double or triple
your income.

166
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,418
I've been doing some research.
The average purity

167
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,937
is only about 60 per cent.

168
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,545
They've never seen
anything like your product.

169
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,317
You'll blow their heads off.

170
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,652
I don't know.

171
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,572
Thinking about exporting is...

172
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,074
You know?

173
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,391
I don't want
to get into trouble.

174
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,035
No.

175
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,812
Nothing happens
if you're Madrigal Locomotiva.

176
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,499
Madrigal

177
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,816
is under investigation
by Anti-narcotics, the DEA...

178
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,377
The restaurant division, mostly.

179
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,278
It's a minimum part
of the corporation.

180
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,298
We have 20 bigger divisions

181
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,825
and more than 100,000 employees
in Latin America and Europe.

182
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,828
Now that Mario is gone,
his people aren't a problem.

183
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,264
We can do things right.

184
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,224
That's what I want.

185
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,624
Efficiency.
Do you understand?

186
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,144
My job is moving things

187
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,711
from point A to point B
all over the globe

188
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,273
from Latin America.

189
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,341
Everything that goes through
the Panama Canal

190
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,859
is related to me.

191
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,760
I deal with 1.2 million tons
a month.

192
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,137
All of them
are under my control.

193
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,156
They're a click away.

194
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,393
Who's there
on the other end?

195
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,829
People I've been working with

196
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,372
for a long time.

197
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,731
People I've work with for years;
responsible people.

198
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,609
I'm very careful
who I work with.

199
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,073
If the business
is that easy,

200
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,908
why didn't you offer it
to Gustavo?

201
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,386
I did.

202
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,138
And he accepted.

203
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,415
We were in the final stages
of working it out

204
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:27,437
when somebody killed him.

205
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,671
Do you think Gustavo Cortés
built his distribution network

206
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,817
all by himself?

207
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,487
There're considerable advantages

208
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,388
to diversification
of distribution.

209
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,865
One of them

210
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,367
is putting 6,000 miles

211
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,701
between you and your product.

212
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,286
We know it

213
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,563
since the cocaine cartels
in the eighties.

214
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,334
What's the output?

215
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,443
With ten kilos per week,
you may be earning

216
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,279
around 2,000,000 dollars
per shipping.

217
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,910
Give me four kilos
to begin with.

218
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,887
Let's see what happens.

219
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,685
Okay.

220
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,170
My deal with Gustavo
was going to be thirty per cent.

221
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,339
- Okay.
- I think it's fair

222
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,258
if you consider
I'm risking a lot.

223
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,404
Lidia, I'm saying it's okay.

224
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,447
The list.

225
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,675
Do we have a deal?

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,599
We have a deal.

227
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:48,459
You and me
are making a lot of money.

228
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,927
Hello.

229
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,246
I think it's time
I meet your uncle.

230
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,726
Where're we going to do it?

231
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,251
Wherever,
except in the workshops.

232
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,170
There're a lot of tools
that can be used for defense

233
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,564
and a lot of witnesses.

234
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,149
It has to be simple.

235
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,385
Let's do it in the yards,
the showers and the cells.

236
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,614
Yes, that's easier.

237
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,741
The riots are ruled out?

238
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:30,268
Yes, I don't want a chaos.
I don't want it.

239
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,497
Something strange may arouse.

240
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,399
And we could end up
losing territory.

241
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,084
It's fast and certain.

242
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,545
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

243
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,070
Commando operation,
do you get it?

244
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,882
It's your call, boss.

245
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,784
How many prisoners
do we have in Bogotá's jails?

246
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,661
Fifteen in one;
25 in the other one.

247
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,096
Mostly, military personnel.

248
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,473
And in the other cities?

249
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,974
It's even easier.

250
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,043
Almost all the yards
belong to us.

251
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,103
Perfect.

252
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,522
Let's do it.

253
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,815
Okay.

254
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,444
I'm going to talk directly.

255
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,154
We are an organized army.

256
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,264
As such, we have rules.
Do you understand?

257
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,909
Yes, it's perfectly clear.

258
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,327
Therefore, I thank you

259
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,121
for listening to my offer.

260
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,665
Tell me something,

261
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,482
why do we have to do it
at the same time

262
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,502
if the places are different?

263
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,671
I don't want any reaction.

264
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,548
If they isolate one man,

265
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,300
the entire operation will fail.

266
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,052
In some way,

267
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,470
it has to be good

268
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,139
for our own interests.

269
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,374
Of course.
Money is ready.

270
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,001
You can do what you want
with that.

271
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,878
I still think
it's a problem

272
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,857
to do it at the same time.

273
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,361
I've already seen that picture.

274
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,304
I don't know
why there're so many.

275
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,908
It's as if they got a container.

276
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,786
Listen, my friend.

277
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,746
We're talking seriously.

278
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,247
I'm saying

279
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,416
that the job can be done,

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,751
but not in the way you want to.

281
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,210
It isn't me

282
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,170
who's wasting your time.

283
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,156
You're wasting it
by doubting.

284
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,760
The job can be done as I say.

285
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,177
I's your choice.

286
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,596
Do you want the money.

287
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,599
Figure it out.

288
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,714
Put me through fast.

289
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,132
It's urgent.

290
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,009
Fast.

291
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,386
What's the matter?

292
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,180
What's wrong...?

293
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,854
No!

294
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:06,232
Aaaah!

295
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,451
Argh!

296
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,847
Aaah!

297
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,890
Uff!

298
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,610
Mm, mm, mmmmmm!

299
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,625
Argh!

300
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,099
Aaaaaaah!

301
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,376
Perfect.

302
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,728

314

- I'm sorry. I'll turn it off.
- Don't worry.

315
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,968
Henry has just come.

316
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,327
If we watches the news,
he'll be in a bad mood.

317
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,704
- Yes, it's okay.
- Come here, sweetie.

318
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,747
- Look, your aunt.
- Hi!

319
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,475
What happens, sweetie?

320
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,417
I think her teeth
are coming through.

321
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,127
- She's crying more.
- Yes. She's heavier.

322
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,689
Uff!

323
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,673
- Hi, honey.
- What's up?

324
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,051
- Hi.
- How are you?

325
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,444
How are you, honey?

326
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,946
Hello.

327
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,364
Do you want something to eat?

328
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,824
I cooked some chicken,

329
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,516
but I can also order
Chinese food.

330
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,810
Whatever you want to, honey.
It's okay.

331
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,287
And you?

332
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,956
One baby's bottle for you.

333
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,481
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

334
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,125
How are you?

335
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,544
I'm fine.

336
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,087
And you?

337
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,612
I'm fine.
Saying hi to my baby.

338
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,008
I was about to go.

339
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,467
Come on.

340
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,095
Stay for a while.

341
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,057
Have a drink with me.

342
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,599
I don't know.

343
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,834
Come on.
Let's have a drink.

344
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,397
One.

345
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:34,400
They're the worst.

346
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,635
- Cheers!

347
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,442
Listen.

348
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,051
Do you know that lately
I've been remembering

349
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,511
a job I had
when I was 14?

350
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,681
I worked
for my grandfather's friend.

351
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,410
We had to go up the mountain,

352
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,645
collect black soil,
for plants nurseries,

353
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,481
put it in some sacks,
and carry them on our shoulders.

354
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,000
We went up and down.

355
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,734
All day,
up and down the mountain.

356
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,005
We carried... No!

357
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,924
Working outdoors is nice.

358
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,282
- Isn't it?
- No, man.

359
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,928
We got sunstroke.

360
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,598
Bugs bit us.

361
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,976
Why have you thought of that?

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,146
Because right now

363
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,607
I'd rather

364
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,025
get sunstroke,

365
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,527
and be bitten by bugs

366
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,763
than chasing
psychopaths and monsters.

367
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,563
Do you know what I think
when you tell me that?

368
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,086
That I love camping.

369
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,819
Wow!

370
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,196
It's beautiful!

371
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,033
Well done!

372
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,535
That's it!

373
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,953
Do you want to see it?

374
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,521
Shall we show them?
Yes?

375
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,039
Show it to me.

376
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,690
- Look.
It's beautiful!

377
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,567
He's more beautiful
than in real life.

378
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,403
- Look at it.
- I look the same.

379
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,448
He's all day
with that phone.

380
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,033
Sweetie,
shall we go to the movies?

381
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,369
- Do you like it?
- Hello.

382
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,054
Hold on, Mom.

383
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,015
What's up, Lucho?

384
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,517
Tell me.

385
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,252
- No.
- It's okay.

386
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,230
Really?

387
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,507
What else can we ask for
at that age?

388
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,942
Valentina.

389
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,402
Baby.

390
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,903
Your brother is gone.

391
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,055
You look much better,
do you know?

392
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,200
Much better, happier.

393
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,160
I'm trying.

394
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:26,896
Yes, but you're better,
aren't you?

395
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,915
I don't know. Yes?

396
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,404
Henry and I
have been talking

397
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:37,240
about...
well, the kids and you.

398
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,054
They miss their parents.

399
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,871
Doesn't Henry want them
to be here?

400
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,349
No, no, no, no.

401
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,725
Don't you dare to think that.

402
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,101
Henry loves them.

403
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,644
I love them.

404
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,588
We're happy
to have them here.

405
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:54,733
We want to help you, but...

406
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,318
What is it?

407
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,886
Sometimes I feel
that we're helping you

408
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,763
in the wrong way.
Do you understand?

409
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,366
That...

410
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,602
That perhaps
we're helping you too much.

411
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,079
María, look.

412
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,748
Listen to me, Cielo.

413
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,208
I know that Walter and you

414
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,192
went through
very hard times,

415
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,903
but I feel
it'd be very helpful

416
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,948
if you get back
your responsibilities, Cielo.

417
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,551
I mean.

418
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,327
I feel the best way
to recover your family

419
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:27,206
is, precisely that,
recover your family.

420
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,226
Don't you agree?

421
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,534
Walter.

422
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,161
I need to show you something.

423
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,480
Do you have
the car keys?

424
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,541
Come.

425
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,392
Come.

426
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,213
Can you explain me
what are we doing here?

427
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,691
This is a place

428
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,234
where people keep stuff

429
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,135
when they don't have
a place to put them.

430
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:28,702
I've rented this warehouse.

431
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,746
Close it.

432
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,054
This is

433
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,600
what you've been working for.

434
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,335
I started bringing it here.
I didn't know what else to do.

435
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:59,048
The laundering rhythm
isn't enough.

436
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,026
I gave up counting it.

437
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,528
I can't do it.

438
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:06,114
It was so much, so fast.

439
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,574
I tried weighing it.

440
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,869
As the Cali cartel used to do.

441
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,813
I figured one bill
weighs, approximately, a gram.

442
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,733
I could have been able
to do a calculation,

443
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,168
but the weight is different

444
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,420
according to the denomination.

445
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,715
Dollars are heavier than pesos.

446
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,591
So...

447
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,593
Honestly, I gave up.

448
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,089
Do you know
how much money is here?

449
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,634
I don't know.
I have no idea.

450
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,111
All I did lately...

451
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,781
All I did

452
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,491
was bringing it here

453
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,309
and keep it
away from humidity and bugs.

454
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,122
But there's more money here

455
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,274
than we can spend
in ten lives.

456
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,710
I can't launder it all.

457
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,570
Not even buying
ten car washers.

458
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,552
Walter,

459
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,138
I want to be with my kids again.

460
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,308
I need my life back.

461
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,769
So tell me:

462
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,688
How much is enough?

463
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,506
How big
does this pile have to be?

464
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,995
Hello.

465
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,373
What's up?

466
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:04,107
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come
without telling you.

467
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,277
In fact,
I called your cell phone.

468
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,363
I threw away
all my cell phones.

469
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,966
It makes sense.

470
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,468
Yes.

471
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,845
I called your home line, but...

472
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,346
It's disconnected.

473
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,455
It isn't
that I don't have the service.

474
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,892
It's unplugged.

475
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,434
Yes, yes, yes.

476
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,211
- Did you leave a message?
- No, no, no, no.

477
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,941
So? What happened?

478
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,359
Everything is all right.

479
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,946
I'm okay. Normal.

480
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,824
I was around.

481
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,283
I was in the neighborhood.

482
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,243
I thought of checking on you.

483
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,083
Do you want to come in?

484
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:48,085
Sure.

485
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,299
How are you? Are you okay?

486
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,301
Yes, I'm fine.

487
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,762
I'd offer you a beer,

488
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,680
but I drank the last one.

489
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,831
No, it's okay.
Don't worry.

490
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,809
I don't drink this early.

491
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,811
You finally didn't move.

492
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:11,109
No, I didn't have to.

493
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:14,696
Saúl told me what you did.

494
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,615
You didn't go to jail.

495
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,076
Neither did I.

496
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,685
I think
there isn't a problem.

497
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,789
Jose.

498
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,749
I need you to understand

499
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,209
I had to do it.

500
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,169
I didn't have a choice.

501
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,968
I won't go back.

502
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,011
I know.

503
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,888
It's crystal clear.

504
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:43,642
Then what are you doing here?

505
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,477
May I?

506
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,730
Sure.

507
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,732
This is very strange.

508
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,511
I was on the street
the other day,

509
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,572
and I saw...

510
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,243
You won't believe me.

511
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,729
A bus just like ours.
It was identical.

512
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,583
Do you remember our bus?

513
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,984
- Really?
- Yes.

514
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,503
I didn't think

515
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,403
there were two buses
like that one around.

516
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,298
I thought it was curious.

517
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,758
I had to tell you.

518
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,468
This was in better condition.

519
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,554
The owners have painted it

520
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,373
and there were no bullet holes
in the door.

521
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,727
What an adventure!

522
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,103
We were completely insane.

523
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,524
It was very primitive.

524
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:36,402
I remember it.

525
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,656
Whenever I hit a red light,

526
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,099
I used to pray
that no policeman appears

527
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,768
to fine me
because he would have caught us.

528
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,812
The noise it made.
The noise!

529
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,399
Sometimes I wake up
after having a nightmare.

530
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,275
It's as if there was
a box with cats inside.

531
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,944
- It was the timing belt.
- That's it!

532
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,547
Why didn't you change that?

533
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,256
I preferred the noise,

534
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,700
instead of having
a bus that stopped.

535
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,427
Yes.

536
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,846
The bus stopped.

537
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,430
Do you remember

538
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,999
when we ran out of battery
in the middle of nowhere?

539
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,333
- Yes.
- How long? Three days?

540
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,978
Yes, I remember.

541
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,629
- Do you remember the antenna?
- It had an aluminum antenna.

542
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,148
Where did you get that?

543
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,217
"First steps,"
"Guideline to..."?

544
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,696
And the gauge?

545
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,322
It didn't work.

546
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,782
Nothing in the bus worked.

547
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,242
All the buttons

548
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,618
indicate something different.

549
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,037
It was a lying bus.

550
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:28,496
Mythomaniac.

551
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,456
We had a mythomaniac bus.

552
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,861
Do you know which was
the craziest part?

553
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,882
We had money then.

554
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,341
With that money

555
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,760
we could have bought

556
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,219
anything we wanted to.

557
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,721
We could have sold the bus.

558
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,581
- Why didn't we do it?
- Because that's us.

559
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,059
I don't know why.

560
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,476
That's how human beings are.

561
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,854
We grew fond of things.

562
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,439
Did you grew fond of it?

563
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,899
Me?

564
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,358
Of course.

565
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,527
Well, not as much as you.

566
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,946
How you used to call it?

567
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,363
My crystal bubble?

568
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:07,017
The crystal ship.

569
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:07,035
Even worse!

570
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,453
Absolutely sentimental.

571
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,164
The crystal ship.

572
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,832
Why haven't we kept that bus?

573
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,751
Have you thought of that?

574
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:18,630
Inertia?

575
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,631
Inertia. I think so.

576
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,644
Well, I have to go.

577
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,146
It's late,

578
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,855
and I have to do some things.

579
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,547
Yes, yes, yes.
Don't worry.

580
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,734
I have things to do, too.

581
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,719
- Okay.
- I'm leaving, too.

582
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,054
I liked coming
and visiting you.

583
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,741
It was...

584
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,743
I'm glad you're fine.

585
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,940
I left something
for you outside.

586
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,373
Hello.

587
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,971
What?

588
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,849
I'm out.

589
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,851
I'm out of the business.

590
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,750
This is delicious.

591
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:03,044
With some big earrings.

592
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,420
I'm not sure about the earrings.

593
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,071
Perhaps I'd like
something different.

594
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:09,032
A look change,
doing something with my hair.

595
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,408
Like what?
Having your hair cut?

596
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,805
No, perhaps changing the color.

597
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,181
It may work.

598
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,682
Burgundy?

599
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,184
Where did you get this?

600
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,169
I made them bring it
from Singapore.

601
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,646
Really?

602
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,148
It's from there.

603
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,941
Hey, don't you like the...?

604
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,442
I'll have to...

605
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,551
María told me
to do something else.

606
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,095
What did you say?
Philately?

607
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,489
Something easier to collect.

608
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,907
Numismatics.

609
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,450
Numis--

610
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,119
It's good for saving, too.

611
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,620
Sure.

612
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,413
Do you know what's trendy now?

613
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,064
Pouring prenatal vitamins
in your hair.

614
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,482
Apparently,
they make it look nice.

615
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,960
For your hair?

616
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,819
It makes it grow.
It'd be good for...

617
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,534
Do you remember it?

618
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,217
I used to use rotten avocado?

619
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,551
With lemon.

620
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,637
It left it stiff.

621
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,163
Stiff?
Who wants something stiff?

622
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:58,183
Don't be vulgar.

623
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,684
Aren't you ashamed?

624
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,668
These are
the women's needs nowadays.

625
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,670
Any time,
you're ready to do it.

626
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,089
I'll put more sunscreen
on the girl.

627
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,757
The weather is terrible
at Bogotá.

628
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,277
It's strange, isn't it?

629
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,012
It's cloudy,
and then the sun comes out.

630
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,531
And everyone gets sunstroke.

631
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,808
Have you put sunscreen
on your forehead?

632
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,871
Yes, sure.

633
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,581
I'll be right back.

634
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,774
I'll make room
for the dessert.

635
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,985
No, please!
We're eating!

636
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:30,072
Why do we have to have
that image in our minds?

637
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,408
- I hope everything's fine!
- Don't be disgusting.

638
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:35,011
Disgusting.

639
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,470
They're delicious.

640
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,331
- Delicious.
- Aren't they?

641
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:53,922
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">"For my other favorite W.B.</font></i>

642
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,535
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">It's my pleasure</font>
<font face="monospaceSansSerif">working with you."</font></i>

643
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,972
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">W.B.?</font></i>

644
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,808
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Who is he W.B.?</font></i>

645
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,436
Wilson Borja?

646
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,853
Wilberto Buitrago?

647
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,855
Do you understand?

648
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,068
Walter Blanco?

649
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,908
You got me.

650
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,122
I give up.
