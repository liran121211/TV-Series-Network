1
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,917
<i>Previously on</i> X-Men...

2
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:08,167
Please don't hurt me.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,375
I'm Roberto Da Costa,
heir to the Da Costa fortune.

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,833
What's this freak's trick?

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:13,958
No clue.

6
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,042
Kid didn't even try to use his powers.

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,500
Good guy or bad guy?

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,000
Definitely the good guy.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,875
Your parents don't know, do they?

10
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,208
Some sort of solar energy.

11
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:29,250
Just reminds me that I'm different.

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,083
Be an X-Men, Jubilee?

13
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,500
I don't even want to be myself.

14
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,833
<i>The breeze is gone.</i>

15
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:42,125
I cannot feel it, nor the moisture,

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,208
nor the air.

17
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,083
The effects appear permanent.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,208
Name's Forge, Storm.

19
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:52,875
An old friend of Charles Xavier.

20
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,417
I'd like to help you
get back what you've lost.

21
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,458
Gambit found a little extra.

22
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,542
Here, take some cream with it.

23
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,792
Aw, thanks, Remy. You're sweet.

24
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,125
But our new boss beat you to the pot.

25
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,375
It's three sugars.

26
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,417
I'll take a cappuccino
if you just takin' orders.

27
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,750
No. Luckily, I am giving them.

28
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,208
After breakfast, the X-Men will report
to the Danger Room for drills.

29
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,917
We must be ready
should Mister Sinister resurface.

30
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,875
Surely our youngest member
deserves some jubilation

31
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,833
on her 18th birthday.

32
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,000
I second the blue Rogaine ad.

33
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,083
Kid deserves it.

34
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,250
Jubilee will see far more birthdays

35
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,458
should she learn to master her powers
to face a world that despises her.

36
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:57,542
Yo-ho! Someone's daddy
didn't get him a pony for his sweet 16th.

37
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:01,208
My parents perished when I was a child.

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,625
Who's got two thumbs that blast fireworks
and turns 18 today?

39
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,708
Me.

40
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,167
Aw, happy birthday, sweet pea.

41
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,167
Boy, do we got some surprises for you.

42
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,208
But first, how do you wanna celebrate
the big 18th, huh?

43
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,542
We are all ears.

44
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,708
Big shocker, I know,

45
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,458
but let's go to the arcade.

46
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,125
It'll be just like old times.

47
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,250
What do we think?

48
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,458
"You would have the master of magnetism

49
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,375
"seen in a bar of childish make-believe?"

50
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,375
Ugh! This is bogus.

51
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,917
What's wrong with just one day

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,125
where I don't have to freak out
about the Professor,

53
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,833
or Jean and her clone,

54
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:44,125
or Cyclops and his latest control issue?

55
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,375
They aren't even here because
they just had to go play mutant politics

56
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,792
at the United Nations.

57
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,833
Genosha entering the UN is a big deal.

58
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:55,333
Small fries.
I'm the birthday Big Mac.

59
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,625
You actually do play video games?

60
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,667
Uh, this might be make-or-break.

61
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,083
The only people who hate video games
are bad at video games.

62
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,042
But actually, this one isn't mine.

63
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,708
Never even heard of a "Motendo."

64
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,458
Rogue said they had some surprises.

65
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,167
Day is looking up. Let's play!

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,750
I'd rather <i>minha mãe</i> find out I'm a mutant

67
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,958
than be caught dead playing <i>that.</i>

68
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,875
Whoa! What's it doing?

69
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,250
- Hey!
- Whoa!

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,083
What time is it?

71
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,000
How long were we playing?

72
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,750
I assume I won?

73
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,875
Wait.

74
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:52,125
Hey, let him go!

75
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,625
Whoa! Where'd the mansion go?

76
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,292
How did we get downtown so fast?

77
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,458
Oh, boy!

78
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,208
You know, it would be a lot easier
if you just used your powers.

79
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,625
What if there's cameras around?

80
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,000
My parents could see me on TV.

81
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,458
- Die, mutie!
- Die, mutie!

82
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,875
Do you really think
everyone is focused on you?

83
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,042
Yes.

84
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,958
Wait a second.
It could be a trap.

85
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,042
A phone booth trap? That'd be creative.

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Hello?

87
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,500
Whoa! Hold up. Genosha?

88
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,083
But, like, way-back-when Genosha?

89
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:09,917
What the heck?

90
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,125
I was trapped here with Storm.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,042
Gambit, too.

92
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,333
And a bunch of other mutants.

93
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,958
All enslaved to build by Bolivar Trask.

94
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,125
The dude
who created the Sentinels?

95
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,167
Move in! Fire!

96
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,976
- Halt!
- Take 'em down!

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,208
Go! Go!

98
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:35,542
I didn't do that.

99
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,458
Maybe it was...

100
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,042
her.

101
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:42,083
Was that you, Hot Topic stalker,

102
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,833
calling us earlier on the phone?

103
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,032
<i>System error.</i>

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,667
<i>System error.</i>

105
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,000
Like a cyberpunk mirage.

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,833
Duh! We are totally in a video game.

107
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:01,917
We're what?

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,875
Pay attention to the young lady.

109
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,500
You're, like, "totally in a video game."

110
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,000
Love the "totally."

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,333
Just what I was hoping for.
Classic Jubilee.

112
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,083
What in the name of all heaven is that?

113
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,167
Mojo here,

114
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,167
your primetime psycho
interdimensional alien TV producer

115
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,708
who feeds off ratings.

116
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:22,917
My greatest hit?

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,458
Putting the X-Men through
overly complicated death traps

118
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,083
to entertain my slaves...

119
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,667
"Indentured audiences," sorry.

120
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,500
Looks like you've been dieting?

121
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,583
You noticed!

122
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,125
Got some nip, some tuck.

123
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,875
Actually, it's been
a horrible third quarter

124
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,167
and it shows, let's be real.

125
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,083
Ratings are down, down, down,

126
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,042
and I'm thirsty for the next big thing,
dirty girl.

127
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,250
That's why I made the pivot
to video games.

128
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,375
The future of mind-numbery!

129
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:58,292
You're not just <i>in </i>a video game, honey.

130
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,208
You're the star!

131
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:05,250
Player <i>numero uno</i>
of my first blockbuster release,

132
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,333
where every level
is based off your own memories.

133
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,542
<i>Really? Me? Please.</i>

134
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,667
Big names are a fortune.

135
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,125
Dazzler had a gig, don't ask.

136
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,250
So you're my gamer girl in a gamer world.

137
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,917
You connect with the youth.
You're their point of view.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,750
Picture this, the future of Motendo,

139
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,208
that's "mo" for "Mojo,"

140
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:29,250
in every home, on every world,
in every dimension! Hah!

141
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,542
Zapping up nom-nom-nom

142
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,958
energy from the brains of all who play!

143
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:38,917
I'll dominate the galaxies
and the 18-to-45 age demographic.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,042
And what if we refuse to play your game?

145
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,167
What then? None of this is even real.

146
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,833
Well, I don't want to say something scary,

147
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:49,625
like, "If you die in the game,
you die in real life," but...

148
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,625
Stakes.

149
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:57,250
Turn those frowns upside down
before I cut you like a one-hit wonder.

150
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,792
This is the dream, Jubilee.
Be young forever,

151
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,625
replay the golden hits, no growing up.

152
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,167
Think about it, Jubes.

153
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,542
The old X-Men are totally old-school.

154
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,625
{\an8}<i>Who's the Boss?</i> Magneto.

155
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,292
{\an8}Storm, <i>Different Worlds.</i>

156
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,000
<i>Divorce Court: Summers v. Grey.</i>

157
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,750
That's not X-Men.

158
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,583
You...

159
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,208
You're my X-Men, Jubilee, so...

160
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,167
Game on!

161
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,792
It's loading. Here we go.

162
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,500
<i>All right!</i>

163
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,958
<i>Savage Land?</i>

164
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,542
She's at it again.

165
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,542
Patch that bug, Spiral!

166
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,625
This is what you get
when you kill tech support.

167
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
For failing to kill the bug!

168
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,292
Nothing lost.

169
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,708
Now, shush!

170
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,792
My favorite level.

171
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,708
I remember seeing this place
on the news with <i>minha mãe.</i>

172
00:10:56,792 --> 00:11:00,208
Magneto's old base
from his megalomaniacal phase.

173
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,083
I acted like I hated mutants.

174
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,042
<i>Minha mãe</i> tried saying
there were good ones,

175
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,542
but I could tell she was spooked.

176
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,042
So I said, "They're all freaks,
and normal people would win."

177
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,500
Man, talk about simpler times.

178
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,708
Now, helmet head's bossing us around

179
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,917
and telling me how to spend my birthday.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,042
It's unreal.

181
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,167
We should probably find a way out of here.

182
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,375
What's the rush?

183
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,292
These levels are taking me back.

184
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,208
Jubes, listen to yourself.

185
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,583
None of this is real.

186
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,500
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,458
Otherwise, reality will smack you
right in the face... Ahhh!

188
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,667
Roberto.

189
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,375
This talky-talky scene is taking forever.

190
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,708
It's boss battle time, babies.

191
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,750
I am Magneto.

192
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,375
Oh, no. Roberto's health is almost gone.

193
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,875
He's dying.

194
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,375
Okay, he's got a pattern of attack.

195
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,083
Typical boss battle shenanigans.

196
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,208
I just need to wait for it to cycle.

197
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,083
One more.

198
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,125
Roberto!

199
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,458
No, no, no.

200
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,958
This can't be happening.

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,250
Is that

202
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,708
an extra life?

203
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,417
How did that get in there?

204
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,875
Spiral, I thought I told you
to get rid of her.

205
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,917
Did I die?

206
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,625
Was I dead?

207
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,250
Oh, thank goodness.

208
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
I thought I lost you.

209
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
I found an extra life.

210
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,833
Someone is definitely helping us.

211
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,458
I don't speak justifiably
angry Portuguese, but I know.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,708
I messed up, big time.

213
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:23,083
Still, this young lady
did take down old Magneto.

214
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:27,958
Bow before the lord of magnetism.

215
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,333
Whoa!

216
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,792
Hey!

217
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,000
Huh?

218
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,887
No need for thank you
among friends.

219
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,250
And by friends, I mean you.

220
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,583
I hacked you out of the game server

221
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,833
and into Mojo's broadcast servers
to buy us some time.

222
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,375
She's a plot twist.

223
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,583
She's in league with Mojo.

224
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,417
Zip it, Da Costa.

225
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,125
Like I said, we go way back.

226
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,500
Now, we need to move.

227
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,500
That blobby tyrant fraud
could download in here any second

228
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,042
and then rip us back
into his game of deception.

229
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,667
Gonna hit pause here for a second.

230
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,000
I got a few questions.

231
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,000
Explain everything.

232
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,125
You gotta test a game before launch.

233
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,667
Running endless trial loops
with you two was too risky.

234
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,167
So Mojo needed beta testers,

235
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,917
digital replicas of me.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,542
I'm the only one left.

237
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,625
I've played these levels inside and out.

238
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,458
Relived the glory days
more than I care to count,

239
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,875
but note the hair and wrinkles.

240
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,500
Before Mojo killed the beta,
I figured out a glitch

241
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,667
and hacked my way through here
before deletion.

242
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,500
Figures my game has cheat codes.

243
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,625
Very me.

244
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:50,000
Jubilee, I know a part of you
wants to hang here.

245
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,750
It's nice knowing how every stage ends.

246
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,583
No surprises, no twists.

247
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,125
It always stays the same.

248
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,000
But that's not living.

249
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,667
Living doesn't get cheat codes
or extra lives.

250
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,250
But it has friends and family.

251
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,875
Love, loss and heapings of hope.

252
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,833
Life's a total risk and it's on you.

253
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,375
Take it.

254
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,083
So, Magneto was right?

255
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,417
A bit, but he's totally wrong
about one thing.

256
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,625
Video games rule.

257
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,500
Now, what do you say
we destroy Mojo's game

258
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,417
and get you two lovebirds out of here?

259
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,708
Two Jubilees?

260
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:37,792
Cheaters!

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,542
Guys, I think he fell off his diet.

262
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,792
Fine by me.

263
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,042
The bigger they are...

264
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,208
the harder they pop.

265
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,708
Wow! I can do that?

266
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,667
That ain't the half of it. Just you wait.

267
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,792
Whoa! Ah!

268
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:15,083
What's the testing on throwing
to a commercial during a video game?

269
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,833
I got him!

270
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,458
Hold up, cowboy.

271
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,917
It ain't over till the fat despot sings.

272
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,542
Time to end you nasty glitches.

273
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
You brats may have canceled me today,

274
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,958
but I swear, I'll gut you in the reboot.

275
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,083
- Roberto, you could've...
- Yeah, talk about risk.

276
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,875
Storm, dinner is ready.

277
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,250
My papa's bison chili.

278
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,167
It's a leaner cut.

279
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,167
Gives room for the spices
to do their magic.

280
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,667
You're very kind.

281
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,667
Well, a friend of Charles Xavier
is a friend of mine.

282
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,083
I owe that fellow a great deal.

283
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:18,833
As do we all.

284
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,250
How does it work,

285
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,000
a mutant who can invent
anything he can conceive?

286
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
I can get at parts of the brain
that are normally dormant in humans.

287
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,875
Draw unique connections,

288
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,417
see how bits fit,

289
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,208
like a Rubik's Cube on constant autopilot.

290
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,875
Or simply a genius.

291
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,667
Well, life and love, God help me.

292
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,875
But if you're needing a neat toaster

293
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,208
or a thing that'll store
your mutant powers...

294
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,542
Or a bowl of this delicious chili.

295
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,583
Yep, or chili.

296
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,250
Then I'm your man.

297
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
May I ask?

298
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,625
I was a soldier,

299
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,583
and there was a war.

300
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,208
I miss soaring.

301
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:11,292
The wind in my hair,
so powerful it's hard to breathe,

302
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,792
but so fresh as to be worth it.

303
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,167
Your mutant gifts
have allowed you to fix yourself.

304
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,125
What a blessing.

305
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,750
Wasn't anything to fix.

306
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,000
Just adapted and got a little creative.

307
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,542
Let's go for a ride.

308
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,292
Looks like you got creative.

309
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,208
Keep up.

310
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,667
I'm not building you a faster horse.

311
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,125
What a rude little man.

312
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:14,292
The goddess lives.

313
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,625
Beautiful, isn't it?

314
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,708
That owl.
I've seen him before, circling.

315
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,875
Perhaps he is like the winds.

316
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,167
The moon affects tides and temperatures,

317
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,583
guiding the wind
across our planet's surface.

318
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,625
The winds here never shift.

319
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,917
They always blow east,
stuck like this owl.

320
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,000
You more than anyone
know how fast the weather can change.

321
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,833
The real trick to reversing
what the X-Cutioner did to you

322
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,458
wasn't making an inverted version
of its radiation.

323
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,500
It was creating a machine
that could safely channel such power.

324
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,542
Ah! You've been listening.

325
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,333
Last power differential clicked in my head
when we were out riding.

326
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,417
Like I said,

327
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,417
helps to get outside.

328
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,792
You ready?

329
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,667
Okay, Ororo, give it a try.

330
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,292
Winds,

331
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,375
heed my command.

332
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:33,667
I am Storm, mistress of the elements.

333
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,875
Rise, winds, and move the desert sands.

334
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,875
Please, winds,

335
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,583
hear me.

336
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,833
Please.

337
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,542
This isn't happening, Forge.

338
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,208
It can't be real.

339
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,125
I know, Ororo.

340
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,875
I know.

341
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh. You're still working on the machine.

342
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,375
Why is fixing me so important to you?

343
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,208
Storm...

344
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:32,958
After the war,

345
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,708
I didn't have the resources
to build what I so easily saw in my mind.

346
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,125
The Defense Department offered to help me

347
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,000
as long as I helped them
build some devices.

348
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,667
Devices that could be used to

349
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,417
neutralize dangerous mutants.

350
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,625
No.

351
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,208
No, no, no.

352
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,917
You made these?

353
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,917
No, a scientist in Scotland did.

354
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:02,250
Using my early designs,
rough strokes at best.

355
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,333
I left the government by then.

356
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:08,625
You of all people should know the perils
of trusting those in Washington.

357
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,083
That's not fair.

358
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,708
I was hurting, lost, bitter.

359
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
I gave up.

360
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,708
If I told you the truth in Dallas,

361
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,250
you wouldn't have let me help you.

362
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,167
So you lied.

363
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,750
My weaver of lies.

364
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,750
It hasn't all been lies.

365
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
This...

366
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,500
This is not a lie.

367
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,583
No, don't you dare.

368
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,042
I could live forever.

369
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,417
And still, my endless imagination

370
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,583
would never conceive
of a thing as perfect as you.

371
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,958
A perfect path to your redemption.

372
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,958
You are a goddess.

373
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,458
Powers be damned.

374
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,000
How do you not see that?

375
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,625
Ororo, look at me.

376
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,042
Look.

377
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,500
I'll say it once, just once.

378
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,375
Then you can go or you can stay, but...

379
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:02,708
I love you.

380
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,750
You meant to make me a goddess.

381
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,750
Instead, you have fashioned a fool.

382
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,458
Ororo!

383
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,792
I was just coming upstairs after you.

384
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,708
What? How did I return here?

385
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,583
By all things in the heavens.

386
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,708
Get out of my home, you damn demon!

387
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,917
<i>Is this death?</i>

388
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,750
No.

389
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,500
You live.

390
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,542
Disappointed.

391
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,250
Trapped here, haunted.

392
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,750
Suffering, despairing.

393
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,583
I feast on misery.

394
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:27,458
And I, The Adversary,

395
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,875
shall not waste my meal.
