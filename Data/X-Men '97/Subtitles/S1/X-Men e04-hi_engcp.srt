00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,417
[grunts]

179
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,792
[yelling]

180
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,542
[Spiral] She's at it again.

181
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,542
Patch that bug, Spiral!

182
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,625
This is what you get
when you kill tech support.

183
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
For failing to kill the bug!

184
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,292
Nothing lost.

185
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,708
Now, shush!

186
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,792
My favorite level.

187
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,917
[crowd cheering]

188
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,708
I remember seeing this place
on the news with <i>minha mãe.</i>

189
00:10:56,792 --> 00:11:00,208
Magneto's old base
from his megalomaniacal phase.

190
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,083
I acted like I hated mutants.

191
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,042
<i>Minha mãe</i> tried saying
there were good ones,

192
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,542
but I could tell she was spooked.

193
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,042
So I said, "They're all freaks,
and normal people would win."

194
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,500
Man, talk about simpler times.

195
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,708
Now, helmet head's bossing us around

196
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,917
and telling me how to spend my birthday.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,042
It's unreal.

198
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,167
We should probably find a way out of here.

199
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,375
What's the rush?

200
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,292
These levels are taking me back.

201
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,208
Jubes, listen to yourself.

202
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,583
None of this is real.

203
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,500
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,458
Otherwise, reality will smack you
right in the face... Ahhh!

205
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,667
[Jubilee] Roberto.

206
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,375
This talky-talky scene is taking forever.

207
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,708
It's boss battle time, babies.

208
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,750
I am Magneto.

209
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,875
[grunts]

210
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,375
Oh, no. Roberto's health is almost gone.

211
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,875
He's dying.

212
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,375
Okay, he's got a pattern of attack.

213
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,083
Typical boss battle shenanigans.

214
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,208
I just need to wait for it to cycle.

215
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,250
[grunts]

216
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,083
One more.

217
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,792
[Magneto cackles]

218
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,625
- [grunts]
- [Magneto groans]

219
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,708
[cackles]

220
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:23,792
[yells]

221
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,125
Roberto!

222
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,458
No, no, no.

223
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,958
This can't be happening.

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,250
Is that

225
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,708
an extra life?

226
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,417
How did that get in there?

227
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,875
Spiral, I thought I told you
to get rid of her.

228
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,333
[scoffs]

229
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,917
[gasps] Did I die?

230
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,625
Was I dead?

231
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,250
Oh, thank goodness.

232
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
I thought I lost you.

233
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
I found an extra life.

234
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,833
Someone is definitely helping us.

235
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,042
[speaking Portuguese]

236
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,458
I don't speak justifiably
angry Portuguese, but I know.

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,708
I messed up, big time.

238
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:23,083
Still, this young lady
did take down old Magneto.

239
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:27,958
Bow before the lord of magnetism.

240
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,333
[Roberto] Whoa!

241
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,792
Hey!

242
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,000
[Roberto screams]

243
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,000
Huh?

244
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,887
[woman] No need for thank you
among friends.

245
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,250
And by friends, I mean you.

246
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,583
I hacked you out of the game server

247
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,833
and into Mojo's broadcast servers
to buy us some time.

248
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,375
She's a plot twist.

249
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,583
She's in league with Mojo.

250
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,417
[both] Zip it, Da Costa.

251
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,125
[chuckles] Like I said, we go way back.

252
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,500
Now, we need to move.

253
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,500
That blobby tyrant fraud
could download in here any second

254
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,042
and then rip us back
into his game of deception.

255
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,667
Gonna hit pause here for a second.

256
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,000
I got a few questions.

257
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,000
Explain everything.

258
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,125
You gotta test a game before launch.

259
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,667
Running endless trial loops
with you two was too risky.

260
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,167
So Mojo needed beta testers,

261
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,917
digital replicas of me.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,542
I'm the only one left.

263
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,625
I've played these levels inside and out.

264
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,458
Relived the glory days
more than I care to count,

265
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,875
but note the hair and wrinkles.

266
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,500
Before Mojo killed the beta,
I figured out a glitch

267
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,667
and hacked my way through here
before deletion.

268
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,500
Figures my game has cheat codes.

269
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,625
Very me.

270
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:50,000
[sighs] Jubilee, I know a part of you
wants to hang here.

271
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,750
It's nice knowing how every stage ends.

272
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,583
No surprises, no twists.

273
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,125
It always stays the same.

274
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,000
But that's not living.

275
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,667
Living doesn't get cheat codes
or extra lives.

276
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,250
But it has friends and family.

277
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,875
Love, loss and heapings of hope.

278
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,833
Life's a total risk and it's on you.

279
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,375
Take it.

280
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,083
So, Magneto was right?

281
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,417
A bit, but he's totally wrong
about one thing.

282
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,625
Video games rule.

283
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,500
Now, what do you say
we destroy Mojo's game

284
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,417
and get you two lovebirds out of here?

285
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,875
{\an8}[game beeping]

286
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,708
Two Jubilees?

287
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:37,792
Cheaters!

288
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,333
[crowd shouting]

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,542
Guys, I think he fell off his diet.

290
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,792
Fine by me.

291
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,042
The bigger they are...

292
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,208
the harder they pop.

293
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,708
Wow! I can do that?

294
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,667
[Abscissa]
That ain't the half of it. Just you wait.

295
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,000
[groans]

296
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,792
Whoa! Ah!

297
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:15,083
What's the testing on throwing
to a commercial during a video game?

298
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,042
[Mojo screams]

299
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,833
I got him!

300
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,458
[Abscissa] Hold up, cowboy.

301
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,917
It ain't over till the fat despot sings.

302
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,542
[Mojo] Time to end you nasty glitches.

303
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
You brats may have canceled me today,

304
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,958
but I swear, I'll gut you in the reboot.

305
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,208
[screams]

306
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,458
[crowd cheers]

307
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,542
[electrical buzzing]

308
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,083
- Roberto, you could've...
- Yeah, talk about risk.

309
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,875
[Forge] Storm, dinner is ready.

310
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,250
My papa's bison chili.

311
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,167
It's a leaner cut.

312
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,167
Gives room for the spices
to do their magic.

313
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,667
You're very kind.

314
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,667
Well, a friend of Charles Xavier
is a friend of mine.

315
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,083
I owe that fellow a great deal.

316
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:18,833
As do we all.

317
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,250
How does it work,

318
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,000
a mutant who can invent
anything he can conceive?

319
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
I can get at parts of the brain
that are normally dormant in humans.

320
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,875
Draw unique connections,

321
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,417
see how bits fit,

322
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,208
like a Rubik's Cube on constant autopilot.

323
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,875
Or simply a genius.

324
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,667
Well, life and love, God help me.

325
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,875
But if you're needing a neat toaster

326
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,208
or a thing that'll store
your mutant powers...

327
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,542
Or a bowl of this delicious chili.

328
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,583
[laughs] Yep, or chili.

329
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,250
Then I'm your man.

330
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
[Ororo] May I ask?

331
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,625
[Forge] I was a soldier,

332
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,583
and there was a war.

333
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,208
I miss soaring.

334
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:11,292
The wind in my hair,
so powerful it's hard to breathe,

335
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,792
but so fresh as to be worth it.

336
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,167
Your mutant gifts
have allowed you to fix yourself.

337
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,125
What a blessing.

338
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,750
[Forge] Wasn't anything to fix.

339
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,000
Just adapted and got a little creative.

340
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,542
Let's go for a ride.

341
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,417
[hooves clopping]

342
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,292
[Forge] Looks like you got creative.

343
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,208
Keep up.

344
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,667
I'm not building you a faster horse.

345
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,125
What a rude little man.

346
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,583
[Forge laughs]

347
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,250
[gasps]

348
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,500
[whinnies]

349
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:14,292
[chuckles] The goddess lives.

350
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,625
Beautiful, isn't it?

351
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,708
[owl hooting softly]

352
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,708
[Ororo] That owl.
I've seen him before, circling.

353
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,875
Perhaps he is like the winds.

354
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,167
The moon affects tides and temperatures,

355
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,583
guiding the wind
across our planet's surface.

356
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,625
The winds here never shift.

357
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,917
They always blow east,
stuck like this owl.

358
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,000
[Forge] You more than anyone
know how fast the weather can change.

359
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,833
The real trick to reversing
what the X-Cutioner did to you

360
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,458
wasn't making an inverted version
of its radiation.

361
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,500
[Ororo] It was creating a machine
that could safely channel such power.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,542
Ah! You've been listening.

363
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,333
Last power differential clicked in my head
when we were out riding.

364
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,417
Like I said,

365
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,417
helps to get outside.

366
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,792
You ready?

367
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,917
[breathes deeply]

368
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,667
[Forge] Okay, Ororo, give it a try.

369
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,292
[Ororo] Winds,

370
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,375
heed my command.

371
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:33,667
I am Storm, mistress of the elements.

372
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,875
Rise, winds, and move the desert sands.

373
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,667
[crows cawing]

374
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,875
Please, winds,

375
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,583
hear me.

376
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,833
[tearfully] Please.

377
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,542
This isn't happening, Forge.

378
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,208
It can't be real.

379
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,125
[Forge] I know, Ororo.

380
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,875
I know.

381
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh. You're still working on the machine.

382
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,375
Why is fixing me so important to you?

383
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,208
Storm...

384
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,292
[grunts softly]

385
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:32,958
After the war,

386
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,708
I didn't have the resources
to build what I so easily saw in my mind.

387
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,125
The Defense Department offered to help me

388
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,000
as long as I helped them
build some devices.

389
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,667
Devices that could be used to

390
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,417
neutralize dangerous mutants.

391
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,625
No.

392
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,208
No, no, no.

393
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,917
You made these?

394
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,917
No, a scientist in Scotland did.

395
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:02,250
Using my early designs,
rough strokes at best.

396
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,333
I left the government by then.

397
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:08,625
You of all people should know the perils
of trusting those in Washington.

398
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,083
[Forge] That's not fair.

399
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,708
I was hurting, lost, bitter.

400
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
I gave up.

401
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,708
If I told you the truth in Dallas,

402
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,250
you wouldn't have let me help you.

403
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,167
So you lied.

404
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,750
My weaver of lies.

405
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,750
It hasn't all been lies.

406
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
This...

407
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,500
This is not a lie.

408
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,583
No, don't you dare.

409
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,042
I could live forever.

410
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,417
And still, my endless imagination

411
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,583
would never conceive
of a thing as perfect as you.

412
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,958
A perfect path to your redemption.

413
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,958
You are a goddess.

414
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,458
Powers be damned.

415
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,000
How do you not see that?

416
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,625
Ororo, look at me.

417
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,042
Look.

418
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,500
I'll say it once, just once.

419
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,375
Then you can go or you can stay, but...

420
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:02,708
I love you.

421
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,750
You meant to make me a goddess.

422
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,750
Instead, you have fashioned a fool.

423
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,000
[thunder rumbling]

424
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,042
[horse whinnies]

425
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,458
Ororo!

426
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,792
I was just coming upstairs after you.

427
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,708
What? How did I return here?

428
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,542
- [thudding]
- [warbling]

429
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,583
[gasps] By all things in the heavens.

430
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,708
Get out of my home, you damn demon!

431
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,917
[Forge groans]

432
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,417
[Forge grunts]

433
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,917
[Ororo] <i>Is this death?</i>

434
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,750
- [creature] No.
- [thunderclap]

435
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,500
You live.

436
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,542
Disappointed.

437
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,250
Trapped here, haunted.

438
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,750
Suffering, despairing.

439
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,583
I feast on misery.

440
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:27,458
And I, The Adversary,

441
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,875
shall not waste my meal.

442
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,042
