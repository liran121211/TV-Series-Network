You want our son. Nathan!

[Hank] It's a Techno-Organic Virus strain,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,458
and the virus
is already spreading rapidly.

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,417
[Jean] What if there's a cure
in yours, Bishop?

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,625
This band only got enough juice
for Nathan and I.

Take care, Jean.

[Magneto] <i>Charles Xavier entrusted me</i>

but merely to accept
that this is a shared world

15

00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,458
Maybe we should take a page
from the Professor's playbook

00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,542
{\an8}Was it caused by atomic testing?

23
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,000
{\an8}Or is it nature herself,

24
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,417
{\an8}deciding the time has come
to change the human race?

25
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:21,667
{\an8}Some say they're freaks,

{\an8}some call them monsters,

27
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,083
{\an8}but all over the planet,
they are known as mutants.

28
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,667
{\an8}We prefer to see it as a world
that misunderstands us.

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,875
{\an8}Fortunately,

30
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,667

{\an8}Well, I am just as flattered

32
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:42,167
{\an8}to be sitting with a renowned scientist
such as yourself, Doctor McCoy.

{\an8}the X-Men's home.

37
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,708
{\an8}A school for mutants,

38
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,958
{\an8}founded by the late
Professor Charles Xavier.

39
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,458
{\an8}Not like regular boring classes.

40
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,417
More hands-on learning, you know?

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,875
But with big death machines
and vampire dinosaurs.

00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,125
[Trish] <i>For many of the X-Men,</i>

43
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,833
<i>Xavier's school
is the only home they've ever known.</i>

44
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,417
<i>People who have fallen through the cracks.</i>

45
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,833
<i>Forgotten.</i>

46
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,458
<i>Desperate to belong.</i>

47
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:20,792
But that sense of belonging
goes worldwide today,

48
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:25,500
as the UN formally admits
the mutant nation of Genosha.

49

[Gambit sighs] This is taking forever.

50
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,333
Gambit, please remember

00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,333
that should the new Blackbird
suffer a malfunction,

52

- [boy] Is that the X-Men?

Lot of smiles at the mansion
when we heard Madelyne Pryor

66
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,458
scored a top spot among Genosha's brass.

67
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,583
The Interim Council wanted an X-Man.

68
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,625
Luckily, you guys could spare a Jean.

69
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,833
[Gambit] Hush, <i>madame.</i>

70
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,583
Two always better than one.

71
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,917
And far better than three.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Most times.

73
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,875
Forgive Gambit's passive adolescence.

74
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,833
He insisted on coming
after Rogue agreed to join me at the gala.

75
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:16,542
I confess, the master of magnetism
was surprised

76
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,583
to receive an invite
bearing the United Nations' seal.

77
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:23,625
- Yeah, I hear it's called "the future."
- [chuckles]

78
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,375
Magneto, the Interim Council
would love a word with you

79
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,750
before tonight's gala.

80
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,042
Privately, if possible.

81
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,917
Hmm. So where the heck does that leave us?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,667
- Ha-ha!
- Dang!

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,250
I'll be a wet bird on a live wire.

84
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,875
Kurt Wagner, how the heck are ya, furball?

86
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:48,417
[in English] We shall play tourist
as the Council speaks with Magneto.

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Kurt joined the Council

88
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,500
to help work with Genosha's
various communities of faith.

89
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,417
Things to see!

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,583
Such wonders in this city.

91
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,167
Long as he left those faithful
killer monks of his back at the monastery.

92
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,125
Ah, a scimitar tongue, Gambit,

93
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,500
you remain as always.

94
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,458
We have much to discuss
since our gothic adventure amid the Alps.

95
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,542
Come.

96
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,125
Everything around us
would not have been possible

97
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,333
without the work of the X-Men.

98
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,125
[laughs]

99
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,250
Oh, my!

100
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,417
It's just like he said it'd be.

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,792
Who? The Professor?

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,958
Uh, yeah, sure.

103
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,292
Always used to say
we'd have a place all our own one day.

104
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,333
{\an8}More than a place.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,042
A home.

106
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,583
Daddy's charging pretty high rent.

107
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,833
Birthing a nation overnight
is not without its share of stumbles.

108
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,042
[chuckles] Ignore him.

109
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,417
Fly can't help but ruin honey.

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,667
Or maybe Gambit's willing to ask questions
no one else will.

111
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,708
Like, why is Magneto suddenly mutant MVP?

112
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,750
- [lively music playing]
- [man singing]

113
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,375
For a man named Gambit,
your poker face is very poor.

114
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,333
Hey, mind your beeswax, furball.

115
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,875
Didn't go ringing for no priest.

116
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:34,250
It does not take a priest to see you
and Rogue's souls touch in every gaze.

117
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,292
[Gambit] Ain't the touch
she be looking for.

118
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,375
[laughs] You Americans.
So theatrical.

119
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,583
Life is violins <i>und</i> close-ups.

120
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,833
I blame soap operas.

121
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,292
Just marry the belle and be done.

122
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,667
Scoundrels like me,
we don't get no white picket reward.

123
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,958
We too busy for love.

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,667
Too busy sinning.

125
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,458
There is no love without sin.

126
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,625
For love is best measured
in what we forgive.

127
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,417
[Trish] I am here with Scott Summers,

128
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,292
also known as Cyclops.

129
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,458
Scott, are you surprised
to see such a bold move in world politics?

130
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,333
Well, if being an X-Man
teaches anything, Ms. Tilby,

131
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,417
it's to expect the unexpected.

132
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
I always kept that in mind
as field leader...

133
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,423
[man] Those shades
are weirding out the lights.

134
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,583
Can you take 'em off?

135
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,833
I can't. Sorry.

136
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,417
So, back as team leader...

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,583
Actually, let's talk about you
and Marvel Girl.

138
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,875
I hear you're the X-Men's power couple.

139
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,542
A love that spans galaxies.

140
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,917
So I have to ask,
when did you know she was the one?

141
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,417
You're skipping the questions, too?

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,583
Hard to interview someone

143
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,000
who can't tell which parts
of her memories belong to her

144
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,000
and which parts belong to her clone.

145
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,167
Even reacquainting myself
with my psychic powers feels

146
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,875
strange.

147
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,500
Like the face of an old friend
seen from every angle

148
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,125
but the one in your memory.

149
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,750
This busted mug
ain't changed in a hundred years,

150
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,833
and you know it.

151
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,250
I remember so many things.

152
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,792
So many with Scott.

153
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,208
You two lovebirds still ain't talking?

154
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,958
He's grieving his son.

155
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,375
Although, the way he's avoiding me
recalls a time.

156
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,792
We were in Nevada.

157
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,750
I had just acquired the power
of a cosmic entity.

158
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,458
The Phoenix.

159
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,458
Oh, right. You were there.

160
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,458
I asked Scott to go on a picnic at sunset.

161
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,750
She seemed nervous
when I asked her to go out.

162
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,250
Like she didn't trust me.

163
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,333
He was scared.

164
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,000
Afraid the Phoenix had changed me.

165
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,625
I wanted to reassure him.

166
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,417
I wanted to show her
that nothing had changed.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,958
She was still the hothead
who knocked my books out of my hand

168
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,208
when I ran into her
on the first day of school.

169
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,917
But I could already
feel the universe speaking to me.

170
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,125
Much like Scott used to
through our special psychic rapport.

171
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,667
She snaps at me,

172
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,875
and then she takes off my ruby glasses,
which hold back my powers.

173
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,542
I needed to anchor myself

174
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,583
because every fiber of me
hungered to leave

175
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,875
and travel the cosmos right then.

176
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,208
And nothing happened.

177
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,583
Jean was using the power of the Phoenix
to block my optic blasts,

178
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,292
and we could see each other's eyes.

179
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,208
They anchored me.

180
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,000
Focused me.

181
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,875
His eyes made me stay.

182
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,625
Now...

183
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,750
I know all about drowning in memories.

184
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,000
Best to look up and keep paddling.

185
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,458
Keep moving, 'cause the past'll
yank ya under if ya don't.

186
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,083
I forget how many sunrises
your eyes have seen.

187
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:47,292
They only ever seen one of you, Red.

188
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,875
Just the one.

189
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,625
Logan,

190
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,542
- I'm...
- You're Jean Grey.

191
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,792
He's Scott Summers.

192
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,125
Those are the rules.

193
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,958
You just forgot 'em for a sec.

194
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,583
Enough said.

195
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,125
Now go talk to that overgrown Boy Scout.

196
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,708
Now, the latest adventure, parenthood.

197
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,667
Jean...

198
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,542
Jean and I don't have any kids.

199
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,625
You don't?

200
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,750
No.

201
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,875
Strange.

202
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,167
I saw hospital records
for one Nathan Charles Summers,

203
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,833
born to Scott and Jean Grey Summers
just last month.

204
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,708
Born at Westchester Memorial?

205
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,167
I spoke to a Dr. Brians there.

206
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,167
He said you told your teammate,
told Rogue...

207
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,750
That jerk wouldn't deliver my...

208
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,333
He called my kid a freak.

209
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,583
Scott, I came here today
to give the X-Men a chance

210
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,167
to show the world
that mutants are just like us, people.

211
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,333
Normal.

212
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,458
And you lie.

213
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,167
Why lie?

214
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,167
Because you're normal.

215
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,667
Excuse me?

216
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,333
I said, because you're normal.

217
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,250
You're ungrateful.

218
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,500
We fight, risk our lives for you.

219
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,875
Evil mutants, robots, crazy aliens.

220
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,167
I gave him up.

221
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,750
I gave him up
because you can't say thank you.

222
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,375
Because I have to stomach your questions
and prove that I'm a person.

223
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,958
I lie because the truth is
we're nothing like you.

224
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:16,958
Thank God, because it's the only reason
you people are still alive.

225
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,917
Recent events have aligned themselves

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,458
in an unprecedented fashion for our kind.

227
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:32,625
With even the most overlooked of us
finally getting a voice.

228
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,125
We need to be thinking about
how to speak loudly

229
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,917
as one united community.

230
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,208
This concerns me and my X-Men, how?

231
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,542
[Emma] We need a handsome jawline
that begs trust and respect.

232
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
A poster child king.

233
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,625
Careful, Ms. Frost.

234
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,625
Don't go filling this man's head
with such notions.

235
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,500
Whose charitable idea was it
to let a human be on the Council?

236
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,083
Were no others available
to weep over semantics?

237
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,417
Moira's a fierce ally to mutants.

238
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,750
And we all agreed
on the title of Chancellor.

239
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,375
[Magneto] You eclectic allotment
of social climbers

240
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,458
wish for me to rule Genosha?

241
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,417
Hilarious.

242
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,292
One could argue, and many sadly do,

243
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,958
that none of us would be here today

244
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,667
were it not for you
and your publicity stunt.

245
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,583
Are there no others better tempered

246
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,917
to stomach the squabble
of human diplomacy?

247
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,292
But Charles be gone, Magneto.

248
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,917
And I may not like it,

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,708
but if Charles trusts you with his X-Men,
he'd trust you with this.

250
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:37,375
We were at a bar in Germany
when he first mentioned his dream.

251
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,708
I laughed at him.

252
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,500
Was he sentimental or suicidal?

253
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,083
Both earn an early grave.

254
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:49,292
He did that smile of his,
that annoying secret smile.

255
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:53,250
"Magneto, any dream worth having
is a dream worth dying for."

256
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,167
We thought we'd perish

257
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,208
before seeing the day
when humanity accepted our people.

258
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,417
Like Moses and the Promised Land,

259
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,083
we would carry the dream,

260
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,958
but never live it.

261
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:05,792
Look, Magnus,

262
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,583
I may not be Jean Grey,

263
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,917
but I know what the Professor
would say if he was here.

264
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,583
"Time to dream bigger."

265
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:18,292
You shall have me on one condition.

266
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,875
[Rogue] I ought to knock you
from here to the North Pole.

267
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,917
You think making me your queen
means we're getting back together?

268
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,792
It is a political calculation, Rogue.

269
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,625
Me, mutant kind's fiercest defender,

270
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:37,292
and you, an X-Man whose touch
allows her to feel anyone's pain.

271
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,167
A true leader, an empathetic one.

272
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,708
Was this your plan all along?

273
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:46,833
Make everyone like ya and then take over?

274
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,542
This was Xavier's design.

275
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:51,625
It is why he gave me his X-Men.

276
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,958
A final chance to uphold the promise
we made to one another so long ago.

277
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,417
But I need help.

278
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,542
You take me for a fool.

279
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,292
Acting like this is all about you
and the Professor.

280
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,583
I won't deny my passion for you.

281
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,917
As with Gambit,

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,375
loving you makes broken men whole
so that even as you deny us,

283
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,125
our heartache is not in vain.

284
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,583
We would be lucky to have you lead.

285
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,667
[Scott] I can't believe
I lost it like that.

286
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh, Scott, anger is normal,
even for mutants.

287
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,500
Sometimes you just have to let go.

288
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,125
[Scott] There are some things
worth holding on to.

289
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,750
Describe him to me.

290
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,583
Describe Nathan.

291
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,833
I see him everywhere.

292
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,542
In every face,
on every street, so clearly.

293
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,042
I can't see color, but up here...

294
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,417
I see these big brown eyes
and his wild rust-colored hair.

295
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,417
It reminds me of...

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,625
Of us.

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,958
[Jean] <i>Don't tell me you can explain.</i>

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,042
Jean!

299
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,125
If you'll excuse us, Madelyne.

300
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,333
[Sebastian] Something wrong,
Miss Pryor?

301
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,458
Sorry, mind just drifted a moment.

302
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,542
Mind drift indeed.

303
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:33,083
Communicating via psychic rapport
was our thing, Scott.

304
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,375
Just stop and let me explain, please.

305
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,583
Explain what? I know what I saw.

306
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,250
- Jean, you...
- How long has it been happening?

307
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,750
A month maybe. I was checking in
after she moved overseas,

308
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,000
- but we ended it...
- Go.

309
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,333
Go to Genosha. Be with my clone.

310
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,792
Oh, dear.

311
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,542
What you saw on the astral plane
was confusion, Jean.

312
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,125
Grief.

313
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,792
She's the mother of my son.

314
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:03,500
That's the one thing
I can be certain about right now.

315
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,167
[Jean] Do you love her?

316
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,542
I love both of you.

317
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,667
Whole galaxies beckoned me.

318
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,542
But I turned my back for you.

319
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,708
Sinister cuts out a part of me
and you love it?

320
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
That wasn't love in there, it's ego.

321
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,500
The music is changing
and you need a chair.

322
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,708
Leader, father, husband...

323
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,750
And you? You don't trust your memories.

324
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,917
Do you even love me?

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,417
My love for you
is the one thing I remember

326
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,542
amid this pain and insanity!

327
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,417
[Scott] Remember? Or feel?

328
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Choose, Jean.

329
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,833
Do not spin this on me.

330
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,417
Do you love me, Jean?

331
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,000
Or am I just a lovely memory?

332
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,625
Jean! What is it?

333
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,167
[Rogue] Hey, there.

334
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,292
Wasn't expecting a lady caller.

335
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,583
What's wrong, <i>chère?</i>

336
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,125
You best sit down.

337
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,083
It was back after I ran away
from my daddy.

338
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:15,042
<i>My evil mother
was helping me with my powers,</i>

339
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,167
<i>said she knew a fella who could help.</i>

340
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,125
<i>An associate.</i>

341
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>The man seemed nice enough.</i>

342
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,292
<i>Seemed to wanna help.</i>

343
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,042
<i>Just not like I thought.</i>

344
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,083
<i>He spent weeks
talking about how mutants were special.</i>

345
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,917
<i>How we'd have our own cities
and culture one day.</i>

346
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,708
<i>He even had plans, too, Remy.</i>

347
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,750
<i>Mutant art, fashion, dance.</i>

348
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:47,583
<i>He showed me that being a mutant
wasn't just about my power.</i>

349
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,667
<i>It could be something more.</i>

350
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,333
<i>And when we realized
that his electromagnetic powers</i>

351
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,083
<i>protected him from my touch,</i>

352
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,250
<i>other things started happening.</i>

353
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,250
<i>But then I started seeing the hurt in him,</i>

354
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,583
<i>like raging waters.</i>

355
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:14,750
<i>There wasn't enough room in our affair
for his demons and mine.</i>

356
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,125
When I joined the X-Men,

357
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,792
Erik said he wouldn't want me
to lose another family.

358
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,375
He acted like it never happened.

359
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,667
We both did.

360
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,732
[Gambit] You gonna accept his offer?

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,417
If Genosha's shown us anything,

362
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,208
it's that we don't need
to be afraid of change.

363
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:41,833
And if I can play a bigger role
in bettering the world,

364
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:45,083
well, that's the whole reason
I became an X-Man.

365
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,043
[Gambit] You never wanted
to make things official.

366
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,750
I respected that.

367
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,708
I played the swamp rat.

368
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,667
[Rogue] And I played your <i>chère.</i>

369
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,042
All the expectations,

370
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:02,042
every time looking at you,
seeing all the things I couldn't do.

371
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,542
[Gambit] Like telling Gambit
the dang truth?

372
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,333
I can't touch you, Remy!

373
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,875
Your heart may beat for me,

374
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,917
but I can't feel it.

375
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,000
You light up everything you touch,

376
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,958
but never me.

377
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,250
Some things be deeper than skin, <i>chère.</i>

378
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,375
[Rogue] Not this.

379
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,708
I wager that fool
will break your heart in two.

380
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
Gambit always knows the odds.

381
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,208
That it?

382
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:31,452
[Gambit] In this game, he do.

383
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,375
Till then, we be friends, <i>mon amie.</i>

384
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:36,917
Just friends.

385
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,792
A drink for my dashing Cajun?

386
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,708
Not enough drink change the fact
that others be more dashing, <i>chère.</i>

387
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,083
Assemble the Council. We need to talk.

388
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,542
Whatever is the matter, Dr. Cooper?

389
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,917
Is it your dress?

390
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,167
My former prosecutor

391
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,125
has likely taken issue
with your choice for Chancellor.

392
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,542
But surely Genosha's right to self-govern

393
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,292
will not only be protected but cherished,

394
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,708
as it is with all UN nations.

395
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:45,167
Most other nations don't allow a terrorist
to be their leader.

396
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,250
Yet so many allow their leaders
to be terrorists.

397
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,042
If it eases your mind,

398
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,250
Magneto accepted only on the condition

399
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,750
that we ask one of the X-Men
to govern with him.

400
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,208
Rogue.

401
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,917
What did she say?

402
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,792
[electronic music playing]

403
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,792
Oh.

404
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,833
- [groans]
- [Cable] <i>Turn it off. The music.</i>

405
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,833
- [Scott] Jean, what is it?
<i>- Madelyne.</i>

406
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,625
Thanks for the dance, sugar,

407
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,625
but Remy was right.

408
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,375
Some things are deeper than skin.

409
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,333
Turn it off, the music.

410
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,958
Get everybody out.

411
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,333
[music continues]

412
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,625
Kill the music.

413
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,708
Cable?

414
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,583
You have to get everyone out.

415
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,833
- Now! He's coming.
- Who's coming? What's going on?

416
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,198
[automated voice] <i>Access failure imminent.</i>
<i>Body slide one.</i>

417
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,333
No, no!

418
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:26,417
Not again.

419
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,625
Your eyes.

420
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,458
You made it.

421
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,375
You survived.

422
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,167
I'm so sorry, Mom.

423
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,750
Sorry for what?

424
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,833
[exploding]

425
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:52,042
[people screaming]

426
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,375
[grunts]

427
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,375
What in tarnation.

428
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:23,792
Rogue, get to the gardens.
Hurry! [screams]

429
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:24,875
[gasps]

430
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,708
[Sentinel] <i>Terminate mutant.</i>

431
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,750
[people clamoring]

432
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,542
[Gambit] Rogue!

433
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:51,917
Remy.

434
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:53,833
[Gambit] He alive.

435
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:55,667
So are you.

436
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,958
Gambit, how many?

437
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,792
Too many.

438
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,375
So many.

439
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,875
Some vile Godzilla Sentinel.

440
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,500
You go at it, you end up dead.

441
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,333
Can't even dent it.

442
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,500
We're trying to evacuate folks now,

443
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,500
but the Morlocks, they stuck in the bay.

444
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,958
Right under its belly.

445
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,792
And there's no way to them.

446
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,167
A promise was made.

447
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,208
- [people screaming]
- Hurry. Almost to the gardens.

448
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:31,542
[Sentinel] <i>Mutants located.</i>

449
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,917
I draw its fire away from the gardens.

450
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,458
Rogue clears a path for Gambit
to the Morlocks.

451
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,875
Save as many as you can.

452
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:53,208
We shall not live our days wondering
if we could've saved more.

453
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,625
Never much cared for roulette.

454
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,958
Then how about we spice up them rules?

455
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,083
[people screaming]

456
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,250
[groans]

457
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,125
They shall be avenged!

458
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,958
- [gasps]
- [Leech] Don't worry.

459
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:29,625
Leech knows Callisto will find us.

460
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,750
If not her, Magneto.

461
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,917
He promised Leech
would never be scared again.

462
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,250
The X-Men are no friends to the Morlocks.

463
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,958
[rumbling in distance]

464
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,042
- [gasps]
- [Sentinel] <i>Mutants located.</i>

465
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,625
<i>Bonne soirée, mes amis.</i>

466
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,333
Now, kindly follow me.

467
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,583
[grunts]

468
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,958
[Sentinel] <i>Omega-level threat detected.</i>

[both grunt]

470
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:45,833
No.

471
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,167
It's too dangerous, <i>chère.</i>

472
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,542
Don't you dare, Erik!

473
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:56,750
You hear me?

474
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,667
He's trying to protect us, Rogue.

475
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,153
[speaks German] Do not be afraid.

476
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,500
<i>Omega threat eliminated.</i>

477
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,667
Gambit see your bet and raise it.

478
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:07,000
'Cause the cards always be in my favor.

479
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,417
[groans]

480
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,625
<i>Mutant intruder neutralized.</i>

481
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,333
The name's Gambit, <i>mon ami.</i>

482
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,042
Remember it.

483
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,083
How many?

484
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,625
How many, damn it?

485
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,167
<i>To reiterate
for those just returning to us.</i>

486
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,792
<i>Regardless of your stance
on recent world events...</i>

487
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:02,917
Oh, my.

488
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,833
<i>the images you are about to see</i>

489
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:06,917

[Rogue sobbing]

491
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,083
Sugar.

492
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,292
I can't feel you.
