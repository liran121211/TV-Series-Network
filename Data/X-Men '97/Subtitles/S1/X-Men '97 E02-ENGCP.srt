00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:05,833
<i>Previously on</i> X-Men...

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,037
<i>The mutant leader's</i>
<i>assassination last year</i>

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:10,625
<i>by former NSA agent Henry Gyrich</i>

4
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,000
<i>has spurred increased sympathy
toward mutants.</i>

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,333
<i>The team,</i>
<i>they'll always be family,</i>

6
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:16,708
<i>but with the baby coming,</i>

7
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,708
maybe it's time to think of a life
beyond the X-Men?

8
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,667
How'd scum like you get your hands
on Sentinel technology?

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,500
You freak shows think
we wouldn't find a way to evolve, too?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,250
I know who we need to see
to find Bolivar Trask.

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,917
<i>The man who killed Charles Xavier.</i>

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,680
<i>Gyrich warned me</i>
<i>you were coming.</i>

13
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:41,792
The last will and testament
of Charles Francis Xavier.

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,042
Everything he built

15
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:48,542
now belongs to me, my X-Men.

16
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>Workers have unloaded
all passengers save one</i>

17
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,792
<i>in what has become
a Coney Island nightmare.</i>

18
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,750
<i>Any sudden moves
and the wheel could come crashing down.</i>

19
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,333
It's okay, honey.

20
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,167
Come to me nice and easy.

21
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,167
Real slow.

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,375
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I...</i>

23
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,167
<i>Art?</i>

24
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,708
<i>Is that who I think it is?</i>

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,083
<i>Saving humans?</i>

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,708
<i>But while it's too soon to tell</i>

27
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:03,208
<i>how recent events
will impact mutant-human relations,</i>

28
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:05,917
<i>one thing is clear
to both humans and mutants.</i>

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,292
I don't get it, Jean.

30
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,042
Did the Professor not trust me?

31
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,375
Maybe we're seeing this wrong.

32
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,917
Maybe he did this for us.

33
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,708
<i>Across the globe, reports are flooding in.</i>

34
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,208
<i>Mutants and humans aided and saved</i>

35
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,333
<i>by the former mutant terrorist</i>

36
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:26,958
<i>who had gone missing
after failing to launch a mutant rebellion</i>

37
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:30,583
<i>following Charles Xavier's assassination
last year.</i>

38
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,208
<i>And we're hearing
the international community</i>

39
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,792
<i>is closely monitoring the situation,
with some demanding</i>

40
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,333
<i>this unlikely savior
answer for his past crimes.</i>

41
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,500
This is our home, you pig,

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,333
it's all we have left,

43
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,542
all you dogs left us.

44
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,833
You think regular folks can sleep

45
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,417
knowing you demons are down here, lurking?

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,958
Please, don't hurt Leech.

47
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,250
The depths you humans go.

48
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:09,000
Even denying these outcasts
the indignity of your waste.

49
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,542
Electricity and magnetism
are intimately acquainted.

50
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,042
How unfortunate for you

51
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,292
that I am the master of magnetism.

52
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:22,958
Dirty mutant.

53
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,292
You'll get what's coming...

54
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,292
You're him!

55
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,792
- You're...
- Magneto.

56
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:39,750
And I promise you, child,
you shall never be afraid again.

57
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,917
What was the Professor thinking?

58
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,167
"The only safe and sure way
to destroy your enemy

59
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,500
"is to make him your friend."

60
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,875
Mark Twain.

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,208
Beast isn't wrong.
The Professor had a plan.

62
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,625
Seen a lot of futures,
but Magneto leading the X-Men?

63
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,375
That's a new one.

64
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,875
Maybe we go change it back, huh?

65
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,083
Look, plenty of us at this table
have paths so dirty

66
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,792
they don't squeak
no matter how much spit you got.

67
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,458
Maybe we should take a page
from the Professor's playbook

68
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,000
and give Erik a second shot.

69
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,917
I have arranged for the Morlocks

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
to travel to the mutant nation of Genosha.

71
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:24,917
It saddens me that none of you,
nor Xavier himself,

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,083
thought to use
his considerable finances to do the same.

73
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,583
But this is one of many mutant matters

74
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,792
on which we can
and will improve, my X-Men.

75
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,875
Guess we can assume

76
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,625
- those jerks in the sewer are...
- Alive, but not unharmed.

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,833
The tragic fact
that I did not consign those <i>sapiens</i>

78
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:50,375
to the waste bin of history
is proof of my desire

79
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,250
to honor Charles Xavier's dream
of mutant-human...

80
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,083
...coexistence.

81
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,375
Okay, prove it.

82
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,833
Let Jean scan your mind,
see your real plans.

83
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,625
Scott, no.

84
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,292
What? You did it with Gyrich.

85
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,708
I accessed Gyrich's mind for information.

86
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,250
Using my powers
to assess honesty is another matter.

87
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,167
Even if I sensed
Magneto's intentions were sincere,

88
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,250
that's today, this hour, this minute.

89
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,167
Then we check every minute of every day.

90
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,875
I was under the welcome impression

91
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,000
that you and Mrs. Summers were leaving us.

92
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,000
Not a chance.
I'm keeping an eye on you.

93
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,667
Scott, read the will again.

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,250
Like it or not,
this is what the Professor wanted.

95
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,875
Please,

96
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,750
my intentions here
were not to cause drama or discord.

97
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,667
You must understand.
You have been our fiercest foe for years.

98
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,875
A desire for you to prove yourself
is only natural.

99
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,375
And Storm,

100
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:51,500
you are the closest thing to a goddess
as we will ever see.

101
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,750
So, I do not lightly deny your request

102
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,708
and demand your trust instead.

103
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,125
Xavier wanted this.

104
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,667
Maybe he was wrong.

105
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,500
After all our tête-à-têtes,

106
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,958
you have finally realized
what I did ages ago.

107
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,708
Even Charles Xavier can make a mistake.

108
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,417
Haven't worn this old thing

109
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
since that battle
in the Blue Area of the Moon.

110
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,917
I was possessed
by a malevolent cosmic entity

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,667
intent on consuming all of existence.

112
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,167
But there was Scott,

113
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,042
fighting by my side.

114
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,125
You are afraid
that he will no longer leave

115
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,125
now that Magneto has taken charge.

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,833
Can I tell you something?

117
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,625
I need to tell you something

118
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,542
and I need you not to judge me
too harshly.

119
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,208
Or tell Scott.

120
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,583
You have my word, Jean.

121
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,583
There are times
when I think about the baby,

122
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,083
his future, and I...

123
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,708
If he's a mutant,

124
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,000
how do I tell him he's different?

125
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,833
That the world
will remind him of it every day.

126
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,125
That he must always be careful,
always be on guard, or else...

127
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,083
You wish him to be born human.

128
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,542
I have wondered
what it would be like to be human.

129
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,708
It is a tempting daydream.

130
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:19,417
But then I remember how my mutant gifts
brought me to this mansion,

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to this family,

132
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,583
to a sister.

133
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Thank you, Storm.

134
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,625
Just ever since
I was in Gyrich's mind,

135
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,250
I can't shake this feeling
that something terrible is coming.

136
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,208
Boy, I sound like a fool.

137
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,292
No, Jean.

138
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,875
You sound like a mother.

139
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,417
Well, your little pep talk

140
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,458
went about as smooth
as a dozen cats in a yarn store.

141
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,042
I wish to be alone, Rogue.

142
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,500
Ugh! Giving me the heebie-jeebies,

143
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,750
pouting with that old bucket of yours.

144
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,917
Back when we were friends,

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,667
I would always sense Charles in my mind.

146
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,708
Not invading, more a presence.

147
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,542
I was in his thoughts and he in mine.

148
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,167
When we parted ways,

149
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,167
I told myself I needed this

150
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,042
to protect myself from his psychic powers.

151
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,333
But you were worried
if you still felt how much he loved you,

152
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,208
you wouldn't be able
to go through with your crusade.

153
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,958
And yet, here you are,

154
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,792
dragged in like a kitty cat's prize.

155
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,708
Xavier's sacrifice

156
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,750
brought about a world
more tolerant towards mutants.

157
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,042
I am indebted to honor his last wish,

158
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,083
even if his X-Men won't trust me.

159
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,375
Perhaps they are right not to.

160
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,917
My past is too littered with error.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,125
Mine was, too, remember?

162
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,042
But the X-Men still took me in.

163
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:55,292
The thing is,
I didn't go about demanding their trust.

164
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,958
I earned it.

165
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,125
I feared you would do your best

166
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,375
to avoid being alone with me, Rogue.

167
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,458
Do you think your team
would still trust you if they knew?

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,042
That was a long time ago, Erik.

169
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,750
And that cat's got to stay in its bag,
you hear me?

170
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,125
Ready yourselves, my X-Men.

171
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,625
We don't lose our cool
when the good guys show up.

172
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,167
You were saying?

173
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,792
We're here for Magneto.

174
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,333
Think twice.

175
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,458
Our rifles are resistant
to your electromagnetic powers.

176
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,208
I should have thought twice?

177
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Magneto, by order of the UN Commission
on Superhuman Activities,

178
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,083
I hereby place you under arrest
for crimes against humanity.

179
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,750
You will stand trial
at the UN Headquarters.

180
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,125
Should I successfully vindicate myself

181
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,500
in what I will generously assume
is a fair trial,

182
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,417
will I earn your trust?

183
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,792
That is how due process works.

184
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,875
Then...

185
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,958
I yield.

186
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,750
<i>These acts prove Magneto's guilt
beyond any doubt</i>

187
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,625
<i>and offer a preview of the zeal</i>

188
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,750
<i>with which he would resume his quest
to dominate this planet,</i>

189
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,833
<i>should he be exonerated today.</i>

190
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,667
<i>Justice is overdue.</i>

191
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,292
Any updates?

192
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,875
Cooper's listing every nasty step

193
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,292
Magneto's taken from here to Asteroid M.

194
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,000
Folks outside are pissed
he's even getting a trial.

195
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,292
Can't say I blame 'em.

196
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,625
Have you seen Scott?

197
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,833
He's there with the others

198
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,125
making sure Magneto doesn't pull
one of his stunts.

199
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,583
Oh, he didn't tell me.

200
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,750
Lot of that going around lately.

201
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,083
- Down with muties!
- Down with mutants!

202
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,292
Come out here, cowards!

203
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,917
People will look back on today

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,250
and say it was the beginning of a new age.

205
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,042
The day mankind made Magneto pay.

206
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,750
Folks out there want the UN's heads
just as much as his.

207
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,792
Stir the pot, boys,
and keep 'em distracted.

208
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,750
I'll only have one shot.

209
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,375
<i>The defendant may now speak.</i>

210
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:22,167
As a boy, my people's homes
were burned to ash

211
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,042
because we dared
to call God by another name.

212
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,167
Then, my people hunted me

213
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,750
with those who had once hunted them.

214
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,167
I was a freak, born a mutant.

215
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,292
<i>An abomination to their misnamed gods.</i>

216
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,667
In history's sad song, there is a refrain.

217
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,542
Believe differently,

218
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,208
<i>love differently,</i>

219
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,875
<i>be of different sex or skin,
and be punished.</i>

220
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,292
<i>We sing this song to one another.</i>

221
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,083
<i>The oppressed become oppressors.</i>

222
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,917
Xavier knew this

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,292
and dreamed we could change, find harmony.

224
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,250
A future where human and mutant

225
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,792
could relinquish the past and finally...

226
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,750
You claim justice is overdue.

227
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,333
Indeed,

228
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,292
but so is healing.

229
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:20,375
Your words, while kind, do nothing
to heal those hurt by your crimes.

230
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:25,417
And your sound-bite indignation
will not heal mutant wounds.

231
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,042
You build robots to hunt us,

232
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,000
collars to chain our power.

233
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,750
Humanity must protect itself.

234
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,875
Protection?

235
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,708
That is extermination.

236
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:41,833
I have only ever acted
to avenge crimes against my people,

237
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:45,542
as you act to avenge
those against yours today.

238
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,833
If that were the case,
are we truly to believe, then,

239
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,875
that in the face
of what you consider to be extermination,

240
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,792
you would walk Charles Xavier's path?

241
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,625
Not the worst thing,
this don't go Magneto's way,

242
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,708
don't you think?

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,160
<i>They've broken through the barriers.</i>

244
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,208
<i>We can't hold 'em back.</i>

245
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,542
<i>Deploy smoke! Deploy smoke!</i>

246
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
Protesters are breaching the perimeter.

247
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,125
They must want Magneto.

248
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,333
And the judges, ma'am.

249
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,542
What in the blazes did we do?

250
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,833
You gave a monster a trial.

251
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,750
Now, you are traitors to your kind.

252
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,667
Oh, to play by the rules
and still they come for you.

253
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,583
Storm, watch Magneto and the judges.

254
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,333
The rest of us will back up the guards.

255
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,750
Our goal is de-escalation.

256
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,958
- <i>Protesters are demanding...</i>
- Jean, gotta get into the city.

257
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:38,875
Crowd's lost their blasted mind.

258
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,125
Logan,

259
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,667
he's...

260
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,750
He's here.

261
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,833
Who? Apocalypse?

262
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,833
The baby!

263
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,333
Oh, crap.

264
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,167
Careful, Logan!

265
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,948
Get out of the way!

266
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,333
Get out of the way!

267
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,493
Hang tight, Jeanie.

268
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,542
Almost there.

269
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,292
Almost there.

270
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,768
Can't hide forever, you freak!

271
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,000
No more mutants!

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,167
Rogue, secure the perimeter outside.

273
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,375
This way to the traitors!

274
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:40,208
I am unable to ascertain
the nature of the weapon on his back,

275
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,292
but his armor

276
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,583
is constructed from an energy-resistant
titanium-laced alloy.

277
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,292
You got a name?

278
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,792
X-Cutioner.

279
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,500
Here to make sure gene freaks like Magneto
pay for their crimes.

280
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:54,917
Darn mutants!

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,125
Get 'em!

282
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,708
Round two. Absorb this!

283
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,875
Hurt my friends?

284
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,625
Well, now you answer to me.

285
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,333
Humanity answers to no one!

286
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,042
Know what I hate about your kind?

287
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,208
You act like you got it so bad.

288
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,572
Normal people have it hard, too.

289
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,625
Harder!

290
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,167
We just have the dignity
not to whine about it.

291
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,292
You see? It's the whining.

292
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,583
I hate your whining
just as much as I hate you.

293
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,417
<i>Scott, hurry!</i>

294
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
Jean, you're in pain.

295
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,917
<i>The baby's coming, Scott.</i>

296
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,333
Storm, Jean's in labor.

297
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,333
Morph's here, but they're losing the line!

298
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,500
Rogue, fly Cyclops to Jean immediately.

299
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,833
Magneto and I will protect the judges.

300
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,500
<i>Be careful, Storm.</i>
<i>It's still Magneto.</i>

301
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,375
Circumstances do not offer us a choice.

302
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,500
I need your men stationed at every door.

303
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,417
I want those in the lobby
to assist the other X-Men.

304
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,542
You, uncollar Magneto. You...

305
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,000
- Well, now who does she think she...
- Do not think.

306
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,083
Be silent. Heed my commands
and you shall survive.

307
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,083
What do you mean,
"don't do mutant births"?

308
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,375
You people can lose control
of your powers.

309
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,833
And if she needs a C-section...

310
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,417
I'll show you a C-section, bub.

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,042
Jean.

312
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,667
Darling, I'm here.

313
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,167
This doctor won't deliver our baby.

314
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,000
Rogue, can you use your powers
to siphon his medical expertise?

315
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,833
Excuse me? Do what?

316
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,333
Cyclops, if I slip
and touch your baby, my powers...

317
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,625
Rogue, I trust you.

318
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,750
We both do.

319
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,333
Enough! You all need to...

320
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,417
Sorry, sugar.

321
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,625
Prep an IV and get this lady to a room.

322
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,417
- Found you, muties!
- Go! Go! Go!

323
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,833
Filthy muties!

324
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,750
Magneto.

325
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,833
Get 'em!

326
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,042
Be animals

327
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,958
and be caged!

328
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,292
Let us see how their mob manners

329
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,917
fare against the shock of good conduct.

330
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,667
Magneto!

331
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,333
Storm!

332
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,167
Ahh!

333
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,792
The breeze is gone.

334
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,750
I cannot feel it, nor the moisture,

335
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,333
nor the air.

336
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,917
What has he done to me?

337
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,500
Magneto, this was not what we wanted.

338
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,833
Lies.

339
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,500
This is your dream.

340
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,583
My kind splayed before you,

341
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,708
powerless and afraid.

342
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:22,458
All the X-Men have done
is use their awesome power

343
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:26,000
to protect a world
that hates and fears them.

344
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,042
Behold their reward.

345
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,292
What must we do to be good enough?

346
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,583
Is this the high road's destination?

347
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,833
If so, I say,
as I have too many times before,

348
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,417
never again.

349
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,333
No!

350
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,042
Let us go! No!

351
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,583
Oh, dear.

352
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,833
Bigot,

353
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,917
ingrate,

354
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,167
sycophant, worm.

355
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,875
So small I could smite you with a step.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,208
There was a time I would smite you all
for what was done to Storm.

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But today,

358
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,708
I have saved you from your own,

359
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:56,375
for an old friend has challenged me
to remember this view of Earth.

360
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,583
How vast it is
versus how small we make it.

361
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:05,417
Charles Xavier entrusted me
with his dream,

362
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:10,708
and it does not ask you to love
or embrace my kind as your own,

363
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,667
but merely to accept
that this is a shared world

364
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,042
with a common future,

365
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:23,792
and that my kind, like yours,
have the right to live in it.

366
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,542
I am trying to be better.

367
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,083
Please...

368
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,500
Do not make me let you down.

369
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,125
Look, he has your eyes.

370
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,458
Well, doesn't he need a name?

371
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,333
I was thinking "Nathan."

372
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,083
Yeah.

373
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,958
That's my boy, Nathan Summers.

374
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,625
Nathan Charles Summers.

375
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>The United Nations
stunned the world this week</i>

376
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,417
<i>when it issued a pardon for Magneto,</i>

377
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,458
<i>due in no small part
to the former mutant terrorist's efforts</i>

378
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:14,542
<i>in saving the tribunal
and quelling the insurrection.</i>

379
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,125
<i>In another gesture of goodwill</i>

380
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,167
<i>in our efforts to improve relations
with our mutant brethren,</i>

381
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,458
<i>we will begin talks to admit
the mutant nation of Genosha</i>

382
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,083
<i>into the United Nations.</i>

383
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,667
- Poison?
- Dark roast.

384
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,833
Genosha, a UN nation.

385
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,958
Never thought I'd see the day.

386
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,458
I hear you and Jean
have begun to make arrangements to leave.

387
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,125
Does this mean you trust me

388
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,542
to carry on Xavier's dream?

389
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,833
The Professor trusted you,
and I trust him.

390
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,458
I guess that'll have to be enough.

391
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,250
If I may offer advice, Scott.

392
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Be wary.

393
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,083
Be vigilant.

394
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,792
Tragedy lures with fortune first.

395
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,125
This was a good week for our people.

396
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,083
Yet it was not without cost.

397
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,250
Inhibitor collars use radiation

398
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,125
to temporarily neutralize
our mutant powers.

399
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,208
The X-Cutioner's laser rifle

400
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:25,375
fired a concentrated dose
of that same radiation.

401
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,583
It affects genetics on a cellular level,

402
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:33,042
suppressing a mutant's abilities
without the need for a collar itself.

403
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:35,417
Ororo...

404
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,333
How long?

405
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:41,417
- Additional tests will be needed before...
- Hank, please.

406
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,958
How long?

407
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,750
The effects appear permanent.

408
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,042
We'll fix this.

409
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,292
Scott and I aren't going anywhere, okay?

410
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,417
Not until you're well again. I swear.

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,125
Beast, we need to contact Muir Island.

412
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,333
<i>Jean, my sister.</i>

413
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,042
<i>You of all the X-Men
know the heartbreak of saying goodbye,</i>

414
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,958
<i>having said it so many times.</i>

415
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,958
<i>So I ask
that you help the others understand</i>

416
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:39,292
<i>why I could not stay to say it this day.</i>

417
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,417
<i>My faith in your family's future
is strong.</i>

418
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,917
<i>And I cannot rob you of a bond
you have more than earned.</i>

419
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,625
<i>It is human nature to crave connection,</i>

420
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,708
<i>as it is also mutant nature to be heard,</i>

421
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>seen,</i>

422
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>to feel another soul finally seeing yours.</i>

423
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,417
<i>Connection is a fragile treasure.</i>

424
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,125
<i>One we sacrifice so much to maintain.</i>

425
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,375
<i>Only to then sometimes</i>
<i>watch it break in a blink</i>

426
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>that changes your life forever.</i>

427
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,875
<i>We are no longer connected, Jean.</i>

428
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:40,000
<i>And now we walk
in two very different worlds.</i>

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,167
<i>But trust that I will cherish
what we shared as X-Men,</i>

430
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,375
<i>memories that already feel
like a lifetime ago.</i>

431
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,097
"Like another woman's life.

432
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,750
"Or another person's dream.

433
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,333
"Love, Ororo."

434
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,833
If only I hadn't left the UN,
I could have...

435
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,184
You did what you had to.

436
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,792
Storm did the same.

437
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,167
And we will respect her decision.

438
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,250
That so?

439
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,375
The blast had your name on it.

440
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,292
Should be you leaving, <i>mon ami.</i>

441
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,208
I don't buy it.

442
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,792
Not one minute.

443
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,059
Storm will spend a day
schlepping it with the basic folk

444
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,208
and come right home,

445
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:23,542
happy as a...

446
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,042
Ha! What did I say?

447
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:27,750
She's back!

448
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,792
Jean?

449
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,625
I need the X-Men.

450
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,667
What? Jean?
