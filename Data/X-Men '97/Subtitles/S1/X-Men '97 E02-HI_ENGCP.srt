You freak shows think
we wouldn't find a way to evolve, too?

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,292
[sighs] I don't get it, Jean.

38
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,042
Did the Professor not trust me?

39
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,375
Maybe we're seeing this wrong.

40
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,917
Maybe he did this for us.

all you dogs left us.

52
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,833
You think regular folks can sleep

53
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,417
knowing you demons are down here, lurking?

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,958
Please, don't hurt Leech.

Even denying these outcasts
the indignity of your waste.

58
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,542
Electricity and magnetism
are intimately acquainted.

59
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,042
How unfortunate for you

60
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,292
that I am the master of magnetism.

61
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:22,958
Dirty mutant.

62
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,292
You'll get what's coming...
[mumbles indistinctly]

63
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,292
You're him!

64
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,792
- You're...
- Magneto.

65
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:39,750
And I promise you, child,
you shall never be afraid again.

66
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,917
What was the Professor thinking?

67
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,167
"The only safe and sure way
to destroy your enemy

68
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,500
"is to make him your friend."

69
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,875
Mark Twain.

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,208
Beast isn't wrong.
The Professor had a plan.

71
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,625
Seen a lot of futures,
but Magneto leading the X-Men?

72
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,375
That's a new one.

73
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,875
Maybe we go change it back, huh?

74
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,083
Look, plenty of us at this table
have paths so dirty

75
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,792
they don't squeak
no matter how much spit you got.

76
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,458
Maybe we should take a page
from the Professor's playbook

77
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,000
and give Erik a second shot.

78
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,917
I have arranged for the Morlocks

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
to travel to the mutant nation of Genosha.

80
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:24,917
It saddens me that none of you,
nor Xavier himself,

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,083
thought to use
his considerable finances to do the same.

82
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,583
But this is one of many mutant matters

83
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,792
on which we can
and will improve, my X-Men.

84
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,875
Guess we can assume

85
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,625
- those jerks in the sewer are...
- Alive, but not unharmed.

86
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,833
The tragic fact
that I did not consign those <i>sapiens</i>

87
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:50,375
to the waste bin of history
is proof of my desire

88
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,250
to honor Charles Xavier's dream
of mutant-human...

89
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,083
[sighs] ...coexistence.

90
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,375
Okay, prove it.

91
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,833
Let Jean scan your mind,
see your real plans.

92
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,625
Scott, no.

93
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,292
What? You did it with Gyrich.

94
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,708
I accessed Gyrich's mind for information.

95
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,250
Using my powers
to assess honesty is another matter.

96
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,167
Even if I sensed
Magneto's intentions were sincere,

97
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,250
that's today, this hour, this minute.

98
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,167
Then we check every minute of every day.

99
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,875
I was under the welcome impression

100
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,000
that you and Mrs. Summers were leaving us.

101
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,000
Not a chance.
I'm keeping an eye on you.

102
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,667
Scott, read the will again.

103
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,250
Like it or not,
this is what the Professor wanted.

104
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,875
Please,

105
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,750
my intentions here
were not to cause drama or discord.

106
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,667
You must understand.
You have been our fiercest foe for years.

107
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,875
A desire for you to prove yourself
is only natural.

108
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,375
And Storm,

109
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:51,500
you are the closest thing to a goddess
as we will ever see.

110
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,750
So, I do not lightly deny your request

111
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,708
and demand your trust instead.

112
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,125
Xavier wanted this.

113
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,667
Maybe he was wrong.

114
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,500
After all our tête-à-têtes,

115
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,958
you have finally realized
what I did ages ago.

116
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,708
Even Charles Xavier can make a mistake.

117
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,417
Haven't worn this old thing

118
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
since that battle
in the Blue Area of the Moon.

119
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,917
I was possessed
by a malevolent cosmic entity

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,667
intent on consuming all of existence.

121
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,167
But there was Scott,

122
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,042
fighting by my side.

123
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,125
[Storm] You are afraid
that he will no longer leave

124
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,125
now that Magneto has taken charge.

125
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,833
Can I tell you something?

126
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,625
I need to tell you something

127
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,542
and I need you not to judge me
too harshly.

128
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,208
Or tell Scott.

129
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,583
[Storm] You have my word, Jean.

130
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,583
There are times
when I think about the baby,

131
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,083
his future, and I...

132
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,708
If he's a mutant,

133
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,000
how do I tell him he's different?

134
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,833
That the world
will remind him of it every day.

135
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,125
That he must always be careful,
always be on guard, or else...

136
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,083
You wish him to be born human.

137
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,542
I have wondered
what it would be like to be human.

138
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,708
It is a tempting daydream.

139
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:19,417
But then I remember how my mutant gifts
brought me to this mansion,

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to this family,

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,583
to a sister.

142
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Thank you, Storm.

143
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,625
[sighs] Just ever since
I was in Gyrich's mind,

144
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,250
I can't shake this feeling
that something terrible is coming.

145
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,833
[scoffs]

146
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,208
Boy, I sound like a fool.

147
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,875
[sighs]

148
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,292
No, Jean.

149
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,875
You sound like a mother.

150
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,417
[Rogue] Well, your little pep talk

151
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,458
went about as smooth
as a dozen cats in a yarn store.

152
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,042
[Magneto] I wish to be alone, Rogue.

153
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,500
Ugh! Giving me the heebie-jeebies,

154
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,750
pouting with that old bucket of yours.

155
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,917
[Magneto] Back when we were friends,

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,667
I would always sense Charles in my mind.

157
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,708
Not invading, more a presence.

158
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,542
I was in his thoughts and he in mine.

159
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,167
When we parted ways,

160
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,167
I told myself I needed this

161
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,042
to protect myself from his psychic powers.

162
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,333
[Rogue] But you were worried
if you still felt how much he loved you,

163
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,208
you wouldn't be able
to go through with your crusade.

164
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,958
And yet, here you are,

165
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,792
dragged in like a kitty cat's prize.

166
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,708
Xavier's sacrifice

167
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,750
brought about a world
more tolerant towards mutants.

168
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,042
I am indebted to honor his last wish,

169
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,083
even if his X-Men won't trust me.

170
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,375
Perhaps they are right not to.

171
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,917
My past is too littered with error.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,125
[Rogue] Mine was, too, remember?

173
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,042
But the X-Men still took me in.

174
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:55,292
The thing is,
I didn't go about demanding their trust.

175
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,958
I earned it.

176
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,125
I feared you would do your best

177
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,375
to avoid being alone with me, Rogue.

178
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,458
Do you think your team
would still trust you if they knew?

179
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,042
That was a long time ago, Erik.

180
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,750
And that cat's got to stay in its bag,
you hear me?

[helicopters whirring]

182
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,125
Ready yourselves, my X-Men.

183
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,625
We don't lose our cool
when the good guys show up.

184
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,042
[rifles powering up]

185
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,167
You were saying?

186
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,792
[Dr. Cooper] We're here for Magneto.

187
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,333
Think twice.

188
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,458
Our rifles are resistant
to your electromagnetic powers.

189
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,208
- [alarms blaring]
- [gasps]

190
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,208
I should have thought twice?

191
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Magneto, by order of the UN Commission
on Superhuman Activities,

192
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,083
I hereby place you under arrest
for crimes against humanity.

193
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,750
You will stand trial
at the UN Headquarters.

194
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,125
Should I successfully vindicate myself

195
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,500
in what I will generously assume
is a fair trial,

196
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,417
will I earn your trust?

197
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,792
That is how due process works.

198
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,875
Then...

199
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,958
I yield.

200
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,250
[inhibitor collar beeping]

201
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,750
<i>These acts prove Magneto's guilt

202
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,625

203
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,750
<i>with which he would resume his quest
to dominate this planet,</i>

204
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,833

205
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,667
<i>Justice is overdue.</i>

206
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,292
Any updates?

Cooper's listing every nasty step

208
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,292
Magneto's taken from here to Asteroid M.

209
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,000
Folks outside are pissed
he's even getting a trial.

210
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,292
Can't say I blame 'em.

211
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,625
Have you seen Scott?

212
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,833
He's there with the others

213
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,125
making sure Magneto doesn't pull
one of his stunts.

214
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,583
Oh, he didn't tell me.

215
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,750
Lot of that going around lately.

216
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,917
[increases volume]

217
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,083
- Down with muties!
- Down with mutants!

218
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,292
Come out here, cowards!

219
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,917
[Denti] People will look back on today

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,250
and say it was the beginning of a new age.

221
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,042
The day mankind made Magneto pay.

222
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,750
Folks out there want the UN's heads
just as much as his.

223
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,792
Stir the pot, boys,
and keep 'em distracted.

224
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,750
I'll only have one shot.

225
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,292
[gavel bangs]

[judge] <i>The defendant may now speak.</i>

227
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:22,167
As a boy, my people's homes
were burned to ash

228
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,042
because we dared
to call God by another name.

229
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,167
Then, my people hunted me

230
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,750
with those who had once hunted them.

231
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,167
I was a freak, born a mutant.

232
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,292
<i>An abomination to their misnamed gods.</i>

233
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,667
In history's sad song, there is a refrain.

234
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,542
Believe differently,

235
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,208
<i>love differently,</i>

236
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,875

<i>We sing this song to one another.</i>

238
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,083
<i>The oppressed become oppressors.</i>

239
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,917
Xavier knew this

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,292
and dreamed we could change, find harmony.

241
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,250
A future where human and mutant

242
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,792
could relinquish the past and finally...

243
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,417
[sighs wearily]

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,750
You claim justice is overdue.

245
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,333
Indeed,

246
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,292
but so is healing.

247
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:20,375
Your words, while kind, do nothing
to heal those hurt by your crimes.

248
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:25,417
And your sound-bite indignation
will not heal mutant wounds.

249
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,042
You build robots to hunt us,

250
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,000
collars to chain our power.

251
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,750
Humanity must protect itself.

252
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,875
Protection?

253
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,708
That is extermination.

254
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:41,833
I have only ever acted
to avenge crimes against my people,

255
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:45,542
as you act to avenge
those against yours today.

256
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,833
If that were the case,
are we truly to believe, then,

257
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,875
that in the face
of what you consider to be extermination,

258
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,792
you would walk Charles Xavier's path?

259
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,625
Not the worst thing,
this don't go Magneto's way,

260
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,708
don't you think?

<i>They've broken through the barriers.</i>

00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
Protesters are breaching the perimeter.

265
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,125
They must want Magneto.

266
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,333
And the judges, ma'am.

267
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,542
What in the blazes did we do?

268
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,833
You gave a monster a trial.

269
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,750
Now, you are traitors to your kind.

270
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,667
Oh, to play by the rules
and still they come for you.

271
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,583
Storm, watch Magneto and the judges.

272
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,333
The rest of us will back up the guards.

273
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,750
Our goal is de-escalation.

He's here.

- Hang tight, Jeanie.

titanium-laced alloy.

Know what I hate about your kind?

309
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,208
You act like you got it so bad.

310
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,572
Normal people have it hard, too.

311
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,625
Harder!

312
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,167
We just have the dignity
not to whine about it.

313
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,292
You see? It's the whining.

314
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,583

Rogue, fly Cyclops to Jean immediately.

I need your men stationed at every door.

I want those in the lobby

You, uncollar Magneto. You...

- Well, now who does she think she...
- Do not think.

What do you mean,
"don't do mutant births"?

00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,375
You people can lose control
of your powers.

334

And if she needs a C-section...

335
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,417
I'll show you a C-section, bub.

Darling, I'm here.

This doctor won't deliver our baby.

Rogue, can you use your powers
to siphon his medical expertise?

340
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,833
Excuse me? Do what?

341
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,333
Cyclops, if I slip
and touch your baby, my powers...

342
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,625
Rogue, I trust you.

343
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,750
We both do.

Enough! You all need to...

00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,917
fare against the shock of good conduct.

356
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
[weapon powering up]

357
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,667
[Storm] Magneto!

358
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,000
[Storm yelps]

359
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,333
Storm!

360
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,917
[grunts]

361
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:26,917
[Storm groans]

362
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,167
Ahh! [grunts]

363
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,792
[groans]

364
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,792
[gasps] The breeze is gone.

365
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,750
I cannot feel it, nor the moisture,

366
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,333
nor the air.

367
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,917
What has he done to me?

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,542
[Storm sobbing]

369
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,500
Magneto, this was not what we wanted.

370
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,833
Lies.

371
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,500
This is your dream.

372
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,583
My kind splayed before you,

373
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,708
powerless and afraid.

374
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:22,458
All the X-Men have done
is use their awesome power

375
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:26,000
to protect a world
that hates and fears them.

376
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,042
Behold their reward.

377
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,292
What must we do to be good enough?

378
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,583
Is this the high road's destination?

379
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,833
If so, I say,
as I have too many times before,

380
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,417
never again.

381
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,125
[gasping]

382
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,875
- [rumbling]
- [people screaming]

383
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,333
[judge] No!

384
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,042
Let us go! No!

385
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,583
Oh, dear.

386
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,792
[gasps]

387
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,208
[all shivering]

388
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,833
Bigot,

389
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,917
ingrate,

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,167
sycophant, worm.

391
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,875
So small I could smite you with a step.

392
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,208
There was a time I would smite you all
for what was done to Storm.

393
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But today,

394
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,708
I have saved you from your own,

395
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:56,375
for an old friend has challenged me
to remember this view of Earth.

396
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,583
How vast it is
versus how small we make it.

397
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:05,417
Charles Xavier entrusted me
with his dream,

398
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:10,708
and it does not ask you to love
or embrace my kind as your own,

399
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,667
but merely to accept
that this is a shared world

400
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,042
with a common future,

401
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:23,792
and that my kind, like yours,
have the right to live in it.

402
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,542
I am trying to be better.

403
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,083
- Please...
- [groans]

404
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,500
Do not make me let you down.

405
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,458
[cooing]

406
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,125
Look, he has your eyes.

407
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,208
[Cyclops chuckles]

408
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,458
Well, doesn't he need a name?

409
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,333
I was thinking "Nathan."

410
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,083
[Cyclops] Yeah.

411
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,958
That's my boy, Nathan Summers.

412
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,625
Nathan Charles Summers.

413
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>The United Nations
stunned the world this week</i>

414
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,417
<i>when it issued a pardon for Magneto,</i>

415
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,458
<i>due in no small part
to the former mutant terrorist's efforts</i>

416
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:14,542
<i>in saving the tribunal
and quelling the insurrection.</i>

417
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,125
<i>In another gesture of goodwill</i>

418
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,167
<i>in our efforts to improve relations
with our mutant brethren,</i>

419
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,458
<i>we will begin talks to admit
the mutant nation of Genosha</i>

420
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,083
<i>into the United Nations.</i>

421
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,667
- Poison?
- Dark roast.

422
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,833
Genosha, a UN nation.

423
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,958
Never thought I'd see the day.

424
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,458
I hear you and Jean
have begun to make arrangements to leave.

425
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,125
Does this mean you trust me

426
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,542
to carry on Xavier's dream?

427
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,833
The Professor trusted you,
and I trust him.

428
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,458
I guess that'll have to be enough.

429
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,250
If I may offer advice, Scott.

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Be wary.

431
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,083
Be vigilant.

432
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,792
Tragedy lures with fortune first.

433
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,125
This was a good week for our people.

434
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,083
Yet it was not without cost.

435
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,250
[clears throat]
Inhibitor collars use radiation

436
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,125
to temporarily neutralize
our mutant powers.

437
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,208
The X-Cutioner's laser rifle

438
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:25,375
fired a concentrated dose
of that same radiation.

439
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,583
It affects genetics on a cellular level,

440
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:33,042
suppressing a mutant's abilities
without the need for a collar itself.

441
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:35,417
Ororo...

442
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,333
[Storm] How long?

443
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:41,417
- Additional tests will be needed before...
- Hank, please.

444
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,958
How long?

445
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,750
- The effects appear permanent.
- [gasps softly]

446
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,042
[Jean] We'll fix this.

447
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,292
Scott and I aren't going anywhere, okay?

448
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,417
Not until you're well again. I swear.

449
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,125
Beast, we need to contact Muir Island.

450
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,875
- [thunderclap]
- [gasps]

451
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,333
[Storm] <i>Jean, my sister.</i>

452
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,042
<i>You of all the X-Men
know the heartbreak of saying goodbye,</i>

453
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,958
<i>having said it so many times.</i>

454
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,958
<i>So I ask
that you help the others understand</i>

455
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:39,292
<i>why I could not stay to say it this day.</i>

456
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,417
<i>My faith in your family's future
is strong.</i>

457
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,917
<i>And I cannot rob you of a bond
you have more than earned.</i>

458
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,625
<i>It is human nature to crave connection,</i>

459
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,708
<i>as it is also mutant nature to be heard,</i>

460
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>seen,</i>

461
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>to feel another soul finally seeing yours.</i>

462
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,417
<i>Connection is a fragile treasure.</i>

463
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,125
<i>One we sacrifice so much to maintain.</i>

464
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,042
[growling playfully]

465
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,208
[Logan chuckles]

466
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,375
[Storm] <i>Only to then sometimes</i>
<i>watch it break in a blink</i>

467
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>that changes your life forever.</i>

468
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,875
<i>We are no longer connected, Jean.</i>

469
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:40,000
<i>And now we walk
in two very different worlds.</i>

470
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,167
<i>But trust that I will cherish
what we shared as X-Men,</i>

471
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,375
<i>memories that already feel
like a lifetime ago.</i>

472
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,097
[Jean reading] "Like another woman's life.

473
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,750
"Or another person's dream.

474
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,333
"Love, Ororo."

475
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,542
[Beast sniffles]

476
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,833
If only I hadn't left the UN,
I could have...

477
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,184
[Bishop] You did what you had to.

478
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,792
Storm did the same.

479
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,167
And we will respect her decision.

480
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,250
[Gambit] That so?

481
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,375
The blast had your name on it.

482
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,292
Should be you leaving, <i>mon ami.</i>

483
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,208
[Morph] I don't buy it.

484
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,792
Not one minute.

485
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,059
Storm will spend a day
schlepping it with the basic folk

486
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,208
and come right home,

487
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:23,542
- happy as a...
- [doorbell rings]

488
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,042
Ha! What did I say?

489
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:27,750
She's back!

490
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,792
Jean?

491
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,625
I need the X-Men.

492
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,667
What? Jean?
