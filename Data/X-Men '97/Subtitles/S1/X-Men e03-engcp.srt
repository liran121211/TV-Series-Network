1
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:05,708
<i>Previously on</i> X-Men...

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:09,417
Maybe it's time to think of a life
beyond the X-Men?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,542
<i>You mean leave the team?</i>

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,601
<i>What have we been fighting for
all these years</i>

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,042
<i>if not the chance
to finally live our lives?</i>

6
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,917
<i>The X-Men need us here.</i>

7
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:19,917
<i>Our son will need us more.</i>

8
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:22,958
<i>Just ever since I was in Gyrich's mind,</i>

9
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,958
<i>I can't shake this feeling
that something terrible is coming.</i>

10
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,833
Boy, do I sound like a fool.

11
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:28,917
No, Jean.

12
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,250
You sound like a mother.

13
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,250
<i>Connection is a fragile treasure.</i>

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:38,208
<i>One we sacrifice so much to maintain.</i>

15
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>Only to then sometimes
watch it break in a blink</i>

16
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,250
<i>that changes your life forever.</i>

17
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,458
Jean?

18
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:49,833
I need the X-Men.

19
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,333
<i>Her mind is dense,</i>

20
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,417
<i>vague in uncertain memories.</i>

21
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,500
<i>As if her awareness
was born only yesterday.</i>

22
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,917
<i>I see a den of confusion and pain.</i>

23
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,042
<i>Some sort of laboratory.</i>

24
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,625
<i>Then, escape.</i>

25
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:36,792
<i>Desperate. Alone.</i>

26
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,375
<i>One purpose...</i>

27
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:40,958
<i>and hope.</i>

28
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,125
<i>A home?</i>

29
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,000
Darling, are you all right?

30
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm fine, Scott.

31
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,083
But who she is or where she came from

32
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,708
remains a mystery.

33
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,792
Well, this isn't gonna get confusing
or anything.

34
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,750
Let's call this mystery gal in the bed
"Jean Doe."

35
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,875
All in favor?

36
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,333
Hmm. Every moment
is a new and shocking valuation

37
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,583
of all we have ever been.

38
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:14,583
My friends,
words will fail to prepare you.

39
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,500
But the Jean that lies on this couch

40
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,292
would appear to be the actual Jean Grey.

41
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,167
What do you mean, the "actual Jean Grey"?

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,375
I used gamma rays

43
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:27,125
to isolate the hemoglobic properties
of both Jeans' genetic markers.

44
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,333
Effectively carbon dating
each woman on a cellular level.

45
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,000
Uh, English, sugar?

46
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,500
Jean Doe is older,

47
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,125
the proper age.

48
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,917
Yours, while identical, is not.

49
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,875
Ergo, our Jean is a clone.

50
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,292
Impossible!

51
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,917
Jean, I assure you, the science is sound.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,792
But I have memories.

53
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,083
Her mind, it's just fragments.

54
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,250
Your science could have been manipulated
by someone with wicked intentions.

55
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,583
Scott, tell them.

56
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,125
Scott?

57
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,000
Beast, confirm your tests.

58
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,603
Enough tests!

59
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,375
I am Jean Grey, member of the X-Men.

60
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,708
One of the first.

61
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,375
I've fought by your side
in countless battles,

62
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,792
given my life how many times?

63
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,958
You know me.

64
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,167
We just...

65
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,875
have to be sure.

66
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
Storm would have believed me.

67
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,417
Shh. It's okay.

68
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,083
It's okay, my darling.

69
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,917
Please. Not now.

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,375
Jean, um, I can take him.

71
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,500
He's fine.

72
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:57,250
Beast's tests won't change the fact
that I'm Nathan's mother.

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,083
I know. No one is saying that.

74
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,000
Just...

75
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,375
With the Professor and Storm gone,

76
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,625
and Magneto here,

77
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,333
it's been a lot for everyone.

78
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,375
Scott, I need you to trust me.

79
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,542
Trust the life we were going to build.

80
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,917
The life we brought into this world.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,083
You and I.

82
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,792
Of course I trust that.

83
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
In us.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,458
You never could lie to me, Scott.

85
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,250
But you always believed in me.

86
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,875
I don't know what to believe right now.

87
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
Just...

88
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,250
go.

89
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,125
We should have left
when we had the chance.

90
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,083
We could still leave.

91
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,917
<i>Jean.</i>

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,958
<i>Jean Grey.</i>

93
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,083
<i>Are you Jean?</i>

94
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,042
Hello? Who's there?

95
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,833
<i>Answers.</i>

96
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,458
Time band's looking slick, Beast.

97
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:58,667
Must be ready soon.

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,792
Future's calling me.

99
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,792
Once I resolve matters
with our superfluous Jeans,

100
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,875
I'll be able to make
the final modifications

101
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,625
to send you back to your time.

102
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,750
Bishop,

103
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,500
you said, in your future, you hadn't heard
of Magneto taking over the X-Men.

104
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,042
What about this?

105
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,042
Time isn't some
history book, man.

106
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,625
It's always writing.

107
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,750
Flipping back a few pages,
rewriting things,

108
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,083
skipping forward, headed in...

109
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,833
Oh, my stars and garters.

110
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,625
Scott, you have to get Nathan.

111
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,875
Hank, what's wrong?

112
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,708
Scientists, like artists,
have signatures to their work.

113
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,583
I know who cloned Jean.

114
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,542
A man so dark and twisted,

115
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,958
he can be described
as nothing other than "sinister."

116
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,375
I don't understand.

117
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,500
Who are you?

118
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:43,000
<i>Most refer to me as Mister Sinister.</i>

119
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,250
But you can call me Father.

120
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,625
You!

121
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,875
Get away from us!

122
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,333
<i>Mother and child, what a touching display.</i>

123
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:58,417
<i>But you and your son
are meant for so much more.</i>

124
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
<i>Let me show you.</i>

125
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,583
Never. You've brought nothing
but pain into our lives.

126
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,792
Kidnapping us,
running your science experiments

127
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,750
just so you could use our genes
to create...

128
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,167
You want our son.

129
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:10,542
Nathan!

130
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,583
<i>Yes. That's why I made you,</i>

131
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,125
<i>baked you.</i>

132
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,042
So it's true.

133
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,042
I'm not Jean Grey?

134
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,375
<i>Come to me.</i>

135
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:27,417
<i>Only I can usher you and your son
to your royal destiny.</i>

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
You'll come nowhere near my son!

137
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,333
Every cell in you belongs to me.

138
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,542
Your mind, your body.

139
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,250
You have no choice.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,625
<i>Time to wake up, my queen.</i>

141
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:50,042
<i>Struggle, of course, is quite useless.</i>

142
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,208
<i>My influence over your mind is flawless.</i>

143
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,000
Shh! Mommy's busy.

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,458
<i>Tell me your dark desire.</i>

145
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:40,125
They shall know my inferno!

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,083
Ah,<i> mon ami,</i> maybe Gambit
should have played less rough with you

147
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,792
in the Danger Room, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

148
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,833
But the cards, they're wild.

149
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,625
Huh. Rematch, then?

150
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,417
Well, let's look at the schedule
and see who's up next.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Hmm, looks like Magneto and Rogue
have the Danger Room next.

152
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,167
Oh, and all tomorrow, too. Wow.

153
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,333
Rogue's really training her stamina
with the new boss.

154
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,333
It don't say that. They on patrol.

155
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,750
On second thought,

156
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,667
maybe Gambit go look for Rogue right now.

157
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,125
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

158
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,917
Go easy on him, pal.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,292
Think you just sent his hush puppies
up into his stomach.

160
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,458
Hit the shower.

161
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,333
I'm gonna go see about a redhead.

162
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,708
Well, one of 'em.

163
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,292
And then there was Morph.

164
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,375
<i>As if he's obsessed with me.</i>

165
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,518
<i>Erasing me.</i>

166
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:50,902
<i>Like he's out there.</i>

167
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,375
<i>Muties...</i>

168
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,083
Uh, do you see that?

169
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,542
Hello? That you, Gambit?

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,042
Logan?

171
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,708
One too many redheads for ya?

172
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,875
Here.

173
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,125
Need some help
with those hard-to-reach spaces?

174
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,568
Always with the jokes, eh, Morph?

175
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,792
As if I don't know.

176
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,542
<i>As if we all don't know.</i>

177
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,583
Say it ain't so.

178
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,875
Get on back to the swamp

179
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,667
with the rest of them
nasty, thieving critters, Remy.

180
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,542
I have found myself a real man.

181
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,708
A hero.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,042
Liar.

183
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,333
No. Not you.

184
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,750
Not again!

185
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,208
Jean? Nathan?

186
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,958
- No!
- This can't be good.

187
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,625
Demerits, my boy.

188
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,833
Failed to sire a child
with the proper wife.

189
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,833
Failed to lead the team.

190
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,417
Flunk and failure.

191
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,917
Naughty, naughty.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
You abandoned me, Bishop.

193
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,667
Where's your home?

194
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,583
When is your time?

195
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,500
Where do you belong, brother?

196
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,792
No! You're not real!

197
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:21,500
Failure!

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,792
Don't look at me like that.

199
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,583
- Don't look.
- This is not my son.

200
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,083
Mutant freak.

201
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,000
What was that thing?

202
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,125
Oh, dear.

203
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,792
I think one of us has the wrong floor.

204
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,000
Cyclops, it's like
the worst horror movie ever.

205
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,417
The whole mansion's possessed.

206
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,667
Gambit can never unsee that.

207
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:56,875
Downstairs, now!

208
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,833
What the heck is going on?

209
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,625
Haven't you figured it out?

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,958
We're in hell.

211
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:15,417
While I share Sinister's
apparent affection for Dante's <i>Inferno,</i>

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,833
I must ask how he's exerting
this much power

213
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,583
over our perceptions of reality.

214
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,042
No, this is... The clone!

215
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,500
Roberto, look out!

216
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,583
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son."

217
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,250
Not a Lewis Carroll fan.

218
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,833
- A little help, please.
- Huh?

219
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,583
Yuck, you smell like burned hair.

220
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,958
Yo, Cyclops. Hit me.

221
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,250
Time for an exorcism, punks!

222
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,625
You're welcome.

223
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,292
Burn, mutants!

224
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,125
Enough!

225
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,625
Jean.

226
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:04,872
Jean.

227
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,792
Pathetic.

228
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,375
What does he even see in you?

229
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,292
Sinister's controlling you.

230
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,958
You don't have to do this.

231
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,292
Who doesn't? Me?

232
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,375
Who am I?

233
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,125
Say my name, Scott.

234
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,583
No? Allow me.

235
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,500
I am beyond Jean Grey.

236
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,125
Beyond the X-Men.

237
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,250
I am scorn and fury,

238
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,625
forged in righteous brimstone.

239
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,417
I am the Goblin Queen.

240
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,083
This was just a taste
of what waits for you if you follow.

241
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,708
My suggestion?

242
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,083
Don't.

243
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,667
No!

244
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,309
I guess we don't
get to finish the movie.

245
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,792
Now, who went and hired a stampede
of buffalo to do a home makeover?

246
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,000
Remy. Oh, I'm sorry, Remy.

247
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,125
Should've been here.

248
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,625
It okay, <i>chère.</i> Gambit okay now.

249
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,667
Cyclops, status report.

250
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,292
Sinister created the clone.

251
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,667
He made her
so he could get his hands on our son.

252
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,333
Mister Sinister?

253
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,958
Sinister's the most evil man
who ever existed.

254
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,875
He was a scientist in the 1800s.

255
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,625
Then he started cutting up mutants,

256
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,875
stealing our DNA to enhance himself,

257
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,292
prolong his life.

258
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,042
He can even take away their will.

259
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,375
I should know.

260
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,000
The voices!

261
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,167
There's too many!

262
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,167
She must not remember
how to entirely control her powers.

263
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,250
The sheer magnitude
of her psychic abilities

264
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,417
are overwhelming her.

265
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,083
How could I lead the team

266
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,292
when I can't even protect my own son?

267
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,375
My own...

268
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,208
Her.

269
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,833
Sinister has plagued us far too long,

270
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:50,333
and it is time the madman pay
for his malevolent appropriations.

271
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,583
I can show you where he is.

272
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,042
Are you sure, Morph?

273
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,292
I'm not gonna let him hurt anyone.

274
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,333
Rogue, Wolverine, Beast,
tend to our wounded.

275
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,917
I will lead the others
in a surgical strike.

276
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,583
Fine. Lead the way.

277
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,917
At last, the spawn of Scott Summers
and Jean Grey.

278
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,750
Do you know why you are my greatest prize,

279
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,042
you random writhing thing of chance?

280
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,208
The combination
of your parents' unique genetics

281
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,292
makes your potential unlimited.

282
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,208
Your powers untold.

283
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,167
But first, you must be made invulnerable.

284
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,375
A new breed of perfect creations
will be born this night

285
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,042
by my will and genius.

286
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,958
Fan out.

287
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,292
Remember, Jean is Sinister's victim, too.

288
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,667
She's under his control.

289
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,917
Better listen!

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,542
I know not what I do.

291
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,333
I knew you'd follow, Scott.

292
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,500
It's all you do. Just ask the Professor.

293
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,792
Fight Sinister.

294
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,333
Use the powers of your mind.

295
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,750
I do not want to fight you, comrade.

296
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,042
I don't want to fight you, either.

297
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,542
I want you to fight for me.

298
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,708
Yes, my queen.

299
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,333
I am power!

300
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,792
Give us the boy, you brimstone clone.

301
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,125
I applaud your magnetism.

302
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,958
But my telekinetic charm
extends beyond mere metal.

303
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,917
Look at you,
a villain playing dress-up as a hero.

304
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,292
I should have you as a toy.

305
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,958
I'm sorry. I didn't want to...

306
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,917
Don't worry.

307
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,333
Mmm.

308
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,750
You'll bleed, too, darling.

309
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,958
- Can't keep the voices out!
- Come on, Jeanie.

310
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,542
Like riding a bicycle.

311
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,458
Remember how to control it.

312
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,583
Concentrate on my mind, Jeanie.

313
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,875
Just my mind. Right here. I'm right here.

314
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,833
Such pain.

315
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,417
I must help.

316
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,917
You will. You always did.

317
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,583
Remember who you are. What you mean to us.

318
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,250
To me.

319
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,333
Logan.

320
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,458
I remember you.

321
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,208
Keep going. Deeper.

322
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,792
I mean all that to you?

323
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,417
More.

324
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,250
Please, don't.

325
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,542
Scott! He's in danger.

326
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,708
I have to go.

327
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,458
My dear, you are not going anywhere.

328
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,000
Your body is in no condition.

329
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,875
Beast, please. My body won't be an issue.

330
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,792
<i>This ends now!</i>

331
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,542
You!

332
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,750
Of course.

333
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,292
You took my face, my husband, my family.

334
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,042
And now my mind.

335
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,625
Enough violation!

336
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,542
I was Phoenix.

337
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,542
Me! Power incarnate!

338
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,667
Power?

339
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,208
Is that all you can remember?

340
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,708
Is she here?

341
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,292
Hello there.

342
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,375
Do you know who I am, Jean?

343
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,250
Mom and Dad called you to help fix me.

344
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,958
They say I think too much.

345
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,958
Don't worry.

346
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>All I do is think, too.</i>

347
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,958
I remember this.

348
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,333
It felt like the first day
of the rest of my life.

349
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,208
But what happened?

350
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,417
When did we find our power?

351
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,292
Annie, watch out!

352
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,250
Our best friend, she died.

353
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,875
It awakened our gifts.

354
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,833
All this pain.

355
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,292
We carry all of this?

356
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,292
No! It's my pain, not yours!

357
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,750
Please, let me help you.

358
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,875
Can you tell me who I am?

359
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,125
Can you say
which of these memories are yours

360
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,333
and which are mine?

361
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,417
Can you?

362
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,167
I-I think so.

363
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,250
We are what we remember.

364
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,417
And you remember nothing.

365
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,833
You are nothing!

366
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,708
Oh, Scott.

367
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,250
Look, he has your eyes.

368
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,042
Well, doesn't he need a name?

369
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,125
I was thinking...

370
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,208
Nathan.

371
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,667
How could I forget?

372
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,000
He's more than a memory.

373
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:04,792
He's a living reminder
of the purest love two people can share.

374
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,542
And no one can ever, ever
take that away from you.

375
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,625
This is the greatest moment of my life.

376
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,667
Let's go save Nathan.

377
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:35,125
If only Xavier's orphans knew
the future we have in store for them.

378
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,333
What? Impossible.

379
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,917
You stay away from our son!

380
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,083
Fools. You have doomed the boy.

381
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,667
Your powers are nothing against mine.

382
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,042
It's over, Sinister.

383
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,625
Is it now?

384
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:07,167
"Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home.

385
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,917
"Your house is on fire

386
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,250
"and your child all gone."

387
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,875
Oh, God. Nathan.

388
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,958
You monster! What have you done?

389
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,542
It's a Techno-Organic Virus strain.

390
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,042
Sinister was likely exposing Nathan to it

391
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,583
in the hopes of making him invincible.

392
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,583
Figure it out, Beast, please.

393
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,875
Sinister's variant is too advanced.

394
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:42,125
It could take months,
even years, to develop a cure.

395
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,625
And the virus
is already spreading rapidly.

396
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:45,750
There's no time.

397
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,500
So what you're saying is not here,
not in our time.

398
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,292
But what if
there's a cure in yours, Bishop?

399
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,625
In the future.

400
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,583
Beast's nearly fixed your time band.

401
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:59,542
I do know a guy there. Smart.
Can build anything.

402
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,542
This band only got enough juice
for Nathan and I.

403
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,708
Meaning we can't go with you.

404
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,375
No, no, no, there has to be another way.

405
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,167
I won't be like my father.

406
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,125
I won't abandon my son.

407
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:16,375
We said we'd give him
the best possible future.

408
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,708
It's what we promised.

409
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:26,333
Don't any of you know how it feels
to be abandoned?

410
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,625
I won't have him feel that.

411
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,708
He won't feel abandoned.

412
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,083
I promise.

413
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,667
I can't be a part of this.

414
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,333
I'm sorry.

415
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:57,500
<i>There'll be days
when you're lonely or scared,</i>

416
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,042
<i>where you ask yourself why we did this?</i>

417
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,125
<i>Was something wrong?</i>

418
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:04,875
<i>But you are perfect, my baby.</i>

419
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,417
<i>Know in our time here,</i>

420
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,167
<i>we thought about you endlessly.</i>

421
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,375
<i>How your voice would sound,</i>

422
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:13,917
<i>your laughter,</i>

423
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,958
<i>how you'd smile.</i>

424
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,542
<i>We love you so much, Nathan.</i>

425
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,708
<i>But owe you nothing less
than the best possible future.</i>

426
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,080
<i>And that is one without us in it.</i>

427
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,000
<i>Remember.</i>

428
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,333
Wait.

429
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,125
This is your home, too.

430
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,792
How much do you remember?

431
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,583
It's strange, but most everything.

432
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,500
Then you know how much I've wanted to go,

433
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,792
to start a new life.

434
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,083
It's not fair.

435
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,333
We don't know when Sinister switched us.

436
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,833
Who really was the Phoenix.

437
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,625
Which of us married Scott.

438
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,250
All we have now is the future.

439
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:25,042
An unknowable future
built on an unknowable past.

440
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:28,042
My next life will be mine.

441
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,958
Take care, Jean.

442
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,625
Call me Madelyne Pryor.

443
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,833
Farewell, Madelyne.

444
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,667
Farewell, Jean.

445
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:55,625
<i>Oh, it's another hot one,
Dallas, with no relief in sight.</i>

446
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,583
<i>Stay hydrated. Looks like
this year drought's sticking around.</i>

447
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,250
Shame about the weather.

448
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,083
No summer like a Texas summer.

449
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,042
What I wouldn't give
if someone could just make it rain.

450
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,375
Speak plainly, who are you?

451
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,125
Name's Forge, Storm.

452
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,208
An old friend of Charles Xavier.

453
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,708
I'd like to help you
get back what you've lost.
