[Wolverine] <i>Previously on</i> X-Men...

[Magneto] <i>The last will and testament
of Charles Francis Xavier.</i>

[Cyclops] <i>Did the Professor not trust me?</i>

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,333
Maybe he did this for us.

{\an8}[Empress Lilandra] <i>Our empire

Professor Charles Xavier.

[Bastion] <i>Our merry band of muties have
been selling the world a very big lie.</i>

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,667
<i>And so have I.</i>

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,458
[Cable] <i>His name's Bastion.</i>

10
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,375
<i>He used the fallout from Genosha</i>

11
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,542
<i>to get backing
for his Prime Sentinel program.</i>

12
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,667
[Beast] <i>His Prime Sentinels would be

[Cyclops] <i>Who exactly is Bastion?</i>

14
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:42,458
[Jean] <i>Bastion, he's a Sentinel,
given human form.</i>

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,458
Do you understand the futility
of fighting the future?

16
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,458
[Dr. Cooper] <i>In Genosha,
I felt a lot of things.</i>

17
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,250
<i>But the scariest thing about Genosha</i>

18
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,583
<i>wasn't the death or the chaos.</i>

19
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>It was a thought. Magneto was right.</i>

20
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,583
[Beast] <i>Magneto has blacked out the Earth.</i>

21

[Wolverine] <i>Where's the Professor
when you need him?</i>

22
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,167
To me, my X-Men.

23
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,833
[theme music playing]

24
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,208
[man 1] You turn off the power,
this is what you get!

00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,417
[woman] You thought Genosha was bad?
Just you wait!

26
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,750
[man 2] Too bad the hospitals
ain't got no power!

27
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,417
-'Cause you're gonna need one!
-[mob chanting] No power, no peace!

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,750
It's finally quiet, Mother.

00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,208
Storm!

[sobbing]

31
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:25,500
The world is going to end in 12 hours,
so you two better make this fast.

32
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,417
Magneto, sir? Really?

33
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:31,875
What did you expect was going to happen
when you tossed him the school?

34
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,958
I wanted you two to be free.

35
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,917
To finally be together.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,917
To have a family. A child like Nathan.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,833
The choice should've been ours.

38
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,792
I wanted to spare you
the weight of your loyalty to me.

39
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,667
You... Both of you have done
everything I have asked

40
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,583
since you were teenagers.

41
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,625
You were my first students,
and you graduated a long time ago.

42
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,625
And what would freedom have gotten us?

43
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,208
I still would've had
to send Nathan to the future.

44
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,833
I'd still be pulled into dealing
with Bastion or Magneto,

45
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,500
or whoever else threatened the world.

46
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,500
No matter what, I'll always end up here.

47
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,542
Don't you know that?

48
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,208
[Professor X] That was my fear,

49
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,125
from the moment I first met you,

50
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,208
that you would help build a world

51
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,167
where mutants
could live however they wish.

52
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,125
But that you would never allow yourself
to enjoy it.

53
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,708
Perhaps that was a mistake.

54
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,083
Because just like you,
I'm right back here.

55
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,792
[Rogue] Remy!

56
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,875
I...

57
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,958
No!

58
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
[Nightcrawler] Rogue?

59
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,792
-How do you feel?
-[groans]

60
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,833
I feel like I've been run over
by a hay baler fixed with a jet engine.

61
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,750
Trask.

62
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,750
Did he...

63
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,458
[Nightcrawler] Much has happened,
<i>fräulein.</i>

64
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,042
Trask survived. And so did...

65
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,167
Remy?

66
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,042
Oh, shucks, we missed the hoedown.

67
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:28,708
Ororo, you're back! [laughs]

68
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,208
Your powers...

69
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,708
Restored, thanks to Forge.

70
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,542
Please. Ororo's doing
her modest goddess routine.

71
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,917
It's been too long, my friend.

72
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,542
Wish it were under better circumstances.

73
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,833
Your augmented prosthetics
remain functional

74
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,667
despite Magneto's blackout.

75
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,542
This old thing? Rigged together
an electrostatic deflector ages ago.

76
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,333
Oh, me, oh, my!

77
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,708
How, my friend?

78
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,333
Thought about it.

79
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,417
[Storm] Oh, Jean!

80
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,292
What happened?

81
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,417
I know. We're actually relocating
to the old base on Muir Island

82
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,000
for gear and supplies.

83
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,875
Its Shi'ar tech should be operational.

84
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,708
This was our home. A haven.

85
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,667
If it is this horrible here,
how bad is it out there?

86
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,583
[Cyclops] Thousands are feared dead.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,333
All First World infrastructures
are in ruin.

88
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,417
Without warning, Magneto's thrown
the entire planet back centuries.

89
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,333
[Storm] I can feel the Earth's
magnetic field dying even now.

90
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:31,250
When the sun sets tonight,
it sets on the future.

91
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:36,292
We need to find Magneto and convince him
to reverse the damage to Earth

92
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,875
before it becomes permanent.

93
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,625
Well, Magneto ain't gonna change his mind
just because we say "please."

94
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,333
The man just declared war
on the whole planet.

95
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,583
His day ends one way.

96
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:51,292
Logan, if you must punish someone
for today, then start with me.

97
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,750
I brought us here, my X-Men.

98
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,375
Do not make Magnus pay for my designs.

99
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,167
Rogue, you're going with me
and Blue Team to find Magneto.

100
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,583
Storm and Jean will lead Gold Team
to shut down Bastion at his headquarters

101
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,000
in the Galapagos Islands.

102
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,458
Have we figured out how to remove
these Prime Sentinel upgrades?

103
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:16,083
Or eliminate his control over them?

104
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,708
Learning how to safely remove
Sentinel nanotech will take years.

105
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:23,917
But Forge and I believe we can restore
the Prime Sentinels' innate humanity.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,833
Hold up. These guys hated us

107
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:29,208
before Bastion drafted them
into his killer robot army.

108
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,625
We don't even know how many are out there.

109
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,542
Unplug them from Bastion, but then what?

110
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,000
Sounds like just another day
that ends in "y" when you put it that way.

111
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,542
Precisely. And we face it
as we always have.

112
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,292
As a family.

113
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,875
There is one wrinkle to our plan.

114
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,250
The Prime Sentinels are controlled by
a central command server.

115
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,583
Alas, I was unable to find it
before the blackout.

116
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,667
Bastion is the command server.

117
00:08:56,417 --> 00:09:00,292
When I first founded the school,
I visited Sebastion's mother.

118
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,208
The boy could communicate with machines.

119
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,125
Cerebro had detected him,
so I assumed he was a mutant.

120
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,667
His mother slammed the door
when she heard the word.

121
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,167
Forbade him from returning with me
to the school.

122
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,750
In another world,

123
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,583
Bastion would be in this portrait.

124
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,750
Once Bastion is no longer a threat,

125
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:24,708
I believe Magnus will be open
to turning the power back on.

126
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,208
Well, didn't you also believe
it was a good idea

127
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,833
to hand the bad guy your school?

128
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:29,917
[Cyclops] That's enough.

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,083
Blame game is over, people.

130
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,583
The world ends in less than 12 hours.

131
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,917
Kurt will teleport us to Muir Island.

132
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,708
Let's get to work, team.

133
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,125
Impress me.

134
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,292
Charles described Bastion as a technopath,

135
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,250
which is essentially telepathy
for machines.

136
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,042
And this mnemonic scrambler
shut down Jean's powers

137
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,500
when she was the Dark Phoenix.

138
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,708
[Forge] So we calibrate
the scrambler to Bastion's frequency

139
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,167
and sever his hold over the Primes.

140
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,167
But we may be able
to do more than just that.

141
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,750
If Bastion's abilities
operate like our mutations,

142
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,042
we can use neutralizer technology

143
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,125
to permanently disable his control

144
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,958
-of Prime Sentinels.
-[electricity whooshes]

145
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,917
Okay, no neutralizer technology.

146
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,958
Part of me wonders if Gambit
should've been buried here,

147
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,125
on our grounds.

148
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,958
He was always trying to outrun his past
with the Thieves Guild.

149
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,792
Remy was the most Cajun man I ever met.

150
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,542
As much as he wanted to escape the bayou,

151
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,292
he knew our lives are about
what bits of us we leave behind

152
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,167
and what we carry into the future.

153
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:53,167
Maybe if you saw us as people
and not students,

154
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,833
you'd have realized that.

155
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,917
I'm so sorry, Rogue.

156
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,000
For you, for Remy, Moira.

157
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,083
So many. And despite the power of words,

158
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,292
nothing spoken can heal this pain.

159
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,500
My heavens! Magnus...

160
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,000
Looks like the search came to us.

161
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,750
[Professor X] Please. Not this, Magnus.
Be reasonable.

162
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,208
I am not the one who needs
to be reasoned with, Charles.

163
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:44,375
There is a large asteroid
hovering over my home that begs otherwise.

164
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,458
[Magneto] Your home?

165
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,000
When you abandoned us
for your Shi'ar Bird-Queen,

166
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,958
you bequeathed it to me,
asked me to walk your path.

167
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,208
Are you prepared to walk mine?

168
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,083
Magnus, your path leads
to total destruction

169
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,125
for both humans and mutants.

170
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,542
You must undo the damage you've done.

171
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,917
Will humanity undo Genosha?

172
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,333
Old friend, you should've seen it.

173
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,333
It was just as you said
that day in the bar,

174
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,417
a promise realized.

175
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:18,583
We have a plan to stop Bastion,
but we must also repair Earth.

176
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,917
[Magneto] I promised a boy
a future free of fear,

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,167
only to watch his frightened eyes
be vaporized inside his tiny skull,

178
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,542
because he believed in me.

179
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,875
In the dream you had me sell.

180
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,792
How many more of your bones
will pave the way to Xavier's future,

181
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,292
where we simper
like beggars for tolerance?

182
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,042
Your professor's dream is dead.

183
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
So I offer a new one.

184
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,333
A home to replace what they stole from us.
A new Genosha.

185
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,667
We have gotten here
by walking this man's path.

186
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
We are left with but two choices.

187
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,750
Cling to this dying world,

188
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,458
or rise to your future and look down
upon this fallen pigsty planet.

189
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:17,042
We are not gods, Magnus.

190
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,833
Gods abandon those who believe in them.

191
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,167
Mutants do not.

192
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,208
Decide, my X-Men.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,375
Rogue, no.

194
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,958
In Genosha, I made a choice.

195
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,542
To lead our kind to a new age.

196
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,042
I stand by that choice.

197
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,708
Rogue, do not turn your back on family.

198
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,667
You were gone, gal.

199
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,917
None of you were there
the day Genosha fell.

200
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,125
Who dies next, Professor?

201
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,625
Jean? Ha! Been there, done that.

202
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,833
Who knows where Bishop is?

203
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,083
And hell, Morph was barely on the team
30 minutes

204
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,208
before we tossed them
to the wolves.

205
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,583
Jubilee, Roberto...

206
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,625
I will not see any more mutants die.

207
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,125
[thunder crackles]

208
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,167
Roberto?

209
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,708
My mom handed me over
to the Prime Sentinels, Jubilee.

210
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,667
They collared me, my own family.
What's left here?

211
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,667
Me.

212
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,292
The offer was made.

213
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,625
The door is open.

214
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,292
Hitchin' a ride to Asteroid M.

215
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,792
Just when we started
working well together.

216
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,542
Look, if I had it my way,

217
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,792
I'd be on Isla Morada
with you and Jean instead of space.

218
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,333
-But she's...
-Not my mother.

219
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,542
It's confusing to me, too, you know?

220
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,583
Jean, Madelyne.

221
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:04,917
But what I know for certain

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,667
is that they're two
of the strongest people I've ever known.

223
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Trust her.

224
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,708
And, son...

225
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,292
Let me guess, "Be careful?"

226
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,833
No. Give 'em hell.

227
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,583
Oh, hey,

228
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,708
almost forgot.

229
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,625
Am I going to war or a circus?

230
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,083
What'd you expect? Black leather?

231
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:34,667
The Magneto Protocols were drawn up
for exactly this sort of crisis.

232
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,250
An attack against Magneto
will only enflame matters further.

233
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,458
Trust that I will reason with him.

234
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,542
You expect me to trust you?

235
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:48,000
The world is falling apart
because you left your legacy to a lunatic.

236
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,417
Not a lunatic.

237
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,125
Merely a man trying to survive in a world
that has proven his worst fears true,

238
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,500
time and again.

239
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,708
<i>In under an hour,
civilization as we know it ends.</i>

240
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,792
<i>Much like in the past,</i>

241
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,542
<i>my X-Men and I
are your best hope to avoid that future.</i>

242
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,125
If you're wrong, Xavier,
my hand will be forced.

243
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,167
We have been here before, President Kelly.

244
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,333
<i>If you don't trust me, trust my X-Men.</i>

245
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,625
They approach. Open the silo.

246
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,167
Mutants, surrender to the future.

247
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,125
Shouldn't Magneto's blackout
have shut these things down?

248
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:38,833
Bastion must be powering their circuitry
using his technopathy.

249
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,000
Hang on.

250
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,125
Forge and I
will draw their focus in the air.

251
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,708
The rest of you continue to the ground.

252
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,750
No, that's an army out there.

253
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,125
I thought of you while away.

254
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:05,417
Of when my sister faced her darkness
and emerged stronger.

255
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,875
A survivor. A phoenix.

256
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,625
All this change? It's all the same.

257
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,208
Let us do what we do.

258
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:21,042
Believe not in a dream or our gifts,

259
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,792
but in each other.

260
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,417
Make them mind your weather, sister.

261
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
And them weather your mind.

262
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,875
The source of the frequency
is coming from inside the volcano itself.

263
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,458
Then that's where Bastion is.

264
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,250
Bastion's building his own ideal future.

265
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,833
Unfortunately, he'll have no one
to share it with.

266
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,625
[Bastion through Sentinels]
<i>Try as you might, X-Men.</i>

267
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,208
<i>You cannot stop me and my kind.</i>

268
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,958
Morph smash! [grunts]

269
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
[grunts]

270
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,375
Let me lend you a hand, friend.

271
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,958
To pose the question,
"What is the sound of one hand clapping?"

272
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,083
-[groans]
-[Jean] Cable!

273
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,958
I've waited for this moment.

274
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,208
I know your genes, Jean.

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,708
Your strengths, weaknesses.

276
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,417
[grunting]

277
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:06,958
[cackles softly]

00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,417

[grunts]

280
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,417
[groans]

281
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:36,083
[Mister Sinister] Only I know where
you end and Madelyne begins.

282
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:42,917
If you ask nicely,
I can tell you when I switched you.

283
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,208
It doesn't matter.
Madelyne fights with me today.

284
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,458
[groans]

285
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,958
[whooshing]

286
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,375
Should we knock?

287
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,875
[Rogue grunts]

288
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,833
Damn it, elf.

289
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,708
And so you have chosen your side.

290
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,458
Oh, good, we're skipping the blabber.

291
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,042
Time out, sugar. You're playing to kill.

292
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,542
Magnus, please.

293
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,375
Thousands are dead
and more will follow unless we...

294
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,875
Thousands more died on Genosha.

295
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,708
Whose lives matter more?

296
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,542
[groans]

297
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,958
Hey, I'm sorry, Jubes, you okay?

298
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,292
[grunts]

299
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,708
Jubes, I said sorry.

300
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:28,292
[Professor X] Magnus,
for all your talk of ruling the world,

301
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:33,250
it is the world that rules you
that has made the bitter man before me.

302
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:38,375
Oh, how I've waited
to say these two words to you, old friend.

303
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,500
Shut up.

304
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,250
[Professor X] <i>Cyclops, his helmet.</i>

305
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,000
<i>I must hijack his powers to repair Earth.</i>

306
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,875
Sir, what about the Prime Sentinels?

307
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,792
<i>There is no time. We must trust Gold Team
to neutralize Bastion.</i>

308
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,625
Bastion, Xavier's brats
have breached the base.

309
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,583
We must retreat.

310
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,792
[groans]

311
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,083
Know your role, mutant.

312
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,708
A snake like Sinister
would never risk his life for another.

313

317
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,792
[Mister Sinister] I have studied you,
Jean. Dissected you.

318
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,125
Then face me.

319
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm shocked that such a coward
hasn't abandoned Bastion yet.

320
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,792
[Mister Sinister] I was waiting for you
to bring me what I want.

Nathan, stop! Please, listen to me!

Sinister's controlling you
just like he controlled your mother.

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,958
[grunts] My real mother was
a world-class telekinetic, just like you.

326

No, Magnus!
