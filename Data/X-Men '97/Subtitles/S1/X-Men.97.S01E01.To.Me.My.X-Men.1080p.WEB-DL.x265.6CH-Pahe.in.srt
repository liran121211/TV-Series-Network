00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,291
{\an8} <i>As we await
more details out of Paris,</i>

2
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,083
{\an8}<i>we take a look back
on another life cut short,</i>

3
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,125
{\an8}<i>Professor Charles Xavier.</i>

4
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,541
{\an8}<i>The mutant leader's
assassination last year</i>

5
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,375
{\an8}<i>by former NSA agent Henry Gyrich</i>

6
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,458
{\an8}<i>has spurred increased sympathy
toward mutants</i>

7
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,541
{\an8}<i>despite their strange powers.</i>

8
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,958
{\an8}<i>But is mankind ready to share a future</i>

9
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,625
{\an8}<i>with those who science claims
were born to replace us?</i>

10
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,416
{\an8}<i>Experts debate this
and more after the break.</i>

11
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:56,708
The buyer's really gonna throw
down 10 grand for every mutant we nab?

12
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,208
Says he's using them
for target practice.

13
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,416
Please don't hurt me.

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,958
I'm Roberto da Costa,
heir to the Da Costa fortune.

15
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,916
Name a price. Money's not an issue.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,833
Mutie thinks it's about cash.

17
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:12,916
Funny.

18
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,083
What's this freak's trick?

19
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,166
No clue.

20
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,291
Kid didn't even try to use his powers.

21
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,916
Collared him just in case.

22
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,666
Hear that, mutie?

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,333
So long as that collar stays on,
your powers are bye-bye.

24
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,166
I'm not like the ones on TV.
I'm one of the good ones.

25
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,375
A good mutant?

26
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,750
Now, that is rich.

27
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,083
Listen, I am begging you.

28
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,666
I didn't ask for this, okay?

29
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,791
I was born this way.

30
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,750
Ain't that the rub?

31
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,500
- Hmm.

32
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,833
{\an8}

33
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,625
Grab a Sentinel blaster
and spread out!

34
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,083
I am Storm,
mistress of the elements.

35
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:02,875
Surrender the boy or face my fury!

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,208
I ain't afraid of you, you witch.

37
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,666
Then you are a fool.

38
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,375
Huh?

39
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,416
Whole announcement shtick
didn't go over so well, did it?

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Pardon me, Bishop, for striving
to resolve matters peacefully.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,708
Real peaceful, Storm.

42
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,916
Keep shooting, punks.

43
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,458
Is it me, or did these dirtbags
get upgrades?

44
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Huh?

45
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,916
Boot it up, boys.
X-Men are like roaches.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,083
You see one, more are coming.

47
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,375
Good guy or bad guy?

48
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,625
Name's Cyclops. Definitely the good guy.

49
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,041
Hang tight.

50
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,291
- Kid, get down.

51
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,625
How'd scum like you get your hands
on Sentinel technology?

52
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,958
What? You freak shows think
we wouldn't find a way to evolve, too?

53
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,000
Take his visor before he starts up again.

54
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,041
No, don't! I surrender!

55
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,666
Not.

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,333
Storm and Bishop
could have been hurt.

57
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,875
We needed you out there.

58
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,583
You stopped the bad guys,
saved the kid,

59
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,125
- got home safe.

60
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,041
These beignets needed me
more than you did, <i>mon ami.</i>

61
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,208
The Friends of Humanity
had retrofitted Sentinel weaponry.

62
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,166
Do you have any idea
what that means, Gambit?

63
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,500
Means you get to howling like
a lonely kettle left on a fiery stove.

64
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,625
We've rodeo'd more Sentinels
than I care to count.

65
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,625
And Storm and Bishop are made
of sterner stuff than you think.

66
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,333
Rogue always come to Gambit's rescue.

67
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,416
Rogue, the Professor entrusted us

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,958
with his dream
of mutant-human coexistence.

69
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,708
We have to stay vigilant,

70
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,916
no matter how good things seem out there.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,583
The last few months have been rough,

72
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,791
what with the Professor
being gone and all,

73
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,333
but, sugar, if you don't simmer down,
you're gonna die of a stroke.

74
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,958
Rogue is right, Cyclops.

75
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,541
Scott, while I trust that
all my students would gladly die

76
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,708
for my dream of a better future,

77
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,625
where both human and mutant
live free of your total disdain for fun,

78
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,708
I would prefer it be avoided.

79
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,375
Stop being a creep, Morph.

80
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,916
Look like Cyclops
about to have that stroke.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,583
Maybe this help.

82
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,458
- Remy, you could have hurt someone.

83
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,750
He doesn't care, Jean.

84
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,750
All he cares about
are his stupid beignets.

85
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,250
I don't know who's worse,
him or Wolverine.

86
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,541
Well, can everyone just please behave?

87
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,833
This is a school, after all,

88
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,291
and we need to be role models
for our guest.

89
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,375
Jean's right.

90
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,958
That kid's our only lead

91
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,166
to where those extremists
got their hands on Sentinel tech.

92
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,541
Huh?

93
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,791
Huh?

94
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,125
Huh?

95
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,708
Salutations and welcome.

96
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,916
- I'm...
- Blue, very blue. Wow.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,958
An astute observation, my boy.

98
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,125
Hank McCoy here.

99
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,125
Or if you prefer my friendly
<i>nom de guerre,</i> Beast.

100
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,791
- That there at the foot of your bed is...
- Name's Jubilee.

101
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,375
And, dude, I get it.

102
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,541
One day, life's fresh.

103
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,125
Then the next day, you're waking up

104
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,458
to a blue monkey singing Mozart
as he tinkers with doohickies.

105
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,666
Simian analogies, Jubilee?

106
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,041
Shame on you.

107
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,625
And this doohickey
is an elegant piece of art

108
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,083
capable of teleporting someone
through time and space.

109
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,583
Bishop's bling. He's a time traveler.

110
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,458
Hank, how fares the boy?

111
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,583
Besides a cavity and layman's
existential fear of metaphysics,

112
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,791
Mr. Da Costa here is in perfect health.

113
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,791
I need to go. Where's my jacket?

114
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,416
Tell me I didn't lose it. Super expensive.

115
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,416
Roberto, we can't let you go just yet.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,875
- Oh. Right. How much?
-  "How much?"

117
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,583
For the save? I was going to pay
those troops to free me, so...

118
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,916
You take checks?

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,375
We're more interested in the weapons
those creeps had.

120
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,458
That giant arm was from a machine
called a Sentinel.

121
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,708
Did your attackers say anything
about where they acquired it?

122
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,416
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,333
Today's been a day and you're coming at me
with giant robot arms?

124
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,791
Your attackers could still
be out there, child.

125
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,458
Should we let you leave,

126
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,166
they could find you and kill you.

127
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,166
So now you're kidnapping me?

128
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,333
Kidnapping?

129
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:30,166
We wanna help mutants,
even arrogant yuppies like you.

130
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,416
Look, you're scared, Roberto. I get it.

131
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,333
Just give us the day to figure this out,

132
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,625
make sure you're safe,

133
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,375
and then you can go do
whatever a kid like you does.

134
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,541
At least say there's something
to do around here

135
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,916
besides listen to Mozart?

136
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,791
Hear me. Humanity's days are over.

137
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,125
We are nature's favored children.

138
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,250
Our new age begins

139
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,291
as we build a bright mutant future.

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,333
Video games are for nerds.

141
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,208
<i>Oh, it's no game, buddy.</i>

142
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,541
<i>It's the Danger Room. It's where we train.</i>

143
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,541
That's Magneto, the Professor's ex-bestie.

144
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,416
They had, uh, different takes
on mutant-human coexistence.

145
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,708
So what can you do?

146
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,833
Fly, teleport?

147
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,250
<i>Shoot gold balls from your body?
That'd be weird.</i>

148
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,916
But, like, he's not even real.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,416
You would turn your back on your own?

150
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,875
<i>Better show me those powers,
tough guy.</i>

151
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,625
Seriously, girl, get a life.

152
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,916
Show the lady some respect.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,541
Oh, so scary, Jubilee. Can we stop now?

154
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,625
- Computer, end program.

155
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,833
- Scary enough for you, bub?

156
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,291
<i>Agencies in the US, England
and Madripoor have been catching rumors</i>

157
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,333
<i>of anti-mutant militias
with Sentinel weaponry.</i>

158
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,291
<i>But this is the first I've heard
of any confirmed reports.</i>

159
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,208
How are these groups
getting this tech?

160
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,500
You said the UN destroyed
all the Sentinels.

161
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,583
<i>And we did.</i>

162
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,458
Oh, I guess I just imagined the big
robot hand that almost took out my team.

163
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,208
Someone's putting this stuff out there.

164
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,708
Dr. Cooper, what about Bolivar Trask?

165
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,958
<i>Trask's been missing
ever since his inventions tried</i>

166
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,291
<i>to swap out President Kelly's brain
with a Sentinel computer.</i>

167
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,000
<i>He'd need a Master Mold factory
to build new Sentinels</i>

168
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,875
<i>and you X-Men destroyed
the only one years ago.</i>

169
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,458
Well, when cardio wraps,

170
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,041
maybe you can spare the calories

171
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,000
to go make sure
he didn't build another one.

172
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,916
<i>Charles Xavier was a dear friend of mine.</i>

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,375
<i>It's why I urged the UN Council
to work with the X-Men.</i>

174
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,333
<i>A little trust, Scott.</i>

175
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:44,458
The Professor loved to say,
"Trust happens when actions meet words."

176
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,583
Cyclops out.

177
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,833
Well,
this certainly explains your mood.

178
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,625
Yeah, it came yesterday.

179
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,416
You know, if he were here,
the team wouldn't be shooting hoops

180
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,458
while slime like the Friends of Humanity

181
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,541
are running around with Sentinel blasters.

182
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,458
You're too hard on yourself,
and the team.

183
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,416
Remember when we were young
and we'd sneak down to the lake

184
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,625
instead of doing our Danger Room drills?

185
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,750
Oh, yeah.
The Professor would shout,

186
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,750
"Your childish hijinks
have cost you five demerits, young man."

187
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,833
And you'd say,
"But, sir,

188
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,375
"what's the point of being an X-Man
if we're not allowed to enjoy our lives?"

189
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,583
Whoa, whoa, I did not sound like that.

190
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,166
Oh, yes, you did.

191
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,416
- You still sound like that.

192
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,208
Those days have been on my mind
a lot lately, darling.

193
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,916
You and I alone.
Our whole future ahead of us.

194
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,166
The team, they'll always be family,

195
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,750
but with the baby coming,

196
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,791
maybe it's time to think of a life
beyond the X-Men?

197
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,541
"Beyond"? You mean leave the team? Jean.

198
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,000
It's like you said, Scott.

199
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,041
What have we been fighting for
all these years

200
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,666
if not the chance
to finally live our lives?

201
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,083
We were the Professor's first students.

202
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,875
The X-Men need us here.

203
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,708
The team will be fine.

204
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Our son will need us more.

205
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,416
Deep down, you know that.

206
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,333
And I know it hurts.
But this one time, Scott...

207
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,833
It's okay for you to let go.

208
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,666
-  Jerk!

209
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,166
-  Jubilee! What are you doing?

210
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,208
Bozo here scared Roberto off.

211
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,041
Cyclops, what if those creeps
with the Sentinel gizmos find him?

212
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:48,958
Logan, take that nose of yours
and go find the kid.

213
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,458
- And take Jubilee.

214
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,541
Actually, all of you could stand
to act a little more like X-Men.

215
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,625
Go with them.

216
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,041
Hey, now, we didn't do a dang thing.

217
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,000
Took the words right out of my mouth.

218
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,083
Jean may dig
the Boy Scout routine, Summers,

219
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,708
but I don't much go in
for being bossed around.

220
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,291
Cry me a river, Wolverine.

221
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,750
Logan...

222
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,666
Find Roberto,

223
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,583
please.

224
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,791
What Gyrich did was pretty horrible.

225
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,041
But want to know the worst part
about the Professor being gone?

226
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,875
You.

227
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,500
- He didn't mean it.
- Doesn't matter.

228
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,875
I know who we need to see
to find Bolivar Trask.

229
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,916
The man who killed Charles Xavier.

230
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,166
The kid's here,
but there are too many damn scents.

231
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,666
Looks like we split up.

232
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,541
Nice place to pass a good time, eh, <i>chère?</i>

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,166
If I was down there
and one of 'em brushed against my skin,

234
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,208
my power-sappin' touch would leave 'em
with a nasty hangover.

235
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:26,583
Any worthwhile man would
gladly suffer your hand in a dance.

236
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,916
Thought you were gonna
slice Summers' head off back there.

237
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,583
Wanna talk about it?

238
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,250
Let's just find this trust-fund baby
and get out of here, Morph.

239
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,250
I know what's wrong. How?

240
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:49,166
Why, I'm Jean Grey,
humble telepath extraordinaire,

241
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,000
and I'm having the most
beautiful baby in the world

242
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,375
with the most boring man in the world,

243
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,291
and, "Oh, hello, you on the sidelines,

244
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,458
"watching our exhausting perfection
every day."

245
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:05,291
Perfection? If we ain't fighting Magneto,
we're dodging aliens and Sentinels.

246
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,375
School's no place for a baby.

247
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,750
You... Jean knows as much.

248
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,500
- You don't think...
- They're leaving the team, Morph.

249
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,791
Jean's leaving.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,291
No, no. I'm not going back there.

251
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,916
Dork, let's go. You're not safe here.

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,708
One dance, then I'll come. Promise.

253
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,416
Beats that stuffy mansion, right?

254
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,250
Hey, at least they're not
wasting time partying

255
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,833
when they could be helping people.

256
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,541
And waste the best years of my life
on some bald guy's corny dream?

257
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,708
Of course, someone like you
would find a little selflessness corny.

258
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,375
Peace, love. I get it.

259
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,791
Does he have to make
such a big stink about it?

260
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,125
Is that why you didn't use your powers
against those goons?

261
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,166
Didn't want to rub their faces in it?

262
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,916
It's like <i>minha mãe</i> says, Jubilee.

263
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,458
Live and let live.

264
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,291
Sometimes people don't get along.

265
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,750
Don't I know it, bub?

266
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,250
FOH ran when they saw us coming.

267
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,500
Dropped one of their little toys, too.

268
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,041
Pray Cyclops find where these bad boys
are coming from,

269
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,750
before things get too hot to handle.

270
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,750
I can't believe this fool
nearly cost us the whole future.

271
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,666
He still cost us enough.

272
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,875
Why would I know where Trask is?

273
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,833
You helped fund his Sentinel program

274
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,125
when you worked
for the Defense Department.

275
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,958
Gyrich, you're serving 25 years.

276
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,333
- You talk and I get it down to 10.

277
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,541
You mutants are moving up,
making friends in high places.

278
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,041
Though it's got to hurt,
offering that deal to me.

279
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,708
Those Sentinel upgrades really threw you.

280
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:12,000
We merely hoped some humans
had evolved beyond the past.

281
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,833
Did you honestly think
we'd roll over

282
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,291
and let mutants take over the planet?

283
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,875
That we wouldn't fight back?

284
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:24,250
Yet your cruelty has only made
humanity more sympathetic to our cause.

285
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,041
Oh, did it?

286
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,500
No, you're in vogue, Storm. A fad.

287
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,500
"Look at my mutant friend."

288
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,791
But under all that fashionable sympathy,

289
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:39,000
normal people know
the more room we make for your kind,

290
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,166
the less we leave for ours.

291
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,041
So we might wear tolerance on our sleeves,

292
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,125
but we know the naked truth.

293
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,125
Tolerance is extinction.

294
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,958
Ten years, Gyrich. Yours to win or lose.

295
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:57,750
I won the day I shot the man
you freak shows look up to.

296
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,583
And you get an "A" for effort,
Mr. Summers,

297
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,666
but we both know you're no Charles Xavier.

298
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,500
You're right. I'm not Charles Xavier.

299
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,791
He'd reason with you. Be patient.

300
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,833
He'd do everything in his power
to save you.

301
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,916
Save me? From what, you?

302
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,458
No. But have you met my wife?

303
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,541
Hatred weakens your mind, Mr. Gyrich.

304
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,916
- Cerebro amplifies my psychic powers,

305
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,041
allowing me to penetrate
your thoughts from any distance I please.

306
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,791
Get out of my head!

307
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,750
<i>One Master Mold is not enough.
We need backups.</i>

308
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,125
<i>I know a place.</i>

309
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,625
Something's wrong. Someone else...

310
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,250
Whoa!

311
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:12,041
<i>No! Not again. I'm so sorry.</i>

312
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,541
<i>Behold, mutant, and despair,
for I am Death.</i>

313
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,666
<i>I am Master Mold.</i>

314
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,083
<i>Jean! Jean, come in!</i>

315
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,125
I'm here. I'm here, Scott.

316
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,041
I'm fine.

317
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,666
What I felt...

318
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,250
We have to stop Trask. Now.

319
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Listen up, people.

320
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,375
Jean's psychic scan placed Trask
in the Sahara Desert.

321
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,708
We fly into the coordinates, detain Trask

322
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,875
and shut down Master Mold for good.

323
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,833
I say we skip detaining

324
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,458
and mail Trask back to the UN
in little pieces.

325
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,000
There will be
no dismembering, Wolverine.

326
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,166
Dismembering?

327
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,958
Nah. Weight loss.

328
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,208
We get this done
by working together as a team.

329
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,583
Think you can do that, Logan?

330
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,250
Jeez, Dad. Keep buzzing in my ear.

331
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,583
What would we do if we ever lost you?

332
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,375
Hang on, people.

333
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,250
Cyclops!

334
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Another "catch the X-Men" day.

335
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,541
Solid work, team. See you on the ground.

336
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,083
To me, my X-Men.

337
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,916
Gyrich warned me
you were coming.

338
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,708
Even in prison, he has friends

339
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,916
who know the mutant agenda
must be stopped.

340
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,708
Trask, we don't want to fight.

341
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,666
You mutants may be
the next step in evolution,

342
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,791
but you're still animals

343
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,333
and you need to be put down.

344
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,375
Final warning, Trask.

345
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,208
<i>Surrender, mutant.</i>

346
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:22,875
<i>Surrender, mutant.
Surrender, mutant. Surrender, mutant.</i>

347
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,541
Head's up.

348
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,000
Greetings, enemy mine.

349
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,000
Might I induce you to a change of heart?

350
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,541
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful, involuntary friendship.

351
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Surrender, mutant.</i>

352
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,583
<i>Surrender, mutant.</i>

353
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,375
Give 'em the forecast.

354
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,208
<i>Omega-level threat detected.</i>

355
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,958
Ancient sands, heed my command

356
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,041
and reclaim these relics of hatred.

357
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,750
Huh?

358
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:18,416
<i>You underestimate us, mutant.</i>

359
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,333
Morph, belly up.

360
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,875
You X-Men might use your gifts
to protect everyone,

361
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,041
but all you do is remind us
that our days are numbered,

362
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:02,083
that humanity itself is obsolete.

363
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:05,958
You've no idea how it feels
to be left behind by the future.

364
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:11,250
Our Special Sciences Division
is flying in to dismantle Master Mold.

365
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,708
Yet again,
humanity is in the X-Men's debt.

366
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:19,166
Trask would rather humans and mutants
go to war than work together.

367
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,708
We all win when men like him fail.

368
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,625
You sound like Charles.

369
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,208
He would have been proud today.

370
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:31,708
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
But to be honest, it was a team effort.

371
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,833
Always has been.

372
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:38,625
Team's on their way back.

373
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:39,791
Mission accomplished.

374
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,208
Freedom! I mean,
I'll get out of your hair.

375
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,041
Look, I know today was strange.

376
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,625
When I first came here,
I ran away, just like you.

377
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,958
The team had saved me
from Sentinels at the mall.

378
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,041
But this place,

379
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:59,958
a place where I could be me,
where a foster brat belonged,

380
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:03,125
that was scarier than any killer robot.

381
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:06,375
Sure, Cyclops still won't
let me fly the jet,

382
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,500
but this isn't some weird school.

383
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,458
It's a family.

384
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,875
A family that accepts you.

385
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,041
Sounds nice.

386
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,833
Your parents don't know, do they?

387
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,083
Some sort of solar energy.

388
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,500
Still figuring it out.

389
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,083
Makes me strong, though. Really strong.

390
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,291
Whenever I do this,
it just reminds me that I'm different.

391
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,000
That I'm lying to them.

392
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,291
Be an X-Man, Jubilee?

393
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,625
I don't even want to be myself.

394
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,958
-  Here.
- Mmm.

395
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,791
What's your job? Hot and rich?

396
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,416
Don't forget single.

397
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,791
Page me. I got a jet, too.

398
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,791
Maybe I'll even let you fly it.

399
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,958
Remember, no powers.

400
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,333
What about Gambit's other powers?

401
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,041
Ow!

402
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:07,041
The responsibility to choose teams
falls to team leader.

403
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,833
I know I've been hardheaded lately.
It's just...

404
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:14,541
I didn't know how the X-Men
could go on without the Professor.

405
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,541
Thought it was on me.

406
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:20,000
But his dream doesn't need me.

407
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,750
It has all of you.

408
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:26,250
And with that said,
Jean and I have an announcement.

409
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:30,416
You're bailing on us to go raise
your little one someplace nice and normal.

410
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Logan, we're not bailing.

411
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,916
Uh, Cyclops and Jean were the first X-Men.

412
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
If they're gone,
who the heck is going to lead the team?

413
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,875
-  <i>Intruder alert!</i>

414
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,291
Sensors show the intruder
has breached the Professor's old office.

415
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,583
Charles Xavier
was the finest man I knew.

416
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,625
Despite our differences,

417
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,041
he never ceased
to have faith in our friendship,

418
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,458
nor forgive my many failings.

419
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:01,208
Perhaps that is why
the old fool has done this.

420
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:04,250
Magneto,
what are you doing in our home?

421
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,958
Your home? I beg to differ, Cyclops.

422
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:12,916
The last will and testament
of Charles Francis Xavier.

423
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,958
As you all will see,

424
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,875
his fortune, his school,

425
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:22,250
everything he built,
everything he fought for,

426
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:27,125
now belongs to me, my X-Men.
