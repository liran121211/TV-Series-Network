1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:05,923
Oh my God, you are not gonna
guess what happened to me on New
Year's.

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,508
You kissed a boy.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,092
Um, no.

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,136
Spencer asked me
to move in with him.

5
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,098
(Lauren)
'Yeah, Lo told me.'

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,978
I was surprised you told Lo
before me though.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,729
It's kind of, like,
big news.

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,857
Well, I'd just found out.

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,233
Thought it was really
nice of him to...

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,986
You know, that he wanted
that but--

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,570
That kinda freaks me out.
I gotta be honest.

12
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,280
- No, it's nice.
- 'Yeah.'

13
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,949
I think if a guy
after a few months asked me

14
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,118
to move in with him,
I would be like, "Whoa."

15
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,622
Yeah.
It was sweet.

16
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,958
Do you want to?

17
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,837
Um...

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,548
I told him that I wasn't
going to, so...

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,010
I'm happy that I decided
to stay here with you though.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,761
Me too, I'm not
like about to celebrate

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,806
'my 21st birthday
with a different roommate.'

22
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,766
A good roommate, that's like
a good pair of jeans.

23
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,727
You know what I mean?
Like, you hang on to those.

24
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,353
- 'You do.'
- No matter what.

25
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,730
You do.

26
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,023

- What's going on?
- Just relaxing.

32
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,881
- What are you up to today?
- Nice.

33
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,131
Nothing much.

34
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,467
Oh, my gosh.

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,802
Is everything's set
for Lauren's surprise party?

36
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,345
Yeah.
Everything's set. Ouch.

37
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,180
We have, um, Hyde

38
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,058
the guest list, the cake.

39
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,309
She knows her birthday
is coming up.

40
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,771
And she thinks it's just you
and her going to dinner?

41
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,441
So maybe if I bailed out,
like, right before dinner?

42
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,109
- It will throw--
- She'll be so mad at you.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,819
She'll be like, "I can't
believe you're leaving."

44
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,487
And I'll be like,
"I'm sorry. I have to go."

45
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,989
And then, like,
it will really throw off.

46
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,783
And then you swoop in
and like...

47
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,868
And then I'll bring her
and I'll just keep texting you.

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,787
- Yeah, and just be like--
- Well, I'll tell her...

49
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,622
I'll just be like, "Yeah, you
know, let's go meet my sister

50
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,331
"and let's go meet
some of my friends at Hyde

51
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,125
and have a couple drinks
since you're 21."

52
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,294
- Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
- And we'll walk off.

53
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,297
And then she's gonna get
so mad, Heidi.

54
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,340
Can you imagine
if that really happened?

55
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,175
That would be
the worst person ever.

56
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,261
- That would be so mean.
- 'I know.'

57
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,680
But it is gonna be so good.

58
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,557
She's gonna die.

59
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,892
- Yeah.
- 'Yeah.'

Short-sleeved sweatshirt.
Orange.

63
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,530
Hey, isn't it your birthday
this weekend?

64
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,407
Mm-hmm. My 21st.

65
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,368
- Your big 21st.
- I'm so excited.

66
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,787
(Whitney)
'What are you gonna do?'

67
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,538
Um...I don't know.

68
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,874
I mean...

69
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,835
I've already told Heidi
I'd go out to dinner with her.

70
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,504
But, I mean, we'll probably
go out afterwards.

71
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,673
- Yeah.
- I haven't really planned it.

72
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,800
I always kind of thought
I'd have a big 21st but--

73
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,927
Yeah. I didn't really
have a big 21st.

74
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,638
It's one of those things
that just being 21 is enough.

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,974
You don't really even need
to have any sort of party.

76
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,684
But I always thought, like,
I would have this huge party

77
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,185
and it just kind of, like,
came really fast.

78
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,395
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,188
I mean I'm kinda like, um...

80
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,774
You don't really have to know
what you're gonna do.

81
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,192
As long as you have your
friends by your side.

82
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,611
- Yeah.
- That's what matters.

83
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,196
Oh, my God.
But 21 is such a big one.

84
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,866
I know.
I'm so excited.

85
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,085
Hey, Spencer.

86
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,587
Hey, so, um,
I got Hyde for Sunday night

87
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,423
for Lauren's surprise
birthday party, and, um...

88
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,134
Yeah, it'll be great.
It'll be like 60 people.

89
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,426
So bring Brody, too.

90
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,808
[laughs]

91
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,434
Okay, I love you.

92
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,352
Bye.

93
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,820
Hi.

94
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,073
Here, let's go inside.

95
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,407
- Hi.
- Hi.

96
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,997
Hi.
I can't really talk to you.

97
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,790
I'm kind of at work.

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,375
- What?
- I'm at work.

99
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,044
- I can't really talk to you.
- Okay.

100
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,921
- That's fine.
- I'm so busy. So what's up?

101
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,839
Uh, I just wanted to see
how you were and everything

102
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,925
'cause I haven't talked
to you in so long.

103
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,134
What's going on?

104
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,344
Nothin'.
Just working a lot.

105
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,765
And I've been so, so busy,
crazy running around.

106
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,600
- Yeah.
- How's school?

107
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,560
Good, but I haven't, like,
talked to Lauren at all

108
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,979
and so I just wanted to, like,
see what was going on with that.

109
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,564
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

110
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,608
Do you think she's ready
to talk at all or not?

111
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,985
No. I don't think she wants
to talk for a while.

112
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,280
I haven't talked to my best
friend of 15 years for, like

113
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,283
what, three weeks
for what, sloppy thirds?

114
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,244
Like, that's...crazy!

115
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,121
I think that's why
she's all mad

116
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,914
'because it was like a code
that you don't hook up'

117
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,960
'with your friends' exes
or, like, past hook-ups.'

118
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,463
One night should not
have even amounted

119
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,966
to two days of this fight
and I think we both agree

120
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,552
on how crazy out of proportion
this got blown. Like--

121
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,304
Well, I told you,
and I told her

122
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,722
I was, like,
that's between you guys

123
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,016
and I want nothing
to do with it. So...

124
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,643
Okay. That's fine.

125
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,770
I mean, it's like
an awkward situation.

126
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,106
- I know. It's so awkward.
- It's so weird, I'm like...

127
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,984
- Yeah.
- Thought, like, I don't know--

128
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,027
- Busy, busy.
- What?

129
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,737
- I said busy, busy.
- Yeah.

130
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,281
- You have to go back to work?
- Yeah.

131
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,407
I'm doing, like,
a lot of office stuff.

132
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,909
- Okay.
- Right, so...

133
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,577
I mean, maybe another place,
another time.

134
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,329
I just, like,
haven't been able to really

135
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,915
like, get a hold
of anyone, so I figured

136
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,209
I'd just see
what was going on.

137
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,044
Okay, well,
have a good day at work.

138
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,963

Are you reading?

145
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,775
I'm reading "You Didn't
Hear It From Us."

146
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,443
Oh, my gosh.

147
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,113
Uh, guess who showed up
at my work, uninvited.

148
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,448
- Who?
- Jen Bunney.

149
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,159
I go, "I think it's really
inappropriate

150
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,077
that you're at my work.
I don't know what happened."

151
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,579
I was like "With you and Lauren,
it's between you and Lauren.

152
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,248
Please don't talk
to me about it."

153
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,625
I go, "Obviously,
you know, you did wrong.

154
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,212
Give her space and don't come
back to my work place."

155
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,088
Like, "Don't be so desperate.

156
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,090
"Do you not have any other
friends? Like, chill out.

157
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,551
I said, I'll talk to you
when I wanna talk to you."

158
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,303
I was friends with her
'cause you're friends with her.

159
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,762
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,681
I told her just
to give you your space.

161
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,183
(Lauren)
'That's all I need,
like, honestly...'

162
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,392
Like, if you do
a really bad thing

163
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,229
or if you do
a really shady thing

164
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,689
be like, "I was shady."
Like, just fess up to it.

165
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,858
That's fine. I don't need
people like that in my life.

166
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,693
You know what I mean, like,
I have too many good people

167
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,988
in my life to try

(Lauren)
'Okay, so, say to me
whatever you want to say'

345
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,274
because you obviously feel
like you need to say something.

346
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,862
Well...

347
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,240
I just have been trying, like,
really hard to talk to you.

348
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,283
I know. Well, I'm saying, like,
you've tried, really tried.

349
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,452
So, like, talk to me now.

350
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,747
Okay, well...

351
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,749
[sighs]

352
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,211
I just feel like everything
got so blown out of proportion

353
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,463
than what it needed to be,
like--

354
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't feel
that way at all but--

355
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,508
Okay, that's the way I feel

356
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,343
and not necessarily, like,
the situation--

357
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,595
(Lauren)
'It probably feels
that way to you'

358
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,304
'cause it didn't
happen to you.

359
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,724
I just think that
what you don't understand

360
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,810
is that I really never
meant to hurt you.

361
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,312
I-I don't think
you meant to hurt me.

362
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,022
I don't think that you
thought about me

363
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,566
at all when you were doing it.

364
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,568
Because you were only
thinking about yourself.

365
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,654
- I wasn't thinking.
- You really like didn't think?

366
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,698
Like it wasn't even a thought
in your head when you left?

367
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,451
No, I'm gonna be perfectly
honest with you.

368
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,747
I knew that Brody was trying
to hook up with me.

369
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,707
But you know what, it shouldn't
even have been a situation.

370
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,000
You shouldn't be in a situation
where you're, you know

371
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,211
hitting on some guy that
I could have been interested.

372
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,922
You know what,
it wasn't just any guy.

373
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,465
It wasn't who he was,
it was the fact

374
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,550
that that was
the first guy

375
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,594
that I was able to have
a crush on after Jason.

376
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,137
- That was a big deal to me.
- Okay.

377
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,139
It had to be that guy.

378
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,975
I didn't know Brody
even mattered.

379
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,560
(Lauren)
'Brody doesn't matter.'

380
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,061
'It's not...
I'm not mad about Brody!'

381
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,980
- This is about a guy.
- No.

382
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,942
It's about the fact that you
did something really shady

383
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,027
and you did it behind my back
and you were evil and conniving.

384
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,781
It wasn't all Brody.
It was you!

385
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:33,033
'And it was, like, I didn't
need my best friend to go'

386
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,535
'and make me feel
like an idiot'

387
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,579
like I've had happen
to me before.

388
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,039
And it just sucked that it
wasn't some girl I hated.

389
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,167
No, it was my best friend

390
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,961
who made me feel
like such an idiot

391
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,671
and made me feel so low.

392
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,422
It was a mistake.

393
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,549
- I messed up one night.
- I know you did.

394
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,301
- That's why, I'm sayin'--
- No, no, no.

395
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,886
You made a mistake
that you went home with him.

396
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,513
You made a mistake
that you kissed him

397
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,348
and you stared in my eyes
and lied to me about it.

398
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,057
Then you made a mistake
that you tried to

399
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,559
blame it on every person
you could.

400
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,227
I'm not trying
to play the victim.

401
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,771
(Lauren)
'You are, you sit there
and you, like'

402
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,230
make your sad puppy-dog face.

403
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,732
You're like,
"Oh, it's so hard."

404
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,734
You put yourself
in this situation.

405
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,612
And I've tried to apologize to
you so much.

406
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,405
Sincerely sorry.

407
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,283
I understand what I did
was wrong. Really, really wrong.

408
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,703
You've screwed up a lot
of friendships because of guys.

409
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,038
The first night
that I told you I liked Jason

410
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,915
and I wanted to kiss him,
you went and kissed him.

411
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,416
- Don't even go there.
- 'Yes, you did.'

412
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,002
- That was--
- 'It doesn't matter.'

413
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,294
You didn't tell me that night.

414
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,838
That was, like,
a joke, Lauren.

415
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,631
- Come on. You can't--
- It's funny.

416
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,216
It's funny 'cause I dated him
for a year after.

417
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,843
I obviously didn't have
any feelings for him.

418
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,012
I know I made a mistake
and I know I lied to you

419
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,180
and I am so sorry.

420
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,017
I've been burned by so many
friends, especially lately.

421
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,352
And I really am starting to
learn who my true friends are.

422
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,688
'And I have every reason
not to trust you.'

423
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,359
You know it's true.

424
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,780
I'm sorry I hurt you.

425
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,449
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

426
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,076
Nothin',
there's nothing I can do?

427
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,411
There's nothing I can say?

428
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,954
No.
- Just like...

429
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,248
