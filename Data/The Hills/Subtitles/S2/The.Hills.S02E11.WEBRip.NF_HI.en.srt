181
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,147
inconvenience of always having

182
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,815
to go get that last little thing

183
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,024
you forgot at your apartment.

- 'What, Spencer?'

186

Go to work and we'll talk
about it when you get back.

187
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,283
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm ready to get serious now.

188
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,533
It's like,
I've been doing the whole

189
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,161
like, single Hollywood thing.

190
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,454
It's like,
if you don't wanna get serious

191
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,955
you just need to tell me that.

192
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,748
I'm serious,
does that mean I have

193
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,500
to move in with you?
Is that the... It's like...

194
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,876
That's the next step?
That's not fair, it's like--

195

It's not about the next step.

196

this relationship better.

is gonna make...

between a best friend

201

slash roommate.

'I would rather you live
by yourself than with Lauren.'

203
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,309
Why don't you decide
my living arrangements

204
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,060
and you can just tell me later?

205
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,812
I've already decided
your living arrangements.

206
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,481
It's a huge thing,
it's not just like

207

I can't just run off.

345
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,058
It was just embarrassing,
you know, like...

346
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,018
- I started hysterically crying.
- 'But you know what?'

347
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,520
You got up and kept doing it

348
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,979
you didn't run off stage
and start crying.

349
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,732
Yeah, it could have been
a lot worse.

350
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,525
I thought it was gonna be
like a domino effect

351
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,402
with the models and they were
all gonna go down.

352
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,488
At that moment, I thought it
was, like, the end of the world.

353
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,365
(Audrina)
'So what is the job, Whitney?'

354
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,368
Lisa titled it, like,
fashion contributor.

355
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,871
'It would have something to do
with styling'

356
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,330
and she said that I would be

357
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:18,042
like, basically
head of all the interns.

358
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,085
'That's kind of a scary thing.'

359
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,670
You didn't tell me that.

360
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,838
You're head of all the interns?

361
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,922
I mean, it's not something

362
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,383
that I really, like...

363
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,468
Well, if I go back there
and intern next year

364
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,929
then you would be
in charge of me.

365
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,723
I mean, technically.

366
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,517
I would rather you be there
instead of, like...

367
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,977
- Emily. That's a possibility.
- 'Emily.'

368
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,397
You'd love that, Lauren.
Come on.

369
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,982
I would quit.
I actually would quit.

370
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,610
'You know you have
to get the job, right?'

371
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,695
Hopefully.

[instrumental music]

373
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,714
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm in the alley.

374
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,173
Okay, I'll come outside.

375
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,801
- 'Alright.'
- Okay, bye.

376
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,356
[sighs]
What's wrong?

377
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,233
You tell me what's wrong.

378
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,735
Nothing.

379
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,487
I disagree.

380
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,529
What?

381
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,574
I got this unresolved...

382
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,952
...living situation
with my girlfriend.

383
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,458
I don't know. It's just,
like, a really big decision.

384
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,502
Well, for me, it's not,
so that's the difference

385
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,962
in our relationship.

386
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,216
It's just over this
you not ready to go

387
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,051
to the next level
with our relationship.

388
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,095
It's not about going the next
level with our relationship

389
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,931
I have other things
going on too.

390
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,724
- It's like, why now?
- Stop saying other things.

391
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,768
- Just say Lauren.
- You know what? It's like...

392
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,562
- No, it's not just Lauren.
- What else is it then?

393
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,648
No, why now? Why are you
pressuring me so much now?

394
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,608
It's, like, what is this
big moment? It's like...

395
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,401
- Come on, just relax.
- 'It is a big moment.'

396
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,654
- I wanna move on with my life.
- It's not like move on or...

397
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,071
- It is that.
- It's not like that.

398
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,782
For me, it is that. It is.

399
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,909
- You can't wait couple months?
- 'What do I have to wait for?'

400
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,202
For me to be ready to...

401
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,537
It's like everybody's
pulling at me.

402
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,747
For God's sakes, just let me
relax for a minute.

403
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,248
I don't know
what you want me to do.

404
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,333
- You do, though.
- 'Okay.'

405
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,543
You want me to move in

406
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,585
what about the repercussions

407
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,170
for the rest of my life?

408
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,422
- 'Where?'
- For my friends, for work.

409
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,675
It's one person,

your work?" "How's it gonna--"

411
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,387
Okay, but why now? Why can't you
wait? I don't understand.

412
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,597
I've been waiting, we've talked
about this for over a month!

413
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,307
Over a month now, we've been
going back and forth.

414
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,851
Is this, like, your way out?

415
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,686
If you wanna be single,
you wanna run around

416
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,522
with all these girls,
just, like, just tell me.

417
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,899
- Heidi. Heidi.
- Don't blame it on moving--

418
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,441
Yes?

419
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,193
If I wanted to go around
with all these girls

420

you think
trying to get you to move in

421
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,530
is what I'd be doing? Is that...

422
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,990
Does that sound
like it makes sense to you?

423
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,491
- Yeah.
- It does?

424
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,369
'Cause it doesn't really
make sense to me.

425
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,997
Hmm, nope. Doesn't really.

426
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,416
Alright, well, my answer is no.

427
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,002
Sweet. My answer
is get out of my car.

428
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,677
Stupid car.
