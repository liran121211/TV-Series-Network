00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,106
- Sure. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

333
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,485
Just like so confused.

334
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,695
Why?

335
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,447
I don't know, it's just, like,
that whole thing

336
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,282
happened with Spencer, you know?

337
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,744
- How are you feelin'?
- I really miss him, like--

338
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,954
How can you miss someone
that does that to you?

339
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,375
You don't choose who you love.
I really, I really do miss him.

340
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,835
He's been calling me a little
bit, and I haven't answered

341
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,798
and he's been texting me,
and he was just kind of, like

342
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,509
"Please, give me a chance
to actually be your boyfriend."

343
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,218
You know, he's, like,
"I'll make it up to you."

344
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,844
And do you believe him?

345
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,722
Do you think
that if you do give him a chance

346
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,724
that you'll be able
to trust him?

347
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,643
I mean, a big part of me does

348
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,270
but I guess you also build
trust with people, you know?

349
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,564
Exactly, and he's done
really nothing to show you

350
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,484
that he's trustworthy right now.

351
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,278
Jordan hurt you, so are you
ready to sign up for that again?

352
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,364
[sighs]
Ugh!

353
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,826
- I just don't know what to do.
- What do you want to do?

354
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,787
What does Heidi want to do
about Spencer?

355
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,330
I mean...

356
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,999
It's up to you. I mean...

357
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,044
There's nothing else
I can say about him.

358
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
[instrumental music]

359
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,689
It's, um, 6:20. Let's see,
how should we do this?

360
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,524
We need a plate here.

361
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,402
- Do you have the plates?
- 'Yeah, here.'

362
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,070
(Emily)
'Do you want to start
moving those down?'

363
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,405
(Lauren)
'Do you want them closer
together?'

364
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,447
'Yeah.'

365
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,616
Wow. Look at us.

366
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,160
We could go into business.

367
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,662
(Emily)
'Everything looks really good,
I've just been'

368
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,288
double-checking
to make sure, you know.

369
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,790
- It's pretty.
- Yeah.

370
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,500
- It looks really good.
- It's amazing.

371
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,837
(Emily)
'Okay.'

372
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,007
- What do you think?
- Perfect.

373
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,467
Do you think
Lisa will like it?

374
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,761
I think so, definitely.

375
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,641
- 'What do you think, Jane?'
- It looks great.

376
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,560
- 'Does it look good?'
- I love the flowers.

377
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,520
- 'Hi, Lisa.'
- 'Hi, Jane.'

378
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,938
What do you think?

379
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,565
- 'It looks beautiful.'
- 'Yeah?'

380
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,901
I think there's a little
too many flowers.

381
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,570
'Maybe you could take
every other one out?'

382
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,946
(male #1)
'That's a good idea.'

383
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,202
'That looks better, Lisa.'

384
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,579
(Lisa)
'Okay, that looks much better.'

385
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,083
I don't think so.

386
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,340
Yeah. I don't know.

387
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,217
I guess
I'll just wait for direction.

388
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,349
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm sure we're staying.

389
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,394
I actually think
we're all set.

390
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,146
Uh, she's not coming.

391
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,064
Emily, why don't you
take a seat at the table?

392
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,858
'And you can take
the other girls down.'

393
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,986
'They're gonna go.
Thank you for doing this.'

394
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,988
'Emily, make yourself
a place card.'

395
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,364
- Right now?
- Yeah.

396
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,574
Okay.

397
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,287
Okay, uh...

398
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,332
- It was so nice meeting you.
- I know.

399
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,959
So good to meet you too.

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,836
Thank you so much
for showing me around.

401
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,921
- Our pleasure.
- Have fun.

402
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,798
And I think it was good.
We did good, right?

403
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,424
We did good, and
hopefully, we'll see you soon.

404
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,593
Yeah, hopefully,
I hope I can come back

405
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,219
and stay a little longer
next time.

406
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,721
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your dinner.

407
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,973
- Thank you.
- Bye.

408
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,766

415

- They're not even eating yet.
- No.

416
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,912
