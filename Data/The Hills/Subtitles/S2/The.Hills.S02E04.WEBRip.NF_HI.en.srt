we should just be friends."

we're more secure
in our relationship.

Um, I'm gonna meet up
with Audrina later.

00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,154
Ooh, are you going alone?

15
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,406
- It's a solo mish?
- Solo mish.

16
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,867
That's good.
You should just talk to her.
