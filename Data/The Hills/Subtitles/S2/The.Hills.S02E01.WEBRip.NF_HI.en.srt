00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,886
Yeah, my * * * golf clubs.

[sighs]

3
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,522
There's so much stuff.

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,863
These aren't my towels.

5
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,781
- 'What else is there?'
- That's it.

6
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:36,704
- That's mine.
- You're my...

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,961
Now, what am I supposed
to do with all this?

8
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,671
I'm sorry,
I just didn't wanna be like

9
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,715
dropping your stuff off
on the curb.

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,800
That's not how I saw it.

11
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,514
Stop. Come here.

'Are you still gonna
be my buddy?'

14
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,107
I can't be a normal buddy
though. It doesn't work.

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,653
- Why?
- I can't 'cause it's you.

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,031
So what do you want me to do?
I don't understand you.

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
I'm saying I don't want you
out of my life.

18
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,035
I don't wanna be like, no, I'm
never gonna talk to you again

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,703
but I can't be normal with you.

20
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,371
Like, I want to, but I can't.

21
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,123
It's not that easy to,
like, like, not see you.

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,626
I know, but it's harder
to see you.

23
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,967
It just is.

24
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,930
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:36,805

- I'm great. How are you?
- Good.

66
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,544
What's going on?

67
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,379
Nothing. I just got here
little bit ago.

68
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,215
So what's going on?
How was your summer?

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,758
It was good. How was yours?

70
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,177
Um, mine was great.

71
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,179
- I got to go to Paris.
- 'I know.'

72
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,264
- How was it?
- 'It was insane.'

73
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,474
I mean, it was one of
the coolest things, like...

74
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,811
- Oh, my God. Cute purse.
- Oh, thank you.

75
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,772
They had all
these couture dresses

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,815
from the last runway shows.

77
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,401
See, like, I worked on
this photo-shoot this summer.

78
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,238
- How cool.
- Yeah. And how was your summer?

79
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
Did you end up
getting that beach house?

80
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,992
- I didn't ask you about that.
- Yeah, but not for that long.

81
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,036
Like, I knew
you and Jason broke up

82
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,747
but I didn't even
know what happened.

83
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,125
Like, we just kept fighting
every single day

84
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,626
and it was like the same fights

85
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,586
and we both knew
we were gonna break up.

86
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,964
Are you okay now?

87
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,174
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,718
So I don't know.
I wonder what we're doing today.

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,511
Have you seen Lisa yet?

90
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,264
Just briefly said hi to her,
but I haven't, like

91
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,390
sat down and talked to her
or anything.

92
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,064
I, like, haven't even talked
to her since the Paris thing.

93
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,233
- Really?
- Oh, so real.

94
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,443
Oh, Brent is calling.

95
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,988
Hello.

96
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,242
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

97
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,288
We got to go into Lisa's office.

98
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,914
- Oh, right now?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,218
Hi, Whitney. Hi, Lauren.
How are you?

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,137
- 'Good. How are you?'
- Good.

102
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,847
- 'Welcome back.'
- Thank you.

103
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,099
- Has school started yet?
- 'Yeah.'

104
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,725
I've been in school
for a month already.

105
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,769
And, Lauren,
are you back at FIDM?

106
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,479
Um, I start really soon.

107
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,858
- How was the summer?
- 'Summer was great.'

108
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,360
- Um, Paris was amazing.
- Did you meet Fiona?

109
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,238
I met Fiona.
She was unbelievable.

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,657
She sent us
to Coco Chanel's apartment.

111
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,576
We got to see that,
so it was pretty amazing.

112
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,538
Well, that was a great choice
of yours to make to go to Paris.

113
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,081
Is it something
that you think that you might

114
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,875
be interested
in doing next summer?

115
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,045
Definitely. It would be awesome
if I could do that.

116
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,672
Oh, I'm sure we'll have
a conversation and discuss that.

117
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,633
- 'Okay.'
- Lauren didn't go to Paris.

118
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,887
She's gonna always be known as
the girl who didn't go to Paris.

119
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,930
'Do you regret that decision?'

with your boyfriend?

121
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,564
