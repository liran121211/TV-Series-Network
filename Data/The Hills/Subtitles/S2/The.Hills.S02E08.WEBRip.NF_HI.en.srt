1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,170
What if we go to Santa Barbara
for the weekend

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,379
and get away, just you and me?

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,631
I really need to start spending

4
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,424
more time with Lauren, though.

5
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,259
- 'You need more time for what?'
- Like, to spend together.

6
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,594
I don't see her that much.

7
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,095
You have a roommate that

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,555
looks at me like the plague.

9
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,307
I mean, I honestly, I really

10
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,433
think she's gonna come around.

11
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,977
Aah.. Yeah!

12
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,604
When there's a little more time,
she's just gonna be like...

13
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,356
"Look, I accept this."

14
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,607
Whatever, all these people
need to stop

15
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,484
worrying about us dating.

16
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,070
Aw!

17
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,033
Ahh.

18
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,535
How cute are you today?

19
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,328
Come on, let's just
go to Santa Barbara.

20
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,249
- Mmm.
- Let's go.

21
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,377
- You wanna go? Ah.
- Yeah.

(Lisa)
'Hi.'

28
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,896
- 'How are you?'
- Good. Great.

29
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,898
I'm always wondering
why you guys are in spring

30
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,400
and I'm in fall.

31
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,319
Next week, you're going to be
working with Lawren Howell.

32
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,780
She does mostly Vogue, but she

33
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,033
covers for Teen Vogue
and Men's Vogue, as well.

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,702
'She's very particular.
She's very precise.'

35
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,120
She's somebody that
you will learn a lot from

36
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,414
if you pay attention.

37
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,832
- Okay.
- 'Okay?'

38
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,333
'You're going to do this young'

39
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,627
'Los Angeles
real children shoot.'

40
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,713
I think Carlos has got, um

41
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,673
about three or four lined up

42
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,842
but if you have anyone...

43
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,177
...young, 15, 16...

44
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,056
I have a younger sister
who's a senior in high school.

45
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,433
'I mean, she looks like
she would fit kind of'

46
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,602
the prototype of
the Teen Vogue girl.

47
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,520
Then maybe she can
come in and meet us and

48
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,689
and, uh, we can
take a polaroid of her.

49
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,691
We'll do the proper casting.
Will she do that?

50
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,902
Okay... Yeah, she would love to,
I'm sure.

51
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,279
- We'll see how that works out.
- 'Great.'

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,405
- Okay.
- 'Okay. See you then.'

53
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,782
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'

54
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,830
That's so cool
if Jade gets it.

55
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,916
I know. I hope she does.

56
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,751
Have you ever worked
with Lawren before?

57
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,502
I don't think so.
I know I've met her before.

58
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,296
I hope that she's not, like

59
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,340
as strict as everyone's
making her out to be, you know.

60
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,594
- She, she worked for Vogue.
- And Anna Wintour, you know.

61
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,429
It's one thing to work
for Vogue.

62
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,431
It's another thing to work
for Anna Wintour, so...

63
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,393
Hmm...another photo shoot.

64
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,312
I wonder how many
I've worked on.

65
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,814
How long did you work for W?

66
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,899
I worked for them,
I think, three summers.

67
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,484
- Oh, wow.
- 'Yeah.'

68
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,111
And then you did this
for two years?

69
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,362
- Yeah.
- You're probably so over it.

70
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,825
I'm just ready to have more
responsibility than just like--

71
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,951
- Hi, girls.
- 'Hey.'

72
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,494
- 'How are you?'
- 'Hi.'

73
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,037
I just wanted to go over
a few quick things.

74
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,413
We've got kind of a big shoot.

75
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,707
There's six kids, which just

76
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,418
means a lot of clothes,
a lot of people.

77
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,546
And I need you guys to be
really, really organized.

78
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,423
'I don't want everyone
to be on top of each other.'

79
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,342
'Everything has to be
returned the next day.'

80
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,344
Nothing can come back dirty,
nothing can come back

81
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,429
with holes in it,
with tags missing, all that.

82
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,015
We'll just have to be
really organized.

83
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,599
Getting one kid dressed,
while we're shooting

84
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,768
another one,
have everything steamed.

85
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,353
I mean, that's kind
of a thing for me.

86
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,981
If I grab a dress
that hasn't been steamed

87
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,025
and, you know, you guys have
been standing there

88
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,443
that's kind of,
you know, a problem.

89
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,320
So, the call time will be nine

90
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,864
'so, we'll all need
to get there at eight.'

91
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,157
- Okay.
- Thanks, guys.

92
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,074
Bye.

93
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,661
Hmm.

94
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,496
- I'll steam.
- You'll steam?

95
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,165
- Thank you.
- I don't mind.

96
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,792
I've done enough steaming
in my interning career.

97
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,209
I'm sure you have,
I didn't realize

98
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,586
you had done five years,
that's crazy.

99
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,338
I'm just ready to be something

100
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,298
other than, like,
someone's intern, you know?

101
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,592
Yeah.

- Hi.

104
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,192
- You doing some homework?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,776
Look at you!

106
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,371
- Heidi.
- Hey-yo!

107
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,083
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Um, I...

108
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,086
Think I'm going to Santa Barbara
for a couple days.

109
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,046
Or for like, until Sunday.

110
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,757
Oh.

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,759
Oh, are you packing now?

112
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,262
Stuffing it in. I think just
tonight and tomorrow night.

113
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,514
Um, do you wanna come
to Santa Barbara?

114
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,683
- Who else are you going with?
- Spencer.

115
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,393
Do you think
I want to go to Santa Barbara?

116
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,895
No, but I'm just putting out
the invitation.

117
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,479
Well, thank you,
I appreciate that.

118
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,982
So, Monday evening

119
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,069
we should have a whole
Heidi and Lauren alone night.

120
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,570
Uh, yeah.

121
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,114
Like, we can go get
our nails done

122
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,117
and get massages. Ha ha ha!

123
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,660
- Good times.
- 'Umm.'

124
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,328
I think I'm gonna
get out of here.

125
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,997
- I'll get out of your room.
- 'Shall we go?'

126
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:49,998
Yeah.

'Where's Heidi?'

135
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,067
She's in Santa Barbara
all weekend with Spencer.

136
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,735
I didn't tell you,
Chris is this guy

137
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,737
who works with me
at Epic Records.

138
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,572
He asked me out Friday night
after work

139
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,742
so we went, and we played pool
and had drinks.

140
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,204
And he has three roommates,
and one of them is single.

So, if you wanna come
with me and meet him.

I've become that friend

where it's like, "Well, maybe
they'll have a friend for you."

144
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,756
He's so nice, like,
he's not like any other guy

145
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,176
that I've dated,
like, he's into music.

all go out one weekend.

00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,874
and I need to count on you guys.

344
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,668
'It's just us, okay?'

345
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,378
So, Jade, why don't you go
in the other room

346
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,879
hair and makeup
with the other kids.

347
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,549
Get started there?
I'll be in in a minute.

348
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,093
Whitney, during the day,
why don't you be with me.

349
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,053
- Just stay by my side?
- 'Okay.'

350
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,014
'Have pins, tape, everything
ready to go from the prop kit.'

351
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,225
Lauren, if you just could stay
in here and make sure the kids

352
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,936
are dressed for each,
each setup we do, okay?

353
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,022
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks, guys.

354
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,191
- How was the date?
- Um, it was good.

355
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,069
- He's cute.
- 'Really?'

356
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,280
- Audrina's guy was chill too.
- 'Really?'

357
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,948
They were really,
like, cool guys.

358
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,325
They were like normal.
Know what I mean?

359
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,368
That's good.

360
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,246
It's, like, really refreshing
to meet people like that here.

361
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,998
Yeah.

362
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,958
Whitney, when you're putting
stuff on the rack

363
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,834
all the hangers
go this way so that you

364
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,796
see the front of the clothes
when you're going through it.

365
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,797
Mm-hmm.

'Okay, you guys,
we're moving outside.'

368
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,058
'We're doing our first shot.
Let's go.'

369
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,438
[indistinct chattering]

370
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,897
Where's Whitney?

371
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,202
Whitney, I need a piece
of double-stick tape.

372
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,968
'Whitney, can you just get
Colton's Converse'

373
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,721
'and bring them to him?'

374
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,973
- Are you glad you did this?
- Yeah, of course.

375
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,768
I mean, it's like an opportunity

376
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,478
'that anyone would wanna have.'

377
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,523
I just think you're lucky
to be on...

378
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,859
- My side?
- On that side of things.

379
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,527
- Why?
- I don't know.

380
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,863
It's just hard to do
things for someone

381
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,949
when they're not really, like,
respecting your position.

382
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,785
I know she's really
good at her job.

383
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,705
Maybe I'm just being
a little pansy, I don't know.

384
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,791
No, well, I mean,
I haven't seen it, but I...

385
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,502
...can't imagine that
you're just making it all up.

386
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,087
Yeah, I don't know.

387
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,756
'I just want to wear
this dress.'

388
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,758
'Yeah, that one looked
really cute on you.'

389
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,134
If she gives you a preference,
or if you really don't feel

390
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,136
comfortable in that other one,
then speak up.

391
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,472
Not that I should really be
talking, 'cause I'm not really

392
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,557
speaking up, but...

393
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,434
Yeah.

394
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,935
'It's just like when you're
the one in the clothes'

395
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,062
you speak up.

396
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,653
I'm just ready to,
like, hold the reins.

397
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,364
You know, like,
I-I wanna style

398
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,659
and, like, I don't wanna just
be cutting tags off.

399
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,120
She used to be Anna Wintour's
assistant, right?

400
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,955
So you know she's gone
through it.

401
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,041
Obviously, I feel so lucky
to have this job and...

402
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,001
You know, it's,
it's what I wanna do

403
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,756
but at the same time, like,
as much as I love clothes

404
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,466
they're only clothes.

405
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,554
(Lauren)
'Do you want us to start
packing up anything or...'

406
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,849
- Um, yeah.
- 'Cause I think this is--

407
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,350
Let's keep all
the accessories out.

408
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,562
Let's pack up the girls' racks.

409
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,856
Definitely pack up all
the stuff we've already shot.

410
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,775
(Lauren)
'Okay.'

411
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,860
And just to let you know,
I don't mean to be difficult

412
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,445
but, I have, uh

413
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,697
like, a farewell dinner
for my sister tonight

414
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,867
'so we have to leave
once Jade is gone.'

415
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,577
(Lawren)
'Well, I'm gonna need
you guys to stay'

416
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,871
and to help me pack up
at the end of it.

417
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,165
The dinner is at six over in

418
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,792
over on the West Side.

419
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,418
Okay, well,
I'm gonna need you to stay.

420
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,338
Well, okay.

421
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,548
(Lauren)
I can do it,
if she needs to leave.

422
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,801
- Okay. Well, it's a lot.
- I'll do as much as I can.

423
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,719

I mean, I don't mind staying
a little later.

- Thank you.
