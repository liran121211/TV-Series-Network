Um, I slept here last night.

Well, that's a first.

He, um, asked me
to move in with him again.

8
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,354
- Do you wanna move in with him?
- 'I don't know.'

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,105
I wanna make, like,
a rational decision.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,858
Not like, "Oh, great,
let's just move in."

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,526
Like, his whole logic is,
like, "Why wouldn't you

12
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,486
wanna move in with me?
Like, you don't want--"

move in together that soon.

14

Like, you told me at the
beginning of this relationship

15
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,994
you said, "I will never move in
with someone

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,120

for at least two years."

00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,497
- Yeah.
- 'Like, you said that to me.'

18

- How are you?
- Good.

Speaking of life-changing,
um...

340
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,024
- Yeah?
- I moved in with Spencer.

341
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,944
After all my grown-up
advice to you

342
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,739
and you didn't do
what I said?

343
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,615
Because it was like
the advice I needed to hear

344
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,242
to make the decision I did.

345
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,744
You know, it's like,
I'm really happy though.

346
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,704
And I'm gonna cook him
dinner tonight.

347
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,622
Like our first. I've never
cooked for him before.

348
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,290
- It's like our first--
- Have you ever cooked dinner?

349
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,625
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.

350
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,085
- What are you cooking?
- I know.

351
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,087
I think pasta,
or something easy.

352
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,047
I mean, do you even have all
of the equipment to cook with?

353
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,007
Oh, my God.
No, I have to go get it.

354
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,342
- What's it called?
- Dinner.

355
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,595
- No.
- What? Pasta? What?

356
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,471
The equipment to cook, like.
Oh, pots and pans.

357
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,014
Yeah, yeah.
I have to go get all that.

358
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,516
Oh, okay, well,
good luck with that.
