'So, what's going on
with you and Heidi?'

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,381
You guys are working on your
friendship now, aren't you?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,301
The way we get along is we
just don't talk about Spencer.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,136
I mean,
she doesn't say his name.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,847
We just don't talk about him,
and it's awkward

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,098
'cause he's obviously,
a really big part of her life.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,225
I mean, she is with him
every night.

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,186
She spends way more time
with him than me

9
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,938
so it's, like, kinda weird.

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,315
I don't know what he did,
it's like he put a spell

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,942
on her or something,
or she's just, like

12
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,610
'head over heels for this guy.'

13
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,111
I don't know. It's weird.
You know what I mean?

14
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,446
Like, I still, I don't like him.

15
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,948
I don't wanna be around him.

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,908
Do they say,
"I love you," and stuff?

17
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,536
Already?

18
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,954
She's making the same mistake

19
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,789
she did with Jordan, kind of.

20
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,582
That was the day, like,
she made such a big deal.

21
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,501
She was, like,
with Jordan, she was like

22
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,086
"I will never, I always
will have at least one night

23
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,672
a week where
I stay away from them"

24
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,799
and like,
she stayed at our apartment

25
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,467

27
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,054

when she's like

"Let's plan a Lauren
and Heidi day."

29
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,560

be Lauren and Heidi day."

176
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,029
One more.
One more. One more.

00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,543
(Heidi)
'Give me a lap dance, Jen,
for your birthday.'

178
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,837
Give me a lap dance.

00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,132
[cheering]

180
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,012
It was a joke.

181
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,992
Alright! After party!

182
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,545
[instrumental music]

183
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,222
(Whitney)
'So I think that we're'

184
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,016
'setting up
for a meeting in here.'

185
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,518
How many are there?

186
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,227
Well, let's just
set 'em on first and then

187
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,856
we'll decide
how we're gonna space.

188
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,150
- Ahem.
- 'Did you go out last night?'

189
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah, went out to, um

190
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,322
Les Deux for Jen's birthday.

191
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,616
'Did you have fun?'

192
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,535
I was there, they
didn't stay the whole time.

193
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,578
They ended up leaving me,
I guess the four of them

194
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,247
went back to Brody's condo
last night.

195
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,583
- Oh, yeah?
- 'Jen called me...'

196
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,460
And she's like, "Hey,
I need to ask you something."

197
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,711
But I... A-And then I was like,
"What do you need to ask me?"

198
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,381
'She's like, "You know
what I need to ask you."'

199
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,090
I was like,
"Are you asking me if I care

200
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,342
if you hook up with Brody?"

201
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,135
And she was like, "Yeah."

202
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,388
- Oh! She said, "Yeah?"
- And I'm like--

203
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,139
She had the nerve
to ask you that

204
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,684
as if she shouldn't have
known in the first place?

205
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,977
And of course, Jen told me
that it was Spencer

206
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,230
the whole time being like,
"You should hook up with Brody."

207
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,190
You know,
'cause Spencer hates me.

208
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,733
Well, then, Jen should be
strong enough to be like

209
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,862
"Obviously, Lauren's
my first priority," and...

210
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,823
But it's like I know Heidi was
there too, and it's just like

211
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,201
I'm so tired of my friends

212
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,078
just screwing me over.

213
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,664
Yeah, people just need to get

214
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,708
their priorities straight.
You know, what I'm saying?

215
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,876
They're cool to hang out with,
but really, is it really worth

216
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,128
like screwing
a friend over for that guy?

217
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,881
I mean, obviously,
they have no idea

218
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,050
'what they're doing right now.'

219
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,968
Oh!

220
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,346
[instrumental music]

221

222
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,317
(Chiara)
'Wait, and did they
end up hooking up?'

223
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,570
Yeah, they hooked up.

224
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,114
And Heidi was there, she could
have stopped the situation.

225
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,532
Heidi should have stopped it.

226
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,242
She not just could,
she should have...

227
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,784
And Jen and Lauren
have been friends

228
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,412
since they were,
like, four or five.

229
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,748
So she shouldn't even
have went.

230
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,416
- She should know.
- Right.

231
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,042
Especially,
since Lauren seems so...nice.

232
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,628
She's so nice.
She's such a good friend.

233
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,714
She got Jen diamonds
for her birthday.

234
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,633
And Jen repaid her
by hanging out with a guy

235
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,967
that she's kinda seeing?

236
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,052
I would be so pissed at Heidi

237
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,638
especially for egging
something like that on.

238
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,556
Yeah, I think, it's...
Spencer's, like

239
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,308
brainwashing her a little bit.

240
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,101
Like, I don't know what...
First of all

241
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,978
Heidi would never do that,
if it was a year ago.

242
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,730
Like, she would be like,
no, don't do that

243
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,273
like, that's, Lauren
and him are hanging out--

244
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,983
It's weird that Heidi
doesn't seem to value

245
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,985
Lauren enough to like...

246
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,819
And Jen too,
Jen grew up with her.

247
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,324
It sucks, because those are
her two best friends.

248
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,784
It's like, those are her
best, best friends.

249
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,368
Is she okay?

250
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,953
- No. She's not okay.
- No.

251
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,747
It's really sad.
I feel bad for Lauren.

252
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,290
'I do too.'

253
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,250
[instrumental music]

254
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,509
(Lauren)
'I'm just so sick
of the situation.'

255
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,760
[cellphone ringing]

256
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,391
Jen.

257
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,393
You and Heidi both act like
you did nothing wrong.

258
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,395
You did a really cut-throat
thing, and so did Heidi.

259
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,939
So you guys need to stop,
like, putting it on each other

260
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,941
and stop making it seem like
I'm making drama.

261
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,652
And, you know what,
I would expect it from someone

262
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,904
I didn't know, but not,
like, my oldest friend.

263
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,783
But it's just kinda like code,
Jen, that you don't really...

264
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,494
You don't hook up with people
that your friends, like

265
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,287
hung out with, or dated.

266
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,873
'So Heidi was in the room
as he was doing this?'

267
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,211
No, Jen, if you're sorry, you
don't sit there and make excuse

268
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,129
after excuse, you say,
I did a really bad thing

269
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,548
and you apologize.

270
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,844
You-You sounded super-sorry,
seriously, Jen

271
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,970
don't be at my apartment,
when I get home.

272
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,807
Mm!

273
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,519
Okay, then,
I'm sorry that I called

274
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,062
like, that's not an apology.

275
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,772
I mean,
not that I think Spencer

276
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,940
is, like, the issue, I think--

277
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,235
- Spencer is the issue.
- Yeah. I mean--

278
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,321
'He was, he started the issue,
but her behavior is the issue.'

279
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,866
Yeah.

280
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,159
'I mean, I don't wanna say
this in a harsh way'

281
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,453
but, like,
it's really time to evaluate

282
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,414
the friendships that you have--

283
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,499
I know, but that sucks, when
it's, your two best friends.

284
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,252
It's-It's awful.

285
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,128
(Whitney)
'Oh, I think
she's calling you again.'

286
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,004
I don't care.

287
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,386
[sighs]

288
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,471
[instrumental music]

289
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,898
[door knob rattles]

290
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,484
- Hi.
- Hey.

291
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,489
Um, so I need to talk to you
about what happened last night.

292
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,742
I had nothing to do
with any of this, it's like

293
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,952
I'm sorry, if I left you
and that hurt your feelings--

294
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,705
Like, If things are going,
gonna continue the way

295
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,624
they're going right now

296
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,251
then that's not okay, I
don't wanna live here anymore.

297
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,336
I just don't get how
this is becoming all on me

298
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,755
when it's, like, Jen's the one

299
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,381
who's, like,
making out with Brody--

300
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,258
Ask Jen,
I told, I told Jen, I said

301
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,302
"Don't be at the apartment
when I get home."

302
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,429
I don't wanna talk to you, I'm
not talking to Jen right now.

303
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,347
I'm livid with Jen.
Okay?

304
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,391
I am really shocked
by Jen's behavior.

305
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,728
But the thing is, last night
was just kind of like

306
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,605
'the straw that broke
the camel's back.'

307
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,982
Like, it's not a secret,
you know that things

308
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,984
aren't fine with us,
like, I really don't feel like

309
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,570
you're the same friend to me
as you used to be. I don't.

310
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,156
That's just so unfair, because
I feel like you put this wall

311
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,283
because you put this wall up
about Spencer. It's like--

312
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,869
Oh, my God!
I'm trying to be a good friend.

313
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,996
I am too!
So what am I supposed to do?

314
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,957
It's so unfair that,
it's like I have to choose

315
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,583
and it's like,
I'm trying to be here and--

316
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,376
No, you're not choosing,
you're not.

317
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,295
You don't even have to choose.
But you've chosen.

318
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,880
- Don't keep saying that--
- 'You have. You've chosen.'

319
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,715
- You make that up.
- You know what, you know what--

320
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,968
I consider, I consider...

321
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,178
I feel like if it continues
to go the way it is, like

322
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,138
I'm not gonna be friends
with you anymore.

323
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,017
'Like, all we do is, like, fight
or pretend things are fine'

324
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,936
and just not talk about
problems, and that's not

325
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,813
how best friends
should be at all.

326
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,815
And I feel like if we just
continue, then it's not...

327
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,316
It's just gonna get worse.

328
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,235
So then what do we do
to fix it?

329
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,112
'Cause I wanna fix it,
I don't wanna just stop

330
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,948
being best friends with you,
it's, like, I love you.

331
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,741
Heidi, we don't have to stop
being best friends

332
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,034
but something has to change.

333
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,077
So what are we gonna change?

334
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,246
I'm gonna be able to talk
to you about Spencer?

335
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,248
It's like, you know,
Spencer has you freakin'

336
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,918
like, brainwashed,
it's so sick to see.

337
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,170
'It is, like,
yo-you've changed so much'

338
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,006
'since you've been
with Spencer, you have.'

339
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,216
I'm so tired of being like,
"Pay attention to me.

340
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,051
- Pay attention to me."
- That's not true.

341
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,845
You have to remind me
of certain things, people--

342
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,763
I don't have to remind you
to be my best friend.

343
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,807
I'm not reminding you to be
my best friend, but Lauren

344
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,475
you're putting me
in the weirdest position

345
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,435
'cause it's like, I'm trying
here, but I can't talk

346
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,604
to you about my boyfriend,
so what do you want me to do?

347
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,314
I thought you were making
an effort with Spencer too.

348
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,607
It's like, this is the whole
hardest thing.

349
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,150
- I am making an effort!
- I know!

350
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,819
I'm making an effort,
and then he does * * *

351
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,821
like he did last night,
he's a sucky person!

352
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,614
- He's a<i> sucky</i><span style="bodyStyle"> person!</i>
- Lauren.

353
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,367
I hate Spencer,
I'm never gonna like Spencer.

354
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,452
He did a really
messed up thing last night.

355
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,204
'I know that he pushed Jen
and Brody together.'

356
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,041
Why did he do it?
Why did he do it?

357
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,500
'Give me a good reason
why he did it.'

358
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,669
Did Brody tell you that
she kissed him?

359
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,589
- Yes.
- Bitch.

360
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,593
I haven't felt so betrayed
by best friends in so long.

361
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,428
- Like--
- I didn't do anything.

362
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,972
Yeah, exactly.
You didn't do anything!

363
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,474
I can't
control people, Lauren.

364
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,227
So you... You sit on the phone
and tell him you love him.

365
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,063
If he loved you,
he wouldn't do * * * like that

366
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,480
'to your best friend.'

367
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,024
You know that
it's not gonna be okay

368
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,483
until you
and Spencer are broken up.

369
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,818
Like, you know that.

370
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,403
Because he is the problem.

371
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,738
We don't have any problems
without him.
