00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,087
(Lauren)
'Oh, my gosh, this is 75% off.'

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,589
That's cute.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,384
And so, who's all coming
for New Year's?

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,512
Are your friends from Laguna?

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,182
I'm inviting my friends Jill,
Natania, and Lo.

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,726
So you've known Lo
since high school?

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,979
I've known Lo since,
like, third grade.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,314
You'll really like Lo.
She's hilarious.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,233
Is she anything like Jen?

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,861
'No, I-I told you, like,
one of the reasons'

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,403
we were, like,
got in a big fight

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,655
and, like, didn't talk
over the last

13
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,072
couple years is 'cause of Jen.

14
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,783
So, we'll just get ready
at your house?

15
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,576
'Yeah, we'll all meet
at our house.'

16
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,578
I have a feeling that Heidi
will end up spending

17
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,372
most of the night with Spencer,
which is understandable.

18
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,290
- It's New Year's.
- Oh, yeah, it's her boyfriend.

19
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,334
But I mean, that's why I went
and invited other people

20
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,211
was 'cause I didn't wanna depend
on her to be, like--

21
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,464
Mm-hmm, to be, like,
the third wheel or something.

22
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,966
'Are they coming in the limo?'

23
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,342
Spencer's not allowed
in the car.

24
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,803
- No? I know. I know.
- No.

25
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,014
I'm so happy.
This New Year's is gonna be fun.

26
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,432
'I know. I just hope
it's better than last year.'

27
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,935

- You did fabulous.
- Thanks for coming.

44
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,355
So do you, do you guys always,
like, switch around positions?

45
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,651
Usually I play, like, either
catcher or in the outfield.

46
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,320
So, what do you guys think
you're gonna do for New Year's?

47
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,281
I guess, you know what
when I asked Heidi something

48
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,116
about New Year's, she's like,
"What are you gonna do for

49
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,577
New Year's?"
and I was kind of, like...

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,203
What are we gonna do?

51
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,413
Well, she's gonna
wanna be with Spencer

52
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,248
on New Year's, but...

53
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,208
I kissed, like, three guys
on New Year's last year.

54
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,963
It was like, the most,
the sluttiest moment of my life.

55
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,589
I'm just gonna grab
someone next to me.

56
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,633
I did that two years ago.

57
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,468
I remember you telling me
about that.

58
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,805

'It'd be fun shopping for a
New Year's eve dress, isn't it?'

63
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,734
(Heidi)
Really? Have you ever shopped
for a New Year's eve dress?

64
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,153
I do have two sisters,
sweetheart.

65
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,864
So, yes, actually.

66
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,532
So, what's the plan
for New Year's, huh?

67
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,534
Do we get our own night,
or what?

68
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,955
- We'll go to dinner together.
- Without the posse?

69
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,040
Yes, without the posse, and then

70
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,208
we will all go to Area
together afterwards.

71
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,003
- Who's "We all?"
- I made up with them.

72
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,754
With Lauren and her friends
from Laguna.

73
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,631
I'm done hanging out
with Lauren.

74
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,342
I'm really excited to spend
New Year's with Lauren, though.

75
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,469
Like, 2006 was a hard year
on our friendship

76
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,554
and I think that this year's
gonna be a lot better

77
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,389
and I wanna make more
of an effort, and I wanna spend

78
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,517
New Year's with her too,
and I want to spend it

79
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,810
with my two favorite people.

80
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,936
She means a lot to me too

81
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,063
and it's just unfair to me.

82
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,314
- I think I--
- That was serious.

83
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,483
I know. I know. Give me a hug.

84
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,028
I don't want anything
to be unfair to Heidi.

85
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,363
I'm a very fair person.

86
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,573
So, I got some big news
I wanna talk to you about.

87
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,034
What's the news?

88
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,243
- The news is...
- What?

89
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,830
What if I was moving out
of the condo

90
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,290
and I was gonna get a house...

91
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,001
...with Princess Heidi?

92
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,671
No? Maybe?

93
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,632
I mean...

94
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,426
I mean, obviously, I would
love to move in with you.

95
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,220
But?

96
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,056
I mean, I made a commitment
to live with her.

97
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,391
You know, I'm trying
to work things out.

98
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,727
I feel like that would
just make it worse in a way.

99
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,897
That gets really annoying.
And it's really...

100
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,232
I don't wanna say affecting
our relationship

101
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,985
but it definitely
doesn't help it.

102
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,862
Well, at least put that
in your head because I think

103
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,655
it's a good solution
because, uh--

104
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,323
It's not like we won't
have to worry about it anymore.

105
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,242
It's, like,
she'll always be my best friend.

106
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,036

are still best friends?

We're planning, I don't know,
like, what your deal is

117
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:37,194
but we're planning on going
there and, uh, Area's countdown.

118
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,404
We have to leave earlier,
'cause we have to pick up a guy

that I'm bringing with us.

- Yeah.

If you had come out,
you would know that.

122
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,494
But he's visiting from Colorado,
so he's only out here

123
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,206
for like,
another five days, I think.

124
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,000
I asked him out, I called him
and I'm picking him up.

125
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,460
When you see him, you'll be like

126
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,628
"That's not Lauren's type."

127
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,796
Maybe that's a good thing.

00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,047

- Audrina, you look pretty.
- Thank you.

133
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,434
What's your New Year's
resolution?

134
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,811
Audrina and I
are gonna take kickboxing.

00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,563

- 'Hey, Lauren.'

Should we just
grab something to eat?

140
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,405
We can order, like, a pizza.

165

...it was gonna compromise
our friendship.

166

It shouldn't be this,
like, juggling act.

- 'Yeah.'
- You know what I mean?

342
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,866
I'm very sad
you weren't there, though.

343
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,326
I know.

344
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,456
I mean, yeah, we're all trying
to find out, like

345
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,167
who our true friends are
and stuff, and it sucks, but...

- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

349
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,769
- I'm good. Thanks.
- It's under "Spencer," for two.

350
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,689
- Here's your Virgin Lemon Drop.
- Thank you so much.

351
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,066
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

352
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,777
This one's mine. That's yours.

Cheers. I love you more.

- I do. I really do.
- No, you really don't.

356
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,871
Heidi, I deal with all your
crazy friends, all your drama.

357
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,874
And I deal with all that...
for you.

358
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,709
Heidi's the one
with all the baggage.

359

You know what?
I don't have baggage.

You have...

361
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,089
I have a lot of people
in my life.

362
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,924
- Lot of things that I'm doing.
- 'I call them baggage.'

363
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,551
You call them baggage,
but that's a lot of things

364
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,261
that I have to deal with.

365
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,471
There's a lot of people
in my life. It's...

366

368
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,353
I've been thinking a lot,
and I think it's really rude

369
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,731
that you've chosen
Lauren over me.

370
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,691
I think it's really rude
that you'd make me choose.

371
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,610
- Oh, is that what you think?
- Yeah.

372
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,945
Yeah, you are choosing
to live with somebody

373
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,989
that abandons you
out in front of clubs.

374
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,909
I don't think so.

375
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,578
Well, I don't really know why
she did that, but there

376
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,122
has to come a time when she
has to let go a little bit.

377
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,541
I was never, like,
"I dislike Jason" or anything.

378
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,418
It's like, she was gonna move,
she moved in with him

379
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,336
in the summer,
and I never was like

380
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,421
"We're gonna stop
being friends."

381
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,590
That never happened.

382
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,174
So I'd expect the same courtesy.

383
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,552
- Whoa. This is a new statement.
- Yeah.

384
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,178
So who are you gonna
get a house from?

385
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,013
You don't worry about that.

386
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,391
All you worry about is how
you're gonna break it to Lauren.

00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,821
Thanks, Brittany.

Thank you so much.

- Oh, thank you.
- 'Sure.'

- Ginger. I love ginger.

I just had ginger juice
go up my nose.

No, it's, like, up here
in the back of my head.

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,013
Oh. Does it burn your brain?

404
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,307
Yeah, it really does.

405
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,810
It's burning my brain.

406
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,229
I didn't realize that ginger
was that potent.

407
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,024
- You okay now?
- Yeah. Yay.

408
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,985
So, did you have a good
New Year's overall?

409
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,738
Yeah. It's so fun being back
in LA, like, with everybody.

410
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,157
Do you know, someone told me

411
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,910
that Jen was gonna go
to Area on New Year's?

412
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,872
I did hear
that she was going to go.

413
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,623
She had, like,
bought a ticket and everything.

414
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,166
She's probably, like

415
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,419
"Ah, I have no more friendships
to destroy."

416
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,880
'Who does she hang out with?'

417
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm guessing
that she is spending

418
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,675
time with her friends at USC.

419
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,929
I don't know,
it's disappointing to me that...

420
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,224
Like, that friendship
had to end in the way it did.

421
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,019
Honestly, like, at this point
I would so much rather

422
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,606
have, like, a few good friends
than a lot of fake friends.

423
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,901
I know, and especially being
in LA, it's really hard to find

424
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,069
people here that are sincere.

425
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,905
- Do you know what I mean?
- Someone who is real.

426
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,698
Um, who is moving into

427
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,825
your apartment when Heidi
moves out with Spencer?

428
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,955
Did she tell you that?

429
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,249
Heidi came up to me
on New Year's, and was like

430
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,126
"Spencer asked me to move in
with him, and I'm, like

431
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,005
thinking about it."
She didn't tell you that?

432
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,298
- No.
- And I know--

433
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,717
That's just really weird
that she wouldn't say

434
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,677
something to me.

435
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,345
I don't think she would move in
with Spencer.

436
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,514
It's way too soon, like,
I know she's crazy in love

437
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,058
but she's not that crazy.

438
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,851
