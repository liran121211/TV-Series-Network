"Hi, happy birthday,"
and that's it.

No, that's fine. Um,
I think that she wanted

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,201
to say hi to you and stuff,
but if you, like

245
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,994
there's stuff going on
between you two

246
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,538
and she didn't want
to talk about it that night

247
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,039
because it's like,
"It's my birthday.

to do this tonight.
