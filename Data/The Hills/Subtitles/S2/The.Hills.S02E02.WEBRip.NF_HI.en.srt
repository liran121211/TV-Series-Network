- How was work?
- Stressful.

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,392
I left early. Had a lot on
my mind, I was really sick.

00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,312
- You okay?
- Yeah. I think that...

I don't know, for the past
couple days, you know

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,734
how I've been so like incredibly
nauseous and couldn't eat and...

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,611
So it's like
a part of me thought

12
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,571
that I might
have been pregnant.

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,535
So... It's like, we were
careful and everything

'but I don't know.'

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,205
Why do you say thought?

16
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,708
- Because I just took a test.
- Are you serious?

17
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,501
Why didn't you have me
go up there with you?

I've never been so scared

What am I gonna do?"

00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,258
I'm so sorry.
I wish you would have told me.

I literally couldn't even
talk about it.

feeling that way for days.

- So you wanted me to feel it?
- I thought I really was...

by myself for how long?

- That's your own choice.

you weren't pregnant

so you were gonna come
tell me that you thought

114

just to see how I would react?

about things.

just gonna leave like that.

Did you talk to Spencer
last night?

Um, I went through
the whole thing and I was like

151
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,648
"You know, I think I've been
feeling sick" blah-blah

152
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,361
and then I was like,
"But I'm not pregnant."

153
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,487
How am I supposed to know
how he's supposed to react?

154
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,780
If he was gonna
react wrongly then

155
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,782
I wouldn't wanna be with him.

156
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,743
I don't think there's a right
way to react to that though.

157
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,536

- Um, I have a brilliant idea.

go on a date

- He's, like, tainted.
- 'He was just asking me.'

00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,383

"Oh, you know, I think

00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,218
"I've had a crush
on Lauren for a while.

that when he calls.

go a little horseback riding.

00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,677
Hold on, here's Lauren.

342
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,720
- Hello?
- Hello?

343
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,805
Hi.

[laughing]

345
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,767
- How was the show?
- 'Yeah, I'm sorry.'

346
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,602
I didn't mean to, like,
hang up so quickly but I was

347
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,228
like, in the
middle of dressing a model

348
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,896
and it was,
like crazy back there.

349
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,191
Well, you have no shows
tomorrow night, right?

350
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,651
No, I don't have
any shows tomorrow night.

351
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,235
I'm picking you up.
We're going out.

352
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,322
- We're gonna have fun.
- Okay.

353
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,783
- So it's a date.
- Okay, great.

354
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,784
- Alright.
- 'Bye.'

355
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,161
Bye.

356
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,580
Ooh, somebody's got a date.

[knock on door]

360
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,759
- 'Come in.'
- 'Hi.'

361
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,511
- 'Hi.'
- Hello.

362
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,970
Thank you.
Hey, Whitney. How are you?

363
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,139
- Good. How are you?
- Thank you.

364
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,684
Lauren, do you wanna
come back for a sec?

365
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,647
Ashley said you did
a great job.

366
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,232
Oh, she was so cool.

367
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,150
I mean, and that is what
your strength is.

368
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,694
I think we're finding out
more and more

00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,487
is the whole production level.

370
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,781
She said you were great,
you were incredibly helpful.

371
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,616
I had fun, it was cool,
'cause I've never like

like, in preparation.

373
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,538
Well, sometimes, really,
two weeks it takes

374
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,123
before a fashion show,
and maybe that's the next thing

375
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,166
that you should do.

376
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,877
A project, is to try

377
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,336
and work with one designer

378
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,714
from the beginning
of the stages.

379
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,424
But anyway, I just wanted
to say thank you

380
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,134
'cause she did say that
it was really helpful.

381
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,429
- Okay.
- Alright. Thanks.

00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,402
- Heya.
- Hi.

384
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,153
- What are you doing?
- You're so fancy.

385
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,489
Thanks. I'm going to dinner.
Are you fancy?

386
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,032
I'm not gonna get fancy.

387
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,493
- I'm just gonna change.
- You look cute.

388
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,953
You having dinner
with Spencer?

389
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,996
Yeah. Is this, like

390
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,708
the first time you've gone out
with a guy alone since Jason?

391
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,420
- I think so. Just one-on-one?
- But you do wanna go?

392
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,422
(Lauren)
'I obviously wanna go
otherwise I wouldn't go.'

393
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,965
Well, do you think that
you're gonna have fun?

394
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,175
- I have no idea.
- I bet you will.

395
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,095
I think it's gonna be pretty
harmless, it's just dinner.

396
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,556
- Mm. Big step.
- Oh, yeah.

397
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,349
Well, that's good though.

in the face.

00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,996
I have to say,
you look amazing in that.

401
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,248
Thank you.
You look very handsome.

402

- I really tried.
- You did!

403
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,377
You got all dressed up.

404
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,171
I feel like
we're so distant here.

405
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,341
- Can I scoot over?
- Yes, you can scoot over.

406
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,927
Much better.
You have a very nice smile.

407
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,596
- I love it when you smile.
- Thank you. That's so nice.

408
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,973
I got told I have
a creepy smile.

409
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,516
- No, you don't.
- Yeah.

410
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,518
I smile, normally
when people smile

411
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,562
they smile like this,
I smile straight.

412
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,984
That's cute. It's character.
It adds character.

413
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,736
That's what you say to people
when they have a weird feature.

414
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,780
Like when someone has
a big nose, you go

415
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,281
"It gives you character."

416
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,241
What's wrong
with having a big nose?

417
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,910
Everybody... It's all about just
how your interpretation is.

418
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,662
I'm not saying there's
something wrong with it.

419
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,664
I'm just saying it's
how you interpret things--

420
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,708
Some-somebody thinks that
that big nose is cute.

421
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,168
Somebody in the world thinks
that that big nose is cute.

422
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,253
You know, just like
the straight-across lip.

423
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,172
I happen to think
it's very cute.
