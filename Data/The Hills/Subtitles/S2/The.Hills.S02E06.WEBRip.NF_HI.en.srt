for the last week and a half.

342
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,627
Lauren, don't even say
things like that.

343
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,962
It just sucks, Heidi, I was
the only one of your friends

344
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,422
who was gonna say
something to your face

345
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,840
and it sucks that I did,
and I really

346
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,634
regret it
and next time, I won't.

347
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,302
Don't walk away like that
and just say something

348
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,178
'like that,
it's not about that--'

349
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,764
I don't wanna fight
with you right now.

350
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,641
'I don't wanna fight
with you, period.'

351
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,601
You're my best friend.
I love you more than anything.

352
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,437
You don't think I, my life sucks
when it's not fine with you?

353
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,856
It's like you're one of the most
important people in my life

354
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,108
ever, in my world,
it's like, I care about you

355
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,026
and I love you
more than anything, it's like--

356
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,695
Really, Heidi,
because I<i> really</i><span style="bodyStyle"> think</i>

357
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,281
that you would have made time,
you keep saying

358
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,199
'like, oh, you don't
wanna choose but you have.'

359
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,952
I haven't chosen.
Don't make it like that.

360
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,870
'I haven't chosen.
It's not like that at all.'

361
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,580
'It's like, I would love
to spend time with you'

362
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,206
'but I don't want
it to be awkward time...'

363
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,083
I want it to be normal
Heidi Lauren time

364
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,961
and it's like, I feel
like it won't be that way

365
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,504
as long as Spencer's
in my life.

366
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,464
How? Why not?
I told you I won't...

367
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,299
- 'I don't know, it's like...'
- I won't talk about him.

368
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,050
I know, but I still feel
like there's this weird space

369
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,678
between us,
do you not feel like that?

370
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,805
Okay, Heidi,
how would you feel right now

371
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,390
if I was like, "I'm gonna
go hang out with Jason."

372
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,225
- I like him again?
- It's a whole different issue.

373
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,894
- 'No, no, it's not, it's not.'
- Oh, really?

374
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,604
You came to me,
and you said all these things

375
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,272
and you put on line,
you were like, "I hate him--"

376
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,899
Because I know what happened.

377
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,026
I'm saying that I went
to you, and I made a risk.

378
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,695
And I said,
this is all this stuff.

379
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,613
I know, it's gonna be awkward,
but I think

380
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,324
it's more worth it for me
to say these things to you.

381
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,034
'I really, like I hoped that
you wouldn't make me'

382
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,285
'regret it but you really did.'

383
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,912
The first thing you did was go

384
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,330
and tell Spencer,
"Oh, Lauren hates you

385
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,165
Lauren hates you,"
so it's awkward.

386
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,125
I didn't say, "Lauren
hates you, Lauren hates you..."

387
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,169
Why would he buy me flowers
if you didn't say anything?

388
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,129
Uh, those were my flowers,
I was just joking

389
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,464
like, here,
Spencer bought you flowers.

390
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,799
I thought it was funny.

391
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,805
I thought it was a joke,
like, look

392
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,515
he bought Audrina flowers,
he bought you flowers

393
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,850
like, I'm sorry.

394
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,396
I really, like, um, don't even
wanna talk to you right now.

395
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,732
No, Lauren, you can't just
shut yourself off like that.

396
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,275
It's like, I'm reaching out, I'm
trying to have a conversation...
