00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,380
Oh, what a day.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,926
You and Jordan, you guys have
been together how long now?

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,094
- Like, seven or eight months.
- Seven or eight months.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,555
So we're kind of
over the honeymoon stage.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,265
You guys seem like
the perfect couple

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,684
like, whenever we all hang out.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,226
I feel like a part
of him is, like

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,771
jealous or mad
that I have this job.

9
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,982
See, I have different
boy problems.

10
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,442
Like, I've never been in a
serious, long-term relationship

11
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,861
but I've, so it's different.

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,362
I don't know, we've just been

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,989
kind of bickering a lot lately.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,907
- I never have time to myself.
- Me time, yeah.

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,493
I never do. I think
that might be the problem too.

16
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,036
Like, I just don't...

17
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,329
I'm very independent

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,164
and I feel like
I haven't been lately.

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,792
Like, sometimes the way
he'll snap at me, I'll be like

20
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,586
"Jordan, like, you can't
snap at me like that."

21
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,338
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know.

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,549
It's so frustrating.

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,844
I mean, whatever's supposed
to happen is gonna happen and...

24
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,929
I feel like it's on, like,
the verge of a turning point

25
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,016
but I don't know exactly
what it's gonna be.

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,099

- Are you okay?

Don't yell,

It's okay.
Why is he yelling at you?

38
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,442
Because I won't go get him
and then

39
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,527
I was like, well,
I'm with Audrina right now

40
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,320
and then he just started
screaming and cussing at me

how I can do this anymore.

I never do that to him.
I never yell at him. I never--

00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,912
I know you don't.
You're so good to him.

That's why it's not fair, Heidi.
You deserve better.

45
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,583

I don't know what to do.

I can't have him talk to me
like this anymore.

50
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,308
You need a break from him.

Of course. Come here, Belle.

90

Jordan, I've just been
thinking a lot lately

91
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,381
about how you've been
snapping at me

92
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,341
and it's really been
affecting me.

93
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,510
So this was one more push.

94
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,303
It's like the straw
that broke the camel's back.

95
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,514
I was just like, how can he
keep talking to me like this?

96
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,892
I don't know what to do
to make him stop

97
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,518
talking to me like this.

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,229
And that was it for me.
And I just don't...

99
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,106
I don't know how to make
you stop because you think

100
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,648
you're passionate and whatever
but it hurts my feelings.

101
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,275
'Listen, I just
proved to you...'

102
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,693
- No, no, because--
- 'Yes, Jordan.'

103
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,486
'It's a combination
of the words'

104
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,155
and how you talk to me.

105
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,991
Okay, but I'm not gonna do that
'cause that's not who I am.

106
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,035
I'm not gonna
completely reconstruct

107
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,536
who I am
to become this calm person.

108
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,580
Okay, but you can't watch
how you talk to me

109
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,458
just a little bit? You can't
monitor it a little bit?

110
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,377
I told you
that whenever I'm passionate

111
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,171
'and I get freaking going
like this'

112
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,673
I'm not gonna, I'll-I'll watch
what I say mean to you.

113
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,801
I would think that the more
that you love me, the more

114
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,470
you'd wanna be, like, calm
and understanding and trying

115
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,847
to make me feel more comfortable
and not snapping at me

116
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,308
and watching how you say it
a little bit.

117
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,561
Okay, sometimes you have this
whole, like, little princess

118

to you all the time.

How you treat me is a big deal.

121
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,322
- It is.
- 'And I cater to you a lot.'

like a prince

but I feel like
I cater to you a lot.

125

I'm gonna something.

Fine, let's just both
think about it then.

129
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,761
I'm gonna go run
and do something.

130
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,722

131
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,141

132
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,978
- But I love you.
- See you tomorrow.

133
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,562

like I'm not coming back.'

out to dinner."

we argue about is so stupid.

tonight with Lauren.

what was going on.

- You're fighting over like--
- Um...

193
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,531
It started because he's been
treating me really bad lately.

00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,783
Really bad, and getting,
and I haven't said anything

problems you could have.

198
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,542
You know that Jordan loves you,
there's no question.

199
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,544
It's not a question of whether
or not he loves you.

be there, you know that.

this is your chance out.

This is your easy out, Heidi.
This is it.

207

00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,769
no you're really
gonna miss him

209
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,397

is supposed to be

339
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,837
it always makes me
kind of stressed out

340
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,673
'because I feel like I have
to get some sort of job.'

341
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,426
So what if you were, you know,
got your own little beach thing?

342
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,304
What will Heidi do? Will Heidi
stay in the apartment?

343
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,722
I don't know.

344
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,599
You haven't spoken to her
about it yet, huh?

345
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,393
No, I mean, like, she knows
that we went looking and stuff

346
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:04,106
but, like, that was before
her and Jordan broke up.

347
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,776
Like when we went to go look at
places, so it was kind of like

348
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,320
Oh, it's fine, like, I'll just
live with Jordan this summer.

349
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,991
- Right.
- But not so much anymore.

350
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,049
So what happened last night?

351
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,427
- It was so hard.
- 'It's okay.'

352
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,305
Like, that's just the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

353
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,684
For the next couple weeks,
Heidi, it's gonna be hard.

354
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,686
I know. It's just so sad.

355
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,647
It's like it's over.

356
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,733
I just have to be really careful
with my heart right now.

357
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,319
Yeah, you're gonna deal with
your feelings, and, you know.

358
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,321
I don't know, it's gonna
be so different now.

359
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,824
I've never seen you
without a boy.

360
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,243
I know.

361
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,662
See the crazy Heidi in you.

362
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,664
I just have to stop
thinking about it.

363
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,416
At least I got
my little buddy back.

364
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,126
Now I have someone to hang out
with all the time.

365
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,421
- I can't even imagine.
- We should start tonight.

366
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,465
- I am starting tonight.
- Okay, good.

367
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,760
Tonight is the first night
of my new life.

368
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,762
- I haven't been out in so long!
- I'm going out every night now.

369
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,097
