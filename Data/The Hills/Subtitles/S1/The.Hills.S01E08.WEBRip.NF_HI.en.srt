Hi. Come in.

342
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,100
- Are you Lauren?
- No, this is Lauren.

343
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,978
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

347
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,283
Love, Jason."

348
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,201
Pack a bag for school?
What does that mean?

349
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,662
It means I won't
be coming back here.

[music continues]

351
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,434
Happy birthday, baby.

352
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,480
- Got you a little rose.
- Thank you.

353
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,155
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh!

354
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,159
It's so pretty.

355
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,582
I'm so hungry.

356
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,460
- I ordered it for us.
- Oh, did you?

357
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,671
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

358

'I don't know what you want.
I just knew'

359
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,214
you like calamari
and stuff, so..

360
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,843
- Thank you.
- Of course.

362
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,180
What do you want to do
the rest of the night?

363
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,475
Whatever you want.

364
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,311
Would you want to go out tonight
or you just want to hang here?

365
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,062
Want to hang out here.

366
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,439
Brian's doing that thing
at Nacional.

367
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,358
- Who is?
- Brian.

368
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,443
Hmm.

369
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,987
If you want to go
to Nacional, that's fine.

370
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,865
I just thought you'd want to
spend my birthday with me.

371
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,115
I do.

372
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,116
Do you want to go meet up

373
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,535
with Heidi and Jordan later?

374
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,707
It's up to you.
I-I don't care. Do whatever.

375
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,166
You okay?
What's bothering you?

376
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,752
I'm just looking around.

377
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,295
It's kind of different.

378
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,631
I never thought I'd do
something like this.

379
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,758
- Just kidding.
- No, it's sweet.

380
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,094
I never had anyone do anything
like this for me.

381
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,931
So you just want to chill
here and we can hang out?

383
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,394
Do you really want to go out?

384
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,812
I'd rather just spend
the night with you.

385
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,397
No, I just wanna
hang out with you.

386
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,358
I don't care.
What do you wanna do?

387
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,652
- Just hang out here.
- What's up?

388
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,362
I-I...Jason, look at me.

389
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,281
I've told you I would rather
stay here and--

390
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,742
I, okay, then we can stay here.

391
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,744
I don't understand
what you want to do, though.

392
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,579
You wanna watch a movie?
You wanna do something else?

393
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,955
- I mean..
- I-I'll do whatever.

394
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,207
I don't care.

395
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,459
You can't just be with me?

396
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,546
- I can.
- That's all I want.

397
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,757
