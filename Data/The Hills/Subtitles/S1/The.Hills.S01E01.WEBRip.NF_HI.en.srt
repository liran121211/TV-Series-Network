the floor and stuff?

173
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,887
Actually working
the floor and stuff.

174
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,513
Yeah, I don't think
I could do that.

175
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,725
You couldn't do that.
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

176
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,019
Are there any other majors
you were thinking about

177
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,355
or other industries
other than fashion?

178
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,982
- No.
- You feel..

179
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,067
Are you sure
you're in the right college?

180
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,402
Yeah.

181
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,490
[instrumental music]

182
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,118
(Lauren)
Can you get that?

183
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,536
[cell phone ringing]

184
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,666
- Hello?
- 'Hi, Lauren.'

185
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,251
'It's Chantal from Teen Vogue.'

186
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,877
'I have Blaine
on the phone for you.'

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,338
- Oh, okay.
- 'Can you hold, please?'

188
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,546
Yeah.

189
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,427
- Teen Vogue.
- Teen Vogue?

190
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,846
It's a long hold.

191
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,806
- Hello?
- Hi, Lauren, it's Blaine.

192
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,850
'I'm one of the editors
here at Teen Vogue.'

193
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,352
I wanted to give you
a little feedback.

194
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,853
Okay.

195
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,271
'First of all,
it's really tough'

196
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,563
'for us to make this decision.'

197
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,274
There are not a lot of interns

198
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,485
that we find that are ready
at the age of 19.

199
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,195
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just, uh..

200
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,156
You need to have
a lot of experience in writing

201
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,950
'and fashion and publicity
and all this stuff'

202
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,869
if you want to be an intern
at Teen Vogue.

203
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:02,125
So, um, that said, Lisa really
liked you and saw a lot of

204
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,710
potential and we'd like to offer
you an internship.

205
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,463
[gasps]
Oh! You had me nervous.

206
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,798
- You had me nervous.
- Oh.

207
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,550
And we think
it might be a good match

208
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,428
and we have high hopes for you.

209
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,514
'So, yeah, again,
if you want to think about it'

210
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,057
and get back to us, that's okay.

211
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,017
Oh, no,
I'd like to formally accept.

212
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,144
Great. Well, then
that works out really well.

213
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,772
- 'We'll see you tomorrow.'
- Thank you very much, Blaine.

214
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,901
Whoo!
What a frickin' relief.

215
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,073
[instrumental music]

216
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,088
[telephone rings]

217
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,722
- 'Hi.'
- Hello.

218
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,933
- I'm here for my first day.
- What's your name?

219
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,102
- Whitney. Yeah.
- Whitney?

220
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,896
Hi, Lisa, Whitney's here in
reception waiting for you.

221
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,856
Okay, great. Thanks.
She'll be right out.

222
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,900
- You can just wait over here.
- Thank you.

223
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,612
[sighs]

224
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,908
Okay, girls, are you ready?

225
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,535
- Yeah.
- I'll take you back now.

226
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,500
Alright, Whitney,
you can have a seat right here.

227
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,878
Lauren, you can sit right here.

228
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,590
And someone
will be with you in a minute.

229
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,341
- Thank you.
- Bye.

230
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,552
This is awesome.

231
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,431
I don't want to touch anything

232
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,141
'cause I don't know
what I'm allowed to touch yet.

233
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,312
You're fired already.

234
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,397
You're fired.

235
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,441
Hi. This is Olivia.

236
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,942
Olivia, this is Whitney.

237
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,735
- I'm Whitney.
- Nice to meet you.

238
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,237
- This is Lauren.
- Hi. Good to meet you.

239
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,281
Olivia is one of our
fashion editors.

240
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,158
I want to have her, you know,
check out your ensembles

241
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,076
because we always want to look
our best for Lisa.

242
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,911
I just feel like
you need something to cover

243
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,538
your shoulders
a little bit maybe.

244
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,085
So obviously the Teen Vogue
style is all about the mix

245
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,796
which is why like a little
jacket on top of this

246
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,756
would really be ideal.

247
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,844
I feel like maybe that's a
little too matchy-matchy.

248
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,762
We've kind of
done the western look.

249
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,598
Why don't you
give that a whirl?

250
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,060
That's most probably gonna be
a little bit big on you.

251
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,355
- That looks great.
- Good. You happy?

252
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,730
Just more Teen Vogue.

253
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,567
- Hello.
- Hi, Blaine.

254
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,027
- 'How you doing?'
- Hi, how are you?

255
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,487
- 'You remember these ones.'
- Good.

256
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,738
- How are you?
- Hi, how are you?

257
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,906
- Whitney.
- You look great.

258
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,200
- Thank you.
- Hi.

259
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,784
Hi, Lauren.

260
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,953
In terms of working
for Teen Vogue now

261
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,122
you're representing Teen Vogue

262
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,168
so it means that whatever you do
in the outside world

263
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,129
also reflects on us,
and we take it really seriously.

264
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,007
So if you're out
and you're employed by us

265
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,176
you work for us,
you represent us

266
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,554
you look great,
you don't behave badly

267
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,973
you don't do anything
that we would be embarrassed by.

268
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,142
Because if it comes back to me..

269
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,563
...then you're in trouble.

270
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,272
(Whitney)
'It's just, like,
the workday's over'

271
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,567
and we're probably
gonna get a job right now.

272
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,277
- Hello.
- Hi.

273
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,488
I am Nicole,
one of the features editors

274
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,156
at the magazine in New York.

275
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,701
We just came out today
with our Hollywood issue

276
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,245
which is basically, for me,
the biggest issue of the year.

277
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,330
When it comes out,
we have a party for it

278
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,957
'and we need to get
the invitations out.'

279
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,001
A lot of invitations.

280
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:36,089
Um, there's, you know,
almost 500 of them.

281
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,633
Everything has to be done
pretty, glamorous

282
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,635
Chic, Vogue beautiful

283
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,263
and that is, like,
down to the stamps, okay?

284
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,223
Alright, let me know
if you need anything.

285
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,307
- Okay.
- 'Nice meeting you.'

286
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,440
Oh, Josh Duhamel is on here.

287
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,692
Oh, my God, he is my love.

288
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,068
Oh, and Gavin Degraw.

289
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,028
Oh!

'Did you ever see that
"Seinfeld" episode'

291
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,033
where that bald guy's fiancee,
like, licked all the envelopes

292
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,493
and she died from,
like, glue poisoning?

293
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,578
[laughing]
No.

294
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,540
And there was only
300 of those.

295
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,833
We so better get to go to this.

with an internship'

298
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,968
it's like kind of
fun work, you know?

299
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,513
I had to do a bunch of RSVPS
for the "Young Hollywood" party.

300
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,348
Are you gonna be able
to get us in that party?

301
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,309
- No.
- Are you gonna ask?

302
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,893
I'm not gonna, like,
mess up my internship

303
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,145
and like, do something shady

304
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,106
just, like, to go to a party.

305
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,692
Yeah.

306
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,742
I was like, the other night,
I had my sorority invite.

307
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,577
- 'Shh!'
- Hi, Lauren.

308
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,537
- Hi, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

309
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,372
- How are you guys doing?
- Good.

work tomorrow night..

00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,754
Whitney, you'll be
at the door with Blaine.

313
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,966
Lauren, you're gonna be
in the party

314
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,177
and you're the section of seats
that we're reserving

315
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,095
for celebrities.

316
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,097
But what I really want you to do

317
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,391
is to understand
that you're working.

318
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,435
'You're not partying.
You're not playing.'

319
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,395
You're not sitting down.

320
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,774
If I see you sitting,
hanging out, you'll be gone.

321
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,193
- Okay?
- 'Cool.'

322
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,659
- So we're going.
- It's exciting.

[upbeat music]

324
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,638
Your job is simply
to stand here, okay

325
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,889
and guard this area.

326
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,766
Okay. So no one can sit here?

327

No one can sit here.

328
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,728
Can they sit here
until they come?

329
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,771
- No. I want you to guard it.
- Okay.

330
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,022
- Thank you.
- You got it, Blaine.

331
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,566
- Okay.
- You have fun.

It's Lauren.

- I know.
- Whitney.

Are you gonna call Lauren?

336
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,580
Yeah, I'm gonna call Lauren.

337
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,914
Okay.

- I hope we get in.
- I hope we get in.

Hey, Heidi.
How are you, darling?

00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,259
Well, I'm standing outside
with Jordan, Audrina, and Brian.

341
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,177
Can you get us in?

342

- Seriously?
- Yeah, we're here.

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,140
What are you doing here, Heidi?

344
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,185
Well, we're trying to get in.
We're gonna sneak in.

345
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,105
Okay, but you're not
on the list.

346
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,858
No, but just, just sneak us in.

347
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,693
Yeah, I don't want
to get in trouble

348
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,695
for letting you guys in,
but Whitney's working the door

349
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,447
'so I'll see
if she can let you guys in.'

350
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,741
Just do whatever you can,
please.

351
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,158
Go up to the front
and ask for Whitney.

352
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,368
She's wearing a white dress.

353
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,912
Alright, we'll go find her.

Whitney, Whitney, come in.
It's Lauren.

00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,170
- Yeah?
- 'I have a couple of friends.'

357
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,090
How much of a big deal
would it be to get them in?

358
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,634
If they come right now, like

359
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,594
right this second,
maybe I can do it.

360
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,262
Well, they're gonna
ask for you right now.

361
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,680
They're coming up
to the front door.

- Okay.
- 'Whitney, hi.'

363

I'm Heidi.
I'm Lauren's friend.

364
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,851
You guys
are Lauren's friends?

365
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,018
Okay.

366
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,437
Thank you so much.

Lauren! Hey!

369
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,624
You look gorgeous.

370
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,250
Guys, do not get me in trouble.

371
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,961
Are you stressed out?
You look stressed.

372
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,796
- I have a very stressful job.
- What are you doing?

373
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,089
I have to guard
this VIP area.

374
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,884
- This right here is VIP?
- This is our table, man.

375
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,512
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Jordan.

376

Don't sit on
the "Reserved" sign.

377
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,890
You can sit on my lap.

378
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,976
- Brian, you can't sit here.
- Where?

379
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,853
Brian, stop it.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

380
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,228
'Brian, up!'

381
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,063
[laughs]

382
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,994
- Where did Heidi go?
- To hook up with Jean-Paul.

383
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,578
I don't have a girlfriend

384
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,956
so now I'm, like,
shopping for one.

385
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,459
- Drama. Always drama.
- Hey, hey.

386
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,545
- No, no, stay here, stay here.
- No, no.

387
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,423
This is the second time
he's done it

388
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,384
'cause you know
what he's saying to you.

389
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,053
He's trying to, he wants to
get in your pants, bottom line.

390
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,180
I didn't do anything!
I walked over there.

391
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,599
I went to the bathroom.
Calm down.

392
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,560
Next time,
I'm beating his ass.

393
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,564
Can I talk to you for a second?

394
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,065
Yeah.

395
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,067
What was all the drama
at the door?

396
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,819
There was a drama at the door?

397
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,070
Yeah, there were people,
like, sad

398
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,989
and crying and fights and tears.

399
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,657
Oh, it was just them fighting

400
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,450
but you can see it's all better.

401
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,578
They were fighting over
something, but now they're fine.

402
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,120
They're just
boyfriend/girlfriend.

403
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,789
They fight a lot.
Everything's okay.

404
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,332
- Is everything okay with you?
- Yeah, we're good.

405

- I'll be here. Thank you.
- Okay good.

You guys, hey!

407
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,928
You can't fight
in public anymore.

408
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,637
We're not fighting.

409
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,139
- 'You look teary-eyed..'
- 'No, I'm fine.'

410
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,683
It's so frustrating
when they show up

411
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,643
especially when
you ask them not to.

412
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,271
- And who are these people?
- These are..

413
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,774
This is Brian
and Audrina and David.

414
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,944
Nobody should be
sitting here yet, okay?

415
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,113
- We'll talk about it on Monday.
- Okay.

416
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,574
Okay, get up, get up, get up.
I'm gonna get in trouble.

Lauren, is that
who you work for?

418
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,829
- Yeah.
- Why'd she get all mad?

419
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,915
- I don't know.
- Did she just yell at you?

420
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,583
Did something just happen?

421
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,543
She was like,
"No one should be sitting here."

422
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,921
She was like, "I'll talk to you
about it on Monday." I'm like..
