00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,427
Not too shabby, huh?

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,137
'Wouldn't this be
a killer summer rental?'

(Lauren)
'So nice. This is so crazy.'

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,226
And I was thinking, uh

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,312
it's been crazy and stuff
and just, we've both been

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,272
through a lot this year,
up and down.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,443
It's just like, the last few
months have been really good.

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,738
And, uh, I just think it would
be nice to do our own thing

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,034
for a little while instead
of being around people 24/7.

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,537
I want to get this place
with you.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,080
- Just you and me?
- Just you and me.

12

<i>- Hi, Whitney.</i>
<i>- 'Hello.'</i>

13
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,562
- Hi, Lauren, how are you?
- Good.

14
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,481
Um, so, this week,
it's LA Fashion Week

15
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,067
and we're gonna have
a pretty rough schedule.

16
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,029
Nicole is coming out
from "Teen Vogue" in New York

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,655
and she's gonna be working
with you, Whitney.

18
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,990
Okay.

19
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,575
And you're gonna go
help her set up

20
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,619
the Charlotte Ronson after-party
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

21
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,662
OK.

22
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,330
Lauren, Amy Astley,
editor-in-chief

23
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,041
of "Teen Vogue"
is coming to town.

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,044
I wanna make everything go
as smoothly as possible.

25
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,629
'She's gonna come to the shows
for the first time in LA.'

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,506
You're gonna be in charge
of getting us tickets

27
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,258
to the Jennifer Nicholson show.

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,343
That's gonna be huge.
That's exciting.

29
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,972
I just want everything to go
smoothly while Amy's in town.

30
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,268
- You think you can manage that?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,149
Hey, Heidi. So these are the
fashion shows I wanna go to.

32
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,860
If you wanna go
to the Jennifer Nicholson show

33
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,236
I can probably get you
on the list.

34
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,571
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,073
'That is so nice.'

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,075
So RSVP me plus three

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,743
so I'll have four tickets total.

38
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,953
- Thank you so much, Brent.
- You're welcome.

39
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,037
'Okay.'

What's going on?

43
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,464
Tonight, I get to go
to the Jennifer Nicholson show.

44
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,215
- No way.
- Ahh!

45
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,342
Oh, my God, that's so awesome.

46
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,762
Life in Hollywood is so good.

48
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,621
So we'll take, uh, your car
and Lauren will take my car

49
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,373
and she'll go get the tickets
ahead of time for us.

50

'Hi, Lauren, this is Amy Astley'

51
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,168
the editor-in-chief
of "Teen Vogue."

52
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,295
Hi, how are you?

53
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,006
Uh, we're a bit late for dinner

54
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,215
'but we have two more people
from "Vogue" coming'

55
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,592
and I need two more tickets
for them.

56
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,218
Can they, will they
just give them to me?

57
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,261
Yes, just ask them.

58
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,304
Is it the same contact Kelly--

59
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,806
Kelly, Kelly Cutrone.

60
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,058
Tell them it's two,
um, "Vogue" editors.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,101
- Okay.
- Okay?

62

'Oh, my God, Lisa just told me'

65
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,411
I have to get two more tickets
to the show.

66
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,623
- What?
- Like, it's a sold-out show.

67
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,334
Like, there are no more tickets.
There's no more seats.

68
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,670
That's kind of, like,
a really big request.

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,464
I, seriously, I'm gonna, like,
go buy two chairs real quick

70
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,717
and just throw them in there
and see if anyone notices.

71
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,760
- Good luck.
- 'Thanks, bye.'

72
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,976
Can I help you with something?

73

Oh, I'm waiting for someone
to come out.

74
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,479
- Who, who are you waiting for?
- For Kelly Cutrone.

75
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,232
- Oh, I'm Kelly Cutrone.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,151
Um, I was wondering,
I called you about

77
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,236
the two extra tickets
for Lisa Love.

78
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,946
I mean, I love Lisa
and she's great

79
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,573
but this is, like,
a little eleventh hour.

80
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,241
Who is it for? Who are her--

81
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,326
She said she had two
other "Vogue" editors and--

82
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,912
What other "Vogue,"
I know every "Vogue" editor.

83
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,538
Who else is coming?

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,915
She didn't,
she didn't tell me a name.

85
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,166
Okay, why don't you wait
over there

86
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,168
and I'll be with you
when I can?

87

00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,848
- Brent got me tickets.
- Shut up!

go to a fashion show tonight?

And I was like, yeah,
and he's like, and after-party?

I was like, yeah.

94
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,773
Are you okay?

95
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,315
No, I'm supposed to get
two extra tickets

96
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,193
and I can't get them
and I'm gonna get yelled at.

97
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,611
How are you
supposed to get them?

98
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,613
I don't know.
She won't give them to me.

99
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,156
She's like,
no, I can't give them to you

100
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,449
unless you give me a name.

101
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,491
Did you try calling Lisa?

102
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,701
I've been calling her.

103
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,203
She's not picking up.

104
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,166
This is not fun.

105
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,834
- Come with me.
- Okay, we'll figure this out.

106
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,003
I seriously feel like
I'm gonna throw up right now.

107
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,213
- Okay.
- Like, I'm freaking out.

108
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,303
Hi, Lisa.
I've been calling you.

109
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,596
They will not give me
the tickets

110
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,514
unless I give them names
and no one knows.

111
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,225
I called Julianna.
I called Blaine.

112
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,977
No one knew what names
to give her.

113
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,520
Okay, wait, it's, uh

00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,232
Hamish Bowles and...

115
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,819
- Okay, thanks. Bye.
- So now what's the story?

116
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,655
Oh, she said she's coming
with, I have the names.

117
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,200
Uh, it was Hamish Bowles

118

and there was,
there was one other.

119
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,204
Howels or Bowles.

120
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,206
No, Hamish Bowles is one person.

121
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,958
Okay, there was a second one.

to go in the summer.

173
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,100
- For this summer?
- 'It's this summer.'

174
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,518
It's a great, great opportunity.

175
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,064
You work, uh, during
Couture Week in Paris.

176
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:05,526
Um, Paris is probably
the single most important place

177
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,822
to ever be
in the fashion business.

178
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,824
'And New York thinks
that you can do it.'

179
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,575
You don't have much time
to think about it.

180
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,702
You really have
to let me know right away.

181
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,371
I think, honestly,
if you go to Paris

182
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,498
you won't wanna come back.

183
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,260
- Hi.
- Hey.

184
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,262
- What happened?
- 'I'm not in trouble.'

185
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,806
Okay, good.

186
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,892
She offered me an internship
in Paris.

187
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,521
Shut up. You're lying.

188
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,648
- 'For the summer?'
- Yeah.

189
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,775
I get to do, like,
Fashion Week in Paris.

190
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,818
You are lying.

191
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,820
'Like, couture shows'

192
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,324
and like, some huge ball
that I can't pronounce.

193
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,494
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

194
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,497
- You gotta do it, right.
- I don't know.

195
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,874
'Cause I, like, planned
my summer with Jason.

196
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,292
I know, but this is Paris.

197
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,878
I know, but I'd be gone,
like, all summer.

198
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,380
Damn!

199
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,465
'It's like my dream
to make it to Paris.'

200
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,925
If you don't do it, I'll do it.

201
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,971
Seriously, that's, like, insane.

202
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,597
It's just, like, it's like
something, like

203
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,352
not, like, no joke would,
like, change your life.

204
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm sure your, like, heart's
telling you to stay, but...

205
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,025
'Timing, right?
If it was only, like...'

206
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,861
...another summer.

207
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,242
Alright, my car's this way.

208
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,244
- Goodbye.
- I'm gonna miss you.

209
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,578
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

210
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,372
And you'll tell me what
you're gonna do.

211
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,999
- Okay, good luck packing.
- Bye.

212
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,315
- 'Hi!'
- Hi.

213
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,567
What are you doing?

214
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,320
"Paris Vogue."

215
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:16,491
- What's going on?
- Um...

216
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,826
I got called into Lisa Love's
office today.

217
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,870
- Did you get in trouble?
- No, I didn't get in trouble.

218
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,248
- I thought I was in trouble.
- I didn't do anything.

219
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,375
'She offered me
a summer internship.'

220
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,962
- To where?
- They gave me one for Paris.

221
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,841
Oh! Oh, my God, that's huge.

222
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,885
'Are you excited?
Are you gonna go?'

223
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,556
- I don't know.
- That's like a huge deal.

224
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,391
I know, but it's like,
I already kind of

225
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,934
had my summer planned out

226
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,811
and it was like
I wasn't expecting it at all.

227
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,104
Oh, yeah?
What about Jason?

228
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,648
I thought you were
gonna move in with him.

229
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,733
You don't think it would, like

230
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,611
jeopardize things
with Jason, do you?

231
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,862
It just sucks 'cause it's like
this whole year, like

232
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,490
it's been up and down,
up and down.

233
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,200
And finally, we're, like,
at a really good place.

234
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,495
And it's like to leave now

235
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,080
after all we've been through,
I feel like that's just...

236
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,666
Like, how's that gonna work,
you know?

237
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,146
♪ Say tell me my sweetheart ♪

238
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:32,275
♪ When did you find me
sweet again? ♪

239
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,443
Yo.

240
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,280
- Hi.
- How was work?

241
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,616
It was good.

242
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,326
[sighs]

243
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,162
- How was your day?
- Look at you relaxing.

244
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,706
I know, I've been relaxing
and waiting for you.

245
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,750
- I'm here.
- I know.

246
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,378
You need to help me figure out

247
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,921
what other stuff we need
to bring here.

248
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,674
I was thinking
about patio furniture.

249
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,219
'And then, like, I was thinking
about getting a barbecue.'

250
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,681
And some other stuff.

251
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,310
- What?
- Yeah.

252
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,270
No, no, no, it sounds good.

253
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,357
- You don't sound too excited.
- No, I am excited.

254
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,067
What's wrong?

255
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,362
Today, Lisa Love offered me
an internship

256
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,946
'for the whole summer.'

257
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,409
- Where?
- Paris.

258
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,785
[chuckles]

259
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,545
Are you going?

260
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,049
I don't know.

261
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,467
Like, Paris isn't something
you just

262
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,219
immediately say no to,
you know?

263
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,432
Like, Paris, they only offer it
to one of the interns.

264
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,892
I mean, I wanna support you
whatever you do, I mean.

265
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,768
Obviously, you'll make
the right decision.

266
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,440
I mean, if you go,
I'll be happy for you.

267
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,442
'Whatever you do,
I'll be there for you, so...'

268
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,406
You've always been there for me.

269
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,745
Come here.

270
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,500
- What?
- I want you to sit with me.

271
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,974
What are you gonna do?

272
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,695
I don't know.

273
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,137
- Okay, look at this one.
- He is so off my list.

274
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,931
- I need a new guy.
- So do I.

275
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,475
But see, this is how
I used to be.

276
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,186
I used to like a guy
for, like, a day

277
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,853
and then I'd be sick of him.

278
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,606
And then God knows
what happened with Jordan.

279
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,107
I don't know
how I started liking him.

280
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,150
That was a mistake.

281
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,110
Yeah, we had that conversation.

282
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,696
Yeah, I don't know
what happened there.

283
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,405
And now I'm, like,
getting back to my old self.

284
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,367
I'm like new guy, new guy.
This is how I think.

285
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,619
In preschool is how you're
gonna be the rest of your life.

286
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,912
'Cause in preschool, I was
like I love you, I love you

287
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,498
I love you, and I use to have

288
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,874
a new boyfriend every
five minutes in preschool.

289
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,209
Are you serious?

290
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,169
Yeah, and I used to make
guys fight over me.

291
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,462
So I'm gonna start
doing that again.

292
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,715
- It worked then.
- You're so over Jordan.

293
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,883
I know.
I really am so over him.

294
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,469
Now that I'm single, I wanna
go out every single night.

295
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,221
We are going out
every night this summer.

296
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,014
I want to and I wanna
meet so many guys.

297
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,559
We're gonna have
the best summer.

298
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,227
I'm gonna miss Lauren.

299
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,604
I think she knows
what she wants.

300
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,991
- You need help?
- 'I'm almost done.'

301
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,830
- You're bringing that?
- Yeah. Get in there.

302
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,582
Why are you being so weird?

303
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,001
You're acting like I'm,
like, going away forever.

304
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,295
Bella, Bella, you're not
supposed to be in here.

305
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,425
- You're stinky.
- Say goodbye to Bella.

306
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,721
Bye, Bella. I won't miss you,
you stinky dog.

307
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,640
Oh, alright.

308
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601
You should probably get going.

309
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,529
Say goodbye to the apartment.

310
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,489
It's okay, I'm not
gonna miss the apartment.

311
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,243
- I'm gonna miss my Heidi.
- Just miss me.

312
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,205
- Goodbye, you. I love you.
- Goodbye, I love you.

313
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,498
- 'I'll call you.'
- You're my best friend.

314
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,083
You're my best friend.

315
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,585
Don't find a new best friend.

316
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:04,923
Don't get another roommate.
I'm, I'm coming back.

317
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,383
- Soon.
- I'll be back.

318
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,760
Goodbye.

319
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,929
Let me know when you get there.

320
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,847
