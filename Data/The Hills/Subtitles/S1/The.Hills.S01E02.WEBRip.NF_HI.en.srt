May be a little short.

But you and me,
we have different short.

Come on, "Teen Vogue" girl.
Help me out here.

00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,516
Speaking of "Teen Vogue",
I got yelled at.

00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,184
No way.

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,853
Well, no,
I didn't get yelled at.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,855
- I got, like scolded.
- What?

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,940
Because a couple of my
friends showed up

10
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,441
'for that "Teen Vogue" party.'

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,151
- Lame. Who did that?
- 'I know.'

12

And they made a scene,
and I got in trouble.

right?

You can't just crash any more

Okay, we'll make that a rule.

the party?

We didn't even get
to talk about it.

22
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,734
I don't know if, like
no one ever said anything

23
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,193
to me about letting them in
but hopefully

24
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,653

25
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,530
I mean,
I didn't want them to come.

and then gotten in a fight

No, that wasn't really

Lisa came over, remember?

And you haven't
talked to her since?

have to finish something.'

356
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,207
If you ask Heidi,
what's your biggest flaw?

357
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,627
She's like, "yeah, like,
I don't really go to school."

358
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,879
[laughing]

359
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,672
"I don't really finish stuff."

360
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,173
[laughing]

361
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,801
So she didn't
go to school today.

362
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,386
So that she could
go to an interview

363
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,721
and she's saying
if she gets the job

364
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,347
she's not gonna go back.

365
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,099
I don't know,
hopefully it'll be

366
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,350
a positive thing for her.

367
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,852
Yeah, I mean, we'll see.

368
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,605
We'll see if she
even gets it, though.

369
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,147
Hopefully.

370
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,816
Yeah.

371
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,653
[instrumental music]

372
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,087
Brent's just wrapping
up a call

373
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,298
so if you want
to have a seat out here

374
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,966
I'm gonna take that
in to him.

375
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,385
- Oh, perfect.
- Do you want water or anything?

376
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,262
- Uh, no, I'm great. Thank you.
- Okay.

377
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,932
- He'll be back in, in a sec.
- Perfect. Thank you.

378
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,393
Ready? I have her resume.

379
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,478
- Yeah.
- You ready?

380
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,938
Sure.

381
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,693
Let me just finish sending this.

382
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,405
- I love your office.
- Hi.

383
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,198
- I'm so nervous.
- Don't worry.

384
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,660
I know. Take a deep breath.

385
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,579
So, tell me why you think
you should work here.

386
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,915
I think that,
um, because I'm extremely

387
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,417
hardworking and I'll go
the extra mile

388
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,795
and I won't quit
until everything's exactly

389
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,255
the way you want it
and I don't give up easily.

390
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,257
I need a second assistant

391
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,759
so that means you'd kind of like

392
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,385
just help keep
our life organized.

393
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,220
Well, we're kind of like
the hub of the company.

394
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,265
I hate drama,
so as little drama as possible.

395
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,897
Yeah.

396
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,816
That's good to hear. Huh.

397
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,778
[cellphone vibrating]

398
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,950
- Hello?
- Guess what, guess what!

399
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,910
- Guess what?
- What?

400
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,872
- I got the job!
- No, you didn't.

401
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,708
Yeah, I seriously got it.

402
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,544
The number one,
like event planning PR firm

403
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,128
and I'm working for them.

404
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,715
I'm like, I have a job,
it's not like..

405
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,467
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.
I get, I get a salary!

406
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,470
That is awesome.
Congratulations, Heidi.

407
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,138
I know, and they're..
Oh, my god.

408
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,098
And that office is gorgeous.

409
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,059
Like, inside it has,
like brick walls

410
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,020
and like these
awesome paintings

411
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,355
and I get, like, a lunch break
and stuff.

412
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,440
A real lunch break?

413
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,568
[chuckles]

414
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,738
Okay, I'm only like 19,
and I have my dream job.

415
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,366
Well, good for you.
What could go wrong?

416
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,245
I'm so excited.
And I think I start like Monday.
