- What's up with Justin?

8
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,365
- Why're you not talking to him?
- We're not together.

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,034
He's planning on hooking up
with other girls, so whatever.

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,038
- So where's Cory?
- He's out on a tour.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,583
I think we're all leaving
a lot back in LA

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,294
and we should just kind
of put it aside and enjoy.

Audrina doesn't have
a boyfriend.

Guess, she does, she's dating
a boy who's a friend.

00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,172
No. She has a boyfriend.
His name is Cory.

Well, I don't know...
Yeah, I guess he is.

Why? Where is everybody?

75
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,340
Brody's birthday.

76
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,258
'He flew everyone out to Cabo.'

77
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,761
They're all in Cabo
and I'm here.

78
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,638
So why didn't you go?

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,266
Like, you know, Brody and I
don't get along and...

80
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,895
Well, what about, uh,
you and Lauren?

81
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,024
I don't know, we left it off,
like, kind of weird.

82
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,109
I mean, it's like probably
the worst

83
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,028
it's been in a really long time.

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,198
Well, why don't you and Cameron

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,657
come to dinner
with Spencer and I?

86
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,367
We can all do like
a double date.

87
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,244
Um...

88
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,371
- Are you scared?
- Really scared.

89
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,082
What is the worst-case scenario

90
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,000
that could happen at dinner,
you know?

91
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,960
Spencer will say something
mean to me

92
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,421
and Cameron will like stiffen up

93
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,423
and be like,
I'm not liking this.

94
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,218
Spencer's not dating him.
You're dating him.

95
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,886
'Even if your family didn't
like him'

96
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,304
that couldn't change
everything, you know?

97
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,224
Spencer and my mom don't
get along too well.

98
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,059
But that doesn't change
my opinion.

99
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,686
My mom's not dating him,
you know?

100
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,564
- Yeah.

I'm worried for you guys 'cause
you are with like ten dudes.

109
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,930
Well, apparently, we're dudes
on this trip as well, so...

110
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,353
- Does it look real?
- What was that from?

111
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,689

112
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:24,116

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,332

00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,758
Ditto.

119
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,426

wanna be exclusive.

121
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,974
So what am I to think?

122
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,934

Okay.

126
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,545
I just wanna say not only
are you my best friend

127
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,006
but you're the best friend
a person can have.

128
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,551

When do you open presents?

131
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,475
Well, since we're having
a little, you know, fiesta

132
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,270
'I thought we'd bring
a little party here.'

133
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,065

Don't lie.

00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,328
Maybe you need to tell him
the truth. Tell him, Audrina.

00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:31,970
Right?

172
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,891
- Contemplating here.
- Yes.

173
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,394
Those are some hot twins.

174
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,438
Damn.

175
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,607
Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't start it.

176
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,860
Let's go make friends
with those girls.

177
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,113
It will be so much fun.
Come on.

178
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,824

Unacceptable.

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,337
She probably is in
a tanning salon.

196
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,006
Actually, I think
she's misting now.

197
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,674
Should we just order
without them?

198
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,218
Absolutely.

199
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,345
You've never met Cameron, right?

200
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,056
No. I have not.
I'm so excited to see, uh...

201
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,558
I wonder what he looks like.

202
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,935
...this lucky gentleman
who has the honor

203
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,271
of dating my fabulous sister.

204
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,399
We don't get along
that great. You'll see.

205
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,526
Well, if he's a jerk,
I'm not gonna be really nice.

206
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,985
You'd have to be.

207
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,529
- No, I don't.
- Always be nice.

208
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,822
- Always be nice. Right here.
- Oh.

209
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,159
I can't believe they're now
legitimately a half hour late.

210
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,912
(Heidi)
'I think they're later
than a half an hour.'

211
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,417
Nice watch. Is that
what you're showing me?

212
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,834
(Spencer)
'No, I'm showing you
what time it is.'

213
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,628
Hi. Nice to meet you.

214
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,172
(Spencer)
'Did, uh, you forget
we were decided'

215
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,508
'to meet up at 9 o'clock,
not 9:40?'

216
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,218
I'll take the blame.
It was my fault.

217
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,803
- Yeah.
- What a gentleman.

218
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,513
(Spencer)
'Once I get some, uh, food'

219
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,974
'in my system,
I'll get a little friendlier.'

220
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,934
Oh, we got this.
This is our food.

221
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,103
Just a glass for this, please.

222
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,729
(female #1)
'Do you all want some pepper?'

223
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,523
We're good, thank you.

224
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,317
I think I'd like
to propose a toast.

225
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,859
(Heidi)
'Hm. That's so nice.'

226
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,361
To the honor of going to dinner

227
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,280
with my sister
and her first boyfriend.

228
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,866
- Cheers.
- Spencer, you are so mean.

229
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,161
I've never gone out to dinner
with you and a boyfriend.

230
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,955
This is your first
real boyfriend.

231
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,124
- 'So how are you guys?'
- Good.

232
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,751
- 'And Holly?'
- I just kicked that Holly out.

233
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,463
- Felt real good.
- Don't say that.

234
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,215
She's, like, the biggest moocher
on the planet.

235
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,967
Was it mutual,
getting Holly out?

236
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,594
It's not mutual, Spencer said

237
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,387
I'm either leaving,
or Holly's leaving.

238
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,182
And so now she's, like, crashing
on someone else's couch.

239
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,853
Um, your sister's really funny.

240
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,481
She makes me laugh a lot.

241
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,566
She makes me laugh a lot too.

242
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,485
I have an important question,
Cameron.

243
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,153
'So have you met
Brody and them?'

244
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,404
Like four or five years ago.

245
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,198
You guys are like old friends?

246
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,782
I don't know.
Brody's alright.

247
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,493
Small world.

248
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,454
Did you know that
Brody made Stephanie cry?

249
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,374
- So have you seen Brody since?
- I have not seen Brody.

250
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,250
When the time's right though

251
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,419
maybe call Brody,
talk about it all.

252
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,712
What happened with you and
Brody? You guys were like...

253
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,465
(Spencer)
'He just hangs out
with somebody'

254
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,258
I can't respect him
for hanging out with.

255
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,968
Who he talked a lot
of crap about?

256
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,970
Yeah.
I don't like hypocrites.

257
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,972
Loyalty is a big thing.

258
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,521
- Did you meet Doug yet?
- You're asking Cameron?

259
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,691
- Dating LC's boyfriend Doug?
- I never dated Doug.

260
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,859
- They just went to dinner.
- Candlelit dinner.

261
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,903

Of course not. It's from you.
I'm keeping it.

285
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,718
Justin, that's mine.
Give this back.

286
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,345
No.

287
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,140

- Nope.

288
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,849
I'm gonna throw you overboard.

289
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,769
I should throw you overboard.

00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,188
You came to Cabo on a hall pass?

291
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,023
I'm not the one that has
a boy right now.

292
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,233
So you really can't say
anything, can you?

293
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,943
You left me for another guy.

294
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,112
- No. Well, yeah, I did.
- See?

295
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,782
- I ask you what's up...
- I was having fun.

296
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,116
Well, have your fun.

297
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,202
I'm having fun, too, now.

298
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,579
Justin, you're in a spot
in your life right now

299
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,749
where you don't wanna be
exclusive with anyone.

300
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,294
And I found someone
who I really like and...

301
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,296
But I've always asked
you just be straight up.

302
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,840
Um, I've always asked
you to be straight up.

303
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,383
- I think I have.
- You're never...

304
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,343
- No, you're not.
- And you're not.

305
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm telling you right now,
me and Cory, I really like him.

306
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,223
He treats me good
and he wants to be with me.

00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,016
- Okay.
- End of story.

Well, you know, I don't care.
I think it's cool.

309
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,271
- Give me my flower.
- No.

310
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,857
Now, you're definitely
not getting it back.

311
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,775
- Justin!
- You will never have this.

312
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,694

Do you know why I'm here?

324
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,447
How do you think
you behaved last night?

325
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,949
After waiting around
for 40 minutes?

326
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,285
Okay, well, the thing was,
it wasn't my fault.

327
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,787
It was his fault.

328
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,038
- And so he felt so bad.
- He should have!

00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,833
If I'm trying to go meet Heidi's
brother for the first time

330
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,710
I'm not gonna be
40 minutes late.

331
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,588
I'm gonna be 40 minutes early,
staking out the place.

332
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,633
'And why would you
bring up Doug?'

333
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,927
- I was just curious.
- I never dated Doug.

334
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,345
That's like the one thing
you don't talk about

335
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,681
to a new couple.

336
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,225
He got in the car, and he was
like, "So, what about Doug?"

337
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,103
Only reason I was
giving him a hard time

338
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,521
is that I didn't
understand the fact

339
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,107
that he's chilling with Brody.

340
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,901
I'm not apologizing.

341
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,611
'Cause you just don't get
along with anyone.

342
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,529
You should be appreciative,
A, I talk to you

343
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,324
B, I went to a dinner with you
and your new boyfriend

344
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,326
and, C, I paid for the dinner.

345
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,828
Just like be nicer to me.

346
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,621
- To you?
- Yeah.

347
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,332
Why don't you start being
loyal to your family?

[whistles]
Trade maybe?

349
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,672
I'll be nice to somebody who's
loyal and you'll be loyal.

350
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,924

359
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,326
for being with someone who...

360
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,577
He can't.
No, he can't at all.

361
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,871
He has no right.

362
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,252
I think that you need to think
about what's right for you.

363
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,673
Honestly, like what
makes you happy.

Cory makes me happy.

Honestly, you need to not
talk to Justin anymore.

367
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,891
But now, this was it.
But I just...

to make things difficult.

I don't. That's why
I-I've stopped it, Lauren.

But you're here
and you're contemplating.

I'm here and he's here

I think that Justin is gonna
be someone that you love

00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,541
and love to be with,
but if you wanna be with someone

00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,919
and you want a boyfriend,
you can't look to Justin

'cause he's not gonna
give that to you.

'Maybe it's time to let him go.'

381
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,675
