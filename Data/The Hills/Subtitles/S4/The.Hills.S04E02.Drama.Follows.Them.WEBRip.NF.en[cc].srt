Alright, so,

00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:09,092
So, I'm gonna have
my birthday party

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,346
at Boulevard three,
on Thursday night.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,764
- This Thursday?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,349
- Oh, I wanna come.
- Can you?

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,017
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,769
Is it okay
if I bring a guy with me?

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,481
- What?
- You have a guy in your life?

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,443
- Oh, my God.
- 'His name's Doug.'

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,737
He plays baseball,
but he's injured right now.

12
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,823
He's an athlete?
That's my favorite kind of guy.

13
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,826
- I know, right?
- Athletes are the best.

14
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:36,119
Are you inviting
your brother and Heidi?

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,622
I don't know. I haven't
talked to them in weeks.

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,207
I just want it
to be a fun night

17
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,750
and it's like
drama follows them.

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,126

if it follows

At my house. I told you
I found them the other day.

32
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,707
I thought you found them
at your Laguna house.

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,667
- Yeah, at my Laguna house.
- That house.

34
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,878
Not the Laguna house.

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,381
So, anyway, how's things
with you and Audrina?

36
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,176
Um, I think her and Lo had like
a little, a little chat.

37
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,346
- Yeah?
- It was kind of a disaster.

Because on my birthday

00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,136
she wanted to apologize
for being absent

76
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,013

being rude to her.

but in reality

78

not be too nervous.

- I get a little nervous.

105
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,072
- At, like, work dinners. Yeah.
- Really? But you work here now.

106
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,907
- You're part of the team.
- I know.

107
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,825
I know, but I'm a newbie, so...

Do you have anything
going on this week?

00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,830

is Stephanie's birthday

00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,665

I mean, I'm not even gonna try
understand their relationship.

if he was going to come.

that maybe we should just go

Stephanie, we're brother and
sister, at the end of the day

346
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,103
I can't change, I can't
make you un-my sister.

347

Trust me, if I could in

349

I don't wanna see you. I don't
wanna hang out with you.

350

Can you come up here
for a minute, please?

Hi.

363
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,318
So, a few things that I wanna
talk to you about.

364
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,986
Okay.

365
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,030
I wanna let you know
that I fired Jessica.

366
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,657
The bottom line is that

367
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,618
we've a voice
and a standard that comes

368
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,245
from New York, and we felt that
it was not being maintained

369
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,038
'with an attention to detail.'

370
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,459
That being said, we,
Robin, Emily, and I have talked

371
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,502
and we want to offer you
Jessica's job

372
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,130
and we would also expect you
to be available

373
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,048
to start living
a bi-coastal lifestyle

374
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,550
which is something
we've all done.

375
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,260
- Right.
- 'You would come to New York.'

376
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,262
'Where you'd basically,
like, be my shadow.'

377
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,139
You would come to
business meetings with us.

378
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,933
We would do a two
or three-day intensive.

379
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,017
You can watch and participate

380
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,269
in the upper management

381
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,687
so when you come back to LA...

382
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,773
So I can bring the voice
from New York?

383
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,775
- Right.
- Okay.

384
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,068
I do remember that we talked
about your need to delegate.

385
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,905
Right. I'm working on it.
Definitely working on it.

386
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,490
You're gonna have to learn
how to do that

387
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,617
while you're here
and also from afar.

388
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,118
Okay.

389
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,703
I wouldn't make any plans
for the next couple of months.

from them at all.

talk to me after that.

You know, they didn't call.
