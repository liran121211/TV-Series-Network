'Okay. Okay. I'm so excited!'

00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,483
- Thank you, Dougy.
- Sure, baby.

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,360
- Tonight's gonna be so fun.
- Gonna be so fun.

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,320
- It's gonna be a long night.
- I'm really excited.

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,280
I think it's fun for us to,
like, all hang out together

'cause we all get along so well.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,536
- There's two more coming.
- Oh, Audrina and Justin.

16
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,746
Why didn't they come with us
on this plane?

17
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,374

- 'Yo, Steph.'

And, uh, I don't know.

68
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,670
I told her, you know, she could
probably stay here until...

69
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,630
No, you didn't.

I know, but she won't
even be in our way.

find a bunch of tam..."

Anyways, she's gonna move here

81
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,568
and she's gonna stay in here,
until she gets on her own feet.

82
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,445
This is the quickest way
to get me to move out

- Are you kidding?

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,502
And it was so awkward
and silly, and I was like

107
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,504
'"Can I talk to you
for just one second?"'

108
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,465

"I'm here with my friends."

109
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,342
'Honestly,
what am I supposed to do?'

110
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,970
I would honestly say,
Get out. Get out of my house.

111
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,680
- 'Listen, you've, you've...'
- If I say that to her...

112
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,473

move out, it's done."

114
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,894

she wants to be friends.

- I don't know what to do.
- Uh, Get out.

117
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,984
We have both gone into her house
and sat with her

118
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,485
and tried to, like, work it out.

119
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,320
Why, first of all,
why do you care?

120
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,531
She was one of my best friends.

121
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,867
- 'She was. You just said it.'
- Was.

122
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,869

for you to do it

123

00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,260
'and Lauren
just kept calling my name'

169
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,178
and I'm like, Hold on.
I don't wanna be rude.

170
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,138
Like, let me finish this
conversation, you know.

171
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,599
I can't just walk away from it.

172
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,727
And then, I think maybe, like

173
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,354
she got her feelings hurt,
I don't know.

174
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,147
She didn't say anything
to you the whole night?

175
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,607
And I haven't
talked to her since.

176
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,483
Now,
we're gonna see her tonight.

177
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,778
'So I mean, there's been tension
ever since we've moved in.'

178
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,988
And I don't know,
we're just growing apart.

179
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,615
We're going
in different directions

180
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,575
and that happens,
friendships, you know.

181
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,245
It doesn't mean
we still can't be friends.

182
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,080
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

183
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,999
And I don't think it's gonna
go back to how it was.

184
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,084
Yeah.

185
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,966
- Happy birthday, Frankie.
- Cheers to Frankie.

186
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,550
- 'Woo-hoo!'
- 'Happy birthday.'

187
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,303
- 'Cheers.'
- 'Twenty one long years.'

188
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,221
- 'Happy twenty seventh.'
- Twenty first birthday.

189
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,391
- Yeah, you're twenty one again.
- Twenty one.

190
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,185
- Do you guys want cocktails?
- Oh, yeah. May I see?

191
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,937
(Frankie)
'Hey, by the way,
where's Audrina?'

192
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,563
'Wasn't she
supposed to be here?'

193
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,649
Whatever.
I'm sick of talking about her.

194
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,110
- Guys.
- 'Be nice.'

195
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,154
Let's just talk
about something else.

196
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,738
We can talk about whatever
you want.

197
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,657
Wait, Brody,
while you're sitting here

198
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,327
with Lauren here, I wanna know

199
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,787
why you told Lauren
not to trust me.

200
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,499
Spencer is your family,
right? That's your brother?

201
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,376
'You guys are getting along?'

202
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,544
- He won't talk to me.
- Why not?

203
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,713
Because he doesn't want me
to be nice to Lauren.

204
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,674
- Well...
- Oh, it's awkward.

205
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,259
(Stephanie)
'I really don't think
you should'

206
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,052
tell Lauren
not to be friends with me.

207
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,096
I never told Lauren
not to be friends with you.

208
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,099
I just was skeptical whether
she should trust you or not.

209
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,268
'I've known you
for a long time.'

210
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,395
- Yeah.
- And I know how crazy you are.

211
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,731
What? This is when
I used to have a drug problem.

212
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,692
And been like a complete psycho.

213
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,444
I can't believe you're
calling me a complete psycho.

214
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,446
Let's just... Why, why even
get into it right now?

215
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,448
- I don't wanna get into it.
- Why, let's just have fun.

216
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,074
I just don't want you
to tell Lauren...

217
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,451
You just asked
that question right now...

218
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,286
Hey, hey.
Cheers. Stop. Right now.

219
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,331
- It's like leave.
- Stop. Well, stop!

220
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,208
(Brody)
'No, no.
I'm gonna tell you right now.'

221
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,127
'I'm here celebrating a birthday
with my best friend'

222
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,254
And you wanna talk
about why I said

223
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,131
something else to my,
another one of my friends?

224
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,757
'I'm gonna tell that
to Lauren because I care'

225
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,468
'about Lauren and she's
a good friend of mine.'

226
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,094
He didn't tell me not to be
your friend. He just...

227
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,971
I said, Be careful.
I said, She's crazy.

228
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,556
I've known her for a long time.

229
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,476
- Don't say I'm crazy.
- You're a little crazy.

231
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,440
You're my friend
and I'm looking out for you.

'You know, I've tried to be
cordial and be nice'

233
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,610
but that's it.

234
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,906
Stephanie, you wanna go
to the bathroom real quick?

235
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,574
I'm gonna be right back.

236
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,954

It's not easy to be
the bigger person, Steph.

248
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,456

- I'm just like blown away.

don't know how boys

I just can't help it.

255
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,685
I just don't understand
how he could say that

256
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,146
when he's known me for so long.

257
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,984
Here's my thing, Steph,
I feel like

258
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,362
you, you made some mistakes

259
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,531
and you went down
a really bad path.

260
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,242
But the point is that you
got help and you got better

261
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,244
and you're a much
better person today

262
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,288
because of it,
and you're a stronger person.

263
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,666
I know, but even when I was
using, like, I was never mean.

264
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,211
Like, I was selfish, but...

265
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,088
Like, in a way,
it's none of his business.

266

268
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,597

partially my fault

I understand,
I understand that you're upset.

340
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,471
And I understand this is
uncomfortable. It's temporary.

341
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,056
She wants to move out.
She doesn't want to move there.

342
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,852
- Yes, she does.
- She is so damn cozy.

343
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,728
You couldn't pay her
to move out.

344

You have to promise me you're
not gonna say anything to her.

Spencer?

346
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,485
- I won't say anything to her.
- Alright.

347
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,070
Well, I have things to do,
so I'll call you after work.

348
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,447
Just get out of the house
or something.

349
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,073
Maybe you shouldn't be there
so much.

last night? Like four?'

I'm delirious right now.
I'm so tired.

353
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,187
Thank you so much for coming to
the room and going late with me.

354
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,356
Obviously.
Are you feeling better?

355
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,025
No.

356
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,861
So Audrina didn't say
hi to you at all?

357
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,905
- 'That's so weird.'
- Yeah.

358
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,074
Well, you do need to talk
when you guys get back to LA.

Coming.

- Oh!
- Frankle! Frankle, Frankle!

- How are you?
- Not good.

from Brody

at 9:00 a.m. that he's in jail.

- Brody's in jail?
- 'Doug got punched.'
