back every weekend and see us.

174
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,063
Yo, yo.

175
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,022
[laughs]

176
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,693
Don't worry, dad.
I'll be back.

177
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,070
It's sad.

178
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,490
I'm really proud of her though.

179
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,202
It's a big deal to move
across the country, like...

180
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,206
She has, like,
one friend in New York.

181
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,625
- What?
- 'And a boy.'

182
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,002
You may have a crush on him,
but you're not dating him yet.

183
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,630
I'm not dating him.
That's very true.

184
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,051
Well, Stephanie came over today.

185
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,057
'She said Heidi and Spencer
just totally disappeared.'

186
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,232
Hey, everybody.
I just wanted to make a toast.

187
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,152
We couldn't be more proud of
the fact that you've progressed

188
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,362
'the way you have with dignity.'

189
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,031
'We hope that
you have all the success.'

190
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,410
And we hope that you may be
even convince them that

191
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,246
you can run their West Coast
office and be back here shortly.

192
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,206
- Love you and...
- And be safe.

193
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,833
And be safe.

194
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,668
(all)
Cheers.

195
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,713
And come home.

196
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,048
[chuckles]

197
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,933
Okay.

198
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,061
It hasn't really hit me yet.

199
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,897
Oh, mom.

200
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,859
You made mom cry.

201
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,361
[sniffles]

202
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,573
You okay?

203
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,992
This is, I have to stop.

204
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,743
Okay, girls, so what's new?

205
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,454
[chuckles]

206
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,913
(Lauren)
'I told Whitney I might cry'

207
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,665

I'm gonna be like,
"Whitney, I like this boy

213
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,224
who doesn't like me.
What do I do?"

214
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,392
And she'll be like,
"Well, Lauren..."

215
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,521
It's been a long run with us.

216
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,899

Don't talk about it.

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,902

I am being so serious.
I want to go marry you.

226
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,306
I don't know, Spence.

227
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,600
- I feel like your mom...
- We don't have to tell...

228
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,185
- Your nana, your mum...
- That's the whole point.

229
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,771
It's a secret Mexico wedding.
It's for us.

230
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,482
'It's like we've been
through so much and my...'

231
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,610
I just, I just don't want
to be in a relationship

232
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,237
that's not going anywhere.
I'm ready to get married...

233
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,988
What do you mean
it's not going anywhere?

234
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,615
Of course, it's going somewhere.

235
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,158
'Where? We're never
gonna get married...'

236
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,493
- Yes, we are...
- With your family.

237
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,912
Your mom will never
approve of it.

238
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,996
And you don't have
to tell anyone.

239
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,374
It's our secret marriage.

240
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,001
No drama, no stress.
Just you and me.

241
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,378
- No planning.
- Are you serious?

242
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,549
I mean, it will be so crazy.

243
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,510
Hasn't our relationship
been that pretty much?

244
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,720
Do you think we should
really do it?

245
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:42,267
Heidi Montag, when I'm with you,
you make me wanna be nicer

246
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,395
and that's why I just
am madly obsessed with you

247
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,272
and it's pretty apparent
the fact that I haven't left

248
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,525
your side
in nearly two and a half years

249
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,153
and I pretty much keep you
from the whole world.

250
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,113
You're just my angel.

251
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,533
Let's just do it.
We'll tell nobody.

252
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,077
It'll just be you and me,
about us, for us.

253
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,537
- You promise?
- I promise.

254
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,456
It has nothing to do
with anybody but us.

Let's just...

you're leaving yet.

278
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,988
I know. I just
can't even imagine

279
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,366
like, living in the city.

280
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,284
It's like when I go
to the grocery store

281
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,495
do I take a cab there and just
bring all my groceries with me?

282
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,121
Do I get a bicycle
and get, like, a basket

283
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,747
and carry everything inside?

284
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,041
I don't know.

285
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,626
I'm gonna be sitting at my desk

286
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,003
staring at my computer
with no one to look to.

287
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,131
No, you'll make
new good friends.

288
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,551
No one like you though.

289
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:43,137
I feel like we've really
grown up with each other.

290
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,184
My first memory of you
is our first day.

291
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:52,731
We had our hair all done
and they changed our outfits.

292
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,441
I would dare someone to come
change your outfit now.

293
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,983
When someone was like,
that's a little...

294
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,611
- Matchy, matchy.
- Matchy, matchy.

295
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,405
That was totally our first day.
Oh, my God.

296
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,240
Was the DKNY show
the first thing we did?

297
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,325
- No, the...
- The young Hollywood party.

298
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,244
When I let Heidi in.

299
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,413
If we only knew then
what we know now.

300
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,124
Seriously, that seems
like so long ago.

301
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,835
Mm.

302
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,879
Don't cry.

303
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,882
I kind of went into it
looking at it as a job

304
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,761
and I didn't expect
to get a friend.

305
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,220
Never.

306
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,561
I really think that we got so
lucky to have found each other.

307
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,194
I'm so proud of you and, like,
so excited you're going away.

308
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,739

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,078

I'm really excited
for you though.

312
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,547

You had this plan
the whole time.

We were gonna come here
and get married.

337

I booked the trip.

338
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
I didn't know if I could
actually get you to do it.

339
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,421
Think the Patron
helped a little bit.

340
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,963
A lot bit.

341
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,258
You didn't feel too good
last night, did you?

342
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,051
Well, don't give me
too much tequila.

00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,848
Oh, let's watch the tape.

346
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,266
We got footage of that.

347
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,434
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh!

348
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,603
Almost dropped the camera.

349
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,023
Look at this.

350
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,444
'This is it,
right after, walking out.'

351
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,112
(Heidi)
'Wow!'

352
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,322
[chuckles]

353
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,867
(Spencer)
'What were you really thinking
when we walked in that chapel?'

354
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,077
(Heidi)
'I just didn't think
you were gonna do it.'

355
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,204
'I was just nervous and scared.'

356
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,873
(Spencer)
'Oh, I don't think
I've ever been that nervous'

357
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,499
'in my whole life
and I was just like'

358
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,376
'"I'm getting married right now.
This is crazy."'

359
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,670
'And I got nobody
here to watch.'

360
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,464
'Not one person.'

361
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,258
I can't believe we did this.

362
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,804
(Spencer on camera)
'Don't get overwhelmed
with that bling, baby.'

363
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,764
Oh, nice ring.

364
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,140
(Heidi on camera)
Mine too.

365
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,016
'Little Zsa Zsa rock here.'

366
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,269
That's a Cabo special
right here.

367
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,605
- I don't know about this.
- This is my Cabo special.

368
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,732
You naughty wife.

369
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,777
(Heidi)
'Look at that dress.
It worked out so perfectly.'

370
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,278
'And the bouquet.'

371
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,238
'Look at that chapel.'

372
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,824
'I just can't believe it.'

373
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,493
'It was just so romantic
and on a whim and...'

374
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,663
Unbelievable.

375
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,997
(Spencer)
'That's enough of this for now.'

376
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,249
(Heidi)
'That's amazing.'

377
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,502
My mom is gonna freak.

378
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,295
'I don't even know
what to tell her'

379
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,839
because she's gonna kill me.

380
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,841
I thought
you weren't tellin' her.

381
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,426
I mean, how can you not tell
somebody something like this?

382
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,052
Like...

383
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,930
She is, like,
really gonna have an issue

384
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,723
with us being married,
I think.
