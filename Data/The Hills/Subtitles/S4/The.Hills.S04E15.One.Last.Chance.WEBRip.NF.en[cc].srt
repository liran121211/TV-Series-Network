00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,422
- I have a question.
- Talk to me.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,466
Have you talked
to the cute boy Jay?

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,009
- Yes.
- Seriously?

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,803
Yeah. We've been keeping
in touch.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,430
We've been talking,
so hopefully

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,474
I'll be able to get out
there soon and...

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,810
So jealous of your
fairy tale. It's so cute.

8
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,227
It's so cute.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,980
Oh, my gosh!
I forgot to tell you.

10
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,565
- 'Holly's staying with me.'
- 'Are you serious?'

11
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,861
Yeah, she came over last night.
She's like crashing.

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,320
That's very nice of you.

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,947
Wouldn't you do that
for a friend?

14
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,239
Yeah, I would do that too.

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,701
- 'You would do it.'
- Definitely.

16
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,996
Does Heidi know that Holly
is staying with you right now?

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,706
'You don't know.'

18
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,457
'Cause that could get
really complicated.

19
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,917
How could it possibly
get more complicated?

20
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,295
I'm just saying,
the longer she stays there

21
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,047
the more the two of them
are gonna resent you.

22
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,676
My only concern
is how they're gonna treat her

23
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,721
but seeing as they didn't leave
her with much of an option.

24
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,640
And I guess if her sister's
the one kicking her out

25
00:00:56,682 --> 00:01:00,143
then she doesn't owe her
anything.

26
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,436
Holly seems like a sweet girl.

27
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,230
- She's great.
- From what I know of her.

28
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,525

but without the Spencer.

I'd be on the beach every day.

59
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,351
That's why I think, like,

things are finally,
the tension's squashed.

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,977
and...bachelorette-ish.

176
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,313
Yes, my little bachelorette pad.

177
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,400
It's slowly coming along.
It just takes time.

178
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,693
'Justin's been coming over.
He helps here and there.'

179
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,528
Like I need those pictures
hung up.

180
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,821
So everything's going good?

181
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,198
Things are going really good.

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,325
We'll hang out here,
we'll go to Venice

183
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,536
to his neck of the woods
and hang out there.

184
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,997
And it's kinda nice
going back and forth.

185
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,666
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

186
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,043
He's been here a lot.

187
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,669
His toothbrush is upstairs.

188
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,422
Oh, goodness.

189
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,215
And we were talking about
going to Mexico

190
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,008
and like getting away
for a little bit.

191
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,179
But he still does
the whole, like

192
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,014
"Oh, I'm gonna disappear
for a week

193
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,849
"and not return your
phone calls or texts

194
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,103
and you're not gonna know
where I am or what I'm doing."

195
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,105
- Like, what is that?
- I know, but...

196
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,148
Where does he go, though?

197
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,607
Even if you talk to him after

198
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,942
does he just not tell you?

199
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,735
But I just, I've gotten
to the point now

200
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,654
where I just don't, kinda
don't sit around anymore...

201
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:12,284
That's sad, though. You expect
to be, like, convenient.

202
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,287
Like, when it's good for him,
he's all about it.

203
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,039
I feel like he's been making,
like, more effort

204
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,083
in hanging out and just...

205
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,961
What can I say? I love him.

206
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,881

Hi, my name's Heidi.
I'm here for Sam.

216
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,997
- I'll let him know you're here.
- Okay, thank you.

Heidi here to see you.'

00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,379

- 'Thank you.'

219
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,761
Hey. How are you? Have a seat.

220
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,930
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with me.

221
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,474
I know you're very busy.

222
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,184
'I mean, you've been with us
for a long time.'

223
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,435
Brent called me a couple times.

224
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,229
He asked me to sit down
with you and...

225
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,730
I mean, I don't know
what to say, I mean

226
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,774
from my perspective,
I just don't get it.

227
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,485
I don't get it because we've
actually spent some time

228
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,403
together 'cause Brent's
brought you around.

229
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,945
He really has high hopes
for you.

230
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,447
But I mean, I don't remember

231
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,823
the last person that talked
that way to me.

232
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,076
'Twice already, we've had,
like, the alcohol thing'

233
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,951
'and being disrespectful.'

234
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,412
Wh-What's the issue, what is it?

235
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,621
What is it? You know,
it happened in Vegas...

236
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,790
- With Spencer?
- 'Yeah. No, just in general.'

237
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,834
I mean, Spencer, the Spencer
thing I don't even get.

238
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,877
But that's your own problem.

239
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,170
'I don't like to get involved'

240
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,380
'with the personal stuff,
but...'

241
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,673
I mean, there really
is no excuse, you know.

242
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,260
I love this company
and I'm very sorry

243
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,011
that anything like that
ever happened.

244
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,137
'It should never have happened.'

245
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,098
Listen, you do good work.

246
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,391
Brent's happy with you.

247
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,975
You seem like
a really smart girl.

248
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,685
This is what I'll do,
we're opening a new hotel

249
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,645
'I wanna put you
on a trial basis over there.'

250
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,855
Okay.

251
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,065
'I wanna get you
out of the clubs.'

252
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,067
So I would urge you

253
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,944
I'm not gonna take this meeting
ever again.

254
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,281
I did it once. Um, so it's up
to you to prove yourself.

255
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,615
An-And you know what?
I hope you can.

256
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,950
But just-just keep
that guy away.

257
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,368
I don't wanna see him.

258
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,994
And really, if he
comes on the property

259
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,037
I'm just gonna kick him out.

260
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,663
- Okay.
- Simple.

261
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,207
- You deal with that.
- I promise it won't happen.

262
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,917
And I will be the best employee
that you have.

263
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,210

about the final.

280
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,547

(Lauren)
'Holly.'

283
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,760
And so we've been, like,
getting her in.

284
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,888
You're kidding.
Holly moved to your house?

285
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,600
She didn't move.
She's just, like, crashing.

286
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,018
Oh, my God.

know anyone else?'

'Like, this is gonna create
so many problems.'

289
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,734
- 'I don't think it will.'
- 'I think Heidi will be hurt.'

290
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,695
That's all.
I think she'll just be sad.

291
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,282
To be honest...

292
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,868

300
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,893
I mean, he was staying
with his sister.

301
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,895
- Yeah! I remember that.
- 'For how long?'

302
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,771
Remember and Stephanie
told us it was like

303
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,691
"Spencer, like, expects me
to clean up after him

304
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,484
like, wash his sheets
and stuff."

305
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,736
I know, I'm like cooking for
them, I'm cleaning the house.

You don't have to clean.

Okay. Well, that's part
of being a good houseguest.

308
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,536
- No, no, no, not at all.
- 'I don't know.'

309
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,580
It's just, it sucks
because, you know

310
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,916
Heidi's always been
my best friend our whole lives.

311
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,044
'Like, I can't believe
she put me in this position.'

312
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,380
What did she expect you to do?

313
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,007
I don't, I don't think
she really

314
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,469
is thinking about my situation.

315
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,762
I can't even imagine
talking to her right now.

316
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,140
- It's just I'm-I'm furious.
- 'Yeah.'

317
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,436

- Yeah.
- 'That's the other thing.'

324
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,572
It's like she was the one
that was encouraging me

325
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,574
to come out here, so...

326
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,493

Spencer's just...'

Is he actually mean to you?

329
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,833
- Oh, like openly and...
- 'Really?'

330
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,961
- Unabashedly.

To be honest, I'm like,

00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,955
'that you're heading back

Oh, yeah,

'This doesn't
look like fried rice.'

359
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,782
It's Thai fried rice.

360
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,867
It looks just like rice.
But thank you.

361
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,994
'Have you talked
to your sister?'

362
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,788
No, she hasn't even been, like

363

'talking to me
since she moved out.'

364
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,417
She didn't even tell you
that she's staying at Lauren's?

(Heidi)
'What?'

366

Who'd you hear that from?

367
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,088
Lauren.

368
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,049
Why would Lauren want Holly
to live with her?

369
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,467
'Cause Holly was homeless.

370
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,886

to a homeless person?

- 'Your mom didn't tell you?'
- 'No.'

372

- Yeah.

the whole thing.

'It sounds like someone's
stalker mom would do.'

375
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,481
Don't call her stalker mom.

376
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,276
She's worse than Stephanie.

377
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,613
It just shows you everything

378
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,615
I've said about Holly
is completely true

379

century crashing at her pad.

381

This is my sister. Am I never
gonna talk to her again?

382
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,333
Are we just not
gonna be friends?

383
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,545
I just, I can't even
believe this and you don't care.
