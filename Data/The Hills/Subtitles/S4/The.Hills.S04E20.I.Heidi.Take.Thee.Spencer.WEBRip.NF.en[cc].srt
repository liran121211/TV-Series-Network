1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,756
- Hi, guys.
- 'Hi.'

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,215
- How's it going?
- Good.

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,968
Okay, the opening of the hotel

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,511
is a few days away.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,846
We're kind of just
in scramble mode.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,597
I need you guys
to look at the timeline

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,056
double-check that
we haven't forgot anything.

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,100
We've got, like,
all hands on deck, so...

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,936
- Okay.
- That's what's going on.

10
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,855
(Brent)
'How was your vacations?
What'd you guys do?'

11
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,064
Um, Hawaii, Kona.

12
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,566
- 'Yeah.'
- Yeah, what'd you do?

13
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,944
I was in Mexico
and kinda decided

14
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,988
to get married.

15
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,784
- Shut up.
- 'No, really.'

16
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,370
We were down there and we had,
like, a couple margaritas

17
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,913
and there was a chapel there
and we're like

18
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,623
'"Well, let's just do
a ceremony."'

19
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,375
So it's the craziest thing
I've ever done.

20
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,505
Alright.

21
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:53,178

to the ground ♪

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,056

25
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,690
What kind of a do
are you gonna do?

26
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,692
I think just like a little bun.

27
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,985
I'm a little nervous
about wearing

28
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,029
lime green to a black-tie.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,323
Lime green is, like, the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

30
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,952
What do you guys
have going on tonight?

31
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,330
Um, we're doing that SLS opening

32
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,917
but it's a black-tie, so...

33
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,459
Great, have a seat.

34
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,503
- 'Have a seat in here.'
- 'Thanks, sweetie.'

35
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,296
(Lo)
We haven't been to a big,
fun party in a while.

36
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,340
- I'm kind of excited.
- I know.

37
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,634
(Lo)
'Do you know who is doing
the event tonight?'

38
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,219
- It's Bolthouse.

39
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,721
Does that mean
Heidi's gonna be there?

40
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,056
Probably.

41
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,059
- Are you gonna talk to her?

42
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,142
You miss her though, right?

43
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,062
'I mean, it's so sad'

44
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,273
but the main reason we don't
get along hasn't changed.

45
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,191
I know.
Holly told me about the wedding.

46
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,154
Holly also told me
that Heidi does miss you.

47
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,575
Well, I'm sure she misses
having friends, period.

48
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,785
Yeah.

49
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,036
I would love to go up to her

50
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,495
and just be fine but I feel like

51
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,748
because we were so close
for so long

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,084
I know how to be her best friend
and I know how to hate her

53
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,294
and I don't know how to do
anything in between.

54
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,630
Yeah. Well,
we'll see tonight, I guess.

55
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,138
♪ Is there ever a dream
of mine you? ♪

56
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,142
♪ Oh you haven't heard ♪

57
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,483

that sparkle away ♪♪

59
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,323
This is it.
We got a little bungalow.

60
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
It's our little getaway, dude.

61
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,039
Oh, my God.

62
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,042
Wow, this is impressive.

63
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,460
You did this all yourself.

64
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,378
- Good, huh?
- Yeah, I like it.

65
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,089
I am going straight
to the bar.

66
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,758
- Straight to the bar? We need...
- You check it out.

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,678
- It's so white.
- Look what I found.

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,262
'Champagne?'

69
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,348
That's kinda
like a celebration, dude.

70
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,808
It is, out of LA.

71
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,601
Out of LA.

72
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,104
- Here.
- Out of LA. No more drama.

73
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,065
'Oh, crap.'

74
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,900
'We don't need glasses, do we?'

75
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,986
[Audrina laughs]

76
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,947
We should do this,
like, once a month.

77
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,824
You got it.

78
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,327
Did you realize
every time we go away

79
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,079
it's never just the two of us?

80
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,123
- I know.
- It's always...

81
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,833
With a group of people
and then we don't really

82
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,626
get to spend time
with each other.

83
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,003
And you know
what comes with that.

84
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,838
Drama.

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,756
Well, this is gonna be
drama-free.

86
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,551
Better be.

87
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
These little trips
will make us a little

88
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,637
closer and closer together.

89
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,223
I'm all yours. You're all mine.

90
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,350
- We're gonna have fun.
- 'You're in trouble now, dude.'

91
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,853
You're in trouble now.

92
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,605

So what's going on?

115
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,889
Nothing's going on with me.
What's going on with you?

116
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,016
I just came to see
how you were doing and...

117
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,435
- Well, we went to Mexico.
- 'How Mexico was?'

118
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,772
And, you know,
had a couple of margaritas

119
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,274
and we just decided to...

120
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,109
Just that easy,
couple margaritas

121
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,820
beautiful sunset, get married?

122
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,655
I don't want you
to be upset about this.

123
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,325
How can I not be upset?
You chose to go and elope.

124
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,494
That's my choice, mom,
and that shouldn't affect you.

125
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,705
It does affect me
and it affects a lot of people.

126
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,917
A lot of people have been hurt
very deeply by all this.

127
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,960
Who?

128
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,711
There's a lot of people

129
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,798
who your whole life,
contribute to your life

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,633
to get you to where you are

131
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,720
and to help mold you
into the person that you are.

132
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,015
I know, mom. I know.

133
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,851
I just feel excluded
from your life.

134
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,893
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you.

135
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,687
I can't not live my life

136
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,647

all the time too.

137
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,858
Is it even legal?

138

I can't sit still.

155
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,527
Maybe you make me nervous.

156
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,196
I get nervous sometimes.

157
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,947
If we don't see each other
for a while

158
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,824
'it's kinda like
maybe an excitement nervous.'

159
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,618
- I get excited to see you.
- Aw.

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,372
That's good. You're a rare one.

161
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,374
So are you.

162
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,918
You think the universe
is in our favor?

163
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,171
I don't know.

164
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,715
Well, do you think you're
comfortable with where we stand?

165
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,303
What do you think?

166
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,682
I think we're at this standstill
that's kind of stuck.

167
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,354
'Audrina, I don't have that big
of a connection with people'

168
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,439
that I give myself to
and spend all that time with

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,109
and you're definitely
one of those people.

170
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,819
'And I hope that
it stays like that'

171
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,363
'for as long
as it possibly can.'

172
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,533
What is that?

173
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,036
It's just a ring.

174
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,955
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

175
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,707
'I wanna see it.'

176
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,419
It's cute. I like it.

177
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,379
- Thank you.
- You're amazing.

178
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,673
Thank you so much.

179
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,302
I love it.

(Stephanie)
'This is so crazy.'

187
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,535
I know.
This is beautiful out here.

188
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,330
Hey. How are you guys?

189
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,374
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

190
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,001
- 'Hi.'
- You look amazing.

191
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,627
Hi, Mrs. Pratt.

192
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,712
[laughing]

193
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,090
(Heidi)
'Um, wait a minute.
Is that Lauren?'

194
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,094
(Stephanie)
'Yeah, Lauren and Lo.'

195
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,054
- Should I go say something?
- Hello.

196
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,932
[laughs]

197
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,437
Hi.
Should I go say something?

198
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,106
Yeah, go do that.
One hundred percent.

199
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,941
- Alright, I'll go.
- 'Now's the time.'

200
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,361
It's beautiful.
Oh, Heidi's coming over.

201
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,780
She looks nice.

202
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,492
- Hi, Heidi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

203
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,369
Do you mind if I talk to you
for a second?

204
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,786
- Is that okay?
- I'm gonna let you guys...

205
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,205
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

206
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,959
- How's everything going?
- I'm good. How are you?

207
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,127
Good.

208
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,717
I hate that this is awkward.

209
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,636
You heard Spencer and I
got married.

210
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,430
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,059
That's all that matters.

212
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,144
[sighs]

213
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,230
What about your mom? How's she?

214
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,526
Um, it's, it's really hard.

215
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,655
Parents.

216
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,076
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's been hard with her.

217
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,289
- You know?
- It's okay.

218
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,544
The things that she said is

219
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,423
just a little bit
irreparable, so...

220
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,092
You just gotta know
that that's your mom and...

221
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,677
I know and that's why, you know

222
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,347
and Spencer understands that
and then...

223
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,307
You have an amazing mother.
You know that?

224
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,436
Of course. And sister and...

225
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:06,940
- Yeah, I know.
- Stephanie, and you know.

226
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,359
The only thing really missing
in my life is you

227
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,571
and I don't think
that's gonna change anytime.

228
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,953
It's just is what it is,
it's not always fair.

229
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,122
I know.

230
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,833
I know.

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,085
You been working out a lot?

232
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,169
- Working out?
- Yeah.

233
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,796
- No.
- No?

234
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,381
No, I wish.

235
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,091
I'm just hiding it well
in my clothes.

236
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,051
No, no, no.
I don't think so.

237
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,470
- Mm.
- So?

238
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,057
[sighs]

239
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,685
Don't you feel like
you're, like, 18 again, 19?

240
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,063
I feel like
I don't really get older.

241
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,358
Time just keeps, like, passing
by and I'm, like, wait.

242
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,735
Like, two years ago,
three years ago

243
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,072
seems like five minutes ago
so much, you know?

244
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,583
You know that, like

245
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,085
if you ever really needed
anything, that I'm here?

246
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,506
I know.

247
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,967
[sighs]

248
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,471
Alright, well,
I'm gonna go back to work.

249
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,389
- Okay.
- It was good to see you.

250
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,058
- I miss you.
- I really miss you.

251
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,562
Alright, well,
it's good to see you.

252
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,230
We're walking the same way,
aren't we?

253
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,858

259
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,555
You're up very early.

260
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,392
I didn't sleep much last night.
Where's Heidi?

261
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,186
Uh, she's up earlier
than all of us at work.

262
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,855
Got some pictures
on your camera?

263
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,190
There it is.

'Just Heidi and I, the minister'

265
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,902
and an empty chapel.

266
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,320
'That's beautiful.'

267
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,114
So you headed
to the courthouse soon?

268
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,578
Well, I know you manipulated
and plotted this whole wedding.

269
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,745
'And you know
it's not what Heidi wanted.'

270
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,955
Is that what I did?

271
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,874
You know that she had dreams

272
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,752
of a bigger wedding
with her family there.

273
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,256
I can't let you go
to the courthouse

274
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,592
and make this wedding legal.

275
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,719
This is how we wanted
to have our wedding.

276
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,137
This is how you wanted
to have your wedding.

277
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,724
Oh, really?
Well, Heidi's my wife.

278
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,808
And we're gonna be married
for the rest of our lives

279
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,768
and you're gonna need
to accept that.

280
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,730
So we'll go to the courthouse
and we'll make it legal

281
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,232
so then you'll be my mom.

How do you feel this morning?

285
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,792
I have no doubts.

286
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,295
- 'You?'
- Neither do I.

287
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,755
And this ring means
so much to me.

288
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,673
'Aw, of course.'

289
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,884
I mean, like I said last night,
we've been through a lot.

290
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,595
You mean a lot to me.

291
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,223
- You meant it?
- Yeah, of course, I did.

292
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,476

It's, like, the happiest day
of my life. You ready, babe?

299
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,517
- 'Are you ready?'
- I don't know.

300
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,561
I just can't believe
my mom's not here and stuff.

301
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,230
I don't know how I'm gonna
tell her about this.

302
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,900
I thought she would, you know,
be here for, like, this part

303
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,488
but it's good, you know?

304
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,032
I got the rings
right here in my pocket.

305
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,160
Alright, well, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom and freshen up.

306
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,911
- Fresh? You look great.
- Thank you.

307
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,913
Where... You know,
come on, let's just do this.

308
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,915
I'll be right back.

309
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,251
You can't do this.

310
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,379
You mean I just got
dressed up in a suit

311
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,921
and I'm at a courthouse
and filled out

312
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,799
an hour's worth of paperwork
to not do this?

313
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,385
She's gonna remember
this day forever.

314
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,178
And you know
what she's gonna think about?

315
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,430
That she's not talking
to her sister or her mom.

316
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,307
I did not force her
to come to the courthouse.

317
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,809
You think I dressed her up
in that outfit

318
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,352
and put on her shoes...

319
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,187
Why do you have to do it
right now?

320
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,189
Just wait till she's on
better terms with her mom.

321
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,400
Seriously, like, I just

322
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,193
I don't even know
what else to say

323
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,570
but I just think this is wrong.

324
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,114
'Just think.'

325
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,036

- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

328
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,542
Ready to do this?

329
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,753
Yeah, I'm, I'm ready.
Are you ready?

330
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,093
- Hello.
- Hello, come on in.

331
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,513
I'm nervous.

332
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,931
Shh.

333
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,974
- Should we come in or...
- Yes, please.

334
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,102
- You stay here.
- Okay.

335
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,775
I am Deputy Commissioner
Donna Jones.

wanna get married.'

337
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,739
Well, we kinda already did
get married in Mexico

338
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,576
but everyone's saying
it's not legal, so we're here.

339
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,747
- Alright. Are you ready?
- Let's do this.

'Heidi Blair Montag
and Spencer Pratt.'

is most sacred

'and with much joy should be
entered into thoughtfully'

344

and with a deep sense of honor

345
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,268

of its responsibilities

346
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,145
'and commitments.'

347
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,606
'So why don't you guys go ahead
and join hands?'

348
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,653
Heidi, will you repeat
after me to him?

349
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,071
- I, Heidi...
- 'I, Heidi...'

350
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,866
- '...take thee, Spencer...'
- ...take thee, Spencer...

351
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,327
(Donna)
'...to be my lawful
wedded husband...'

352
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,370
...to be my lawful
wedded husband...

353
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,122
(Donna)
'...for better or for worse...'

354
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,833
...for better or for worse...

355
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,710
(Donna)
'...for as long
as we both shall live.'

356
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,921
...for as long
as we both shall live.

357
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,966
(Donna)
'Spencer, will you have Heidi'

358
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,759
'as your wedded wife'

359
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,470
through all the days
of your lives?

360
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,853
Before we do this part
right here

361
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,146
I need to know

362
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,190
that everything going on
with your mom and everything

363
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,942
'that you honestly,
in your heart'

364
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,195
'after her,
she forbid you to do this'

365
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:13,115
and we're going so against
what your whole family wants...

366
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,659
I mean,
what are you talking about?

367
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,036
- This is your idea.
- That's the key thing.

368
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
It's my idea.

369
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,164
So I mean,
that's what's throwing this

370
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,041
whole thing off for me, like...

371
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,752
It's just, like,
this rain cloud following me

372
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,671
'and I don't want that feeling.'

373
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,548
And I just feel like
we're doing something

374
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,217
sneaky right now and shady.

375
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,636
I mean, of course,
I want my mom here.

376
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,847
I shouldn't have
to tell you that.

377
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,057
Alright, then we can't do this.

378
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,100
I just wanna give you
the wedding of your dreams

379
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,478
that you have been talking
about now for three years.

380
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,730
- Really?
- Yeah.

381
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,649
And, and I will deal with it.

382
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,235
It's worth it to be with you
the rest of my life.

383
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,529
We'll do it the way you want.
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,447
- I love you so much.
- I love you.
