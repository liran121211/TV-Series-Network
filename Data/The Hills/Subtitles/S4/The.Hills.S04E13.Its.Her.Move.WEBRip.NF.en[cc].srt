00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,634
- Lauren, hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,552
- 'How are you?'
- I'm good.

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,095
- How are you?
- Uh, good.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,222
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,975
- I'm going to a rock show.
- 'What?'

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,393
I'm going to
Tokyo Police Club with Lo.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,770
- 'Aren't you proud of me?'
- Yeah.

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,730
I was, like,
trying to, like... Wait.

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,607
You have to help me
pick an outfit to...

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,401
'Where did it go? I was gonna
cut a shirt. I've to find it.'

11
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,612
But you have to give me,
like, cool outfit approval.

12
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,866
So I've been meaning to tell
you, so I just wanted to...

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,951
Uh, you know
how I told you eventually

14
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,160
I was looking for places?

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,705
Well, I found a place

16
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,541
and I'm gonna be
moving out soon.

17
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,876
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,585
I've been meaning
to tell you for a while

19
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:47,381
but I just wanted, until I,
I didn't wanna tell you

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,132
until I knew for sure,
you know what I mean?

21
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,509
When are the,
when are movers gonna be...

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,011
They're actually coming
this weekend.

23
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,054
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

24
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,764
That was quick.

25
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,265
I'm kind of bummed,
but at the same time

26
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,060
I'm excited
because of the place, like...

27
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,021
So has Justin seen it?

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,357
No, I haven't told him
about it yet.

29
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,403
But I'm sure he'll be there
a lot and we'll get closer.

30
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,905
Uh-oh.

31
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,573
It will be like he lives there

32
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,744
but I'm not gonna
plan on anything.

33
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,704

[laughing]

40
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,729
(Heidi)
'Amazing.'

41
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,355
It's like yesterday,
I looked here

42
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,481
and it was all construction.

43
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,692
I know.

44
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,152
(Heidi)
'Here come the kings.'

45
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,030
(Sam)
'Then we have the party
and then Oakenfold's'

46
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,990
gonna go on probably
like what, around 11:00?

47
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,951
(Brent)
'He'll open
and Jason Bentley will close.'

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,201
(Sam)
'We gotta have more greeters'

49
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,120
'than we thought
outside on Selma.'

50
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,289
'The party's on the deck.
Last thing we wanna do

51
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,666
is we invite important people
here and they can't get in.

52
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,501
So for four years,
we've been, everybody's been

53
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,295
like, waiting
for this thing to open.

54
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,589
And I think everything's
gonna coordinate through her.

55
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,549
- Yeah, Heidi, so...
- I'm Mrs. Coordinator.

56
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,718
- You're gonna be here, right?
- Of course.

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,804
- Of course, I'll be here.
- I remember last time.

58
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,513
(Brent)
'When we finish the walkthrough,
we'll go outside.'

59
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,766
You guys finish. I'm gonna look
at the tent they just put in.

60
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,894
(Heidi)
'Okay, there's just gonna be
so many people.'

61
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,687
And it's gonna be heavy
with this crowd.

62
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,065
Um, with them cutting tape
and all that

63
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,817
it's not gonna be
like our other events.

64
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,944
But I feel like we have
most of the things done

65
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,947
and maybe
I'll, uh, invite Spencer.

66
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,032
- What, to here?
- Yeah.

67
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,994
Maybe I'll have him bring his
sister or somethin', you know?

68
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,121
I don't know. It's gonna be,
like, huge, high stress.

69
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,998
This is a big one
for Sam and Brent, you know?

70
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,708
Yeah, I feel like, you know,
it's all under control

71
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,376
and what's the harm
in adding, you know

72
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,420
maybe one more
to the guest list?

73
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,923
'And Audrina,
maybe she'll wanna come.'

74
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,051
I mean, this is gonna be
the best party yet.

75
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,886

Hi. I have a shirt

81
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,734
in that same material
as your dress. I love it.

82
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,863
I didn't know if I thought
it was, like, dorky or...

83
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,280
I hope not,
otherwise we're both dorks.

84
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,116
[chuckles]
I think we are both dorks.

85
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,410
Well, how are you doing?

86
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,623
Um, Audrina, well, she's been
looking for places

87
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,377
for a little while and she told
me that she's gonna move out.

88
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,421
Wow. So she just found a place
and she's ready to go?

89
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,466
Yeah. It was just kind of
out of nowhere though.

90
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,343
And you're totally okay with it?

91
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,221
It's gonna be weird when she's
gone when that place is empty.

92
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,058
'I just really hope she's doing
it for the right reasons.'

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,560
She's been looking
for places with Justin.

94
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,520

Everywhere we go is cute, dude.

100
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,835
I know.

101
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,004
Well, you know how I told you
I was looking for a house?

102
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,048
- Yeah?
- I found one.

103
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,883
- Yeah?
- 'Yeah, it's really cute.'

104
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,385
I like it. It's not too big.

105
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,055
So I won't be afraid in it.

106
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,057
That's awesome.
I wanna see it.

107
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,226
I know.
I wanna show it to you.

108
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,188
- I love it. I'm excited.
- Yeah?

109
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,024
Yeah, I just feel like
it's time to move on, you know?

110
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,613
- What are you thinkin'?
- Nothing.

111
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,115
- What are you thinkin'?
- Nothing.

112
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,532
Don't lie to me.

113
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,327
'That I don't know
if I'd wanna live by myself.'

114
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,996
You know what I mean?

115
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,001
'Would you wanna move in,
maybe?'

116
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,089
Alright, you know what?

117
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,299

00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,242
- Oh, my God!
- Isn't it pretty?

124
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:28,203
- This is just the entrance.
- I can't believe it!

125
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,496
- Your own house.
- I know.

126
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,581
The garage is over there.

127
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,416
And this is gonna be, like,
when you first walk in

128
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,460
I wanna get a bench
or something over here.

129
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,962
And there's a lot of stairs

130
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,922
but it's gonna be
a good butt workout.

131
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,465
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

132
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,884
Nice buns, here we come.

133

'I wanna put candles everywhere'

134
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,347
like, all going up the stairs.
This is the first level.

135
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,558
This is, like,
the guest bathroom.

136
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,936
- This is gorgeous.
- And then the living room.

137
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,813
- Isn't it pretty?
- It's so pretty.

138
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,731
- I wanna make it really girly.
- 'Yeah.'

139
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,484
And then
it leads into to the kitchen.

140
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,819
- Ooh.
- Isn't it nice?

141
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,571
- The kitchen's huge.
- I know.

142
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,573
Seriously, this is amazing.

143
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,868
Like, this house is so cool.

144
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,536
Seriously, gorgeous.

145
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,830
I wanna decorate it,
like, all romantic.

146
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,709
With candles
and, like, flowey white and...

147
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,878
Justin.

148
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,838
Well, he can come over,
and, like

149
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,132
we could just hang out
where it's just me and him...

150
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,591
'That's not awkward?'

151
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,384
And it's not not like,
okay, like, be quiet

152
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,678
'cause they're probably sleeping

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,347
or, like, don't wake up the dog.

154
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,350
You know, like we could
just kind of

155
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,853
rekindle that flame again.

156
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,938
- Ooh.
- You know what I mean?

157
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,193
Whenever you're with someone
more, you almost become...

158
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,485
Closer?

159
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,325
So you bought this
for Audrina, right?

160
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,411

after Cleo.

167
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,398
- Cleo is a good pet.
- Yeah.

168
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,692

Audrina today. I feel bad.

00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,527
- I just, I don't know.
- Why do you feel bad?

170
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,072
Just that it didn't turn out
like we hoped

171
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,116
that it would in the
very beginning, you know?

172
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,202
I don't think this was ever
her home and I think it's...

173
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,787
You never wanna not
feel at home.

174
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,790
- Completely.
- 'So maybe this'll be better.'

175
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,250
I was thinking about,
you know, who's probably

176
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,669
pretty stoked
on her moving is Justin.

177
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,255
Oh, Justin Bobby.

178
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,424
The man's so great,
he needed two names.

179
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,009
[chuckles]
I don't know
if he's ever gonna forgive me

180
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,304
for naming him Justin Bobby.

181
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,431
- 'He'll get over it.'
- Eventually.

182
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,268
What if Justin moves in
with Audrina?

183
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,270
We're still gonna see her.
I love her.

184
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,521
She's always gonna be
my friend. I just...

185
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,566
I don't think that her leaving
is gonna change that at all.

186
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,902
No. We'll see though.

Hi.

206

I found you. What's up? Cheers.

- That tequila hit you.
- Three tequilas.

208

Why don't you pour that in mine?

209
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,091
No, no, no. Hi!

210
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,635

00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,014

- 'Nice.'

00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,766
Whoo, look at you.

214
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,061

- Hi. How are you?

- How are you?
- So what's up, ladies?

218
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,362
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

219
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,197
- 'I'm moving out.'
- To you moving out.

220
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,698
- 'Whoa!'
- Finally.

221
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,825
I will definitely toast that.

222

of the house.'

223
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,537
- Thank you.
- Cheers to that.

224
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,746
Isn't it amazing
having your own place?

225
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,248
Totally, I love it.

00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,124

move in together or what?

that Heidi
and I moving in together

229
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,174
was the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

230
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,051
Okay, congratulations, Audrina.

231
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,844
- I think this is a great move.
- Thank you.

232
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,473
(Heidi)
'I'm very proud of you
for getting your life together.'

233
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,726
- To new beginnings.
- Cheers, to new beginnings.

234
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,063
- 'Can we get another tequila?'
- 'Whoo!'

235
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,899
- I'm so wasted. I'm so wasted.
- Shh.

236
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,776
Oh.

237
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,694
Can I get another tequila?

238
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,071
- Excuse me.
- 'Hi.'

239
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,489
- Do you know where Brent is?
- Uh, no.

240
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,865
Do you want me to go find him?

241
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,242
Are we still
working here tonight?

242
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,579
- Are you?
- Would you like a shot?

243
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,081
- The bar's over there.
- 'Let's go.'

244
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,292
Alright, let these girls work,
if you don't mind, huh?

245
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,001
What else? Are you okay?
Do you need anything else?

246
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,003
I'm okay
when you guys are working.

247
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,046

'cause I had to, like,
get all of Audrina's out.

255
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,705
Get all of Audrina's cookbooks?

256
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,334
- Audrina has cookbooks?
- Separating the things, yeah.

257
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,169
- Why are you separating them?
- 'Cause she's moving.

258
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,630

259
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
I, like, didn't realize
she was gonna move

260
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,427
like, it was literally like...

261
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,014
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna move,
like, right now.

262
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,434
Yeah, she told me
she was getting a house.

263
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,437
- Oh. Did you talk to her?
- Yeah.

264
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,274
I saw Audrina last night
at some Bolthouse thing

265
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,734
'that Heidi was working at.'

266
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,571
I haven't seen Heidi and Spencer
drink in such a long time

267
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,407
so they must have been
celebrating something.

268
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,451
I think, like, they're gonna
start hanging out.

269
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,370
They could hang out
when she lived there.

270
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,579
It would have been
awkward if Heidi...

271
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,123
...if she came to the house,
but that was it.

272
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,167
It would have been weird
if Audrina went over

273
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,709
to Heidi's house
because I don't think her

274
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,420
and Spencer are, like, great.

275
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,132
I don't know.

276
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,052
But I know Spencer likes Justin.

277
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,887

282
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,780
- Hi.
- What's up?

283
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:24,285
Um, so I just got off
the phone with Sam.

284
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,080
And were you guys drinking
at the XIV opening?

285
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,832
I definitely wasn't.

286
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
Out of respect for you,
I'd never do that.

287
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,919
- Okay.
- Why, what happened?

288
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,129
Well, Sam made it sound like
you guys were pretty wasted

289
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,797
and he was a little pissed off.

290
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,217
Oh, my God, not at all.

291
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,052
Was Heidi wasted?

292
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,015
I don't think so, but...

293
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,226
Will you grab Heidi and have
her come in and talk to me?

294
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,936
- Yeah.
- 'Okay.'

295
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,483
- Hey.
- Hey.

296
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,736
- Brent wants to talk to you.
- Now?

297
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,777
- Yeah.
- Okay.

298
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,988
Everything okay?

299
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,781
Yeah.

300
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,200
I think it's about XIV.

301
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay.

302
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,376
- Hey, Heidi.
- Hey.

303
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,629
So I just got off
the phone with Sam.

304
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,838
'He kind of let me know
that you were drinking'

305
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,550
at the XIV opening
and he was a little pissed off.

306
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,470
I'm so sorry, I thought
when everything was done

307
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,513
and taken care of
that we could have a drink.

308
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,599
'You had responsibilities
that night.'

309
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,144
I can't have you
visibly, like, intoxicated

310
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,229
drunk in front of my partner.

311
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,566
We were working so hard all
night and everything was fine.

312
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,318
And so I thought
that it would be okay.

313
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,819
Then he said
your, your boyfriend was there.

314
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,530
- Mm-hm.
- That's not okay.

315
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,032
To have your boyfriend there,
if he influences you

316
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,660
in a bad way at the workplace

317
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,412
then that's something
you need to sort out, okay?

318
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,790
- But, Brent, I...
- Hold on.

319
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,042
I put a lot of faith in you and
I fight for you all the time.

320
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,797
And I'm a little disappointed.

321
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,215
So I don't really
have much of a choice.

322
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,218
Get your, get your bag,
get your stuff.

323
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,680

325
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,727

00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,731
- Hi.
- Hey.

338
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,607
You okay? You overwhelmed?

339
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,527
I'm trying to, like,
there's so much stuff to pack.

340
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,487
- Oh, my gosh.
- 'I know.'

341
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,864
- Um...
- Wanna help?

342
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,741
Yeah. What do you want me to do?

343
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,534
There's a box right there,
just start

344
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,452
putting stuff in it
or wrapping, or...

345
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,329
Okay.

346
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,955
- Do you want this wrapped?
- 'Yes.'

347
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,624
- Alright.
- 'Thank you.'

348
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,334
No worries.

349
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:22,213
We did a lot of stuff
in the past two years.

350
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,298
I'm gonna miss
my partner in crime.

351
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,843
Who you gonna cry
about with at your house?

352
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,720
I'll just call you.

353
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,638
I'll always come cry with you
on your kitchen floor.

354
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,849
Okay.

355
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,142
I can't believe you're moving.
That happened really fast.

356
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,561
I know it did.

357
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,403
- Who's that?
- Justin.

358
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,239
'Did I, did I ever
show you this picture?'

359
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,032
No. Where's this from?

360
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,787
- We went to dinner somewhere.
- You look pretty there.

361
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,623
It's a cute picture.
He's actually smiling in it.

362
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,208
I know.
Wow, you captured a moment.

363
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,629
I know. I had to frame it.

364
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,255
- Where is he?
- I don't...

365
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,341
I think he's working
or something.

366
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,219
I figured once I get
everything to the house

367
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,805
I'll make him come and help.

368
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,139
You gotta.

369
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,602
All the time, like, I feel
like you've been there

370
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,271
so much for me
with the whole Justin thing.

371
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,856
All the big stuff,
I just know for me

372
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,608
that I've had to go through

373
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,778
it's been, like, it's been nice
to have someone there.

374
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,864
I feel like every time something

375
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,992
went wrong with Justin,
you know, we were together.

376
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,579
But it was the same way
with me where, whether it was

377
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,206
me dealing with, like,
you know, getting over

378
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,628
the whole, like, Heidi
situation or any of the guys.

379
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,338
But I feel like it's really
important to always have

380
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,173
someone there, and it's just,
over the last two years

381
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,968
you've kind of been that person.

382
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,637
And you've been
that person to me too.

383
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,973
It's not the end of the story,
it's just a to-be-continued.

384
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,475
It's just to be continued, yes.

385
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,231
Well...

386
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,238
I love you.
I'm really proud of you.

387
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,157
