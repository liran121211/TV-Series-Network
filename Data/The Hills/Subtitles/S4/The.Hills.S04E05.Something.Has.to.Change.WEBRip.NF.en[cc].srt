172
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,136
'who, apparently,
is their new big signing.'

173
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,140
And, also, Whitney, I know you
want to do more styling stuff.

174
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,476
There's gonna be an opportunity
for somebody to style Gaga.

175
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,061
'And she's gonna be the star
of the night.'

176
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,396
'So I think you should do it.'

177
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,897
If there's something
that you're feeling that

178
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,649
she should be doing
and wearing and the way that...

179
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,192
I'd rather have you do it
than the client.

180
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,278
- Okay. Yeah.
- 'Okay?'

181
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,695
Lauren, I'm really gonna
need you to help

182
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,072
Whitney with this event.

183
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm gonna be back in New York
that night.

and I'm not here all the time.

But I haven't talked
to my sister

203
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,418
and I'm really worried
about her.

204
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,087
I had plans with her.
She hasn't called me all day.

205
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,673
Maybe she was in a tunnel.

206
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,009
I go places where I don't have
service for five hours.

207

Did you say anything to her?

208
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,391
For you, it's been an hour.
You've seen her an hour.

209
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,269
I've seen her
for 48 hours straight.

210
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,812
So, what did you say to her?

211
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,440
I probably said something
about her moving out

212
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,861
and how we both probably
wanted her moving out.

213
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,030
Do you just not think about
anyone but yourself?

214
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,949

the weirdest trip'

in Vegas I've ever had.

225
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,898
It was weird, the next day,
how everyone was missing.

226
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,359
The boys and Audrina.
She was missing all day.

227
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,944
She was in the whole trip.

228
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,405

since we've been back?

we need to talk.'

hang out with other people,

you didn't want me here anymore

just talk to me about it?

00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,366
Well, I felt the exact same way.

342
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,950
I just, whenever
I would hang out with you

343
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,578
sometimes
you had a bad attitude

344
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,913
or it was like you weren't
listening to what I was saying.

345
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,082
How so? Like, I don't understand
how I did that...

346
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,542
Maybe you didn't realize
you did.

347
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,210
Then why wouldn't you say
something to me?

348
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,211
Be like, "Lauren,
it hurts my feelings."

349
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,171
- I have in the past.
- 'When?'

350
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,382
The night you came into my room
and sat on the couch.

351
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,426
Yes, the night
when I came into your room

352
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,220
because you wouldn't
even talk to me.

353
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,390
I just feel like I never stopped
trying to be your friend

354
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,017
and you just lost interest,
you just didn't care.

355
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,853
I call you...
When is the last time

356
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,187
you called me and said...

357
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,313
When was the last time
you called me?

358
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,274
- Last week I called you!
- Really?

359
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,192
I said, "We're going out
to Teddy's. You want to come?"

360
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,903
'Two weeks ago,
I had a bunch of people over.'

361
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,487
We were cooking dinner.

362
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,239
I walked out, invited you
and said "Hey, we're cooking."

363
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,783
- "You want to come up?"
- My sister was here.

364
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,325
We went to the Thrice concert.
I had tickets.

365
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,202
Okay, this is my point,
is that I'm always inviting you.

366
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,662
When is the last time
you called me and said

367
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,289
"Hey, Lauren, do you want
to do something?"

368
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,749
You don't like to do anything
I do.

369
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,792
You don't like going to shows.

370
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,834
You don't like any of that.

371
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,627
I go for you, though!

372
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,920
I go, I sit.

373
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
I'm awkwardly bobbing

374
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,297
my head at the weird shows

375
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,298
but it's just because
we're friends.

376
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,217
I do it for you.
We're friends.

377
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,761
Like, I want to hang out
with my friends

378
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,971
and I'm trying so hard.

379
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,934
Like, the worst part is, like,
at the end of the day

380
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,560
like, you were
one of my best friends

381
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,020
and I feel like
I've completely lost that.

382
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,982
'I've lost another friend.'

383
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,025
[sniffling]
I'm so, just, like, tired

384
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,444
of trying to make
you be my friend

385
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,821
and I don't know what to do
anymore.

386
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,656
- Like, I feel pathetic.
- I don't...

387
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,742
See, this is so frustrating.
Like, I don't know.

388
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,128
This whole situation just sucks.

389
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,839
I don't know
what do you want me to do?

390
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,340
'I don't know
what to do either.'

391
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,592
I don't want to just be like,
"Fine."

392
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,177
You think that I don't want...

393
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,846
Do you think I'm not trying
right now, Lauren?

394
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,681
Right now!

395
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,433
Okay, so, what about the past?
You wanna keep bringing that up?

396
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,769
Like, you can't start
and keep dwelling on that.

397
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,188
You have to start from now.
Fresh start. Move forward.

398
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,526
If you really,
really want to say, like

399
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,695
"Let's go back.
Let the past be the past."

400
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,781
'That would make me so happy
because that's all I want.'

401
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,032
That's all I want.

402
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,999
Is that really
what you want, though?

403
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,170
It's like everyone doesn't want
us to be friends, you know?

404
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,011
All I want is for you
to just be my friend again.

405
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,137
Okay, then let's do it.
