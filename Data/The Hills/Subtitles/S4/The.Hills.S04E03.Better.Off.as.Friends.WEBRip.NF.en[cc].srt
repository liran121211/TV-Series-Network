1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,172
I'm going to New York tomorrow.

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,424
- Oh, wow. Quick.
- It's, like, right away.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,926
I mean, that's how Kelly works,
you know.

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,093
When she wants you,
she wants you

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,595
and you just gotta do it.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,555
'I don't even know how long
I'm supposed to be there for.'

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,765
So it's a little nerve-racking.

8
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:15,766
I don't really know exactly

9
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:16,809
what to plan for.

10
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,018
Just pack lots of black.

11
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,812
Pack lots of black. Exactly.

12
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,146
You'll do fine. It'll be good.

13
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,606
'Okay, so,
let's talk about Doug.'

14
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,774
What's going on with him?

15
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,484
There's no juicy details.

16
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,821
You don't sound too
enthusiastic about it.

17
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,614
Are you over it?

18
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,157
I don't wanna say I'm over it.

19
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,284
But you're just not
super-excited about it.

20
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,203
That's okay.
You can't force these things.

21
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,205
The thing is,
I think... I just remembered

22
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,374
liking him a lot more,
like, when I was younger

23
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,041
and, like,
I think I thought I would just

24
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,378
hop right back into it but, like

25
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,630
I feel like I'm kind of
leading him on a little bit.

26
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,340
It's just not happening.

27
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,967
The latest person
I can even compare him to

28
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,510
is, like, Brody, and, like

29
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,888
I remember being so
excited, like, about...

30
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,305
When you first
started seeing Brody.

31
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,432
It's just not,
it's not there for Doug.

32
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,934
To be perfectly honest

33
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,644
if you're not
excited about him...

34
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,896
Put it to an end?

35
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,480
If that's what you want.

36
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,273
I just don't wanna have
the conversation.

37
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,442
You just say,
"I really, really like you.

38
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,987
"I just think
things are moving too fast

39
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,197
'"and it's just a little
much for me right now.'

40
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,825
And it's nothing about you.
It's just timing."

41
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,744

68

Good. I'm just here
to see Kelly.

69
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,455

72
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,339
Nothing.
I came right from my flight.

73
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,173
Was there
a lot of traffic, or...

74
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,926
- No. Just came right here.
- Where are your bags?

75
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,176
They're dropped off
at my hotel.

76
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,679
Okay, I'm a little crazed

going on upstairs.

78
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,683
If you can maybe help with some
of the styling and the casting.

00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,392

try on these clothes

00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,916
Thank God you're here.
We need some help.

93
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,169
We need to pull some items
for them to wear.

94
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,920
- Okay.
- Whoa.

95
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,672

96
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,465
- Okay.
- Can you come over here?

97
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,425
- A jacket, or a t-shirt?
- You can do, like, a jacket.

98
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,386
Maybe you can do a t-shirt,
which would be good.

99
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,805
- Maybe something like that.
- Something like this? Okay.

100
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,683
This is Alex. You're looking
very casual today.

101
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,227
Alright, let's get you
in some clothes.

102
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,354
Maybe in, like,
some jeans and a t-shirt.

103
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,107
Okay. Thanks.

104
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,026
(Kelly)
'Okay. Come back in a minute.'

105
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,610
[exhales]
Okay.

106
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,655
'Do you want to
go forward and walk?'

107
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,824
And then just walk, mark
and return.

108
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,203
- He's cute.
- Hmm.

109
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,121
- 'Where are you from?'
- California.

110
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,664
- Where?
- That's a state. What city?

111
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,791
From Fresno. I went to USC.

112
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,001
I went to USC.

113
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,878
- 'Yeah?'
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,255
- What house were you in?
- I wasn't in a sorority.

115
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,841
- I was in sigma beta.
- 'You were a frat boy?'

116
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,676
Did you graduate when?

117
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,428
I graduated from Columbia,
actually. I transferred.

118
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,013
Oh, okay.

119
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,557
From Columbia? Okay.

120
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,102
Can we just take one of you
without your shirt on?

121
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,020
You have a nice body.

122
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,439
'But you know that already.
What are you doing later?'

123
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,067
There's a little event
I'm going to for...

124
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,111
It's a launch event for Kobe
in the Hamptons.

125
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,154
(Kelly)
'Why don't you come by and have
drinks with us tonight?'

126
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,864
We're gonna take
a couple of girls out.

127
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,449
- Are you up for that?
- Yeah. Alright, cool.

128
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,409
'Come by and
have a drink with us.'

129
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,661
- Don't act embarrassed.
- No. I'm shy.

130
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,247
No. I'm back and forth.

131
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,456
But, yeah.

132
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,917
8:45 sharp, okay?

It's a distant memory for me.

254
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,585
- How long were you there for?
- I was there for a year.

255
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,171

what I wanted to do and I felt

like going to school at Columbia
would open more doors.

345
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,786
had her eye on him for me.

346
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,373
She said to this guy, "Why don't
you come meet us tonight?"

347
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,626
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
Oh, my God."

348
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,295
I was like, "Kelly, do I scream
lonely, or something?"

349
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,464
Like, "Do you think
I need a guy?"

350
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,966
So, we were gonna meet
for drinks at my hotel

351
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,260
and I get a call from Kelly,
and she's like

352
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,137
"Robin and I aren't gonna be
able to make it."

353
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,557
I was like, "Are you serious?"

354
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,058
Like, I was...

355
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,935
So, it's just me
and this guy, Alex

356
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,772
sitting there at this hotel,
like, total date-style.

357
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,898
- Was it good, or was it awful?
- It wasn't awful.

358
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,066
Well, that's good!

359
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,110
We-we sat and talked
for a little while.

360
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,613
He took me on, like, a little
walk around Soho afterwards.

361
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,698
Stop it. That's cute.
But do you like him at all?

362
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,534
Yeah, I think so.

363
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,369
- How have you been?
- Good.

364
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,621
Good?

365
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,665
Did you end it with Doug?

366
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,833
Well, I've kind of been
avoiding him.

367
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,836
It's hard, but it's better
not to string him along.

368
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,255
'Yeah, I'm gonna
talk to him today.'

369

It's not a problem. It's good.

to pick the wrong guy.'
