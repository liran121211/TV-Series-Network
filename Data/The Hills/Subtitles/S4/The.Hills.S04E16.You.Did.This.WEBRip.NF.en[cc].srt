What was it?

9
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,186
This guy Dino, who
I've known for two years

10
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,981
and... one of Justin's
close friends,

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,231
was like, "There's
something that, like,

12
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,441
"I need to get off
my conscience.

What is it?

15
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,279
Basically that Lauren
and Justin hooked up.

16
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,699
[gasps] Oh, my God.
Have you talked to Lauren?

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,325
Right when I found out,
I called Lauren

18
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,702
and she's like, "What are
you talking about?

19
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,286
You know I would
never do that."

20
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,872
And then she hung up on me,

21
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,623
and then she texted me with

22
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,876

would say something like that.

23
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,126
You know I'm not
that person."

24
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,753
I mean, I was in shock.
Do you think she did it?

25
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:45,921
I was in shock,

26
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,172
I didn't know what
to believe, you know.

27

Have you talked to Justin?

28
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,634
Justin can't even give me
the respect of calling me

29
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,012
and tell me that
this never happened.

30

I don't know what to think.
I don't know what to do.

But you weren't there.
You didn't see it.

You don't know for a fact
if it happened.

33
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,852

to the bottom of this.

181

Hey.

193
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,363
Whatcha doin'?

194
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,407
Uh, just working.

195
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
What are you doing?

196
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,911
I thought you had an office.

197
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,955
Um, that used to be my office

198
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,498
and now I'm here
because I got...

199
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,668
I ran into a little trouble
at XIV the other week.

200
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,504
It's a long story.
I don't wanna go into it.

201
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,174
I'm sorry.
Do you have a minute or...

202
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,177
Yeah, but I don't think
we should really talk in here.

203
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,470
So maybe we can
just go in there?

204
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,721
Okay, yeah.

205
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,432
Okay.

206
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,482
So...

207
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,444
It's good
to finally see you.

208
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,363
You know, I was really hurt
by the whole situation.

209
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,658
I've never felt
so unwelcome and unwanted.

210
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,493
I feel like I've done
nothing but try to be

211
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,370
the best sister
I possibly can be to you.

212
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,997
And then I hear
from Stephanie

213
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,292
that you're living with
Lauren, or whatever and...

214
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,002
Do you know how badly
that hurts me?

215
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,711
Lauren was my best friend,

216
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,964
who I've gone
through so much with

217
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,632
and obviously I miss her.

218
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,635
I don't really feel like
I was left with an alternative.

219
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,971
You told me I could
stay there, and I did and...

220
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,306
And I let you stay there

221
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,599
but I didn't think
you would stay that long.

222
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,143
Honestly, my...

223
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,061
issue has nothing
to do with you.

224
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,688
It's just Spencer.

225
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,523
I feel like,
if you have somebody

226
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,608
that loves you so much,

227
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,695
then they want every part
of your life to be great.

228
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,864
I mean, he's been doing nothing
but push everybody away,

229
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,032
push all your friends away.

230
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,283
No, he doesn't.

231
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,160

I came by the other day?

Hi.

240
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,527
- AUDRINA:
How are you?

241
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,694
Been better.

242
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,238
Me too.

243
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,785
Well...

244
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,787
Hmm?

245
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,665
Let's talk about
you and Lauren.

246
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,167
Me and Lauren.

247
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,002
Well, what is there
to talk about?

248
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,717
Did you do it or not?

249
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,469
You think after all this,

250
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,221
I would run and hook up
with Lauren?

251
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,597
You really do?

252
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,224
There are little things
that kept popping in my mind

253
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,934
and when Dino was
so sincere about it.

254
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,270
I told you, no,
it didn't happen.

255
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,479
And if you don't
wanna believe me

256
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,731
then I don't know
what else to tell you.

257
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
But you can't talk to me
the way you... you talk to me.

258
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,360
That's for one...
I know, but...

259
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,070
No, you don't know.
Yes, I do know.

260
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,072
Because I would never talk
to you the way you talk to me.

261
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,074
Justin, when I called you
a whole bunch of times,

262
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,742
you don't answer or text me back

263
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,286
when I did text you back nicely.

264
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,246
Yeah, but some
of the things you say,

265
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,539
I truly would
never say to you.

266
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,791
"You [bleep] I
[bleep] hate you.

267
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,000
You [bleep] use me."
All that...

268
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,336
After you don't call me back
or text me back.

269
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,588
Why would I
wanna talk to you

270
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,880
after all the [bleep]
you were saying to me?

271
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,673
Justin, this was a huge rumor.
Lauren...

272
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,342
I don't wanna hear
it, Audrina.

273
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,053
I will [bleep] leave right now
because this is [bleep].

274
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,180
How would you feel if you heard
something like that, Justin?

275
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,432
You know what?
I'm not even...

276
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,724
You wouldn't even call.

277
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,934
Exactly, I'm not even
gonna deal with it

278
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,227
because I find it
so immature.

279
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,604
I didn't even wanna
talk to you at all.

280
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,564
All I did was ask you.
I talked to Lauren about it.

281
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,856
All I wanted was an answer...

282
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,150
You talked
to Lauren about it?

283
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,485
Okay,

284
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,693
and what happened when you
talked to Lauren?

285
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,903
Your best friend.
She said no.

286
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,280
She said no. Okay.

287
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,365
She said no.
I wanted to talk to you.

288
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,575
I wanted to talk to you first.

289
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,035
I called her and you
at the same time.

290
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,413
You're pleading like you're
so innocent about this.

291
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,956
And it's not
only you, Audrina.

292
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,374
It's affected all of us.

293
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,466
It's like, I kind of lost
Lauren over it.

294
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,050
Yeah, that's great.

295
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,219
I don't know what's
gonna happen with us.

296
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,638
You know what?
I got to go, dude.

297
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,473
This is so stupid.

298
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,765
You put something
in your head,

299
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,142
and you think that
you really believe it,

300
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,186
when it's really fictitious.

301
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,812

Hi.

309
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,682
Hey, you.
I need coffee ASAP.

310

So, other than that...

311
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,309
What else is new?

312
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,852
I feel like I haven't
really talked to you

313
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,146
about the Audrina thing,
which is not really fun.

314
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,315
I kind of know a little bit.

315
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,984
No way.

316
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,861
I got a text
from Audrina.

317
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,821
Wow, that's amazing.

318
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,115
So what's, like...

319
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,325
your story?

320
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,868
I tried to talk to her
at my house.

321
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,412
She walked out, and...

322
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,746
it was like the most
awful conversation ever.

323
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,249
She wouldn't talk to me,
and I was like,

324
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,458
"You're crazy."

325
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,834
I was so mad at her,

326
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,211
that after knowing
me for years,

327
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,172
she still would
so quickly believe that.

328
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,841
That's because, like,
Justin, like, has hooked up

329
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,510
with Audrina's friends.

330
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,969
But me?

331
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,930
That's the part that sucks.

332
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,182
What did I do
not to be trusted?

333
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,059
After she moved out,
this happened?

334
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,981
It's just sad because we were
getting along really well.

335
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,858

336
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,277

We're supposed to meet
tonight at Winston's.

338

But to be honest,

339
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,117
I don't think this is something
we're gonna come back from.

340
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,327
But, you can't let
that happen with Audrina.

00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,071
It's not like how it was before.

What, pre-party animal?

356
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,576
Yeah,
so I lost my office

357
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,869
and now I just have,
like, a little cubicle.

358
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,623
Oh, yeah,
it's really funny.

wanna talk about it.

How was your day?

363
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,757
Quite eventful.

Yeah.

I was, like, shaking, so mad.

on her face,

387

she was looking at me
like I was hurting her.

388

I couldn't even stand
there and talk to her

389

395

Because she's all upset

396
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,285
that you accused her of it.

397
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,913
I didn't necessarily
accuse her of it.

398
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,956
But obviously I have to ask.
