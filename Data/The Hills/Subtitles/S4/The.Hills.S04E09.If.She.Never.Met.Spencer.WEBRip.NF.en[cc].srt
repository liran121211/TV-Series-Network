1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,129
(Lauren)
'Thanks for helping me
with my homework.'

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,256
Mm-hm. Got more?

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,968
Yeah, I got more where
this came from, too, so...

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,470
Hey, have you seen much
of Stephanie lately?

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,096
'No, not really.'

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,473
So do you have plans
already for tonight?

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,599
No, not tonight.

8
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,267
Um, if you wanna go

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,895
I think I'm gonna go to, um

10
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,939
S Bar to go meet Holly
for a drink.

11
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,316
- Is she living here now?
- Yeah, she moved here.

12
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,861
- 'She's staying with Heidi.'
- Oh, really?

13
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,487
She's still kind
of getting settled

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,238
like, getting to know
people and stuff.

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,740
- Yeah, definitely.
- She actually mentioned.

16
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,784
She's, like,
Heidi said it was fine.

17
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,161
- 'Mm-hm.'
- But it's, like...

18
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,705
I'm worried
she's trying to play, like

19
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,165
matchmaker with me
and her sister.

20
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,002
I understand your position,
like, it is awkward.

21
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,712
But I don't wanna turn away,
you know

22
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,797

23
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,675

'I have a date
with this guy, Colin.'

32
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,033
He's really nice,
I've seen him around for a year

33
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,410
but I've just never really
thought anything of it.

34
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,871
And he asked me out on a date
to go to dinner.

35
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,248
That's good. That's great.

36
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,376
I don't know. I haven't
told Justin, so whatever.

37
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,336
- You don't have to.
- He doesn't tell me who he's...

38
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,171
'Yeah, exactly.'

39
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,382
Are you kind of hoping
this will make him jealous?

40
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,927
Well, maybe a little. I mean, I
don't have a ring on my finger.

41
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,929

(Holly)
'I'm seeing her again tonight.'

48
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,327
She seems really happy.

49
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,830
She said, basically,
she hasn't been so happy

50
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,041
since a couple of years ago.

51
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,376
It seemed like
she was missing you.

52
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,004
Obviously, hearing
from you all the things

53
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,091
and you guys catching up,
like, you don't think I wanna be

54
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,675
catching up with her
and hearing about

55
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,261
how her life has been
for the past two years?

56
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,472
That was my best friend,
and now I'm the only one

57
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,390
who can't talk to her
because of something

58
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,642
I had nothing to do with?

59
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,187
I think it's hard, too,
because I think Lauren thinks

60
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,649
she was the only one
hurt in this, you know?

61
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,985
I've been the one on my own
and to lose my best friend

62
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,028
and to lose all my friends.

63
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,405
'You know,
it's just been so hard.'

64
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,118
Well, I know you talked about
giving her, like, a letter.

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,079
Do you still think
about that at all?

66
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,664
I mean, maybe I will
write her a letter

67
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,166
but I just don't think
she'll read it.

68
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,335
'When it comes
to your friendship'

69
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,505
she knows who you are,
she knows your heart.

70
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,882
Maybe she just forgot.

71
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,593

to be reminded.

Thank you.

79
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,746
So you used to work at Saddle
Ranch. You ever ride the bull?

80
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,623
That was my first job in town
when I first moved to town.

81
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,583
I was the bull operator.

82
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,005
So how did you get into,
um, what, is it Sony?

83
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,007
I just always, I went to shows

84
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,925
since I was,
like, 15 and a half.

85
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,593
As soon as I got my permit,
I was, like

86
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,388
I'd go every night to shows.

87
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,349
And I just... All my
connections, I just love music.

88
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,393
I've always been into music
also, but I've never, like

89
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,854
I've never pursued it
for a career.

90
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,273
It's, like, fun for me. It's not
like work. It's hanging out...

91
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,234
Of course, it's an ideal

92
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,070
it's an ideal job
if you like music.

93
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,197
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

94
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,490
Cheers.

95
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,826
This one's kinda strong.

96
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,745
I know, like, exes
that I went with they

97
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,372
like, drink too much and
it causes fights all the time.

98
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,290
- Oh, I'm the happiest drunk...
- Really?

99
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,626
Yeah, I love everybody
when I'm drunk.

100
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,794
Like Justin.

101
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,504
It's, just, whenever he drinks

102
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,215
we get in, like, fights.

103
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,633
He just, like,
gets this cocky attitude.

104
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,344
- It's like...
- I'm not that way at all.

105
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,848
- I get, like, a bigger smile.
- Happy.

106
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,726
- You're a happy drunk.
- I'm like the happiest drunk.

107
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,061
That's how I am.
I'm like that.

108
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,188
Oh, yeah?
You have beautiful eyes.

109
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,439
Thank you.

110
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,274
I was gonna see if you wanted

111
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,859

again or something.

112

Drinks, maybe tomorrow night.

113
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,904

- I don't know.

114
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,239

I love your shirt.

Yeah, can I get another one?
It was so good.

Perfect. Thank you.

133
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,702
When I met you at Joel's

134
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,454
were you living in LA
then or just visiting?

135
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,916
Yeah, no, I was living
with, uh, Lauren and then Heidi.

136
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,668
How long did we share a bed for?

137
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,670
Like, in that loft?

138
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,046
On the air mattress?

139
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,465
- Didn't it, like, pop?
- Yeah.

140
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,967
(Lo)
'I haven't seen her
in a long time'

141
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,177
but you remind me
so much of her.

142
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,928
So, you like, her and I grew

143
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,345
pretty far apart, you know?

144
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,765
And, uh,
these last couple years

145
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,809
it's just so hard
to get a hold of her.

146
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,728
'Like, right when I moved back,
that's when everything changed.'

147
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,564
And it was, like,
she started dating Spencer.

148
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,026
'It was hard.
We all kind of do that.'

149
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,528
'We drift away
from who we really are.'

150
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,655
And, like, in these
last couple weeks

151
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,406
she's even been
the one saying it.

152
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,284
'She's been talking
about old times'

153
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,162
'and she really misses you
in her life.'

154
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,122
I mean,
it's water under the bridge.

155
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,124
It's just done
and things have happened

156
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,084
and it's changed
the situation, you know?

157
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,756
You remind me so much
of Heidi, like

158
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,800

like, your mannerisms.

159

00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,092
Pulled my chair out,
opened the door.

348
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,053
You got a winner, dude.

349
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,806
- He was nice.
- Yeah?

350
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,601
Nice is good.
Nice gets you far.

351
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,479
It went so far, he's not here.

352
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,774
'I wish I would have met
the old nice chap.'

353
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,151
You're dating too.

354
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,529
Can I do that?
Will that make you mad?

355
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,698
No?

356
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,324
I mean, have you put
a lot of thought into this?

357
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,034
Have you really
thought about it?

358
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,039
There's ways to go
about things, you know?

359
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,625
Maturely.

360
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,753
And maybe immaturely sometimes.

361
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,007
You're a heartbreaker.

362
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,511
Things change.

363
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,972
Not for long.

367
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,697
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

368
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,991
Looking at pictures from
when mom was here and stuff.

369
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:56,289
You know, I saw
Lauren the other night.

370
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,917
Talked about that letter
you gave her.

371
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,919
Yeah? What did she say?

372
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,838
She said that she missed you

373
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,258
and that there's a big part
of her that's really sad

374
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,719
that you guys can't
be friends again.

375
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,306
But that's what she's saying.
That's how she feels, you know?

376
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,516
She's making it that way,
you know?

377
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,686
If she came up to me and was
like, "Look, I got your letter."

378
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:23,065
"Things have happened. Let's
move on. Let's be friends."

379
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,985
'You know, I would
be okay to do whatever.'

380
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,403
Because, obviously, I miss her

381
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,030
and, you know,
that was my best friend.

382
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,784
So maybe it's one step closer.

383
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,786
Yeah, I really think so.

384
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,204
I think that you and Lauren
can be friends again after...

385
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,041
Hello.

386
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,044
What are you doing?

387
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,630
Why are we discussing her?

388
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,008
Well, we were talking
about the letter

389
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,927
'that Heidi wrote to Lauren.'

390
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:57,224
I just wrote a letter
saying, you know

391
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,059
'I'm sorry
how everything's happened'

392
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,187
'and wish you the best.'

393
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,523
And maybe one day
we can be friends

394
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,149
and maybe not, you know?

395
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,987
So now since Holly moves in

396
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,947
you start keeping
secrets from me?

397
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,156
It's not a secret.

398
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,366
When you don't tell somebody

399
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,575
something, that's a secret.

400
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,785
It's not her fault if she feels

401
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,453
like she can't talk to you.

402
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,830
Who's talking to you
is what I wanna know.

403
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm her family.

404
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,082
- Shh.
- Spencer!

405
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,670
He's the reason why you and
Lauren can't be friends again.

406
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,129
He's not the reason.

407
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,965
She said it straight up,
it won't happen

408
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,091
as long as you and Spencer
are together.

409
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,679
'That's what Lauren said.'

410
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,556
Either way,
I'll take credit for that.

411
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,474
I think it's great
that you guys aren't friends

412
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,934
'so it's a win-win.'

413
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,728
If it's her fault or my fault

414
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,521
it's great that you do not
have her in your life.

415
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,606
So she's not gonna
be friends with you...

416
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,818
- That's not the point.
- For as long as we're together.

417
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,486
So what's the point?

418
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,321
(Holly)
'The point is,
there's still a chance.'

419
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,574
And especially since
it doesn't involve you

420
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,367
it sounds like a great option.

421
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,041
Oh, let go, my dear, let go.

422
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,296
