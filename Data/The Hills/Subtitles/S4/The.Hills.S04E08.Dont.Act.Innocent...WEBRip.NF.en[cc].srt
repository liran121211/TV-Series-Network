00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,507
When did you get back
from Italy?

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,843
I got back a few days ago.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,385
Did you miss anything?

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,054
Um, Steph and Doug went out
to dinner.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,933
- Stephanie Pratt and Doug?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,601
And that's the guy you dated?

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,269
- Oh!
- 'That's a little shady.'

to me was that she, like'

10
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,064
called Audrina
and was like, what do I do?

11
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,942
And like, if you're having
to question it

12
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,735
so much, like,
then it's not worth it.

13
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,863
Well, I just think
it's strange because

14
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,823
it's already hard enough
for you to trust her.

15
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,158
(Lauren)
'Yeah, I'm just gonna see
what she has to say.'

Listen, if you guys,
if you're, if you're friends

17

you don't go out with an ex

of approval.

Oh, my God! So good to see you!

- Hello, how are you, Darlene?

- Good, how are you doing?
- How excited are you?

'Anyways, what do you
wanna do while you're here?'

80
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,244
I was just kind of hoping
to be able to spend some time

81
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,957
with you and catch up
and see what's been going on.

00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,836
- Well, Spencer's here.
- Mm-hmm.

she didn't know that?

(Heidi)
'No, I, you know,
I haven't really seen you'

85

and I wasn't gonna just
tell you over the phone.

86
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,887
Well, Heids,
I'm disappointed that

87
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,638
I had to find out from Holly

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,183
that you and Spencer
are living together.

for me to, like'

hide, not hide this,
but have not told you yet?

91
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,979
Why did you feel
like you couldn't tell me?

92
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,190
Because I just
didn't want you judging me.

93
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,774
I would have appreciated
having this conversation

94
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,651

keep it a secret?

Spencer well enough.

00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,167
She was, like,
out of her mind in Vegas

173
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,044
and I felt bad and she was,
like, hitting me up

174
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,963
'on BBM since we got back.'

175
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,173
Bottom line is I wanted
to be friends with her

176
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,258
she blew it
out of proportion saying

177
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,052
come over late night,
watch movies.

178
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,720
Lauren already knows.
Lauren's tripping.

179
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,389
I mean, at the end of the day

180
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,266
Lauren broke up with me,
you know what I mean?

181
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,059
Is Stephanie coming
to the party tomorrow?

182
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,312
Stephanie's coming,
Lauren's coming.

183
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,023
I'm-I'm just hoping
you don't make her cry.

184
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,110
If she cries, she cries.
It's not my fault.

189
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,793
Let's sit right out here.

190
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,302
I'm sure you got a couple
things on your mind.

191
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,348
It was nice of you guys
to let Holly stay with you

192
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,891
for a little while,
till she gets on her feet.

193
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,726
It's nice of Heidi.

194
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,897
I really, to be honest,
wasn't too fond of the idea.

195
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,316
She's just staying there
for a little bit.

196
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,067
Isn't it her intention
to get her own place?

197
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
- No.
- Yes, it is.

198
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,821
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

199
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,614
Her intention is
to get me out of there

200
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,325
and to live just with Heidi.

201
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,576
Well, maybe that's not
such a bad idea.

202
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,704
What planet are you living on?

203
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,998
That's a horrible idea.

204
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,375
Why do you guys feel
like you need

205
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,836
to live together so soon
in your relationship?

206
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,214
Because why not?

207
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,383
I just wonder if you're
pressuring her into doing

208
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,427
something that she might
not be ready for.

209
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,721
One main thing I love about
Heidi is that she doesn't feel

210
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,392
the need to call her mom
in Crested Butte to get approval

211
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,894
of living with somebody
in a different state.

212
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,981
Maybe she was just afraid
that of what we would say.

213
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,359
And maybe she's afraid
she didn't care anymore

214
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,277
and she didn't wanna
be in that place

215
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
where you're telling her
something and she's not

216
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,199
listening and then
that creates a problem.

217
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,242
No?

218
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,329
I don't know, I think

219
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,165
you're very controlling
and manipulative.

220
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,210
Oh, is that what you think
from Crested Butte?

221
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,004
I'm not looking to grill you

222
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,383
and try to make you
uncomfortable.

223
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,135
I don't get uncomfortable,
my dear.

224
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,137
I think you're condescending

225
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,016
rude and very hostile right now.

226
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,103
I think you're totally
taking this the wrong way

227
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,439

wrong in my opinion.

257
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,911

00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,540
I don't even have
anything to say.

00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,792
- Nothing?
- You're really mean to me.

260
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,086
Stephanie, you have
to understand something.

261
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,754
I was right all along.

262
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,714
'Alright, I told Lauren
not to trust you.'

263
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,593
Listen, I saw all the text
messages you sent to Doug.

264
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,387
Like, come over and watch
a movie late night.

265
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,138
- I know what you were doing.
- I never did that.

266
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,848
How much you wanna bet?
How much you wanna bet?

267
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,017
I saw them. Doug's
one of my best friends.

268
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,228
You really think
I was trying to date him?

269
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,064
I know for 100% fact that
you were telling him

270
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,066
late night to come over
and watch a movie.

271
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,485
And I'm sorry, like,
yes, I know there was

272
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,820
something shady behind that,
and you can sit here and go

273
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,657
"I wasn't doing anything,"
Yeah, right.

274
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,159
- You and I both know.
- I really was not.

275
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,869
But listen, I'm not gonna
talk about that.

276
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,288
You can live, listen,
you can live your life however

277
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,416
with you, live your
life however you want

278
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,668
just don't pretend to be
innocent when you're not.

279
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,587
It's like that's
so obnoxious and annoying.

280
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,132
It's so awkward. Why would he
yell at her at a time like this?

281
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,758
It's so inappropriate.

282
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,847
If you leave, can you take me?
I didn't drive here.

283
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,725
I'm-I'm totally serious.

284
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,184
Totally serious.

285
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,353
I'll walk. I'm not that far.
Down there.

286
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,063
It may take me, like, an hour.
It's worth it.

287
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,607
I'm totally wearing
a sheer dress

288
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,525

and balancing Spencer,
and Holly, and...

felt like you couldn't
tell me that.

306
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,032
I thought I owed it
to myself and to Spencer

307
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,825

I took most of all,
not even my own.

312
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,753
And now you're just
listening to Spencer

313
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,588
and now you're going
from one to the other.

314
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,465
This is my life, you know.

315
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,967
And I wanna be able to make
decisions for myself.

316
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,136
Well, at lunch,
Spencer was really rude

317
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,013
and condescending to me.

318
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,431
I'm sorry. What did he say?
What happened?

319
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,016

a little more respect.

321
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,561
I think that's disrespectful,
you know

322
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,647
maybe he doesn't want you to be
as close to your family.

323
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,023
Please don't be silly.

324
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,941
I'm trying to explain
how I felt.

325
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,486
That's why I didn't tell because
right here you're judging...

00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,293
Lauren's back being all shady
with the whole Doug thing

341
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,961
and she's just sitting there
trying to play like

342
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,297
"Oh, I'm so innocent,
I'm not doing anything wrong."

343
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,716
What?

344
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,133
You know, 'cause you
showed me the text.

345
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,510
You were like, ha ha, look.

346
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,887
I just can't believe
this is an issue.

347
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,680
What are you talking about?

348
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,600
So I can't go have dinner with
another girl if we're friends?

349
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,727
No, no, no, dinner
with a friend is maybe like

350
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,520
"Let's go to Jerry's deli
and grab some food."

351
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,105
I wasn't trying
to hook up with her.

352
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,690
I wasn't trying to date her,
I was trying

353
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,692
'to help the girl out
because she was lost.'

354
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,820
She's like a lost puppy. I
wanted nothing to do with her.

355
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,322
I want nothing to do with her.
I don't, that's it.

356
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,241
But you know what's really
funny is for someone who

357
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,826
really feels like they did
nothing wrong

358
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,412
you've spent a really
a long time defending it.

359
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,789
Like, that's all
I've heard is like

360
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,331
you and Stephanie
have been like, oh.

361
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,333
(Doug)
'If I was taking her out
and going in public'

362
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,085
'with her other than that,
yeah.'

363
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,129
In public, you took her out.
You went in public with her.

364
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,133
No, I didn't. I went to dinner
and then, dude.

365
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,260
And then what?
What else went on?

366
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,554
'No, I went to dinner
and that was it.'

367
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,306
Two dinners?

368
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,559
It wasn't, we did not have
two dinners. No, we didn't.

369
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,771
- 'Coffee then.'
- Oh, you had coffee too?

370
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,149
Who cares? I had coffee,
dinner, whatever it was.

371
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,778
Okay. It's, like,
really common sense.

372
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,112
You're like my ex-fling.

373
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,073
I mean, wh-wh-what is that?

374
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,702
- Fling?
- And that's when I leave.

375
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,204
I-I-I-I don't feel like
I did anything wrong here.

376
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,165
At the end of the day,
you should have just

377
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,000
not gone to dinner
like we told you.

378
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,419
(Brody)
'I found out from my mom,
because you lied to the homies'

379
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,171
'and said you weren't gonna go
to dinner with Stephanie.'

380
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,923
I don't care about that!

381
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,049
You're acting like you guys
have been friends for years.

382
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
Everyone can be mad at me.

383
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,679
At the end of the day,
I did nothing wrong

384
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,888
'and that's all I'm saying.'

385
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,306
- Are you okay?
- 'What?'

386
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,057
Are you okay?

387
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,059
I was just, like, wait,
don't go out there like that.

388
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,728
Come here.
Let me get you a tissue.

389
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,567
Look at me. Look up.

390
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,029
I cannot believe Brody and Doug.

391
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,698
They're the worst,
like, trying to come

392
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,867
in between our friendship.

393
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,201
Like, I just never
wanna hang out with Doug

394
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,703
or Brody ever again
if they're just

395
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,454
gonna do this
'cause it's just...

396
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,247
Well, I think Brody's kind
of a lost cause, I don't think

397
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,291
you guys are gonna be able work
it out to be honest.

398
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,544
Uh, but I'm saying I'm never
coming, like, when you guys

399
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,171
all hang out, like I just can't
come if they're just

400
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,633
like out to try to * * * me
over with you, like...

401
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,844
They're not, Steph,
we're just...

402
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,554
...honestly, something happened

403
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,556
and it got blown out
of proportion, it sucks.

404
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,307
But, like, you and Doug
shouldn't have done

405
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,393
what you did, and it sucks,
but it's done, you know?

406
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,397
I didn't know
you did coffee too.

407
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,982
I didn't know you guys
went to coffee too.

408
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,735
'Cause I went there
to go tell him, like

409
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,570
you're getting
the wrong impression.

410
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,822
- You're the one calling me...
- Steph!

411
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,581
