1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,674
(Kelly)
Hey, Whit?
Can you come up here?

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,133
(Whitney)
'Sure.'

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,639
- Hey.
- Hi.

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,434
So I ran into Alixe at DVF,
Diane Von Furstenberg

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,603
'and she told me that
she was looking for somebody'

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,063
to do PR in-house.

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,566
'And that made me think of you.'

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,943
Okay?

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,863
And there's an interview, um

10
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,700
that I've set up for you in
New York the day after tomorrow.

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,451
The job is in New York?

12
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,495
- Yes.
- Wow.

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,039
You know,
despite how demanding I am

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,124
I always kind of
think about the people

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,251
that work for me
and like where they're headed

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,920
'and what's gonna
be best for them.'

17
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,881
I don't wanna lose you,
but I think that

18
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,216
you've really done a lot
for us and this interview

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,259
'is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.'

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,970
'Diane's amazing.
She's a legend.'

21
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,138
The amount of experience
that you would have

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,640
would just be tremendous.

23
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,601
I mean, it sounds amazing.
It's just scary.

24
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,813
Like, I always kind of
saw myself in New York.

25
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,816
I just didn't think it was
gonna happen this fast.

26
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,694
I really think that you have
a great shot at this job

27
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,031
and I think you will have
a fantastic experience.

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,949
Well, then I have to do it.

29
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,284

(Lauren)
'I know!
You're all settled?'

36
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,225
Yeah. I mean, I got that
back house together quick.

37
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,227
This is gonna take me a while.

38
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,855
And it's gonna be, like, your
home, you know what I mean?

39
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,190
- Like, that's like...
- Bachelorette pad.

40
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,734
[laughs]

41
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,653
Bachelorette, huh?
What about Justin?

42
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,113
How you doing with that?

43
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,699
We talked and, like...

44
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,242
So you don't want it anymore?

45
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,702
No, I still want it.

46
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,371
[laughs]

47
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,708
So what about you?
What's been going on?

48
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,126
My parents are moving.

49
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,169
Where are they moving?

50
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,630
Are they moving out of Laguna?

51
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,466
Yeah.

52
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,884
Oh, are you gonna
miss that house?

53
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,177
I loved that house.

54
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,888
'I'm going down
tomorrow with Lo'

55
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,849
and pack up, like,
my whole room down there.

56
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,393
You know, everyone moved away,
everyone moved out of town

57
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,771
and I have, like,
my few friends from Laguna

58
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,189
that I still hang out with,
but they're all in LA.

59
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,441
I mean, the only reason
I went back

60
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,234
was for my family, but now...

61
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,278
Now they're moving.

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,781
'It's kind of like growing up.'

63
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,492
Yeah.

64
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,119
Do you want to show me
the rest of the house?

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,662
Yeah, I wanna show you upstairs.

66
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,622

Is this really
a poor-me afternoon?

73
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,399
No, it's not.
I just don't know what to do.

74
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,485
- With who?
- With Cameron.

75
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,112
I thought you already
broke up with him.

76
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,947
- No.
- What do you mean no?

77
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,740
We keep breaking up
and then, like, he'll be nice

78
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,036
and then two days later,
it'll all change again.

79
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,538
It's stupid, but, like,
one thing was, he was like

80
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,125
"Well, it's because I always
drive to your house.

81
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,793
You never drive to my house."

82
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,252
Then he's not worth your time

83
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,964
if he can't drive
15 minutes to see you.

84
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,591
That's just,
like, straight punk.

85
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,594
Why be sad over a guy that
doesn't stand up for you

86
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,806
after somebody makes
you cry twice in a club?

87
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,809
I don't know
what to do with myself.

88
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,144
Go be a nun.

89
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,105

90
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,439
Can you stop, Spencer?

91
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,316
How many times
have you broken up?

92
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,653
Maybe like four, five.

93
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,780
Do you know how, I mean, do you
know how immature and stupid

94
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,867
this relationship sounds
from an outside perspective?

95
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,119
'Obviously this relationship
is not meant to be.'

96
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,663
'Because,
from my honest opinion'

97
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,582

better than that guy.

I have to tell you about
my meeting with Kelly yesterday.

104
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,145
She basically told me
that she was talking

105
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,522
to people over
at Diane Von Furstenberg

106
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,191
and she wants me
to fly in tomorrow

107
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,984
to have an interview with them...

108
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,113
- Like a whole new job?
- Like a whole new job.

109
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,156
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

110
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,950
This is like so out of nowhere.

111
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,952
I mean, I feel like
I just started working here.

112
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,494
- For Diane Von Furstenberg.
- 'For Diane Von Furstenberg.'

113
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,163
That's gonna be the most
awesome thing ever.

114
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,581
I know, but that would mean

115
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,209
I'd be basically moving
to New York.

116
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,129
- It's out of New York?
- I would be moving to New York.

117
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,716
- Whit.
- I know.

118
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,551
I'm sorry, I'm so happy
for you, I'm just...

119
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,678
'I know.
It's how could I not try it?'

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,346
I'd regret it if I didn't.

121
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,390
That's true.
This is really exciting.

122
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,434
Such a whirlwind,
I'll be leaving tomorrow

123
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,519
and then coming back
the same day.

124
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,105

- 'Yeah.'

be coming right back'

126
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,275

what I really need to keep

were, um, back together.

to...'

155
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,059

of the story, so...

159
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,525
My perspective is
a little skewed here, Steph.

160
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,319
And he's a little protective.

161

he was making you cry

- Hi.
- I've come to pack my room.

185
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,923
Come here, tall girl.

186
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,300
- 'How are you?'
- 'Good.'

187
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,884
Nice to see you guys.

00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,510

(Lauren)
'I'm packing the room.
I recruited Lo.'

191
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,516
You know what you should
do though is we wanna put

192
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,644
have some of your pictures
in the new bedroom.

193
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,938
- I'll pick my favorites.
- 'Okay.'

194
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,648
So you guys are just moving
to a smaller house?

195
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,651
- 'Yes.'
- Yep. My kids are grown up.

196
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,653
Lauren's gone.

197
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,280
'Breanna's gone.'

198
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,157
We just have little Brandon
and he's...

199
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,700
Two years, he's graduating
and going away to college.

200
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,411
Seems silly to be livin'

- 'Good, how are you?'
- Good. I'm Whitney Port.

217
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,162
- I'm here to see Alixe Boyer.
- 'Elizabeth will be with you.'

218
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,221
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

219
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,390
- Hi, I'm Elizabeth.
- Hi, I'm Whitney.

220
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,891
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

221
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,684
- Go right upstairs.
- Okay, great.

222
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,651
- Alixe will be right with you.
- Okay, great.

223
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,986
Thank you.

224
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,212
- Hi. How are you?
- Whitney. Hi.

225
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,838
- I'm Whitney.
- Good. Alixe Boyer.

226
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,673
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

227
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,301
- Thank you for having me here.
- Thank you for coming by.

228
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,761
So I spoke with Kelly

229
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,555
and she was very
complimentary of you.

230
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,557
- Oh, good.
- So I brought you my resume.

231
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,059
Great. I did take a look at it

232
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,103
but I'd love to hear from you
what you've been doing.

233
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,939
Okay, well, basically,
uh, as you can see

234
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,691
my most recent job
was People's Revolution.

235
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,069
Which, I was working a lot
with styling.

236
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,696
I particularly helped style
the Sass & Bide runway show

237
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,490
that we did here in New York.

238
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,909
And your role at the Sass & Bide
show was what exactly?

239
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,787
Basically, I was just helping
with all the casting.

240
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,872
I was helping styling
with the designers.

241
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,541
Just everything
that you can think of.

242
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,793
And before that,
I worked at "Teen Vogue."

243
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,503
So tell me, why DVF?

244
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,964
Well, I've always wanted
to work for a designer.

245
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,549
I think it's part
of the fashion industry

246
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,051
that I've never
been able to really do

247
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,596
so I think it would just be
really an awesome opportunity

248
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,556
for me to just learn
a whole new...

249
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,475
- Sort of be in-house.
- Yeah.

250
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,602
In terms of the position,
I can tell you that

251
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,397
I'm looking for someone who can
come in as an image coordinator

252
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,941
in essence, and work with me
on all facets of the brand.

253
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,777
- Mm-hm.
- So, it's a broad position.

254
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,737
(Alixe)
'You know, it's a very
busy time of year.'

255
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,406
- 'It's fashion week, so...'
- Okay.

256
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,907
How quickly can you start?

257
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,409
As soon as you would need me.

258
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,995
So you're ready
to change your lifestyle?

259
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,997
- I'm very ready.
- And start something entirely
new?

260
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,207
I'm very ready.
I would never have taken

261
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,335
this job interview
if I wasn't serious about it

262
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,295
and I feel like
if I'm in this industry

263
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,422
I should just go into it
wholeheartedly

264
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,300

00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,283
It's sad to leave.

346
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,118
I know. I thought they were
gonna have it forever.

347
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,412
I thought it was
kind of the plan.

348
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,872
'Mm-hm.'

349
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,917
I just grew up
a little bit here

350
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,461
and there's no memories
in the new place.

351
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,881
Well, you have to make them.
You have to make the memories.

352
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,300
Yeah, but this was my home.
That'll never be my home.

353
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,595
With your parents living
there, it'll be homey.

354
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,513
It'll be the same thing.

355
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,433
I think it's time to make
my own home my home.

356
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,059
Or our home.

357
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,103
God, are we that old?
We're not that old yet.

358
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,979
We don't have to do that yet.

359
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,991
Wanna go back to the car?

360
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,830
Okay. Come on.

361
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,967
(Alixe)
'So we'll be in touch soon.'

362
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,719
- 'Okay, great.'
- Thank you. Bye.

363
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,596
- Bye, I'll talk to you soon.
- Great, thanks.

364
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,355
- 'Wow, hi.'
- Hi.

365
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,065
How are you?

366
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,651
- What's going on?
- You made it!

367
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,236
- How's it going?
- Good. How are you?

368
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,780
- I like your dress.
- Thank you.

369
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,907
- How did it go?
- You look good too.

370
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,408
How did it go?

371
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,077
- It was okay. I mean...
- It was good?

372
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,288
Yeah, she said they're looking
at other people

373
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,707
but I guess I'll hear
from her tomorrow and...

374
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,417
I wanna get back here,
like, as soon as possible.

375
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,085
- Are you gonna stay?
- Yeah, I think so.

376
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,963
- Aah!
- Aah!

377
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,173
I really want to, you know.

378
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,091
I wanna get out of LA
and I want to move here

379
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,387
and things could be,
like, different.

380
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,932
- That would be cool.
- Yeah.

381
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,392
Now that's done, what are you
gonna do for today then?

382
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,479
- Um, what am I doing where?
- All day here?

383
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,941
- Um, it's so good to see you.
- I know.

384
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,819
I love this dress, babe.
You look hot.

385
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,613
Thank you.

386
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,532
So you're leaving tonight?
What time is your flight again?

387
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,283
I have to go now.

388
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,202
I guess I'll just have
to see you when I get back.

389
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,372
No, that's not fair.

390
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,291
- I know, right?
- That's not fair.

391
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,418
I'm not gonna see you
till next time?

392
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,796
No, but hopefully, it will
be sooner than later.

393
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,756
A week?

394
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,257
Hopefully. Okay?

395
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,680
- Mm!
- Mm.

396
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,264
It's been too long already.
It's already been a month.

397
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,351
I know. But I'll
talk to you, um...

398
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,811
I'll talk to you once I'm home.

399
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,187
- Okay.
- Okay.

400
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,689
Call me when you
get, uh, back to LA.

401
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,191
- Okay. Bye, Jay.
- Alright. See ya, babe.
