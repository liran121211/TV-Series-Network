00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,598
- Long time no see.
- Have a seat, my friend.

175
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,519
- What are you guys doing?
- 'Taking photos.'

Oh, I 'm so glad you came.

180
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,612
- Have you seen "Batman?"
- So good.

181
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,074

been called "Joker."

- So she doesn't have her phone.
- Really?

205
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,814
Is it weird
that you dated Lauren?

206
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,731
'Not at all.'

207
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,030
What are you doing after this?

208
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,375
That's Brody's mom. Hi!

209
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,545
- 'How are you?'
- I'm good. How are you?

210
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,963

- Just wondering.
- No, no, no.

where it's like everything
hurts, but...

231
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,479
- Drink a lot of water today.
- I'm trying.

So what's going on?

234
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,195
- Lauren's been in Italy.
- That's awesome.

235
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,864
So Lo and I
had some bonding time.

236
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,700
How's that going?

237
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,535
'It's actually
going pretty good.'

00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,912
I think it's kind of a good
thing that Lauren's away.

00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,788
What are you guys doing?

240
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,917
We went to Goa and we ran
into Heidi and Spencer there.

241
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,463
She invited me
to this X Games party.

242
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,214
Does Lauren know you guys
have been hanging out?

243
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
'She's been in Italy
and we haven't been

244
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,008
able to get a hold of her.

245
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,929
Oh, my God,
and Stephanie came over

246
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,974
and asked me if she should
go on a date with Doug.

247
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,434
What?

248
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,893
Does Stephanie like Doug
or is she just...

249
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,604
That's what I asked her.

250
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,897
I think she's afraid
because no one really thinks

251
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,068
that Stephanie is trustworthy
of-of being Lauren's friend.

252
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,279
Right,
because she's Spencer's sister.

253
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,323
There are plenty of guys
that Stephanie can date

254
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,326
that aren't Lauren's
recent fling.

255
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,994

Why did you leave early?

272

I had seen all that
Italy had to offer.

00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,419

I learned a lot, it was so good.

'Well, we're glad you're back.'

281
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,020
So what did I miss?

282
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,898
Well, we went out
to Goa one night...

283
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,692
(Audrina)
'And then Heidi and Spencer
were there.'

284
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,068
They sat right behind us.

285
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,655
I'm Audrina. She's Heidi.

286
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,741
They sat this close to us.

287
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,702
I was like, hello.

288
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,620
It was very uncomfortable.

289
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,331
So we said hi.

290
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,752
'And Justin and I met up
with them last night.'

291
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,044
Surprise.

292
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,381
Very shocking.

293
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,468
So what else did I miss?

294
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,513
Um...

295
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,306
'Stephanie came over here.'

296
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,267
She wanted my advice
whether or not

297
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,561
she should go
on a date with Doug.

298
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,563
- My Doug?
- Your Doug.

299
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,273
What did you tell her?

300
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,982
I didn't really tell her
yes or no.

301
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,068
If she has to ask me,
like, she obviously knows

302
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,862
that that's probably not...

303
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,155

- 'Yeah.'
- Do you know what I mean?

306
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,997

00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,585

I just wanna look at you
and just be like

325
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,550
I told you so.

326
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,719
Wait, what are you
talking about?

327
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,639
The whole Doug-Stephanie thing.

328
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,433
It's kind of funny to me that
she really went and did that.

329
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,393
- So they did go out.
- This is how I found out.

330
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,604
We told him to come out with us,
he's like, I got to handle

331
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,898
a little business, you know,
a little business dinner

332
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,107
you know? No big deal.

333
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,400
He called it a business dinner?

334
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,986
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.

335
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,362
My mom calls me up and goes

336
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,656
"I just met your friend Doug.

337
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,408
Why was he having dinner
with Stephanie?"

338
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,327
And I was like

339

"Come again, mom.
What did you say?"

340
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,333
I think it's kind of ironic,
don't you, kind of?

341
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,294
Are you pissed off about it?

342
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,924
Yeah.

343
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,677
She straight went
behind your back.

344
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,554
