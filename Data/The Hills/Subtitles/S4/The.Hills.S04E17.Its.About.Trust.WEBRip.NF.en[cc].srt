1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,924
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,553
What's going on?
How was your day?

3
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,181
'Fine, I'm just bummed about
Audrina.'

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,684
I mean, I'm done yelling.
I'm done being upset about it.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,853
It's really unfortunate
when somebody you consider

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,314
to be your best friend
questions you in that way.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,107
I think that
that's what she doesn't get.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,902
She just, like, acted
like it was no big deal.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,445
'Because it was about Justin'

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,823
'somebody she cares
so much about.'

11
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,950
And it felt like
she cared more about him

12
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,827
than in you in this situation.

13
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,745
Considering how
he's treated her...

14
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,874
The way he's treated her over
the past few years is the reason

15
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,626
why she believed this.

16
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,003
It's a hard situation.

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,754
But what would you do? Like...

18
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,383
Truly, like, if somebody
questions you in that way

19
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,511
you will always know
that they don't trust you.

20
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,095
- Yeah, that's...
- 'Completely.'

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,056
That's the thing for me.
It's about the trust.

22
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,809
Well, I mean, what would it
take for you to forgive her?

23
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,438
For her to actually be sorry.

'Did you end up
doing anything this week?'

31
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,955
- No.
- I wish you went with me.

32
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,582
What, uh, what happened?

33
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,333
'We went to Winston's,
that little bar.'

34
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,169
- But Lauren was there.
- Did you talk to her?

35
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,922
Well, obviously
I had to do something.

36
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,381
She was there with Lo.

37
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,216
So I went up there
and I was like

38
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,343
"Okay, we need to talk
about this whole situation."

39
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,762
What'd she say?

40
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,888
She just kept saying
that I hurt her

41
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,472
I humiliated her.

42
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,558
It wasn't even a conversation,
Chiara.

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,393
It was like a scream fest.

44
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,229
Like, I would start talking,
she would yell over me

45
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,440
I would try to yell over her
and it just escalates

46
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,817
so I just sat back
and let her do what she wanted

47
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,778
and say what she wanted.

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,780
It's just sad, because there's
a history there, you know.

49
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,951
I've never had a conversation
with anyone like that, ever.

50
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,536
And then I've got a hold
of Justin, finally

51
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,539
and I went and met him
at Cobras and Matadors.

52
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,626
What was his excuse
for not reaching out to you?

53
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,253
He didn't bring his phone
charger, blah, blah, blah.

54
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,964
And I was like,
"Why didn't you text me back

55
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,924
or call me back
when you did get 'em?"

56
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,175
He said, "Because when I did get
'em, beyond the nice ones, like

57
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,678
"I just read all your * * *
ones that were hurtful.

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,639
Like, those things you said to
me, I would never say to you."

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,557
I'm like, "Well, I was upset,
I was hurt.

60
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,601
- 'Like, what was I..."'
- Nobody was answering you.

61
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,436
And he's like, "Audrina, like,
you should know, of all people

62
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,396
like, I've known you forever.
I wouldn't do that."

63
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,316
He's like, "You've made me just
not even wanna talk to you."

64
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,903
'And then he just walked out and
I haven't talked to him since.'

65
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,362
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,699
I don't know.

67
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,619
So now you're pretty convinced
and you don't think it happened?

68
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,412
No.

69
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,790
It's almost like I feel better,
but yet at the same time

70
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:48,002
I don't because it costed
my friendship with Lauren.

71
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,711
So what do I do now?

72
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,717
I just want all this to, like,
be gone and just disappear

73
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,928
and then all go back
to how it was.

It's open.

80
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,784
Well, that's safe.

81
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,870
- Hi.
- Hi.

82
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,329
What's up?

83
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,167
You decorate this place
pretty janky.

84
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,210
Like, this should be
all clear and nice.

85
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,963
You got it like it's a bathroom.

86
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,298
Oh, my God, Spencer.

87
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,427
So Heidi and I are gonna
go visit our nana.

88
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,056
Nana the great,
in Huntington Beach.

89
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,558
And, uh, Heidi had suggested
I invite you.

90
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,477
- To go to Huntington Beach?
- To visit Nana.

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,688
I have something
called school and work.

92
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,024
If you guys go on a weekend,
maybe I can go.

93
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,775
Can't she come here?

94
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,320
What kind of person doesn't
check in with their nana?

95
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,073
And I go to school
three times a week.

96
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,407
You can't pick up
the phone once a month

97
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,034
and call her
and check in with her?

98
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,162
- I can, but like...
- You don't though.

99
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,122
All she cares about
is how you treat her.

100
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,666
Well, it sounds like you've got
her wrapped around your finger.

101
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,334
Sounds like I'm giving you
an opportunity

102
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,046
to go make good with your nana.

103
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,506
I don't know if I wanna go and,
like, listen to you, like lie

104
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,425
and, like, say
how great you are and...

105
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,802
Well, if you wanna roll,
we're leaving tomorrow.

106
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,262
I'm out of here.

107
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,058
- Spencer.
- 'I'm not trying to be mean.'

108
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,309
Like, you should really
make peace with your nana.

109
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,395

You need to get the heat
working in this thing.

115
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,958
(Lauren)
'It's like 100 degrees out.
You want the heat on?'

116
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,293

'Yeah, outside. In here,
it's like 50 degrees.'

117
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,298
[sighs]
So I have something
to talk about.

118
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,050
- What?
- Why you banging Justin Bobby?

119
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,136
Honestly, it's not funny.

120
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,096
'That's a crazy * * *
I've heard my entire life.'

121
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,765
I'm just, I'm so angry.

122
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,143
It's disgusting
and it's embarrassing for other

123
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,103
people to, like,
ask me about that.

124
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:14,898
It is, but sometimes, it's not
about standing up for yourself...

125
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,942
You're gonna let people say
things like that about you

126
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,819
and not even defend yourself?

127
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,945
[sighs]

128
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,822
- You know what?
- What?

129
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,573
That's not the kind of person
you want in your life.

130
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,659
- I know.
- Plain and simple.

131
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,078
You shouldn't have any dislike
towards Audrina at all.

132
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,124
'You know, just go about your
life and leave people like that'

133
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,002
that are constant drama
and constant, like

134
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,129
leave them to do
their own thing.

135
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,006
It's just lame, honestly.

136
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,258
It's kind of like one
of those lose-lose situations.

137
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,717
I don't think
it's a lose-lose.

138
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,802
I think it's a
win-win situation.

139
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,720
How?

140
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,597
'Cause you don't need somebody
like that in your life.

141
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,434
Yeah, but, like, where did she,
like, where did she turn?

142
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,645
- Everybody changes.
- Yeah, I know, I know that.

143
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,190
Some change for the bad.
Some change for the good.

144
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,108
'You gotta let her go
as a friend.'

145
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,860
I've already done that.

146
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,195

Had any good ideas?

152
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,896
Yeah, there's a lot of,
like, this magazine

153
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,815
has called the most
romantic rooms ever.

154
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,525
- That's cool.
- 'Yeah.'

155
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,736
Well, not bedrooms.
It's just rooms.

156
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,279
Cool.

157
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,157
So Justin still
isn't talking to me.

158
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,826
Just for him to not even
call me back or text me.

159
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,494
'It's just
he's very good at, like'

160
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,956
manipulating and kind of
turning it back on me.

161
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,875
It's like he likes
seeing you hurt.

162
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,919
I know.
This is the worst of all.

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,712
Everything that we've been
through, you know?

164
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,714
Because it involves Lauren.

165
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,799
Yeah, it's not
another random girl.

166
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,344
Random girls don't matter.
I don't know them.

167
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:12,099
Lauren is, like, someone
that I know and care about.

168
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,312
So it's like I understand why
Lauren is upset because I...

169
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,108
Why would I even
think that of her?

170
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,402
Do you think I should
apologize to Lauren?

171
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,156
- You do, huh?
- 'If you, I don't know if...'

172
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,159
If you really believe that she
didn't do it and she's genuine

173
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,205
about it, like she's not gonna
forgive you for being the victim

174
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,292
until you apologize to her.

175
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,668
I'm kind of nervous.
I don't know why.

176
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,922
'Cause she's all upset
that you accused her of it.

177
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,635
It's just the... Well, the whole
situation just sucks.

So you didn't hit up the tanning
salon before you saw Nana today?

183
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,949
Oh, my God. No, I hit up
a store to get a nice outfit.

184
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,827
That's your nice outfit
to visit your nana?

185
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,911
For me.

186
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,704
Queen Nana!

187
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,460
Here, Nana, this flower
is from Heidi and I.

188
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,544
- Thank you. What a surprise!
- 'We got you a flower!'

189
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,088
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Hi, Nana.

190
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,965
- It's so good to see you guys.
- Hi.

191
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,883
You remember Stephanie, right?

192
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,053
Hi, sweetheart.
Long time no see. How are you?

193
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,680
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

194
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,349
- It has been a long time.
- Come on in.

195
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,975
What, you haven't seen
Nana in five years?

196
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,518
This is the first time
you've called?

197
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,020
- Did we see Nana last week?
- Yeah.

198
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,521
- We see Nana all the time.
- Yep.

199
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,190
This is our,
the love our my life.

200
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,192
(Heidi)
Oh, look at all these photos!

201
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,444
- Aren't they wonderful?
- Look at this one, Nana.

202
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,155
(Heidi)
'Oh, the cutest little boy
in the entire world.'

203
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,531
(Spencer)
'You know I can get you frames'

204
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,116
'that only have,
like, one heart'

205
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,410
'and we can just have
one like that.'

206
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,537
(Nana)
Are you thirsty? I have some
lemonade and some and cookies.

207
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,580
I don't think Stephanie's ever
had your lemonade and cookies.

208
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,333
- You take Heidi outside then.
- Are you okay?

209
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,503
- Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.
- Okay.

210
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,381
How lovely out here.
My favorite part of coming.

211
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,090
- 'I know.'
- Besides you, of course.

212
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,591
I'll put 'em down right here.

213
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,302
- Alright.
- That would be nice.

214
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,262
Those look good.

215
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,847
So, Stephanie,
what's new with you?

216
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,724
I haven't seen you in so long.

217
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,434
- It hasn't been that long.
- 'How have you been doing?'

218
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,978
Stephanie, not knowing
what family is and loyalty

219
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,398
she decided to become
friends with the person

220
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,608
that was talking mean
about poor, sweet Heidi

221
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,070
'for over a year,
and Stephanie decided to go'

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,405
be best friends
with this girl.

223
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,822
- Oh, dear.
- Okay.

224
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,699
Nana doesn't know
the whole story.

225
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,410
Why does this remind me
of years back where you two

226
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,412
'were fighting then
and now you're still doing it?'

227
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,830
I don't remember ever
fighting with Spencer.

228
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,542
I remember playing, like,
Nerf guns.

229
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,336
(Nana)
'I want you to get along
and to be happy, you know?'

230
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:50,340
Everything is a, is such a nice
time when people are happy.

231
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,759
You know, I wish
I had had a brother

232
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,846
when I was young who would
have been protective of me.

233
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,183
You can trust him
and you can rely on him

234
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,436
and he will always
be there for you.

235
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,479
'I'm just happy
that I got to see you'

236
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,358
and I hope that, uh, our visits
will become more frequent.

237
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,859
(Spencer)
'Speaking of that, Stephanie,
maybe you could'

238
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,237
start visiting more often.

239
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,864
Whenever, whenever
I'm not at school.

240
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,033
Maybe we could get together
tomorrow and...

241
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,245
Stephanie's got her day free.
Of course, she'll go.

242
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,580

Thanks.

250
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,234
Will you update me
with the boy situation?

251
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,778
'Do you, like, talk to him
on the phone or you just text?'

252
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,238
I talk to him.

253
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,240
So he's so cute.

254
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,286
He just puts, like,
XOs after every sentence.

255
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,704
- Does he really?
- Yeah, they're like XXX.

256
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,457
It's so... He's so cute.

258
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,338
Has Audrina tried
to get in touch with you

259
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,089
since the last time
you guys spoke?

260
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,342
She texted me
that she wants to meet

261
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,346
at Bond Street tomorrow night
to explain to me

262
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,473
you know, kind of
her situation, but...

263
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,058
To try to make peace,
you're assuming, or to try to...

264
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,935
I don't think she's looking
for round two.

265
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,939
But I really, really,
really don't wanna go.

266
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,692
Just playing devil's advocate,
maybe she just has

267
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,029
something different to say.

268
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,489
I mean,
what would have changed?

269
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,241
She's already heard
from Justin

270
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:44,287
that it wasn't true and knows
that she was wrong, so...

271
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,080
You guys have been through
so much

272
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,291
'that if she's reaching out
to you this hard'

273
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,251
she must really,
really need someone

274
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,420
to talk to right now,
you know?

275
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,339
Because you guys have
been there for each other

276
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,008
so much in the past, like, maybe
she just needs you right now.

Yes, it is.

You wanna sit down
for a minute?

Yeah, might as well.

288

[sighs]

289
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,257
I'm glad this,
this opportunity came

290
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,718
because I don't think we would
have had it otherwise.

291
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,844
There isn't any reason
why you and I can't have

292
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,349
when I come up here, we can have
our time, just the two of us.

293
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,017
It's really good
to spend time with you

294
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,561
but whenever you come into town

295
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,229
I don't even know
you're in town

296
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,314
'cause you were just, like,
with Spencer and Heidi

297
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,568
like holed up.
I'm not even, like, included.

298
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,404
Yeah, well, it's not up to me.
That's the problem.

299
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,490
If it was me, I would
definitely include you.

300
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,618
And, like, I know you don't
know this side of Spencer

301
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,246
but with Spencer and I,
it was just competition.

302
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,458
And this is just
like one battle that

303
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,334
like I should fight
for your attention

304
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,130
but he's just, like the star
in the spotlight.

305
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,424
Well, that's, that's
always tough to have somebody

306
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,302
you know, you're living
in his shadow.

307
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,097
Do you think if you looked
closer at Spencer

308
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,682
he would still be your favorite?

309
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,436
I can only go by the way
he treats me.

310
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,939
I just think that
he wouldn't be your favorite

311
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,941
if you knew more about him.

312
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,777
Well, maybe it's just as well
I don't know more about him

313
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,696
because maybe
I wouldn't like him.

314
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,032
You know, life is sometimes
a bucket of worms

315
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,243
and you don't know
what to do with them.

316
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,622
That's how I feel
about Spencer.

317
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,415
Like, he just, like,
doesn't care

318
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,251
and I don't understand
why he's so mean to me.

319
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,836
Stephanie, you have to wait
till he grows up a little bit.

320
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,506
That's what you'll have to do

321
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,466
and then he'll see
the error of his ways.

322
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,345
Well, I'm gonna start
stealing your time from him.

323
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,805
I'll go shopping with you.

324
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,889
Now that's something
we can do together.

325
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,558
Yeah, that's true, we could.

326
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,101

00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,228
- How are you?
- Fine.

336
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,817
[sighs]
This is a mess, Lauren.

337
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,737
Well, I came to hear
what you have to say 'cause...

338
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,822
I just,
I mean, I know I'm sorry

339
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,615
that I jumped to conclusions.

340
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,535
You're accusing me things
that are, like, crazy.

341
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,119
'They are so out
of character for me.'

342
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,747
You know I wouldn't do that.

343
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,374
Some crazy person told you
a crazy story.

344
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,377
I know it was in left field,
but whenever someone is so like

345
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,962
"I swear, I was there,"
duh, like...

346
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,464
But it wasn't
about what he said

347
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,049
or anything
that could've happened

348
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,594
it was that you,
after I even told you

349
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,970
it wasn't true,
still believed it.

350
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,640
I know and I believe you
and I believe Justin now.

351
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,685
And it's just, I realize
the damage that it's done

352
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,687
and I'm, you know,
I'm sorry on my end

353
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,523
for what I've caused you
and what you went through.

354
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,067
As far as I'm concerned,
if you have a friendship

355
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,737
with someone and you trust them,
then that's everything.

356
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,614
'You know what I mean?'

357
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,032
'Who, who are your friends
if you don't trust them?'

358
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,118
Which was one
of the hardest things for me

359
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,788
was that I realized
that you don't trust me.

360
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,415
I feel like an idiot
because I didn't trust you

361
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,834
and I didn't trust Justin.
It's like...

362
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,463
Audrina, I get why
you didn't trust Justin.

363
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,173
What really made me upset
is that I've watched you

364
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,843
over the past few years
repeatedly

365
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,220
'go back to Justin
and trust him'

366
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,809
with not just, you know,
your feelings, but your heart.

367
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,311
And you couldn't give me
the benefit of the doubt

368
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,563
on something crazy like this.

369
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,483
I don't trust anyone and
you've known that for so long.

370
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,025
I don't think
it's about trusting people

371
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,653
it's about
knowing who to trust.

372
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,987
'The right people.'

373
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,825
'As bad as it sounds, like,
I feel like'

374
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:36,746
if Justin wasn't in my life,
I just feel like

375
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,082
I think I would be happier
in a sense.

376
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,209
Happiness comes first.

377
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,839
I just, I just feel
like my happiness lately

378
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,674
like, I haven't been happy.

379
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,593
I've been, like, so torn up
inside and so angry

380
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,554
and so just, almost lost.

381
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,932
Like, I don't know
who I am anymore.

382
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,980
But I just feel, like, inside
I've lost who I am, like...

383
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,857
Audrina, you gotta
believe that there's people

384
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,442
that just really want
the best for you.

385
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,235
And it's almost like
I've learned to become

386
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,697
my own best friend
and not trust anyone

387
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,156
because of all that.

388
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,408
And that's not healthy,
it's bad.

389
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,288
I was not gonna cry today.

390
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,082
I don't know.

391
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,918
'I wish you'd just trust me.'

392
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,629

never want you to be sad.
