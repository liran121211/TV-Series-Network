so it's not in the way.'

Ooh, these got all messed up.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,762
How's it going with Lo
and Audrina at the house?

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,388
The same,
we're gonna throw a party

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,682
for her birthday
this week, though.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,308
Oh, fun.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,977
Yeah, Lo's helping,
so hopefully it will

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,520
'smooth things out at home.'

9
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,898
Oh, and guess what?
I've got a date tonight.

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,400
- I know.
- A date!

11
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,444
Where did you meet him?
Tell me everything.

12
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,196
I kind of dated him,
when I was 18.

13
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,572
Like, did he go
to your high school?

14
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,073
No, he went to
a different school.

15
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,784
- I went to his prom with him.
- Oh, my gosh.

16
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,453
And I ran into him...

17
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,455
...last Thursday.

18
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,959
- That is such a small world.
- I know, right?

19
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,836
So, what's his name, this guy?

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,880
Doug.

21
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,589
Doug. Doug.

22
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,174
- Doug's such a funny name.
- I know.

23
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,634
I don't even want to talk
about him too much.

24
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,012
I feel like I'm gonna,
like, jinx it.

25
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,680
Yeah. Fair enough.

26
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,473
The last guy I dated, like

27
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,142
more than like one date,
really, was Brody.

28
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,353
And that was when Heidi
and Spencer set us up.

29
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,647
'That's how long
it's been for me.'

30
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,441
- Little bit of a slump.

my sister's coming to town?

37
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,882
Oh, no. Cool.

38
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,717
- When's she coming in?
- Tonight.

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,719
- For how long?
- Just for the weekend.

40
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,805
Are you, like, you sound
like you're not excited.

41
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,516
I mean, it's like the worst
time ever 'cause it's, like

42
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,393
Spencer just moved back in

43
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,978
and we're trying
to work things out

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,939
'and I haven't told
him she's coming.'

45
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,899
Yeah, might be a good idea
to tell him sooner than later.

46
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,234
Right, and she doesn't
know that he's there

47
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,819
'cause I haven't really
had time to tell her

48
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,654
like, "Oh, Spencer
moved back in."

49

It's not like
you planned it out

50

purposely didn't tell him.

race home, and be like...

00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,538
- Just a "By the way?"
- Right.

54
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,206

It was really awkward for her
to be there.

341
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,454
She's trying, you know? And
I feel bad because I love Lo.

342
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,541
And I'm really, like making her
jump through hoops for Audrina.

343
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,293
And she just, she doesn't owe
Audrina anything.

344
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,878
No. Not at all.

345
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,381
So, like, Lo went upstairs...

346
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,090
And just, like, shut herself
out out of the party?

347
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,010
I'm like, I needed, like,
another team member there.

348
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,762
What about Doug?
Wasn't Doug there?

349
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,264
- Oh, Doug was there.
- Is that a whole another story?

350
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,642
I felt bad because
he came over.

351
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,144
He was so nice to everybody.
He cooked for everybody.

352
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,147
I was really stressed about Lo
and Audrina and all this stuff.

353
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,860
And I was, like, completely
ignoring him. I felt so bad.

354
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,820
Such a frustrating situation.

she had to talk to Audrina'

That's good. Did you have fun
at the party on Sunday?

367
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,740
Oh, it was crazy. At one point,
I had to go in the front yard

kind of absent at your birthday.

like I click with you.

Like, I feel like I'm kind
of always on the outside.

I don't think that
I put you on the outside.

have grown up together

is being put on me
for the reason

389
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,370
that you and Lauren
are drifting apart.

390
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
And I just, like,
don't think that's fair.

391
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,917

like there's an attitude.
