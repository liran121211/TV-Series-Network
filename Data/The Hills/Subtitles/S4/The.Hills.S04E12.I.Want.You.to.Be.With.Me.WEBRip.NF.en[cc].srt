1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,382
Hey. So I just talked to Brandon

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,635
and he said that, um,
we are gonna have to go

3
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,010
into the studio with Brandy
later this week.

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,596
That's cool.

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,515
Yeah, and being in the studio
is like.

6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,433
You just kind of forget
about everything else.

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,185
Hey, you're not
forgetting everything.

8
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,896
I'm really on a forgetting kick.

9
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,816
'So Cabo was that bad, huh?'

10
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,776
'Justin's just being a jerk.'

11
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,653
He was torturing me and just,
he knows how to do that...

12
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,822
He knows, like,
which buttons to push.

13
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,907
He knows how to push my buttons
get under my skin.

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,659
It doesn't seem like he's
interested in really being

15
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,577
with you
unless it's some kind of game.

16
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,539
Well, he just likes knowing
that whenever I do

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,165
start dating someone,
he gets me back

18
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,083
'and then he drops me
and I'm hurt'

19
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,211
and then I go find someone,
it's like the same thing.

20
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,130
And I can't keep jumping
from one relationship

21
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,048
right into the next.

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,592
Audrina, I think you're starting

23
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,845
to figure things out
a little bit.

24
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,138

31
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,955
'fabric samples
for our next class.'

32
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,165
(Lauren)
'How many do we have
to turn in?'

33
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,377
We need, like, four...

34
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,922
...prints and two solids,
or something.

35
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,089
I didn't miss anything,
like, super important, right?

36
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,927
Oh, yeah, how was Cabo? You
really didn't miss that much.

37
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,469
Um...

38
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,348
...I can't say I had
as much fun as the guys.

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,809
Why, did the guys partied hard?

40
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,771
Yeah, they just, like, flew
in a shipment of girls though.

41
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,856
- It was really funny.
- No, they didn't.

42
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,901
- Yeah, they did.
- Why did Doug fly in girls?

43
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,654
Um, because I don't know

44
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,699
boys like girls
and it was Brody's birthday.

45
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,493
Speaking of boys...

46
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,495
...I've told you
about Cameron, right?

47
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,998
A little bit. Are you guys,
like, together-together now?

48
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,418
- Yay.
- We had the talk.

49
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,963
- The talk? It's such a step.
- The talk.

50
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,340
But you guys will really
like him. He's cute.

51
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,009
- Why wouldn't we, you know?
- I know.

52
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,845
I think we're gonna do
Crown tomorrow night

53
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,097
if you wanna go.

54
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,890
- Crown Bar?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,184
Um, the only thing is,
I think Brody's gonna go.

56
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,812
At least, I'll have like,
protection

57
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,522
if Brody, like,
says anything to me.

58
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,357
He has to stand up for you,
I think.

59
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,152
'Cause, yeah,
Brody did make me cry.

60
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,655
But, like, he just met Spencer
and Spencer's like

61
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,658
just totally giving him * * *,
like, to stand up

62
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,243
and like, protect me
and whatever.

63
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,203
It'll be fine.
We'll have fun.

64
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,584
Okay, do you need anything else
from here?

65
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,462
- Well, that's bright.
- I know.

66
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,048
Let's get some, like,
plaids or something.

67
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,146
(Brody)
'I need some heat up
in this pool.'

68
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,981
It's too hot outside to heat it.

69
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,608
Oh, thank you, princess.

70
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,360
Why are you not in your bikini?

71
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,362
'I am under here.'

72
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,657
'So I invited Steph to come
to Crown Bar tomorrow night.'

73
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,659
Oh, you mean
you're besties again?

74
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,831
I mean, we just, like,
I don't know.

75
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,083
'Well, I mean, you know
how I feel about her.'

76
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,754
I know. All BS aside,
Stephanie is actually

77
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,256
in a really good relationship
for once and she's really happy.

78
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,885
Good for her.
I'm happy for her.

79
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,303
'I just don't understand
how you have not seen it yet.'

80
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,431
How you don't, like, how do you
not see that she's shady?

81
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,100
She did all that thing
with Doug.

82
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,019
'It's, like, she's not
the kind of person'

83
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,687
I like to surround myself with.

84
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,689
I don't need you to be
her best friend, Brody.

85
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,149
I just think everyone's gonna
be so much more comfortable

86
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,775
if you guys just get along.

87
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,569
'I just don't wanna
hang out with her.'

88
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,488
I know, but listen,
part of her problem is that

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,991
Spencer keeps getting
into her head and saying that

90
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,284
Cameron isn't standing up
for her with you...

91
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,871
You know what?

92
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,374
Please, God, I would love for
Cameron to say one thing to me.

93
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,085
I'll be like,
listen, homey, why don't I

94

and tell you a couple things

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,379

- But...
- I don't know.

170
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,682
I feel like I've just been
kind of trying to convince

171
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,645
and make myself like someone

172
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,106
where it's like someone else
is still on my mind.

173
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,237
'I think we have
something special.'

174
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,282
I just think
to be in a relationship

175
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,367
you kind of got to
be, like, together.

176
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,998
Yeah. It's just frustrating
at times.

177
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,791
Like, sometimes,
you don't put forth

178
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,628
as much effort as you should.

179
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,297
I know that.
I'm very well aware of that.

00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,716

Do you want me to hand them
to you?

198
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,319
Yeah, just separate them
and then give me

199
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,071
one page of each
and I'll put them in.

200
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,199
- Okay. Perfect.
- 'So Brandy was cool, right?'

201
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,327
I felt bad, like,
walking out with Justin.

202
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,162
You need to tell me
how that went.

203
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,289
He said all the right things.

204
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,250
And maybe, I don't think
he would do that

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
just to play with me

206
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,129
especially coming
to work, you know?

207
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,590
But think of how many times

208
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,174
you've wanted to end it
with him though.

209
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,093
'Like, there's a reason
for that every time.'

210
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,096
And he can't just keep coming
and sweeping you off your feet.

211
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,684
But he wouldn't say those things
if he didn't really care.

212
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,728
Well, I think that he get scared
when he thinks

213
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,439
he's gonna lose you,
and he likes when he feels

214
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,815
like he's got you wrapped
around his finger, you know?

215
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,235
I know, but this time,
like, just, what he said...

216
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,696
No, but he said it
last time too.

217
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,074
I don't know, there's something
that Justin and I have

218
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,535
that no one else
that I've met...

219
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,037
Like, we don't have that
connection or chemistry.

220
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,081
So you feel like with Cory

221
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,417
there's just no real connection.

222
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,255
Well, you got to do
what you got to do.

223
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,466
I just don't want you to fall
back into the same trap

00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,842
you've fallen back
into 15 times before.

I just, I like Cory.

Like, I think that he likes you.

we were all having lunch.

- Um, he decided not to come.
- 'What do you mean?'

How are you gonna
flake out on brunch?

245
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,781
He just didn't
wanna get grilled.

246
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,324
He didn't flake out.

00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,284
Uh, do you see
the open seat there?

You guys, this is why
he's not coming.

(Heidi)
'So on a scale from one to ten,
how much do you like him?'

250
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,917
I have no idea.

251
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,586
Like, Cameron's just
like a really nice guy

252
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,755
and like, we went
to Crown Bar last night

253
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,257
so he could meet,
like, the girls and stuff.

254
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,469
- Did Brody go?
- Yeah.

255
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,223
Let me guess.
He didn't stand up for you.

256
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,684
- You guys.
- Oh, my gosh.

257
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,686
He, like, wanted to. He's like,
I'm gonna pull Brody aside.

258
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,271
He wanted to?

259
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,899
Well, what did you say?

I don't know yet.
