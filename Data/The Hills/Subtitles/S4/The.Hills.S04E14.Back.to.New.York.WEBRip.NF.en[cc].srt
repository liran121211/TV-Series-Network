00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,238
Yes.

344
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,616
Like, you can't just have people

345
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,911
like that in your life,
because they will constantly...

346
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,246
I mean, but he's not
a bad person, you know.

347
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,082
The bottom line is, I'm very
sorry about what happened

348
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,209
'at work, and if there was
ever anything'

349
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,044
I could do or any way

350
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,590
I could possibly get any kind
of job with you guys again.

351
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,759
I mean, if you could just
consider it, you know.

352
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,761
I don't...
I mean, that's...

353
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,929
I-I don't know.

354
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,889
That's...

355
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,390
That's the last thing
on my mind right now.

356
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,477
But I mean I'm more than happy
to talk to Sam.

357
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:22,148
But I put a lot of faith and
trust in you, and...you know.

358
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,568
Nothing like that would ever
happen again, you know.

359
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,695
I don't know.
I don't know.

360
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,071
- I gotta get back to work.
- Alright.

361
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,031
Well, it was good
to see you.

362
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,284

she'll come to you.

370
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,516
The other guy
with the pink T-shirt.

371
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,267
That's...
Do you know who that is?

372
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,102
(Whitney)
'He told us that he's
the brother'

373
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,855
of your ex-girlfriend.

374
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,148
I went out with her
for nearly five years.

375
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,066
- You know what I mean, so...
- That's a really long time.

376
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,235
I got out of a relationship
a year ago.

377
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,946
- It-it sucked.
- It's hard.

378
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,948
It's like the worst
feeling ever.

379
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,074
Yeah, but,
you know, I-I mean

380
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,619
it's really hard at first

381
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,288
but, you know,
over time, you realize

382
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,750
that it's, like, maybe that
was the right thing for me or...

383
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,544
- Hey.
- Are you leaving?

384
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,420
No, no, when you have
a second, meet me over there.

385
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,797
- Okay.
- Alright.

386
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,507
Do-do you wanna go speak
to him? I'm gonna go...

387
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,217
- I mean, not really, but...
- Why?

388
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,177
- What's the deal with that?
- I don't know.

389
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,471
- Just this guy that...
- Is that the ex-boyfriend?

390
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,848
No. No, no.

391
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,266
The ex-boyfriend lives in LA.

392
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,476
Oh, that's a start.

393
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,686
- That's a good start.
- Yeah.

394
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,021
I'll steer clear
from that guy.

395
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,106
- Oh, yeah?
- Come and check out our place.

396
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,901
- You wanna come with us?
- Okay.

397
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:54,657
Thanks for coming down.
I appreciate that.

398
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,826
- We're leaving.
- I feel bad.

399
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,828
I should go say goodbye
to him really fast, and then...

400
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,788
- No, no, no.
- No?

401
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,668
You know
what just happened, right?

402
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,961
No, not really.

403
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,338
Your girl just beat it
with that Australian kid.

404
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,007
I don't...

405
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,926
I don't really think
that's exactly what's going on

406
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,177
but she just met him
right now.

407
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,055
I'm just saying
that's what just happened.
