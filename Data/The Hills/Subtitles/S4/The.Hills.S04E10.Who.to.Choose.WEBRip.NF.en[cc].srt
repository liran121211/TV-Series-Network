1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,088
- 'Lauren, are you home?'
- Yeah, I'm upstairs in my room.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,507
Okay.

3
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,510
Hello. This is so cute.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,345
You guys have little pictures
everywhere.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,389
Yeah, we do that for fun.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,433
We did, like, silly pictures,
though, so it wasn't, like...

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,018
- Posey-like.
- 'Yeah, like, cheesy.'

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,020
Kissy faces.

9
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,981
- Um, what's up?
- 'Remember Cory?'

10
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,607
The Australian?

11
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,068
I hung out with him all weekend.
And that's it.

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,863
- 'Justin was like...'
- How was that?

13
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,615
It was fun. I really like him.

14
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,284
- He was, like, a good guy.
- He's a really good guy.

15
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,078
- We're having dinner tonight.
- 'Good.'

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,331
- Wait.
- I didn't tell Justin about it.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,333
He's just like, well,
why didn't you call me back?

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,628
Like, I texted you, called you.
Like, I was busy having fun.

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,464
It's like I wanna
give more attention to Cory

20
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,049
but then Justin
always makes me feel guilty.

21
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,177
He gets mad at me, but he
can't really get mad at me

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,554
'cause we're not together.

23
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,138
I've totally been there
with a guy

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,431
where, like,
I didn't really like him.

25
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,099
I totally took him for granted

26
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,686
and then as soon as he,
like, got a girlfriend

27
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,146
or did something else,
I was like, wait a minute.

28
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,440
Then you wanted him back.

29
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,442
So maybe that's how
Justin will feel about you.

30
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,445
I don't know.
He's a weird one.

31
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,073
He's... I don't get him.

32
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,076
- But that's why you like him.
- I know.

33
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,619
You don't want a normal one.
They're no fun.

34
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,830
- Normal is not fun.
- 'No way.'

Must be really important

What's up?

00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,866
It's just insane.

'I don't know
who I dislike more'

50
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,994
Heidi's sister
or her mom right now.

51
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,704
Her mom came in town?

52
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,998
Oh, her mom came in town
and started lighting me up.

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,959
She was like, "I think you're

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,586
"manipulative and controlling
and Heidi doesn't tell me"

55
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,046
"all the details
of her life anymore."

56
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm like,
settle down, stalker mom.

57
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,300
Oh my God!

58
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,594
And then Holly is just like
the mooch of the century.

59
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,889
I have to, like, spend my day
in a coffee shop

60
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,809
because Holly's
on my office all day long.

61
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,351
Is she looking
for a new place?

62
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,854
No. She doesn't
even leave the condo.

63
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,190
I can't even imagine
disliking a sister more.

64
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,027
This should make you feel good.

65
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,738
That's like a demented
compliment, but thanks.

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,282
Oh, and then Holly
must've talked Heidi

67
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,535
into writing
LC some apology letter

68
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,454
and, like, let's make peace.

69
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,915
- What'd the letter say?
- Oh, I didn't know about it.

70
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,250
I didn't even get to read it
or spell-check it.

71
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,420
No, it's the first secret
she's ever kept from me.

72
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,841
Holly is really throwing
some wrenches in this machine.

73
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,176
Spencer, you can't go to war

74
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,554
with someone's family
who you wanna marry.

75
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,640
They already started the war
when they came out here

76
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,476
and bombed me like Pearl Harbor
the other night.

77
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,354
- Okay, then put up the flag.
- No, I'm out.

78
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,940
It's not worth it
'cause every time I say, like

79
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,775
Holly, move out, Heidi's like

80
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,360
"Don't listen to him.
Spencer, stop. Don't be..."

81
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,320
'Cause you guys
are doing it wrong.

82
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,656
You can't ask her to move out.
Heidi's got to be the one.

83
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,785

'I need the weekend to come.'

90
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,887
- 'You need the what?'
- The weekend to come.

91
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,055
What are you up to?

92
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,348
I may be...

93
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,643
...taking advantage of the nice
weather and going to Malibu.

94
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,103
Ooh.

95
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,354
If you wanna come,
we're gonna go

96
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,023
I think Saturday, to a party.

97
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,150
- That sounds fun.
- A during-the-daytime pool one.

98
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,401
Who's coming?

99
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,028
Audrina will be there with...

100
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,865
...I'm assuming, Cory.

101
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,742
Which one's Cory?

102
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,494
You met Cory, actually,
last year at Halloween.

103
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,872
- Oh, the Australian guy.
- The really cute guy.

104
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,790
Oh, she's seeing Cory again?

105
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,210
Well, she was seeing Colin,
then Colin didn't work out

106
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,046
so she went back to Justin,
but then she ran into Cory

107
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,924
but Justin's never, like,
really left the picture, so...

108
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,383
Mmm.

109
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,052
It'll either be Justin or Cory.

110
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,302
Alright, well,
I'll be looking forward

111
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,763
to seeing either one of them.

112
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,848
- Wanna be my date?
- So there.

113
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,642
[laughs]
I actually
really like Cory a lot.

114
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,603
You like him
better than Justin?

115
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,356
He's great.
He, like, wants to be with her.

116
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,234
- You know?
- Yeah.

117
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,152
And it's funny 'cause
I feel like she's so grateful

118
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,320
for the, for the simplest
things, like, you know

119
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,364
she was like,
he always returns my calls

120
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,283
and he doesn't stand me up.

121
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,993
And I'm like, these are
the normal things, Audrina.

122
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,412
'These are things
that should be expected.'

123
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,706
I think she needs
someone to be able

124
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,583
to appreciate her
for who she is.

125
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,168
Well, I think
that's what she needs.

126
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,711

actually what she wants.

Uh, probably 20th of December
or something around there.

134
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,111
- Just in time for Christmas.
- Yeah.

135
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,071
It's the best time of the year,
I reckon, to be back there

136
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,615
just at the beach
and just ride in the afternoon.

137
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,408
It's like you got summer here

138
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,995
and then you go back for summer
and come back here.

139
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,788
Yeah, endless summer.
It's pretty awesome.

140
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,748
You need to get out there
at least once.

141
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,001
I want to. We should go.

142
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,378
You've been single
for a while or what?

143
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,631
'What's, what's going on?'

144
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,301
- What have you been doing?
- Well, I've been single.

145
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,762
You been hanging out
with any other guys?

146
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,347
I mean, Justin, but not lately.

147
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,767
- Then what's up with you two?
- We're just friends.

148
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,479
- That's it.
- Yeah. That's, that's cool.

149
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,897
I don't know.

150
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,819
- What?
- How long has it been for you?

151
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,696
Just over a year.

152
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,615
- I was five years deep, so...
- That's a long time.

153
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,618
So now I'm just not worried
about anything, really.

154
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,789
- 'Yeah, just kind of...'
- Stress-free, just cruising.

155
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,624
Yeah, I know what you mean.

156
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,044
Yeah.

It's a bit of a hike, it's like,
an hour away or whatever, but...

189
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,638
- I'm gonna carpool with Whit.
- Yeah.

00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,390

00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,272
We're gonna stay in a big house.

00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,275
- No.

00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,362
Yeah, I'll hang out, for sure.

We went to Cabo last year
for a full week

200
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,034
and when we came back,
we needed two weeks to recover.

201
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,703
It was so fun though.

202
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,580
It sounds like
a bit of a big deal.

Yeah, but we are not bringing
your sister to another meal.

- We live with her.

Spencer, what do you
want me to say?

217
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,991
I want you to tell her
that her free rent

218

What do you want me to do?

229
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,267
I just cannot live
with your sister anymore

230
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,645
so it's either her or it's me.

231
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,565

kitchen today and found them.

249

Maybe the cutest thing ever.
It's so cute.

00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,741
- She's so happy around him.
- She is?

00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,659
'It makes me so happy.'

252
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,370
- That's pretty adorable.
- 'He's, like, a good guy.'

00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,247
He's nice to her.
You know what I mean?

254
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,374
But he's not, like,
too nice guy.

'He's still got enough edge
for her.'

256

- Yeah, how is that gonna work?
- Well, how's what gonna work?

285

Surreal.

348
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,478
Um, I kind of got to talk
to you about something.

What?

00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,947
I think that
it's time that we figure out

352

somewhere else for you to live.

353
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,786
Why?

354
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,372
Because it was only supposed
to be, you know

355
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,291
for a week or two
until you got on your feet

356
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,711
and, you know,
I've been at work all the time

357
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,253
and I don't really know

358
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,839
if you're looking for jobs
or places.

359
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,173
Of course,
I've been looking for jobs.

360
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,675
But Spencer says
you're here a lot

361
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,009
and on the couch and...

362
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,512
- Spencer?
- How long do you need?

363
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,889
Am I supposed to just
go on the street?

364
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,349
- I don't have a job yet.
- I can't...

365
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,142
But I can't figure out
your life for you.

366
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,228
Like, I don't know
how much more to help you

367
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,647
while sacrificing my life
at the same time.

368
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,483
Like, I love having you here,
and I wanna have you here

369
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,194
but it can't be
at the cost of my relationship.

370
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,864
I just don't understand why
it has to be one or the other.

371
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,741
Well, Spencer said it's either
