'I think I kind of overreacted.'

- I don't think you did at all.
- You don't?

00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,597
Actually, I left my helmet
there last night.

00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,224
Will you be needing the helmet?

00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,643
Probably.

When is it gonna stop?

I mean, it's been going on for
two years and it hasn't stopped.

Do you think
it's gonna stop now?

I'm surprised Heidi and Spencer
didn't pop in yesterday.

I guess Brody and Spencer
are kind of drifting.

Oh, my god, they're gonna be
pissed when they find out

we were hanging out
with Brody yesterday.

Well, I guess that's
what happens.

to be cool about it, but...

I saw them this weekend.

I mean, last time I heard

26
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,746
they hated each other, so...

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,623
It's a little funny.

28
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,710

a party for Chelsea soccer club.

'They're the, one of the biggest
soccer teams over there.'

They are doing an expo game
with the galaxy

which just brought
David Beckham here

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,100

I was home for a little bit

00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,961
and I went to the beach,
pretty much.

00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,088
We went to Brody's barbecue
in Malibu.

- Was it fun?
- It was fun.

00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,133
But Lauren got really emotional

48
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,843
'cause we were talking about
how hard it is

52
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,102
when her and Heidi were
such good friends.

53
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,645
We were sitting there
on the couch.

by this time.

00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,231
And then she went in
the house real quick

56
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,067
and she came back out
with my helmet.

57
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,027
She's like, "Justin left."
I'm like...

58
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,570
- He just peaced out?
- "He just left."

59
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,238
And I started crying.

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,074
That's not something you
would usually cry about.

61
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,201
No, never. I've never cried
over a guy in my life.

62
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,122
Never.
And then I called him after.

63
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,957
I was like, "Well, you should
have called me first.

64
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,709
Like, I'm the one
calling you first?"

65
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,336
I got all emotional and was like

66
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,046
"How can you just leave
without saying bye?

I'm done, like, I can't
deal with this anymore."

- Final straw.

I'm on this roller-coaster ride

highs and lows and, like...

00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,434
I like him, and I don't like
him, and it's just...

72
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,353
Whatever.
Roller coasters are so fun.

Uh, you know...

349
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,375
- I'm so hungry.
- Have you ordered yet?

350
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,210
What has been going on?

351
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,006
Everything! What about you?

352
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,259
You know, same old, same old.

353
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,762
So, have you not been
going out at all?

354
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,013
No. Not really.

355
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,682
Are you not friends with, uh...

356
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,518
Frankie and all them anymore,
or are you?

357
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,103
I mean, I was never really
friends with them.

358
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,730
Yes, you were.

359
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,941
Only because that was
Spencer's friends.

360
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,401
I never hung out with them
before that, you know?

361
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,695
Is Spencer still friends
with those kids?

362
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,030
Um, I don't think
Spencer and Brody

363
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,866
are really like,
friends anymore.

364
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,284
Spencer and Brody?

365
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,786
'You know what happened was'

366
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,829
Brody was saying things
about Lauren.

367
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,289
I can't hear you.

368
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,249
Brody was saying things
about Lauren?

369
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,627
So then, he starts
hanging out with her.

370
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,295
And Spencer's like,
"You know what, dude?

371
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,088
He's like
where's your loyalty?"

372
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,799
He's like, you know
who spread all those rumors

373
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,717
is Brody Jenner.

374
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,927
It's like
and she's hanging out with

375
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,846
Brody Jenner as her new friend?

376
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,848
We don't know that, though.

377
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,183
I do know that.

378
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,810
I-I never...
I wasn't the one.

379
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,436
- How would I know?
- How do you know that?

380
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,482
Because I heard him
say things about it.

381
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,234
But that's their relationship,
you know?

382
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,446
It's just sad
how in the past year

383
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,115
so like, so many
of our close friendships

384
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,034
'have just like disintegrated.'

385
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,286
Like, this time last year,
you know, like...

386
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,998
Like me and Lauren were having
the best time of our...

387
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,582
like, having so much fun.

388
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,584
Then maybe you'll be
friends again.

389
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,879
'You know what she said to me
when we were fighting?'

390
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,630
She's like, "You know that I

391
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,340
"don't want to be friends
with you right now.

392
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,842
You know that we need
our space right now."

393
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,010
And I was like, "Yeah,"
she's like...

394
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,970
"But if you ever needed me

395
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,472
"really needed me at 2:00 a.m.
in the morning crying

396
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,558
you know I'd be there
in a second."

397
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,143
Well, if you talk to her,
tell her I say hello.

398
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,478
Do you think that you would ever

399
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,815
like, be friends with her again?

400
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,984
It's funny how one...

401
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,823
It's just funny
how things happen.

402
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,283
You know?

403
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,077
I don't really care.

404
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,873
Yes, you do.
