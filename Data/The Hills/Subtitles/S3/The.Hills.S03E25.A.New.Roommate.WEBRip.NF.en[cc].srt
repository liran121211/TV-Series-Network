00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,634
So we're supposed to fold
this stuff up in tissue

2
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,512
and then ship it back
to New York.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,848
- So cool.
- 'So how's Audrina?'

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,016
I haven't heard from her
in a long time.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,852
Me neither.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,603
- You haven't either?
- 'Uh-huh, she's good.'

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,772
- She's been busy.
- 'She is?'

8
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,398
- She's been okay?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,233
She keeps running
into Heidi places.

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,902
What do you mean
running into Heidi places?

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,446
I mean, like, every time she
goes out, she's been seeing her.

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,239
Do they get
in confrontations or...

13
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,033
No, it's...
No, no, she's friendly.

14
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,743
- 'Oh, she's friendly?'
- T-They're friends.

15
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,746
Oh.

16
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,707
It puts us all in a little bit
of an awkward position

17
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,250
because it's like,
it's both of our homes

18
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,879
and so she should be able to do
whatever she wants there.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,673
- Why, because she came over?
- She's been over, yeah.

20
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,009
And I can't tell her
what to do in her home.

21
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,844
But at the same time,
it's my home as well

22
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,638
and I don't want people in there
that I don't get along with.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,391
Yeah, I completely
understand that.

It was really good. You're going
out to Goa with us, right?

31
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,126
- Yeah, come to Goa.

Ooh. Maybe these shoes.

and seeing how Spencer
was behaving

64
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,415

wanna have a girls' night

with her, do you?

Don't freak out.

Well, I don't care.
If she's there, like, maybe

75

maybe this will be, like,
the first time it's okay.

she always had a problem

00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,586
- Dinner.
- 'Who'd she go to dinner with?'

170
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,755
- 'Justin Bobby.'
- That's not true.

171
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,550
Yes, it is true and it actually
kind of freaks me out.

172
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,760
Wait, that's so weird.
Maybe she'll bring Heidi

173
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,012
'and Justin Bobby
to the new house.'

174
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,722
That's not allowed.

- Oh, you're in to eat dinner.
- Where did you come from?

183
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,878
- How are you?
- Good. How you doing?

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,838
Good. You smell good.

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,006
- Really?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,633
I haven't showered in weeks.

187
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,177
[chuckles]

188
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,596
I like your leathers.

189
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,514
It looks like you miss
the bike, huh?

190
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,517
Come on. A little bit?

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,560
- A little bit.
- 'Little bit?'

192
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,520
Yeah.

193
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,230
I don't think
anybody's, I don't I...

194
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,982
I don't think anybody's
been on it since.

195
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

196
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,236
I got a solo seat
and I haven't had anybody on it.

197
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,990
Wow. What have you been up to?

198
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,451
Hanging out. Doing the move.

199
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,244
So your new place
is by the beach?

200
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,829
- Mm-hmm.
- That's so nice.

201
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,872
I'm excited. It's good.

202
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,750
Change is good.
People are different.

203
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,085
I needed to get
my priorities straight.

204
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,004
Yeah.

205
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,881
'Remember the first, our first
little date we went to?'

206
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,634
How long ago was that?

207
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,302
'Long.'

208
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,761
Do you think about all the BS

209
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,347
that's been on between
that time and right now?

210
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,265
I know. A lot.

211
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,643
It's, like, I'm just
over all that stuff.

212
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,977
- Yeah.
- You know?

213
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,270
I have my own stuff going on.

214
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,564
I don't want any more drama.

215
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,525
Like Lauren still won't
talk or look at Heidi.

216
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:36,196
But I see Heidi out now
and, like, we're okay.

217
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,696
No, she seems really nice.

218
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,616
Yeah. We used to be
really good friends.

219
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,783
Okay.

220
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,327
Like we talked about you

221
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,620
when she came over
the other week.

222
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,079
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

223
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,206
It-It might cause
a little drama.

224
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,999
Oh? A little?

225
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,835
[laughing]

226
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,671
It's not nice
when you fall away from people

227
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,132
but when you, when you kind of
regroup again, it's kind of...

228
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,217
- Good company.
- Absolutely.

229
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,801
Yeah.

230
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,095
- You know, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

231
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,890
What are you gonna do
later tonight?

232
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,016
I don't know.

233
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,852
Uh-oh.

- Good morning.

239
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,503
- She lives.
- 'I live.'

240
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,962
Can I have the other half?

241
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,173
- Yeah. I saved it for you.
- Okay. Cool.

242
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,009
So what happened to you
last night? I tried calling you.

243
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,302
- You did?
- Yeah.

244
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,929
I didn't see your call.

245
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,265
'Justin and I went out
pretty late last night.'

246
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,684
- How's he doing?
- 'He's doing really good.'

247
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,978
- That's good.
- He's cleaned up.

248
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,397
Did he burp in your face?

249
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,232
No, he didn't burp at all.

250
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,483
- He didn't burp once.
- Wow.

251
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,444
He's doing good.
I'm happy for him.

252
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,320
So you guys are good
just being friends?

253
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,990
There's always
gonna be something.

254
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,119
I think you still love him.

255
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,581
I don't know. It's like you
and Jason or Stephen, you know?

256
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,417
No, it's not, because I
stopped going back to Jason.

257
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,586
We didn't go on a date
like a date date

258
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,003
like a we-wanna-get-back
together date.

259
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,005
We just went out and talked.

260
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,717
Tomato, to-mah-to...
Call it what you want.

261
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,886
He kept asking me a bunch
of questions about Heidi.

262
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,888
It seems like you and Heidi
are becoming friends again.

263
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,848
I don't know, it's like
whenever you stop talking

264
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,559
to someone who's,
you were really close to

265
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,352
it's like, a good friend,
like, I feel like

266
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,980
I have one of my friends back,
you know?

267
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,398
'I need a spoon.'

268
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,567
Alright, I'm gonna go get
dressed and get ready.

269
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,859
Okay.

270
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,169
[knock on door]

271
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,175
Comin'.

272
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,763
Look who it is.

273
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,846
Steph's not here.

274
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,056
Steph's not here?

275
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,351
She is not.

276
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,978
- Oh.
- Can I help you?

277
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,981
Yeah, I just wanted to come
and see how you are.

278
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,108
I thought you were here
to see Steph.

279
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,568
Okay.

280
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,236
So you came here
to hang out with Stephanie

281
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,030
and now you're pretending
like you wanna talk to me.

282
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:28,201
- Well, now that I'm here.
- Oh. What's going on?

283
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,036
I went to, uh, to Goa

284
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,454
the other night
with your sister.

285
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,498
Cool. Did you have fun?

286
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,915
No. Actually, I didn't.

287
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,293
Because, uh, your sister
was, you know

288
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,045
like hanging out with Lauren

289
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,463
and I felt really uncomfortable.

290
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,633
And she was, like,
pretty icy to me.

291
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,386
I can't believe you would go to
a club where she was even there.

292
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,347
No, it was awful.
It was a really bad night.

293
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,265
Um, I know you probably
want to vent about this

294
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,226
but I really have
no sympathy for you

295
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,645
'cause who do you expect
to find at Goa?

296
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,481
Oh, I was just trying to be,
like, the bigger person and be...

297
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,651
Why even try? You think you guys
are gonna move back in together?

298
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,944
All of a sudden, everything's
gonna be hunky-dory?

299
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,448
No offense,
I really don't wanna talk

300
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,285
about you out at clubs, so...

301
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,580
Maybe you should wait
for my sister to come back.

302
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,998
You know what, I got to go.

303
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,084
'Will you tell Steph I said hi?'

304
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,128
It was great seeing you.
Enjoy your space.

305
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,963
Yeah, it was great
seeing you too.

306
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,298
You look great.

Okay, so I was thinking
more about the house.

312
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,659
I haven't really
talked to Audrina.

313
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,702
About moving in?

314
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,496
Do you wanna live with her?

315
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,164
'I love livin'
with Audrina.'

316
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,587
Remember, like the night that
Audrina had a date with Justin

317
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,380
the first meeting
of Justin Bobby

318
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,049
when we named him Justin Bobby?

319
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,594
That's what it would be like
every night living together.

320
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,637
Fun!

321
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,054
[laughs]

322
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,640
Audrina brings dirty boys home

323
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,601
and I'm like, "Hey, friend,
wanna hang out?"

324
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,269
Want me to torment you forever?

325
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,563
To be fair,
they're not all dirty.

326
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,941
Justin Bobby was just
exceptionally dirty.

327
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,443
That's funny.
Hey! How are you, sweetie?

328
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,945
Good. Tired.

329
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,529
You have the same pants on?

330
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,823
Yes, we have the same pants on.

331
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,742
That's amazing.

332
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,953
We were gonna order food for you
but didn't know what you'd want.

333
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,080
Um, I'll just get whatever
they got and then soup.

334
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,249
- Okay.
- It's good.

335
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,585
Um, you went out to dinner
with Justin last night, right?

336
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,507
Um, no, we just went out
and we caught up

337
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,218
and like, he said he stopped
drinking for now, anyways.

338
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,386
Really?

339
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:00,227
Um, Lo and I were talking about
how the lease is running up.

340
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,437
Yeah.

341
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,063
Um, so we have to kind of start

342
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,858
figuring out
what our plan is afterwards.

343
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,192
Do you know
what you're gonna do yet?

344
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:10,613
I mean, I haven't
really thought about it.

345
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,115
Well, we were thinking about
possibly getting a house.

346
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,241
It's totally up to you,
whatever you want.

347
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,952
Have you guys already
been looking?

348
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,621
- A little bit, but not like...
- Kind of.

349
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,622
Oh.

350
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,753
(Lo)
'So this is what
we were thinking about'

351
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,463
and we didn't know,
like, if you

352
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,299
like had a plan yet
or were thinking about it, so...

353
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,468
Well, yeah.
I mean, I'm definitely open.

354
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,639
Yeah, it's, it's gonna be,
like, a weird change.

355
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,224
But at the same time,
like, Lauren and I

356
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,433
have known each other
for so long

357
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,227
and, you know, like,
the social aspect

358
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,021
of it is gonna be different

359
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,981
but still just as fun, you know?

360
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:53,322
Well, I mean, if you guys want
me to move in with you, I will.

361
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,200
- For sure.
- Yay! I'm so excited!
