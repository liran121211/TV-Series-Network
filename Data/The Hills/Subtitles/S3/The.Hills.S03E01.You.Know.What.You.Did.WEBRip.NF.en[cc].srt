00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,050
- Hey!
- Hey!

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,345
Look at you with your own desk.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,138
I know, so official.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,349
Oh, my God, they moved
everything around in here.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,101
- I know.
- It looks good though.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,729
And all the clothes are more
organized and everything, too.

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,648
Like, all the sweaters
and the shoes back there.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,608
I'm so proud of you
and your new job.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,695
- Thank you.
- Are you gonna be my boss man?

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,280
Supposedly.
How are you doing?

11
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,907
I didn't tell you what happened?

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,116
No.

13
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,785
Started having, like, my friends

14
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,787
coming up to me
and just telling me, like

15
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,331
really, like,
rude, horrible rumors.

16
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,083
Like, the next thing I know,
all the exact same things

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,335
they were telling me, like

18
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,044
ended up, like, on the Internet.

19
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,213
Horrible.

20
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,089
And it got back to Laguna

21
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,174
and my parents.

22
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,759
What were the rumors?

23
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,928
They basically were
saying that, like

24
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,931
me and Jason made, like,
inappropriate videotapes.

25
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:56,891
Ay.

26
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,434
'Who does that?'

27
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,689
I just could never understand
hating someone so much

28
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,816
that you want to do something
like that to them.

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,905
Have you heard
from Heidi, lately?

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,579
[upbeat music]

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,224
- Delivery!
- Hey! You got the TVs?

32
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,019
- What is that?
- 'A jelly aquarium.'

33
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,938
[laughs]
A what?

34
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,398
I didn't even know you were
looking for a fish tank.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,816
Are you working on invites?

36
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,401
- Yeah, I was.
- Look at you.

37
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,862
I need the guest list
of who's coming

38
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,572
for the housewarming party.

39
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,323
The guests? I don't think
we have a guest list.

40
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,200
'Cause I invite friends
and tell friends

41
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,786
to invite friends,
so I don't know what...

42
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,328
So, how many people are coming?

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,707
(Spencer)
'I invited Brody, Frankie'

44
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,166
I invited your boy.

45
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,378
I invited Gino, Panaro.
What about you?

46
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,589
Who are you gonna invite?

47
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:15,218
I'll invite Lauren and Audrina
and then, um, Whitney.

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,263
I already invited.
That's pretty much it.

49
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,890
We'll see if we can
get them on the list.

50
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,894
[chuckles]

00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,983
[instrumental music]

52
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,914
- Hey!
- Hi. How are you?

53
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,958
Good. Haven't seen you
in so long.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,167
- How's work going?
- Good.

55
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,004
Yeah? You just sit
here by yourself?

56
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,174
Um, Spencer and I are having
a little housewarming party.

57
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,636
I wanted to see if you
and Lauren wanted to come.

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,305
One for both of you.

59
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,141
If you want to come,
I talked to Whitney

60
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,183
and I think
she should be coming.

61
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,978
- Whitney is gonna go?
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,272
Okay, I'll deliver it to Lauren.

63
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,816
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
so, if you guys can come.

64
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,026
- 'Yeah!'
- If not but...

65
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,485
Um, but it was good seeing you.

66
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,987
I have to go take these
to the mailroom.

67
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,405
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

68
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,869
[instrumental music]

69
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,709
Oh, my God.

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,085
- Chiara.
- Hi.

71
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,586
Oh, my God.

72
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,048
Heidi just came in here right
now.

73
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,256
Is she still here?

74
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,299
No, she just left.

75
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,342
What was she doing here?

76
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,802
She came her to give us

77
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,846
housewarming invitations.

78
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,390
Argh, I didn't even tell you
the story, but, like

79
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,351
she hasn't called Lauren once
since she's moved out.

80
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,311
We've heard from friends
that her and Spencer

81
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,147
were talking so much crap
on Lauren

82
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,482
saying really mean,
mean things.

83
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,568
'Saying that Lauren was no one
without Heidi'

84
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,695
and she could never get in
any club without her.

85
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,030
That's so pathetic.

86
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,239
You know what's the bad thing?

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,782
Lauren's mom called her.

88
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,450
She was like, "Lauren...

89
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,537
"...there's these rumors
on, on these websites

90
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,915
saying that you and Jason
have a sex-tape out."

91
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,708
And Lauren's like, "What?"

92
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,543
I cannot even imagine.

93
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,170
Even if these rumors
are going around

94
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,963
she could have called her
and been, like

95
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,256
you know, like, "I'm sorry."
Like, "Are you okay?"

96
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,632
Even if they had
nothing to do

97
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,842
with the rumors
in the first place.

98
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,343
We don't have any real proof

99
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,054
but they were best friends

100
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,598
and for Heidi just to stand back
and not do anything

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,434
and then for her to come in here
and give us invitations

102
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,104
and expect us to go
to her housewarming party?

103
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,314
- It's not gonna happen.
- No. That's really weird. Ugh.

104
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,401
I mean, I have Lauren's back,
regardless.

[instrumental music]

106
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,658
(Lauren)
'Oh, my God,
I have to tell you something.'

107
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,328
Audrina was at work today,
and Heidi walked into her work.

108
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,914
Really?

109
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,457
She came to give us invitations

110
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,375
'to her housewarming
party tonight.'

111
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,170
That's strange. Does she really
think you're gonna go?

112
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,923
No. She can't think
I'm gonna go.

113
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,592
I feel bad not going,
but at the same time

114
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,012
I just think I would feel really
uncomfortable being there.

115
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,889
- She's in a different world.
- Yeah.

116
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,226
Oh, well, hope she has fun.

117
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,646
So, what are we doing tonight?

118
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,439
'We're going to Les Deux.
You should come.'

119
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,566
Almost every time I go there,
I meet a cute guy.

120
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,485
Really? That sounds fun.

Hi, nice to meet you.

You guys, margarita's in here.

Your apartment is so cute.

Okay.

140
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,144

'Refill, playboy.'

142
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,324
I shouldn't even be drinking.

143
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,909
It's Friday night.
You're 23 years old.

144
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,452
Brody is such a good influence.

145
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,204
Who wants one?

146
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:38,333
Oh, what a nice party.
I'm so glad that you came.

147
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,168
- I know.
- I'm so, so glad...

148
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,212
- I'm so glad to see you.
- I missed you so much.

149
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,133
I'm totally focused on, like,
my real friendships right now.

150
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,550
'Like, you're a very important
person to me.'

151
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,261
I know.

152
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,804
'I'm just really glad that'

153
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,597
you know, I'm here
and we're talking.

I'm just glad that
you're part of my fresh start.

You know, I'm glad
that you're here

00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,518
to really be a part of all this

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,438
because, you know,
you mean so much to me.

158
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,899
- 'Did you invite Lauren?'
- I did.

159
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,195
I wish, you know, she were here
to see how much fun this is.

How are you feeling?

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,762
'I think the girls' pre-party'

165
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,474
before going out
isn't always a good idea.

166
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,893
No. No more.
We can't start so early. Oh.

167
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,022
- I have the worst headache.
- Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,564
'What time did you get home?'

169

6:00 in the morning.

170

The club closes at 2:00.
What did you do for four hours?

171
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,239
We went back
to Justin's apartment.

172
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,574
- So you hooked up with him?
- We made out.

173

[chuckling]

174
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,745
You made out with that guy
from London.

175
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,747
Oh, God.

176
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,417
- You guys kissed a lot.
- No, we didn't.

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,461
- It wasn't just once.
- Really?

178
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,379
Yes.

00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,315
I liked all your friends
last night.

183
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,774
You know, they loved you
actually.

184
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,860
They seem very nice,
all of them.

185
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,238
Oh, Frankie invited us
to his birthday party

186
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,906
at Les Deux tonight.

187
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,825
Oh, yeah?
Is, um, Lauren going?

188
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,660
'Um, she actually
just called me.'

189
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,621
I just missed her call, and I'll
call her back and ask her.

190
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,333
I wish that Audrina and Lauren
would have come last night.

191
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,335
I mean, I totally accept
that she doesn't like me

192
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,546
but she shouldn't take
that out on you.

193
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,715
I know, our friendship
shouldn't suffer from it.

195
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,061

'So, what time do
we have to be at Frankie's?'

196
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,563
(Lauren)
'Let's go around 10:00.'

197
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,482
So, I told you
I saw Brody, right?

198
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,234
He came up to me
and was really nice at first

199
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,528
and then he started
saying how we didn't go

200
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,405
to the housewarming party
and how we missed out.

201
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,324
- That's just rude though.
- It is really rude.

202
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,118
When you've disrespected
someone so much

203
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,327
they're not gonna be
there for you.

204
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,912
They're not, no, not at all.

205
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,122
And at this point,
I have no intention

206
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,873
of being there for her.

207
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,043
Oh, well.
What can you do?

208
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,713
All I know is, "Thank you
for getting out of my life."

209
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,467
Because now I have a better
roommate and a better apartment

210

'and I'm just
in a better situation.'

211
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,309
- Yeah.
- Cheers. Frankie's birthday.

212
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,144
Let's go have fun. Who cares?

213

It's done and over with.

214
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,188
It's gonna be a long night.

And those are the shoes?

00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,946

00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,911
I'm dying to see if Lauren,
Audrina, and Whitney

221
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,538
show up to Frankie's birthday.

222
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,373
Somebody they've known
for three months

223
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,042
and they didn't show up
to their best friend's

225
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,171
So I wrote Lauren
a letter about

226
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,631
'not coming to
the housewarming party.'

227
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,549
Let me read these.

228

them? They're personal.'

Oh!

230
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,348
Okay. So, should we go?

you're a different person.

You're not my friend anymore.
I don't...

I really,
I don't care about you.

I don't ever, ever
wanna talk to you again.

that's really sad, Lauren.

- I feel bad for you.

Lauren, always.'

- No, you're a bad person.
- What did I do? What did I do?

through everything

- Why?

- You know what you did.
- Why? What did I do?

For, uh, Frankie's birthday,
right?

00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,594
So, I walked in
with Frankie and everyone.

Lauren was at the table, right?

284

And she got up
from the table and left.

- So I was like, "Okay." Yeah!
- What?

And it's like I didn't
even think we had a problem.

So I go downstairs
to see what's wrong

00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,857
and she starts looking at me
so crazy, and she's like

"You know what you did,"
and starts screaming at me.

gonna do now?'

any responsibility for it.

I lost her as a friend.

she did to me.

you haven't lost her forever.

know I will never trust again.
