You lived together so...

172
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,547
I mean, I'm gonna try
to be really nice to her

173
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,383
but I just feel like...

174
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,427
I can't believe they're moving
in together already.

throw up.'

- 'I don't know.'

(Whitney)
'They promised
they'd be here on time.'

181
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,044
I hope we don't get in trouble
for keeping them out late.

182
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,133
Hey, they're running
a little late?

183
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,426
Yeah, I don't know.

184
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,219
'Maybe they had car trouble.'

185
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,851
Oh, thank God, they're here.

186
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,859
Do you need me
to do anything, boss man?

187
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,361
So, I'm gonna have you go look

188
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,071
for the 32s in this style,
Lauren.

189

And then once you find them,
steam them and come back.

00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,701
Aye, aye.

191
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,163
And I will take care of Elias.

Oh, you.

193
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,624
- Okay.
- What are you trying to do?

194
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,377
Why are you holding jeans?

195
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,337
- We wanna change your jeans.
- No way, sorry.

196
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,839
- Really?
- I really like these a lot.

197
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,466
These are really nice, though

198
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,218
and they're small,
they're really small.

199
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,094
I know, but I don't like them
'cause they're not mine.

'Sorry.'

You have to meet
with Lisa tomorrow.

I know.

204
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,822

a future in this."

- We have enough glasses.
- What do you want?

00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,493
You wanna register
at Blockbuster?

- Yeah.
- Not happening.

You want some more of these?

wanted one of these.

for you to have.

registering?'

'You don't wanna do this?'

I don't know what we really
need from anybody.

that we need.

you're into any of this.

we're not gonna use.

in high school.

you'd be happy for me.

didn't really wanna take off
this pair of pants

I told him I understood.

We had all gone out
the night before.

of getting to know them.

'Going out with them
is beyond my job?'

We wanted to entertain them make
them feel comfortable

307
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,604
because they were only in LA for
a certain amount of time.

308
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,107
They were late because
they were out the night before

309
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,694
or they were late because the
car didn't pick them up on time?

310

I don't know the details
of why they were late.

I just want respect on every
shoot that we do.

312
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,201
And it's very hard
for them to respect you

313
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,036
if you've been out
the night before.

314
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,705
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,708
No, you know what?
You just need to step it up now.

on the shoot, it's your fault.

about the wedding?

324
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,157
I was thinking maybe fall?

325
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,160
Or should we do it
in the spring or..

326
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,290
I think we need to look
at some calendars.

picked out.

- We're not going to Tibet.

We're gonna fly
our whole family to Tibet?

Why do we have to have
our whole families there?

00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,260
Well, I thought
we were eloping.

00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,095
I want the wedding
and we need to register.

333

And I want the dress
and...you know.

So marriage this is what
a little girl dreams of.

335
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,562
I mean, you really don't think
your parents would mind

336
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,149
if they're not even there
for the actual wedding?

337
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,484
I haven't really spoken
to my parents

338
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,486
too much about me
getting married.

339
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,488
You haven't told your parents
that we're getting married?

340
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,074
I can't believe you haven't
told your parents.

- Why, are you embarrassed?
- Embarrassed?

342
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:40,667
- Why would I be embarrassed?
- Why wouldn't you tell them?

343
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,961
[upbeat music]

344
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,806
So, basically, I just got

345
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,351
a nice little
ass whipping from Lisa.

346
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,770
- Really?
- 'It was not really good.'

347
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,814
So I think the gist is

348
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,941
I'll just have to do
a better job next time.

349
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,989
So you seem a little dazed.

350
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,491
- I'm just out of it today.
- What's going on?

351
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,660
We had Jason's party
last night that we went to.

352
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,203
Oh, and you met his girlfriend?

353
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:22,041
- Well, I met his fiancee.
- Fiancee?

354
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,879
- They just got engaged.
- Oh, my God.

355
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,006
- I can't believe that.
- It was weird.

356
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,256
Of course, it's weird.

357
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,758
You just dated him a year ago

358
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,677
and then all of a sudden
he has a fiancee?

359
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,970
Like, that is so strange.

360
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,722
It's not even weird
in that way.

361
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,932
It's just like I think I just
have an idea in my head

362
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,018
of how I'd want my, like, party

363
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,436
where I'd announce
my engagement to be.
- Yeah.

364
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,774
And it, it didn't include a keg
or a Bob Marley poster.

365
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,275
'You know what I mean?'

366
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,069
Like, it was really, like,
it was diffi...

367
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,154
It was difficult
to take seriously.

368
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,781
You know, the program
he's in he's not even

369
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,408
supposed to be dating anyone.

370
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,951
And, like, I just
don't wanna be the one

371
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,619
to pick up the pieces again.

372
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,080
And you won't. Don't let
yourself be that person.

373
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,123
You know, like, maybe
the best thing is to not

374
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,126
talk to him for a while
and let him fall down

375
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,295
and let him pick himself
back up.

376
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,006
Yeah, but I've seen him fall
down. He falls hard.

377
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,261
There was a point where I was
there last night looking around.

378
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,888
It really just hit me
all at once

379
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,223
I was like,
"This could have been me."

380
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:24,144
And as much as I love Jason,
I'm so glad it's not.
