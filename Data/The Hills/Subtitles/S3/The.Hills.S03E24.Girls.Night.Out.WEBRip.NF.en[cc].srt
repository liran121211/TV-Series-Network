I didn't hook up with anybody!

340
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,287
I was there with
my friends and you

341
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,622
embarrassed me
in front of everybody...

342
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,206
- I embarrassed you?
- Yes!

343
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,834
- For standing at a bar?
- Okay, you know what?

344
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,794
Next time I stand at a bar

345
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,796
and there happens
to be some guys there

346
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,046
and I'm flirting
with them taking shots

347
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,757
let's see how you feel.

348
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,467
Bottom line is, you're
delusional if you think

349
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,969
I was flirting
with those girls.

350
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,553
How long is
relationship vacation?

351
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,972
Like, am I supposed
to not go to bars

352
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,515
and not talk to people
for how many months?

353
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,726
I just don't think I can
just keep waiting around

354
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,020
all year long, to wait
for when Heidi decides

355
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,814
she wants to get off
relationship vacation.

371
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,439
making some changes
in our LA office.

372
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,400
Hi, you're going
to the party, right?

373
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,276
Can you make sure everybody
out there has wristbands?

374
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,071
- I'm going, we have two, so...
- But, she's talking about...

375
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,322
No, but I'm talking
about this party

376
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,782
before we go to the other party.

377
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,325
- Oh, I didn't even know there...
- Yeah.

378
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,536
There's one in that
green room for Mercedes.

379
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,580
And then can you get
an assistant to get a taxi

380
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,373
for my nanny and my daughter
to get back?

381
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,583
Yeah, okay, we'll
just figure out

382
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,210
the wristbands and then, okay...

383
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,713
