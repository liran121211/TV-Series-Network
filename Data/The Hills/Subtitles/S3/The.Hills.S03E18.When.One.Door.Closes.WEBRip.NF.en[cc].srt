00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,420
- Hi, Whitney, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,840
Great, you know Kimball from New
York.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,842
- 'He just arrived.'
- Welcome.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,468
With very exciting news for you.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,970
- Really?
- Yes.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,806
We're going
to send you to Paris.

7
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,766
- Par... Again to Paris?
- Yes.

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,977
You are the lucky chosen one

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,146
to go to Paris with Kimball
to go to the Crillon Ball.

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,690
(Kim) 'It's-it's kind
of the most surreal'

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,817
mix of celebrities' children

12
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,570
and authentic, like,
aristocrats and royalty.

13
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,448
Yeah, you might
come back a princess.

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,325
That wouldn't be bad.

15
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,328
You'll have so much fun,
but you'll work really hard.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,454
- As always.
- Alright.

17
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,373
- Okay.
- See you soon.

18
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, and what about Lauren?

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,250
Is she coming?

20
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,377
I think Lauren had her chance

21
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,253
to go to Paris.

22
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,965
[instrumental music]

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,737
- Hey.
- Hey.

24
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,488
What's going on?

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,156
[sighs]

26
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,993
I got in another
huge fight with Spencer.

27
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,244
What were you fighting about?

28
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,787
We've been fighting
about all this stupid

29
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,707
wedding stuff,
and I told his sister

30
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,291
like, "Look, I think

31
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,710
'this is all getting
way out of hand."'

32
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,795
And so then I guess she told him

33
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,923
I was getting cold feet,
and he took it

34
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,841
'like I didn't wanna marry him.'

35
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,968
I just think we need
to work on our relationship

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,177
and not this wedding.

37
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,429
Like, let's just get back to us.

38
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,931
Right.

39
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:37,973
I feel like you guys
keep fighting

40
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,558
and then it's okay.

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,268
And then you guys
are fighting again, like

42
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,811
you're not really
getting to the root of, like...

43
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,396
- Why you guys are...
- Right.

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,981
...getting so upset
with each other, you know?

45
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,108
I feel like
I'm in a relationship

46
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,902
with a five-year-old.

47
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,820
I just don't know what to do.

48
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,531
Like, I gave up
everything for him, you know?

49
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,491
Yeah.

50
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,578
I just need some breathing
room for a minute.

51
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,289
[instrumental music]

52
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,065
- Morning.
- Hi.

53
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,650
What are you doing here early?

54
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,443
I thought
I was gonna beat you here.

55
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,945
(Whitney)
'Lisa wanted to see me.'

56
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,531
And I actually just found out

57
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,992
I'm going to Paris.

58
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,785
- Again?
- 'Yeah.'

59
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:40,953
For what?

60
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,788
For this Crillon Ball.

61
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,332
'Lisa and Kimball'

62
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,167
asked if I would go
and help out.

63
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,129
Are they sending anybody else?

64
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,841
- Uh, I don't think so.
- Oh.

65
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,300
Obviously, if I had my choice

66
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,677
I would want you there with me.

67
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,261
No, I know.

68
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,097
(Whitney) 'Are you upset?'

69
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,977
I just shouldn't have passed
the first time.

70
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,228
The first time was all
situational, though, you know?

71
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,564
You can't take
back those things.

72
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,900
I just, like,
I tried to work really hard

73
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,904
to show her, but...it's fine.

74
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:16,989
You're just disappointed
that you...

75
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,366
I'm just...

76
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,909
I mean, when am I
gonna have a chance

77
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,452
to go again, you know?

78
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,746
I know.

79
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,206
[inhales deeply]

80

[exhales sharply]

81
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,293
Stupid Jason.

[instrumental music]

83
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,195
(Stephanie) Hey.

84
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,412
What's wrong?

85
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,873
I walked out
on another fight with Heidi.

86
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,791
What?

87
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,293
- Where did you go?
- Just home.

88
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,838
- To mom and dad's?
- Yeah.

89
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,464
What did mom and dad say?

90
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,301
I'm an idiot.

91
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,722
Have you talked to her?

92
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,640
Oh, my God.

93
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,975
I'd kill you.

94
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,185
This is bad.

95
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,228
I don't know what to do.

96
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,148
You've got to send her
an e-mail or something.

97
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,484
I mean, you can just say <i>adios</i>

98
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,361
to the relationship
if you don't try.

99
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,322
[instrumental music]

100
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

101
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,061
What are you doing?

102
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm just doing magazine cuts.

103
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,023
'Oh.'

104
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,651
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,487
Uh, Whitney found out she's
going to Paris again today.

106
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,572
They're sending her,
there's like a Crillon Ball

107
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,908
and they need help dressing

108
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,202
'so they're sending her again.'

109
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,705
She actually gets to go
to the ball, too.

110
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,250
It seems like this year
Lisa would have invited you

111
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,584
'or, like, let you go 'cause...'

112
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,253
But, like,
why would, why would she

113
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,255
invite me, like, when I said no?

114
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,299
You know what I mean, like,
they offered me an opportunity

115
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,134
that, like, I probably

116
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,802
didn't even deserve at the time.

117
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,554
And I said no to it

118
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,389
and for a careless reason.

119
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,268
So, they have no reason
to offer it to me again.

120
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,897
That sucks you can't go.

121
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,191

Okay, thanks.

- Okay, just a minute.
- Thank you.

You're welcome.

[footsteps approaching]

00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,659
Hey.

132
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,495
She left.

133
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,622
- Really?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,876
- For the day, night?
- I don't know.

135
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,837
She said
she was leaving early, so.

136
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,090
[sighs]

137
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,217
If I were you, I would call her.

138
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,721
Okay, well,
if you speak with her

139
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,139
tell her I came by.

140
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,182
- I will.
- Take it easy.

141
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,267

- Inventory.
- Oh, putting away those bags?

146
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,597
Yeah, they've been sitting
there for so long.

147
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,975
- 'How are you?'
- I'm good. What's up?

148
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,851
Have you started shopping yet?

149
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,979
No, I just wanted
to start making a list

150
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,647
actually, of what
I think I needed.

151
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,857
Coats, lots of coats.

152
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,443
Lots of coats, right.

153
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,153
Gloves, ear muffs.

154
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,321
Like, it's freezing there.

155
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,529
Have you ever been t-there

156
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,615
in this time of year before?

157
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,200
- Where?
- 'Paris.'

158
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,952
'Or have you never
been there before?'

159
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,078
I've never been.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,205
Oh.

161
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,708
Coats, gloves, hats.

162
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,752
If you... You need
a couple of nice dresses.

163
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,629
You'll probably
have to go to events.

164
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,756
I know. I only have, like,
a couple days to do this.

165
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,259
- I'm going on Thursday.
- Are you excited?

166
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,345
Yeah. I don't know
how I couldn't be.

167
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,887
I know it's gonna be
a lot of work

168
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,056
but it just sounds so fun.

'I really need
to practice my French.'

00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,978
I love guys with French accents.

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,688
It sounds like
they're singing everything.

172
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,233
I don't know why accents
are just so attractive.

173
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,526
- 'Cause they're different.
- Yeah.

- Did she say why?
- No.

[Lisa speaking French]

184
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,851
Hi, Lauren, how are you?

185
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,478
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

186
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,563
I just got off
the phone with Ophelie.

187
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,899
She's the director
of the fabulous ball

188
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,775
'that Whitney is going to.'

189
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,195
And Kimball is overwhelmed, so

190
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,489
'they need to send
additional help.'

191
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,117
- So, you are going to Paris.
- I'm gonna go to Paris?

192
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,702
(Lisa) 'You'll go
with Kimball and Whitney'

193
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,871
and help Ophelie backstage.

194
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,789
It is a bit of a fashion show

195
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,666
because all the girls
have to be presented

196
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,085
so they'll need your help.

197
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,627
Thank you so much.

198
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,547
Who's gonna take you
to the airport?

199
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,424
- I've always dropped my...
- 'You'll go with Whitney.'

200
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,300
She'll make sure
you get on the plane.

201
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,094
Do you think I wouldn't
get on the plane this time?

202
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,221
Oh, I don't know,
last time you didn't go so...

203
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,931
- Have you learned your lesson?
- Yes.

204
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,307
Because it's my favorite city
in the world.

205
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,392
(Lauren) 'I know.'

206
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,726
I ran away from home

207
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,228
when I was 15 to go to Paris.

208
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,855
- Fifteen?
- It changed my life.

209
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,648
And hopefully
it'll change your life, too.

210
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,401
'And it's just magical.'

211
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,319
It's just an incredible
sophistication

212
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,071
that you've never seen before.

213
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,822
I think it'll be an incredibly

214
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,741
inspiring trip for you.

215
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,702
[instrumental music]

216
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,374
I'm going to Paris with you.

217
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,666
Oh, my God!

218
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,627
I am so excited.

219
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,629
We're gonna have so much fun!

220
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,465
We're gonna get to fly
out there together.

221
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,800
That just made my day.

222
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,595
Uh, made my life. Try.

[instrumental music]

224
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,320
I would pull out your chair,
but it looks like...

225
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,156
- It's stationary.
- It's pretty fixated in there.

226
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,907
Whoo!

227
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,827
I had a good day at work today.

228
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,662
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,539
Remember how I told you
Whitney's going to Paris?

230
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,873
Yeah.

231
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,875
I get to go, too, now.

232
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,669
Wow.

233
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,795
When is this all going down?

234
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,173
Uh, I leave Thursday.

235
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,091
This Thursday?

236
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,177
It's really nice to know that
you're not gonna miss me at all.

237
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,677
I didn't say
I wasn't gonna miss you.

238
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,265
I'm just, I'm so excited
to go, I mean...

239
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,475
I'm a little sad
that you're leaving

240
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,101
but I'm happy for you to go.

241
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,603
Why are you sad your single
friend is leaving?

242
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,313
What?

243
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,565
There's a lot
of single people in LA.

244
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,942
There's a lot of single
people in Paris, too.

245
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,944
Stinky people
with hairy armpits.

[gasps]

247
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,448
Those are just the girls,
I think.

248
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,034
Um, the guys...stinky.

249
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,286
Well, I'll find
a Parisian that showers.

250
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,996
So, what, you really want
to find a boyfriend?

251
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,080
Is that what it is?

252
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,625
Where did that come from?

253
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,001
I don't know.

254
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,087
What are you saying?

255
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,556
I don't know, I just haven't
had the best, like, honestly...

256
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,432
I have not had the best
relationships in the past.

257
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,393
So, therefore I'm scared
to get into a relationship.

258
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,186
Nobody's had the best
relationships in the past.

259
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,646
That's why they end.

260
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,815
If you really want
to be with someone

261
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,484
it should be someone
you really like.

262
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,403
Someone you're really,
someone you're really proud

263
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,112
to be with,
and you should want to call them

264
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,864
your boyfriend or girlfriend.

Well, hello, stranger.

269
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,627
I thought you changed
the locks on me.

270
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,715
What are you packing for?

271
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,092
I think I'm just gonna
go home for a little bit.

272
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,429
To Colorado?

273
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,514
Yep.

274
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,183
So...

275
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,103
Where were you?

276
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,522
Giving you space.

277
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,566
Well...

278
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,487
- I'm gonna give you some space.
- I don't need space.

279
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,656
I didn't need space
either, but now I do.

280
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,324
So, you can think
about what you want.

281
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,992
I'll think about what I want.

282
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,868
I know what I want.

283
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,830
[sighs] I just don't know
what else to do.

284
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,500
When are you coming back?

285
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,464
You can stay here. You can
have the place to yourself.

286
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,425
I need to go home.

287
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,766
So, I assume the wedding

288
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,186
isn't going to happen
anytime soon?

289
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,021
It's not working.

290
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,397
I need some space.

291
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,069
Okey-dokey.

a day off to actually'

or, like, shop.'

'So, do you know your French?'

295
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,318
Obviously.

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,778

<i>Je m'appelle.</i>

00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,581
- I don't know.
- You'll do fine.

303
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,416
Time to pile in the shoes.

304
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,084
- Want me to help you?
- Sure.

305
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,086
- Just your boots...
- Stack them in here.

306
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,629
You have a lot of black.

307
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,214
Black goes with everything.

308
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,091
Don't forget your passport.

309
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,593
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

310
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,261
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

311
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,638
I stuck it right there.
Oh, my God!

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,892
I would have gone to the airport
without my passport.

Dude, I hope I packed enough.
I feel like I didn't.

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,854
- I'm really scared.
- I'm sure whatever you don't...

315
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,647
[gasps]
Whitney's an over-packer.

316
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,357
- She'd have been upset.
- Yeah.

317
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,650
- 'You got it all?'
- Yeah, I'm good.

318
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,444
Okay.

- Well, bye!
- Okay.

I love you, and I will call you
when I get to...

- Be safe.
- I will.

322
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,077
- Alright, there.
- Are you sure you got it?

323
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,995
I got it.

324
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,581
- There.
- Okay, bye.

325
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,998

329
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,427
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

330
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,389
Are you sure
you want me to put this in?

331
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,933
Put it in the trunk, Brody.

332
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,309
Come on!

Oh, I think the trunk's broken.

336

- Close it.
- It's not closing.

337
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,983
Oh, God!

338
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,276
- Whoa.
- Did I really get your finger?

00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,069
No, no, no, you're good.

Yeah, I am.

I won't be gone that long.

- I won't be gone that long.

345

I'll miss you.

346
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,583
I'll be back really quick.

00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,668
Okay.

348
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,710
Be safe.

349
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,503
I will.

00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,964
Okay?
