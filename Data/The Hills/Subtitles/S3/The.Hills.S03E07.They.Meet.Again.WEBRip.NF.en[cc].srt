Where do you and Justin stand,

You know how I said,
it would make it or break it?

What did you do?

- Not too much.

Amy Astley has decided that she
wanted a fashion house involved

'and Marc Jacobs
is showcasing Marc by Marc.'

of being out of the box

a really fun party.

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,832
If we can narrow
the location down to two options

52
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,876
to present to Amy,
that would be ideal.

53
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,837

And then a guy from

00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,698
wanted you to call him back so
I took down all their numbers.

that will always get through

64
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,037
are Spencer, Brent, Jen.

But, yeah, other than that

66
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,165
these are pretty much
just, you know...

through for sure.

write down for you.

This is the dining room
on the right.

72
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,062
And then here,
you have the living room.

73
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,980
And then, next to that,
you have the library.

74
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,899
So, if you have a logo
or something from "Teen Vogue"

75
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,901
you can project
it on the three plasmas.

76
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,195
Right, and maybe even while
the fashion show is running

77
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,446
we can like put
the fashion show on here

78
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,241
so people can watch it
upstairs and downstairs.

79
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,994
All I'm just gonna go make sure
the terrace door is unlocked.

And it's okay. I'll leave you
guys here to take a look around.

I'll be right back.

- Jason.

- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God!

to see him again, obviously.
- Yeah.

'Cause he used to be the
one I told everything to.'

it was too small

I feel like we should
look outside of hotels

because I don't think a hotel
is gonna have the space.

173
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,400
Maybe she picked him up
at rehab.

174
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,235
Maybe she picked him up
out of jail.

175
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,945
[laughing] Oh. I wouldn't know.

176
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,448
Maybe they're back into
movie-making action.

177
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,036
That is crazy.

178
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,662
I just don't like them at all.

179
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,789
- I know.
- I don't think anybody does.

180
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm gonna send over a drink.

181
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,293
My name is Cindy,
if you guys need anything.

182
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,961
Yeah. What should we send them?

183
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,297
Uh, bottle of water for him.

184
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,715
Yeah, and a drink of whatever
she's drinking.

185
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,675
And a Shirley Temple.

186
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,968
- 'Okay.'
- Thanks.

187
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,348
[sighs]

188
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,101
I can't, like, help it.
I just wanna, like, stare.

189
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,394
If you're my friend,
you'll just sit here

190
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,438
and you'll talk to
me and you'll behave.

191
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,649
Bottle of water for you.

192
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,068
'Shirley Temple.'

193
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,652
We're actually fine, thank you.

194
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,988
(Jason) 'Yeah.'

195
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,241
They just sent the drinks back.

196
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,911
[indistinct chatter]
Wow. That was rude.

197
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,038
(Jason)
'I think there's gonna be
some serious beat-downs.'

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,124
'I so want to right now.'

199
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:28,462
Look at me. Them. You.

200
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,213
You're above it.

201
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,507
Besides, if you get hurt
or something happens

202
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,384
I got no driver so...

203
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,094
- Me get hurt by big mouth?
- 'I'm kidding.'

204
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,305
I'm kidding. I know.
I'm kidding.

205
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,722
You know, what I find
actually disturbing?

206
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,723
What?

207
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,559
That after everything

208
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,436
she's really been through
with Jason. Every...

209
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,062
That she's even sitting
here to have dinner him?

210
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,482
And not me,
who was there for her

211
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,900
through all of that hell
is the one she won't talk to

212
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,110
because of you.

213
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,861
I mean, it's just baffling.

214
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,323
It's like, are you-are you
really, are you kidding me?

215
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,243
I wanna go home.

216
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,203
Let's go.
Are you in a bad mood now?

217
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,371
No.

218
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,919
Bye.

219
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,879
Have a good night.

220
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,841
[instrumental music]

221
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,771
She found her perfect match,
though, that's for sure.

222
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,650
(Lauren)
'Honestly, I just feel bad
for the girl.'

223
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,985
(Jason)
'I just knew from day one
that the chick was shady.

224
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,196
'You can't really reach
a higher level'

225
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,905
of betrayal than she did to me.

226
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,033
- And it's like...
- What do you mean to you?

227
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,578
- She did it to me too.
- I know. I know.

228
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,372
The other thing
that was super annoying

229
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,290
is like dude, I've never
met the kid, first off.

230
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,334
- Why would you like...
- Never would wanna meet him.

231
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,127
It's like, what was the point
of coming up and saying that?

232
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,673
It's like, you, you didn't know
us when we were dating.

233
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,342
Don't be like, "Oh, I'm really
glad to see you back together."

234
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,594
It was just like,
unnecessary, like...

235
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,638
"Glad to see you guys
are back together?"

236
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,474
[indistinct chatter]

237
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,078
Sorry that it was a little
bit interrupted but...

238
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,496
Oh, it's okay.

239
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,832
[sighs]

240
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,128
Goodnight.

241
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,048
[instrumental music]

242
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,776
[instrumental music]

243
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,791
- Hi.
- Morning.

244
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,254
- You look so adorable.
- Thank you.

245
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,258
Lisa agreed we should scout
some places other than hotels.

246
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,842
(Lauren) 'Go ahead.'

247
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,637
What's goin' on?

248
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,555
So I made dinner last night.

249
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,931
With Jason?

250
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,767
'How was it?'

251
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,853
Um, it was good until Heidi
and Spencer showed up.

252
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,897
(Whitney) 'What do you mean
they showed up?'

253
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,691
They went
to the same restaurant.

254
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,276
[laughs]

255
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,529
So you didn't, like,
have an encounter?

256
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,990
- Oh, no, there were encounters.
- 'There were?'

257
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,784
Did they came,
did say hi to you?

258
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,827
First they sent us drinks
and we sent them back.

259
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,622
[laughs]

260
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,000
Homeboy would poison my drink.
Are you serious?

261
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,502
Okay. Okay.

262
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,420
Then, next? Next encounter?

263
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,922
Spencer, who...

264
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,216
...has never met Jason before

265
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
feels the need to
walk by and be like

266
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,763
"I think it's really great you
guys are getting back together.

267
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,807
Good."

268
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,266
Like, so rude and I'm like...

269
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,892
(Whitney) 'That's so strange.'

270
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,228
Did it end with you guys
just walking out and...

271
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,230
Oh, no, um...

272
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,776
They, like, yelled goodbye
across the restaurant.

273
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,029
So, what did Jason say
when they came up to you guys

274
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,532
or when they
sent you drinks? Was he...

275
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,158
He doesn't like them.
I mean, obviously.

276
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,661
- He never liked Heidi.
- He never liked Heidi?

277
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,579
He always was, like,
"I really don't like her.

278
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,331
"I don't trust her as your
friend, like, I don't think

279
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,583
I think she's gonna
screw you over and..."

280
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,419
So he had a good intuition
about her.

281
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,255
[instrumental music]

282
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,652
- 'Hey.'
- Hey, Heidi, what's up?

283
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,279
Ugh! You'll never guess
who I ran into.

284
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,906
I went to dinner at Ketchup

285
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,449
and guess who was there
two tables away from us.

286
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,284
'Lauren and Jason.'

287
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,705
So, first of all, we walk up
and they're sitting there.

288
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,666
I just can't believe
she's talking to her

289
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,753
crazy, abusive ex-boyfriend,
who went to rehab and jail

290
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,880
'and she can't forgive me?'

291
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,048
It's like,
is she out of her mind?

292
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,008
So we try to send them over
drinks to be like

293
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,052
"Let's feel out the water."
Like, you know.

294
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,013
So they send them back.
So we're like, okay.

295
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,600
So what exactly
did you do to her

296
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,728
that makes her not even
wanna accept a drink?

297
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,858
And also, you know, you were
also friends with Audrina

298
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,693
and now she doesn't
talk to you anymore.

299
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,319
'You were
friends with Whitney too.'

300
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,029
You don't even know

301
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,407
what's wrong and
what's right anymore and...

302
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,825
It's so sad.

303
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:58,708
Well, I'm gonna finish up
on this so see ya.

304
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,752
[instrumental music]

305
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,389
- Hey.
- Yo.

306
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,725
- What are you doin'?
- Just checkin' out places.

307
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,227
- 'Have you found any yet?'
- Not that I like.

308
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,438
I'll help you find places.
I get the weekend off so...

309
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,440
Well, there's a couple places.

310
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,151
There's a place in Santa Monica.
It's right by the beach.

311
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,445
I wouldn't mind being close
to the water again.

312
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,823
If you live with someone, it
needs to be someone who's sober.

313
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,451
None of my friends are sober.

314
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,953
I'll have sober nights with you.

315
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,666
We can go bowling
and we can go to movies.

316
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,459
We should go to,
like a comedy club.

317
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,670
Exactly. That'd be really fun.

318
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,716
(Jason) 'Nice purse.'

319
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,511
[laughs]

320
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,139
Thanks. My, uh, loser
ex-boyfriend gave it to me.

321
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,683
[laughs]

322
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,314
You're such a jerk.

323
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,733
[instrumental music]

324
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,540
- Oh!
- Ah, right table.

325
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,376
So excited!

326
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,712
They need to get us a little
plaque right here that says

327
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,005
Spencer and Heidi's table.

328
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,715
I know.

329
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,425
[sighs]

330
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,595
I'd like to propose a toast

331
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,849
to my favorite event
director, Heidi Montag

332
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,475
the love of my life,
who reached out

333
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,852
and got what she deserved.

334
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,562
I told you
you wouldn't regret it.

335
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,442
Tired?

336
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,695
I'm so tired.

337
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,906
I went to bed at three.

338
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,741
What were you doing
up that late?

339
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,159
I couldn't fall asleep.

340
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,078
I've been stressing out
a lot about my job.

341
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,207
I've been doing this job
for two years

342
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,584
and I just feel like

343
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,419
I really deserve this promotion.

344
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,545
