Oh, okay, great.

42

Can you bring her in?
Because I have to go.

43
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,155
- Hi, there.
- Hi, how are you?

44
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,826
- Crazy here today.
- I know, I was noticing.

45
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,454
Well, you know, we're doing
all these fashion shows here

46
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,122
and then we're
setting up Paris

47
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,165
we're setting up Los Angeles.

48
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,501
So one of these things is
we're gonna be working

49
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,962
'a lot with a brand
from Australia.'

50
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,797
- Sass & Bide.
- That's awesome.

51
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,799
So I'll just give you
a quick brief, they're here

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,426
'and their show's in the main
tent at Fashion Week tomorrow.'

53
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,095
So here's the problem.

54
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,596
Normally, when people start

55
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,681
we like to give them
all the rules.

56
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,642
- Which come in this book here.
- 'Okay.'

57
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,602
We don't have time for that
today, so what we're gonna do is

58
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,479
we're gonna take you up,
and you're gonna run the fitting

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,481
- 'with Sass & Bide.'
- Okay.

60
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,608
Alright. And then just so you
know you have to wear black.

61
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,610
I don't know if you noticed,
but everybody wears black.

62
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,612
- Okay. Will do.
- 'Okay?'

63
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,363
You're willing to do
whatever it takes?

64
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,491
I'm definitely willing to do
whatever it takes.

65
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,993
That's always
been my work ethic.

- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay?

00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,421
- So, this is our fifth floor.
- Wow, look at that color.

72
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,882
Which is kind of going kooky.

73
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,884
- Uh-huh.
- Isn't it great?

74
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,345
- A lot of great clothes.
- 'It's awesome.'

employee in our LA office.

- Okay? I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay. Right.

It's gonna be a long night.

is not as wearable

- Yeah, I mean, I would.

134
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,098
But I think that you also
wanna show the pants

135
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,516
because I-I don't know
you've done

136
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,059
on all the other models, but...
