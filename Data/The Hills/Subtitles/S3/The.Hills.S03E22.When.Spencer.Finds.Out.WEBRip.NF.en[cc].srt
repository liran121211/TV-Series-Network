- Hey, Kimberly.
- Hi.

179
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,166
I worked S Bar last night

180
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,918
and Lauren had
her birthday party there

181
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,087
and, um, Stephanie was there.

182
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,797
- Spencer's sister, Stephanie?
- Yeah.

183

like, at the club?

184

No, she was there for the party.

- That can't be right.
- Yeah. I don't know.

just kind of checking out

drinks and stuff.

188

over there with them.

Lauren's logic.

192
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,237
But she'll hang out
with my boyfriend's sister.

193
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,490
- I thought it was weird too.
- It's so weird, I don't even...

194
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,783

gonna have to ask

And he had a really big problem
with Brody being my friend.

342
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,408
And it's probably
just a sensitive...

343
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,912
This is exactly,
exactly what it is.

344
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,455
And that's not your fault.

345
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,540
And I'm really, really,
I mean, I don't ever

346
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,542
wanna, like, cause fights
and I'm really sorry.

347
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,210
But you didn't do anything
wrong. You know that.

348
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,421

Yes. Dinner. So what's up?

354
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,360
- You know, don't you?
- What?

355
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,321
That I went
to Lauren's birthday.

356
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,781
Mm-hmm.

357
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,365
I didn't tell you this
just because, like

358
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,033
'we have become friends.'

359
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,119
And I know you wanna
be friends with her.

'You do, don't you?'

361
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,628
Anyways, I heard that you went
to Lauren's birthday

362
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,421
from a coworker.

I don't believe this."'

being like a sister to me

00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,766
and like a best friend to me,
and being Spencer's sister.

367
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,477
I'm sorry. Like, what
do you want me to do?

368
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,605
Like, we do have
fashion in common.

369
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,691
I mean, every girl
has fashion in common.

370

You know, like...

371
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,028
You just apologized to her.

372
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,071
Yeah, but I apologized to her

373
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,407
for something
that we both were doing.

374
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,618
What did you and Spencer
do to her that she...

375
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,496
Nothing.

376
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,915
I didn't... If you're
really thinking that

377
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,460
then I-I honestly don't
even wanna talk to you.

378
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,046
If you really think
I would do something like that.

I don't know.

381
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,552
Just be careful with her,
because one minute

382
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,429
you're her best friend,
and then the next minute...

383
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,473
Just like playing
devil's advocate, why?

384
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,685
- What's gonna happen?
- I have no idea.

385
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,520

to tell you the events

in my life, so...

you wanted to go.
