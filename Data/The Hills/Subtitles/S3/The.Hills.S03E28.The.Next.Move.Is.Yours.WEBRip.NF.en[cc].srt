When my sister said
you were moving to Vegas

178

and you got a job out here,
I was like, I...

179

- Yeah, I have a job here.

living in Vegas

It's only convenient for you.

You wake up with me
when you want.

You come and see me
when you want.

186

This is really important to me

188
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,109

care enough to respect that.

189
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,861
- Like, what are you doing?
- I need to talk to you.

190
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,156
Like, I can't do this anymore.
Like, we need to be together.

191
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,866
Well, you said you were done.
You said you were...

Done chasing you
like this every day

193
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,536
and obviously, I'm not.

194
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,580
My point was our relationship
was turning into one

195
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,998
'me just always wanting
to be with you'

196

really do this right now

198

00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,935
We should definitely

201
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,603
figure out a time
with what we're doing.

202
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,855
Sorry about that.

I'll see you.
I'll see you in the morning.

You've got to get
that under control.

I'll just, I'll talk
to you in the morning.

I just was letting you know
that, how I felt.

'Everything was fine when it was
just me and you living together'

since Lo's in the picture'

344
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,017
you're distanced...

Da-da-da.

'Like, it's every time,
you're just like...'

348
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,817
Well, no, like last night,
it was really nice

349
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,361
that you, you know, invited me
to have crab with you guys

350
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,362
but I already had plans.

351
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,575
I know I don't tell you
everything all the time...

352
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,201
You don't have to tell me
everything

353
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,871
but you don't tell me
anything anymore.

354
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,497
'That's what friends do,
they talk'

355
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,207
'to each other
when they have problems.'

356
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,334
I'm here all the time.
You can walk in there.

00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,378
It's not about you, you know?

358
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,050
I just feel like Lo is the one
pushing us apart too.

359
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,061
Lo's done nothing to push us
apart on my side.

Okay.

362
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,151
And I've never let the opinions

363
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,570
of others affect
my friendships.

364
