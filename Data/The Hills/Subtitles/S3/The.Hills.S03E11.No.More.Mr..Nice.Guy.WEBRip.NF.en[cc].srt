1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,965
I would've pulled out
your chair for you

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,216
but it's kinda, a little bed
we got going on here.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,051
- Thank you.
- Ahh.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,095
We're excited for your barbecue.

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,681
I'm so excited.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,224
- Frankie called me twice.
- 'Frankie?'

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,977
You're gonna tell him
you're on a date.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,060
I haven't been on a real date

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,104
in, like, three weeks.

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,316
Hey, there's a certain type of
nice guy that you need to find.

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,568
Tell me what I need
to date, Brody.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,823
Somebody that's not Mr. Perfect
all the time, 'cause that's...

13
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,867
- I don't want Mr. Perfect.
- Like I said.

14
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,368
Thank you.

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,911
Somebody who's got
a little bit of bad boy.

16
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,621
You like that,
I know you do. I'm...

17
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,457
I'm going after your...
I'm going after your taste.

18
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,208
Yeah.

19
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,251
What looks good?

20
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,920
Nothing's catching my eye.

21
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,799
[chuckles]

22
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,010
[instrumental music]

23
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,271
(Brent)
'So Wednesday night's NASCAR.'

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,106
Rob's in charge.

25
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,902
So, Heidi, you'll work with Rob.

26
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,361
And at the event, Heidi

27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,404
I want you to work
with Kimberly.

28
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,155
She's new.

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,033
'So just kinda show her
the ropes a little bit.'

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,451
You keep an eye on her,
and Rob will keep an eye on you.

31
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,078
- Alright.
- It'll work perfect, alright?

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,329
Okay, guys.

33
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,501
- Hi, I'm Heidi.
- Hey, I'm Kim.

34
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,920
Nice to meet you.

35
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,796
I'm the new events coordinator.

36
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,673
Everyone keeps saying,
"Oh, you're the new Elodie."

37
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,467
I'm like, "No, I'm just
the new events coordinator."

38
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,553
- Yeah.
- It's kind of weird.

39
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,096
- Has it been a whirlwind?
- Really fast. Yeah.

40
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,724
I like it, though.
I'm a New Yorker

41
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,309
so I'm, like, you know,
fast-paced.

42
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,646
- Is this your first event?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,565
Well, if you need anything,
just, you know, let me know.

44
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,442
- Okay.
- Perfect.

45
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,276
Bye.

46
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,991
[instrumental music]

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,335
[camera whirring]

48
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,797
- Thank you.
- 'You're next...'

49
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,923
Good to see you.

50
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,132
Hi.

51
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,968
Could you fill one of these out

52
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,677
and then give it back to me
with one of your cards.

53
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,055
Thank you. Can we have you
fill out those?

54
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,347
There's pens over there.

55
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,557
And then...

56
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,234
No. Which one?

57
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,196
Oh, my God! Yeah!
That's really funny.

58
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,116
Was I trying to set you up
with my friend Heidi?

59
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,576
- Yes. You were.
- Now I remember.

60
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,662
(Whitney) Hey, Lauren, is there
anyone to send in?

61
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,372
- I did a shoot with him.
- 'Really?'

62
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,249
I was trying to set him up
with Heidi.

63
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,839
It's 'cause she was trying
to date Spencer.

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,924
- Oh.
- I was trying desperately.

65
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,052
How things would have changed!

66
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,387
I was like, "Date anyone else!"

67
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,973
(Whitney)
'Oh, my gosh. What's your name?'

68
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,683
- Gavin.
- 'Gavin. I'm Whitney.'

69
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,310
- 'Nice to meet you.'
- 'You're up, Gavin.'

70
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,396
I need you in the pink shirt
and the gray pants.

71
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,564
Thank you.

72
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,234
'Okay.'

73
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,486
If you could just stand
right there.

74
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,502
Um, you're done.
Thank you so much.

75
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,337
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

76
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,631
How'd you do?

77
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,304
Whew. Confidence isn't
an issue with you, is it?

78
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,472
He was really funny.

79
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,029
Got any big plans
for the weekend?

80
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:57,905
Mmm...

81
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,366
I was gonna see
if you wanted to hang out.

82
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,869
Um, sure.

83
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,286
Alright, can I grab your number?

84
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,287
(Lauren) 'Yeah.'

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,125
'Here.'

86
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,877
Awesome. Thanks.

87
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,378
- Alright.
- It was good seeing you again.

88
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,504
Yeah, you too.
I'll see you later.

89
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,090
- 'Bye!'
- 'Bye.'

90
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,348
- Don't.
- I'm not saying a word.

91
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,063
- Don't.
- Okay, fine!

92
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,196
[instrumental music]

93
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,761
- Heidi! What are you doing?
- Getting ready for work.

94
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,973
'I have that huge NASCAR
event tonight.'

95
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,308
- You didn't tell me that.
- Yes, I did!

96
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,561
'Why?'

97
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,354
'Cause I set up dinner plans.

98
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,400
It's a surprise to make up for

99
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,611
'the anniversary dinner
we didn't get to have.'

100
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,493
Babe, I'm really sorry,
but I have to go do this.

101
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,661
It's part of my new job.

102
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,539
'Why don't you come
by the NASCAR event?'

103
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,834
And then we'll leave together,
and we'll get a late-night bite.

104
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,088
It's not my choice.
It's really...

105
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,466
Don't even put that on me.
It's not my choice.

106
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,342
Alright, I got to go.
Please don't be mad at me.

107
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,762
- This is so ridiculous.
- I'll see you at our anni...

108
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,388
Oh, you're not coming
to our anniversary.

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,891
I'll be at work.
Why don't you try it?

110
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,934
Oh, it's like that.

111
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,654
[instrumental music]

112
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,367
(Lo) 'What's this guy's name?'

113
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,369
- Gavin.
- That's exciting.

114
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,956
Why don't you invite him today
to the barbecue at Brody's.

115
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,458
I did. He...
I don't think he's coming.

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,336
He has to shoot
a commercial today.

117
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,963
Does Kevin or any of our guy
friends know who he is?

118
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,923
No, I can't do a background
check. They don't know him.

119
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,466
Good they don't know him.

120
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,676
'You wanna meet him
for who he is.'

121
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,427
Oh! Oh! Wait! Wait!

122
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,722
- Oh, my God! What?
- Gavin's coming.

123
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,557
- Yay!
- Gavin is coming?

124
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah, he said, "Hey,
I just got done shooting.

125
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,476
"Looks like I'll make it
to the beach.

126
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,020
See you this afternoon. Gavin."

127
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,272
How fun. I love passing
judgment on people.

128
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,691
I wonder how Frankie and Brody
are gonna treat him

129
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,651
'cause you're, like, their girl,
you know what I mean.

130
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,445
- Frankie doesn't care.
- Brody, on the other hand.

131
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,572
[giggling]

132
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,659

133
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,164
[instrumental music]

134
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,714
[indistinct chatter]

135
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,969
Oh, you missed out on Brody
spinning in the bed with Lauren.

136
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,637
What are you talking about
right now?

137
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,932
Missed out on Brody in a
spinning bed with Lauren.

138
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,726
- Oh, the girlies!
- Speaking of the devil.

139
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,520
- Speaking of the devil.
- 'I don't get a hug, Lauren?'

140
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,355
I'm making my way over.

141
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,901
(Lauren) 'Whitney!'

142
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,156
Yeah, that's fine. I don't care.

143
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,575
We met this guy
at a model casting.

144
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,328
- This is Gavin?
- For the Marc Jacobs show.

145
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,704
What, you sit around
and talk about me?

146
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,373
We're living vicariously
through you.

147
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,916
We're acting like
your big brothers.

148
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,584
- Don't embarrass me.
- 'We won't.'

149
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,128
- 'We may embarrass him a bit.'
- Stop. I'm nervous.

150
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,879
Don't make me feel more...

151
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,049
- 'What up?'
- What's up, man?

152
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,550
- I'm Gavin .
- Taylor.

153
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,469
- Nice to meet you, dude.
- Brody.

154
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,430
I'm Gavin .
This is my buddy Justin.

155
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,348
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Audrina.

156
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,933
There's drinks all up here
if you guys want anything.

157
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,101
(Gavin) Alright, cool.

158
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,646
He seems like a nice guy.

159
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,148
He's a little short, though.

160
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,774
I didn't ask your opinion.

161
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,943
- Hey.
- What?

162
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,569
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

163
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,322
I went camping in Catalina
a couple of weeks ago.

164
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,324
I hate camping.
You camped? Really?

165
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,284
Yeah. Why do you hate camping?

166
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,868
'Cause don't you just get
really dirty?

167
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,578
And it's just not fun
to sleep on the ground.

168
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,122
'He just went camping
in Catalina.'

169
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,957
You did? Where did you sleep?

170
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,167
In a hotel that's on Catalina?

171
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,918
No, we went up as far north

172
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,837
where there's no running water
or electricity.

173
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,839
(Lo)
'Really? That's pretty manly.'

174
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,591
There's another beach that's
about an hour north of here

175
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,386
and you can camp on it
and build fires and so...

176
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,805
Like, I just made it sound
like I go camping every day.

177
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,974
Yeah. We pretty much did...

178
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,225
If a girl says she hates camping

179
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,685
don't say you camp every day.

180
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,978
Right.

181
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,858
[instrumental music]

182
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,782
- 'We're cooking.'
- You're cooking?

183
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,827
- 'We're finally cooking.'
- Thank you, Gavin.

184
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,620
He's gonna cook for you.

185
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,164
He's gonna cook
for everybody, Lo.

186
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,041
Yeah, but he's cooking for you.

187
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,002
Wait. Who's he cooking with?

188
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,964
(Brody)
'So, how'd you meet Lauren?'

189
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,133
I just ran into her
at a casting last week.

190
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,760
I asked her out.

191
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,012
Supposed to go out Friday.

192
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,515
Oh! Whoa!

193
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,392
- How do you know Lauren?
- Got to get my approval here.

194
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,601
I just gotta make sure you're a
good guy, you know...

195
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,936
- I'm alright.
- You're alright?

196
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:22,979
Yeah, I'm good.

197
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,529
- No, he's not.
- Oh, yes, he did.

198
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,280
He got a little jealous.
Yes, he did.

199
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:34,574
Yeah, you do, too.

200
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,832
When was your last relationship?

201
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,084
(Gavin) 'It's actually been
over a year'

202
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,544
'since I was in a relationship.'

203
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,421
- 'How did it end?'
- Not good.

204
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,713
- 'Really?'
- Yeah.

205
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,923
'Why? On her part or yours?'

206
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,758
It was just a weird situation

207
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,176
'cause she was my best friend,
you know?

208
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,386
- Right
- And so...

209
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,389
- Before?
- Before, yeah.

210
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,807
It wasn't anybody's fault.
We were just young...

211
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,351
'We just went through
a lot of stuff...'

212
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,900
[instrumental music]

213
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,703
- 'This is getting crazy.'
- 'I know.'

214
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,539
Um... Okay, this person's
on the list.

215
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,541
- Yeah.
- Right here. They're coming.

216
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,251
- Yeah, he's already checked in.
- What else?

217
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,378
Inside VIP Rooms are all
checked out?

218
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,131
Yeah. That's all set.
Everything's cleared too.

219
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,467
Okay, and the tables
are coming in right now?

220
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,676
Yeah, I got to check
all the radios back in

221
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,929
so I'm probably gonna be here
till at least, like, 3:00.

222
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,973
- Three?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,266
[cell phone ringing]

224
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,017
Hello?

225
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,396
Hey, babe. How are you?

226
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,484
Um, I have to stay late tonight.

227
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,947
But we can do it another night.

228
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm sorry, babe.

229
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,997
Please don't be mad at me.

230
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,041
Hello?

231
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,213
Spencer just called.

232
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,508
Now he's mad. It's not my fault.

233
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Just talk to him

234
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,344
when you get home, you know?

235
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,094
Yeah.

236
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,184
[instrumental music]

237
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,568
[indistinct chatter]

238
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,154
He just seems so perfect
and, like, by the book

239
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,905
and everything is so, like...

240
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,949
Maybe in a "Fairy-tale" world.

241
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,868
Can you imagine Brandon coming
into this group of people?

242
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,370
I'm trying to get something
out of him.

243
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,503
Did you have a good time today?

244
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,130
Mm-hmm. I always have fun
at his house.

245
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,798
Thanks for asking me
to come and all...

246
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,258
Of course.

247
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,427
'You were a trouper. Thanks.'

248
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,012
I had a good time, for sure.

249
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,391
Like I said to them, I feel like

250
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,643
he is being Mister,
like, Perfect.

251
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,311
It has nothing to do
out of jealousy

252
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,188
but I will give him a hard
time... Not a hard time

253
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,274
but just, I wanna, like,
see him have some reaction.

254
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,401
Seriously, though, like,
all your friends

255
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,776
here really seem nice.

256
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,445
They are.
I have very good friends.

257
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,531
They do seem really cool.

258
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,366
'Uh, so, I guess
I'll see you Friday?'

259
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,825
(Lauren) 'Mm-hmm.'

262
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,737
Is Heidi available?

263
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,447
- 'And you are?'
- Spencer.

264
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,075
[phone ringing]

265
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,535
Hi, Heidi. Spencer's here.

266
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,749
'Okay, great. Thanks.'

267
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,542
- She'll be right out.
- Thank you very much.

268
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,970
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hey, stealing you for lunch.

269
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,972
Uh, no, you're not, because

270
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,642
I'm actually in the middle
of a meeting.

271
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,685
I wish you would have called me.
I would have told you.

272
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,937
Lunchtime you usually have off.

273
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,731
Get Brent out here.
Let me talk to Brent.

274
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,899
You know I've been working
so hard on this job.

275
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,026
I've been doing this for us,
been moving ahead.

276
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,819
How does this have anything
to do with us?

277
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,739
I'll be off work at like
seven or something, so let's...

278
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,992
You can schedule me in?
You can put me in your calendar?

279
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,453
I mean, you were the one who
encouraged me to get this job

280
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,829
and you know that it was gonna
be a lot more time and effort.

281
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,291
You said after NASCAR

282
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,126
that everything
was gonna quiet down.

283
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,421
I know, but I'm really busy,
and I got to go.

284
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,047
I hope this meeting's
pretty important.

285
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,551
[instrumental music]

286
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,566
- 'Where are you guys going?'
- 'To Sushi Dan's.'

287
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,109
- Sushi Dan's!
- Yeah!

288
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,695
(Audrina) 'Good.'

289
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,279
You have to try
the crazy Danny roll.

290
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,031
Crazy Danny roll.
I'll remember that.

291
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,908
It's good. So, are you excited?

292
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,910
Yeah.

293
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,454
You haven't been
on a date in a while.

294
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,955
I know.

295
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,207
(Audrina)
'He seems nice, but he doesn't'

296
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,709
'really seem like your type.'

297
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,043
That's what Brody said too.

298
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,633
[instrumental music]

299
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,352
(Lauren)
'So you like Sean Kingston?'

300
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,813
- I don't know who that is.
- Yes, you do.

301
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,648
He sings that
"Beautiful Girls" song.

302
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,734
I can probably.
I'll find it on my BlackBerry

303
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,984
and I'll play it for you.

304
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,697
[indistinct chatter]

305
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,115
- Thank you.
- Yep.

306
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,330
Alright, what's good here?

307
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,416
Crazy Danny roll, Danny roll.

308
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,335
I was told I needed to try
the crazy Danny roll.

309
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,588
Alright,
then crazy Danny roll it is.

310
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,548
The baked salmon roll.

311
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,633
I get a baked salmon roll
every single time I come here.

312
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,427
I'm not a huge salmon fan.

313
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,637
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna let you order.

314
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,013
Alright.

315
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,682
(female #1)
'Hi, guys. How are you?'

316
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,225
- Good, how are you?
- 'Good.'

317
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,309
We're gonna get
a baked salmon roll

318
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,977
'a crazy Danny roll'

319
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,479
and what was that cucumber roll?

320
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,689
- Rockin' roll.
- 'Rockin' roll.'

321
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,653
'I hope the barbecue wasn't
too uncomfortable for you.'

322
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,280
I got mad at Brody for that.

323
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,199
Honestly, from the way
he was towards me

324
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,034
I thought he was being
pretty nice.

325
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,953
You're just a very nice guy.

326
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,581
- Baked salmon roll.
- Oh, thank you.

327
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,916
That was quick.

328
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,751
Here, I'm going to serve you up.

329
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,546
I just want you to have the best
experience possible...

330
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,256
- With this baked salmon roll.
- Thank you.

331
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,802
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

332
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,096
It's really big.

333
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,980
It's good.

334
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,107
It is good.

335
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,654
Tell me about some of the dates
you've been on recently.

336
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,447
Um, they're very bad.

337
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,699
I have very, very...

338
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,992
...bad taste.

339
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,661
I didn't mean, like, you.

340
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm just saying, like,
in general

341
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,164
they seem very normal,
and then they're crazy.

342
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,542
So, I seem normal,
but I'm crazy.

343
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,086
No, you're not crazy.
You're very normal.

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,708
Well, well, well.
Somebody's home

346
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,584
awfully early for a date night.

347
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,837
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm just driving around.

348
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:26,921
I just dropped Frankie off.

349
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,506
'How was, uh, the date?'

350
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:33,302
It was a great date
with no sparks.

351
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,638
Well, somebody didn't listen,
but I think I told you

352
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,890
that guy was pretty boring.

353
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,349
'I know, I know.'

354
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,560
But I needed
to go, just to find out.

355
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,980
But, I mean, he's really nice.
It just...

356
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,858
You know, it just went.

357
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,360
So, what are you doing now?
You just dropped Frankie off?

358
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,571
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'm on my way home right now.

359
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,699
- 'What are you gonna do?'
- Um...nothing.

360
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,784
I'm just at home.
I was gonna watch a movie.

361
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,578
If it's not a boring movie

362
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,914
how about I watch
a movie with you?

363
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,290
'What movie is it?'

364
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,376
Does it really matter?

365
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,502
[laughs]

366
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,254
I guess not.

367
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,297
[laughs] Okay, I'll see you
in a few minutes.

368
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,132
- 'Alright, bye.'
- Bye.

369
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,136
[instrumental music]

370
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,032
[music continues]
