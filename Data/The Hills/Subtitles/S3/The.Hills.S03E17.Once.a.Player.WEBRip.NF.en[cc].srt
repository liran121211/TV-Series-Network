1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,004
(Brody)
'Should we get some calamari?'

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,298
- No. Do you like calamari?
- I like calamari.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,717
Wow! Your eyes look very
beautiful right now.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,302
- Thank you.
- They look very bluish.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,720
They are blue.

6
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,138
I thought they were green.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,182
They're blue with yellow
in the middle.

8
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,058
I need to get
some eyes like that.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,477
I like your eyes.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,901
So? Anything else new
and exciting in your life?

11
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,779
Any... Talk to Jen Bunney
at all lately?

12
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,948
I think Jen might be coming
tonight to my Halloween party.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,491
Oh, really?
That's cool, though.

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,869
- You guys can hang out.
- Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,496
Shut up.

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,831
Little cuties everywhere.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,042
Kidding.

18
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,129
[instrumental music]

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,770
'What are you gonna do
for Halloween?'

20
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,731
I think, Audrina and I
were talking about

21
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,733
having like
a Halloween party, but...

22
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,651
Oh, my gosh!
That should be fun.

23
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,153
It'll be fun just 'cause we've
never had one at our apartment.

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,740
And Audrina's inviting a couple
of her guy friends.

25
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,992
Oh, my God!
And she's inviting a guy.

26
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,535
Ooh!

27
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,787
- JB's replacement.
- Special night!

28
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,623
I haven't met him yet either,
so I'm excited to meet him.

29
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,168
You and Brody doing a little,
like, couple-costume action?

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,086
Please. He'll couple
with Frankie before me.

31
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,338
[laughs]

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,798
I guarantee he does.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,341
"Dumb and dumber."

34
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,594
Oh! They should do
"Dumb and Dumber."

35
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,470
But which one's Dumber?

36
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,348
They should be the guys
from "Night at the Roxbury."

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,308
They would have to do
this all night.

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,312
Wait, so, what's going on
with Brody?

39
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,398
- Same thing as always.
- Same thing as always?

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,358
What's that mean, though?

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,945
Brody's a good guy.
He's really nice.

42
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,654
- Very good-looking.
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,990
But Brody likes his ladies.

44
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,700
Brody does like his ladies.

45
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,994
And you don't need to be one
among a million.

46
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,871
- Mmnh-mnh.
- Mmnh-mnh.

47
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,831
I just know that when I'm
around the two of you guys

48
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,877
like I can definitely sense
some sort of chemistry.

49
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,295
Yeah.

50
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,142
'Thanks for coming over
and talking about this.'

51
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,352
I know you know Spencer
better than anyone

52
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,563
'and I just kind of wanted
to, like, talk to you'

53
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,732
for a minute and see
what you thought.

54
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,652
I don't think Spencer told you,
but we got in this huge fight

55
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,988
the other night 'cause
he wanted to elope.

56
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,657
"Are you kidding me?"
Like, "You want to go elope?"

57
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,367
And so, he got so mad
at me, and he left.

58
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,078
And he like didn't
call me that night.

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,746
And I was just so upset.

60
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,081
I was like,
"how could you just leave me?"

61
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,624
Like, "I wouldn't leave you."

62
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,459
- That's so not like him.
- I know.

63
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,837
You know, he's just over it,
and I'm burnt out.

64
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
'And it's all
happening so fast.'

65
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,134
And I feel, if anything, it's
just kind of tearing us apart.

66
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,844
You know that he loves you.

67
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,889
And I'm sure he knows
that you love him and...

68
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,100
You know, like, I want to be
engaged and I want to get

69
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,685
married, but maybe
we should postpone this

70
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,394
and wait a little bit.

71
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,981
Like, what's the harm
in waiting, you know?

72
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,944
Yeah.

73
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,904
But please don't, you know,
like tell him anything.

74
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,823
Oh, of course.

75
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,617
I know you won't, but I just
got to say it in case, you know?

76
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,704
I know you're his sister
and everything.

77
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,997
Yeah.

78
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,010
Don't... Take that off, bro.

79
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,804
- Bro, it's so hot in here.
- No, that's our costume right?

80
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,015
'Whitney, what do you think
of Batman and Robin?'

81
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:47,519
It's more like
Siegfried and Roy.

82
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,104
Hey, you know what?

83
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,271
Good job, Batman!

84
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,871
'Alright, that's good
on the smoke!'

85
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,082
Alright, we're gonna shut
off the smoke for a while.

86
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,042
I, like, can't breathe.

87
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,633
Oh!

88
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,552
Oh! Amazing!

89
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,262
You're amazing.

90
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,307
Oh, my God!

91
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,976
- 'Great job, ladies!'
- 'Thank you!'

92
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,312
- Amazing job, Jen, you too.
- We just won!

93
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,898
- 'What?'
- 'We just won!'

94
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,649
That's why he's saying
"good job."

95
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,570
What do you think
I'm saying "great job" for?

96
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,114
- Hi! Hi!
- Hello, hello.

97
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,656
- Do you like my costume?
- Holy...

98
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,033
- How are you?
- I'm doing alright.

99
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,576
How are you doing?

100
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,078
- You're not gonna say hi?
- Oh, hi!

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,412
Are you gonna
ignore me like that?

102
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,956
- 'Can I see how it is?'
- 'What?'

103
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,629
- Lauren!
- This is Corey.

104
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,757
Corey, this is my sister Casey
and her fiancé Aaron.

105
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,175
Nice to meet you.

106
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,260
I'm glad you guys came.

107
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,012
We made it, but just.

108
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,847
Well, you're still here.

109
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,183
It's all good.

110
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,352
'Brody and Lauren, I want to
introduce you guys to Corey.'

111
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,396
- Corey, what up, man?
- How you doing?

112
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,816
- Nice to meet you.
- Lauren. Nice to meet you.

113
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,152
- He's from Australia.
- Where in Australia you from?

114
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,945
- Brisbane.
- Oh, Brisbane?

115
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,363
Aussies are the best.
I love Aussies.

116
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,865
I love Aussies.

117
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,744
Alright, baby, I got to bounce.

118
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,330
- You give me a nice hug.
- A cape hug.

119
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,457
Do you have to leave right now?

120
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,875
Sorry, I was a little
under dressed here

121
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,253
but, oh, wait,
I got a little excited.

122
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,671
Whoa!

123
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,423
Alright. Audrina...

124
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,967
- Hey, very nice to meet you.
- You too, man.

125
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,427
[indistinct chatter]

126
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,517
[instrumental music]

127
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,441
[sighs]

128
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,239
[instrumental music]

129
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,626
- Hey.
- Hi.

130
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,795
This is a mess.

131
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,965
It's too bad that Frankie
and Brody left so early.

132
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,759
I barely remember even saying
goodbye to 'em.

133
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,137
It was just chaos.

134
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,183
They must have went
to another party.

135
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,726
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

136
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,353
Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,270
That's okay.
That doesn't matter, though.

138
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,022
'I know.'

139
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,439
But the good thing
is, everybody's a fan of Corey.

140
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,941
'Everyone loves him.'

141
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,026
He's nice, huh?

142
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,443
I really like him.

143
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,280
I know. We're going
on a date tonight.

144
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,573
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,158
That'll be fun.
You'll have fun.

146
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,951
He didn't know anyone,
and he, like...

147
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,870
See? That's so good.

148
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,830
And he was nice to everybody.
You know what I mean?

149
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,874
He made an effort, which
shows that he likes you.

150
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,500
It shows a lot.

151
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,143
- After you, my dear.
- Thanks.

152
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,145
'Hi. Nice to meet you.'

153
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,147
(Spencer)
'Hi, I'm here to pick up
the Heidi Montag'

154
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,982
save-the-date cards.

155
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,484
- You're getting married.
- I am. I am.

156
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,820
- I'm his sister.
- Oh! Okay. Alright.

157
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,030
Very excited.

158
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,949
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

159
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,451
I was getting stressed out
by it, but now it's all

160
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,287
starting to come together.

161
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,789
Got a church. We got invites.

162
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,792
Now we just need to figure out
where to have the party.

163
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,920
She won't do
Don Antonio's, so...

164
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,048
Well, we were talking
a couple days ago, Heidi and I.

165
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,716
About?

166
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,010
I just think that fight
freaked her out.

167
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,637
It wasn't a fight.

168
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,972
You left.

169
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,974
Well, that's your opinion.

170
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,184
She just feels like this is
breaking up your relationship.

171
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,602
What are you talking about?

172
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,853
She didn't know
how to tell you.

173
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,605
Are you kidding me right now?

174
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,190
When did you have this
conversation with her?

175
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,775
How do you know this
and I don't know.

176
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,111
I mean, she wants
the perfect wedding.

177
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,570
I know she was
pushing you into this.

178
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,323
She wasn't pushing me
into this.

179
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,826
I wanted this as much if not
more than she did.

180
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,288
Spencer, I don't even think
she is 100% sure

181
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,790
she wants to get married
right now.

182
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,542
I mean, I think you
just freaked her out.

183
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,837
Alright, well,
thank you so much.

184
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,631
I think we're gonna
have to come back.

185
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,467
I think, I need to go talk
to my future bride.

186
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,177
I don't want to say
anything, but...

187
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,637
After you,
bearer of great news.

188
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,225
♪ Don't you run and hide ♪

189
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,146
♪ It's only... ♪♪

190
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,523
It's probably best that they
sat us inside anyway.

191
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,066
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

192
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,319
- We have reservations.
- Great. Come on in.

193
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,196
Check in with the hosts.

194
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,656
I used to come here
all the time. It's so good.

195
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,785
'Yeah, this place
is pretty nice, huh?'

196
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,372
You got to try
one of these ones.

197
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,415
I'm not very good
with chopsticks.

198
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,667
- I'm trying.
- Go for it.

199
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,670
We got this one little local
sushi place back home.

200
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,340
We sesh there quite a bit.

201
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,841
That's where I
learned my skills.

202
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,717
That's where you
learned your skills?

203
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,052
Yeah.

204
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,678
'Cause I was real bad
at it, too.

205
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,222
They brang me out
the beginner ones

206
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,515
you know, with the rubber band.

207
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
That's what I used to.

208
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,518
Yeah, the training ones.

209
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,395
You feel like a real loser,
but that's how to learn it.

210
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,938
You got to go down to Australia,
alright, at least once.

211
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,690
'I will.'

212
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,526
You should. It's gonna be
so hot this summer, though.

213
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,028
I don't think I've had a proper
winter in like five years.

214
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,363
Do you snowboard?

215
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,240
I've never been
snowboarding once.

216
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,741
I've only been once.

217
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,159
'I love to go
again this winter.'

218
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,745
- You want to?
- Yeah, let's do it up.

219
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,332
- It'll be sweet.
- Where should we go next?

220
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,875
I don't know.
Do you want to go out?

221
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,420
Or do you want to just go home?

222
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,600
'This place is cute.'

223
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,769
It's very romantical.

224
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,397
- Yeah, I've been here before.
- Have you?

225
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,689
Who have you been here with?

226
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,275
I came here with Jason.

227
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,777
Oh, then it is very
romantical indeed.

228
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,154
Well, I can be your
boyfriend tonight.

229
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,948
How was Halloween?

230
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,783
Um, it was fun.
You should have come.

231
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,743
- I'm sad you couldn't make it.
- I was such a loser-face.

232
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,246
I had a midterm the next day.
It was horrible.

233
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,914
Did Brody and Frankie go?

234
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,208
Oh, as Batman and Robin.

235
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,294
They left early, too.
They went to another party.

236
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,503
Mmm.

237
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,757
Have you guys been, like,
going on dates?

238
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,052
I don't know. It's limbo.
It's...

239
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,596
We're friends, but, like...

240
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,846
He's more than your
friend, Lauren.

241
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,723
The thing is, like...

242
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,559
I mean, do you want him to be
more than your friend?

243
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,187
That's the thing is I just...

244
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,689
Maybe he wants things from you,
too, that you just don't know.

245
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,777
You know, like how we're having
this conversation.

246
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,446
He could be having
a conversation like this

247
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,781
with somebody else,
and you just don't know.

248
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,244
Maybe Brody is waiting for you
to say something.

249
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,414
It's not that I don't want
Brody to be my boyfriend

250
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,124
but... I mean, I'm not stupid.

251
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,917
I know that he's out with other
girls all the time.

252
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,004
You know what I mean?
Like, I know that.

253
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,757
I want... Brody to want...

254
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,969
...to not do it
without me saying anything.

255
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,847
So, you want him to not want
to see other girls.

256
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,890
But, like, I don't want to
tell him not to do that.

257
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,310
You know what I mean?
Who am I to tell not to do that?

258
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,521
Yeah. Catch 22, love.

259
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,290
- Hi
- Hello!

260
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,959
Didn't see you right there.

261
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,547
- 'I like your blue hat.'
- Thanks.

262
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,216
- How was your date?
- It was really good!

263
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,592
'He's really nice.'

264
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,135
Like, everything he does

265
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,513
I'm not used to like
being treated like that.

266
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,806
You know, he's very attentive
and very gent.

267
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,475
He's, like, a gentleman.
He's really nice.

268
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,352
So good.

269
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,479
He doesn't leave me hanging
all the time, you know?

270
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,981
- He's a keeper.
- Oh, you got a keeper?

271
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,441
Well, I'm not gonna
jinx anything.

272
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,818
It's way too soon
to jump into anything.

273
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,445
- 'Knock on wood.'
- Yeah.

274
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,364
- Alright, can I be annoying?
- Please.

275
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,575
Did you kiss him?

276
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,950
- Yes.
- You kissed him, huh?

277
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,494
He kissed me.

278
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,162
Did you kiss him, like,
"thanks for dinner."

279
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,789
- It was, like, mutual.
- 'Or was it like...'

280
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,376
Like I wanna kiss you, but I
don't know and then you kiss.

281
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,127
- Or was it like...
- Oh, my God, Lauren.

282
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,257
What kind of kiss?
Kiss, it's important!

283
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,719
It's so weird 'cause Justin
hated. He never liked to kiss.

284
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,680
So, he returned your calls,
which Justin didn't.

285
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,016
He likes to kiss,
which Justin didn't.

286
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,604
He bathes,
which Justin didn't.

287
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,105
Upgrade!

288
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,529
[instrumental music]

289
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,547
'Will you please move your
feet off the table?'

290
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,507
'I'm trying to clean up here.'

291
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,266
What's wrong?

292
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,018
Well, uh...

293
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,187
Last I heard, we were planning
on getting married.

294
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,567
And I was going and getting
invitations, and my sister

295
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,943
thankfully stopped me.

296
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,819
Your sister?
What'd your sister say?

297
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,030
She said not to spend a few
thousand dollars on invitations

298
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,866
for a wedding that she doesn't
think is happening.

299
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,410
Well, first of all,
I don't think that's

300
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,245
any of her business.

301
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,247
Well, you made it her
business when you told her about

302
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,667
what's going on with
the wedding instead of me.

303
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,461
First of all, your sister
has nothing to do with this.

304
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,088
And actually, she shouldn't even
have said anything to you.

305
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,466
She was just looking out
for her brother.

306
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,135
'She was not trying
to be a snitch.'

307
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,638
Is the big wedding just an
excuse for you to stall

308
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,722
and not have a wedding?

309
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,683
You can just be honest.

310
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,018
I was trying to make a nice
ceremony that we'd all be at

311
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,728
and you don't want this.

312
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,313
It's like it seems
like a nightmare for you.

313
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,315
You're the one that's
dragging it out

314
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,900
so there's all this conflict
so it doesn't happen.

315
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,611
I don't want to just get
it over with.

316
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,237
I want our family and friends
to be there.

317
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,947
Like, that's not dragging
it out.

318
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,574
It's something that's really
important to me.

319
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,034
And if you don't understand
that by now

320
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,910
'I don't know
what to tell you.'

321
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,621
I mean, I'm not the one
who pushed you.

322
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,081
You're the one who pushed me
to move in here.

323
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,583
You're the one
who proposed to me.

324
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,460
I have given up
so much for this.

325
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,629
I haven't given up anything
for this relationship?

326
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,756
Do you see me going out ever
with any of my friends?

327
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,466
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that something
really important to you?

328
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,343
Then why don't you go do that?

329
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,053
My point is you're acting
like I haven't sacrificed

330
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,305
anything...
I'm here with you 24-7.

331
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,850
I don't make you
be here with me 24-7.

332
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,685
But, I don't sit here and say
"I've sacrificed everything."

333
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,894
"I forced you to do this."

334
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,937
'Ah, don't mock me.'

335
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,027
Don't you dare leave.

336
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,112
If you leave, don't come back.

337
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,574
Spencer!

338
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,134
'Wow!'

339
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,096
This place is cool. I can...

340
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,975
I mean, you know, you could have
let me pull that out for you.

341
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,729
Jeez. Way to make me look bad.

342
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,398
- Sorry.
- Just kidding!

343
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,024
I love when they put
twinkly lights around

344
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,777
when it's not
Christmas time.

345
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,780
'It's almost Christmas time.'

346
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,783
- Audrina her and Justin...
- Done.

347
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,200
...wanna hang out.

348
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,786
They're done.

349
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,953
- They're not done.
- Yeah, they are.

350
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,496
'I've heard that before.'

351
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,790
She just went on two dates
with another guy

352
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,250
and she really likes him.

353
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,170
No. I think she's...
She's gonna be strong this time.

354
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,714
Sure.

355
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,382
Sometimes no matter
how much you like a guy

356
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,843
they're just not
good for you, you know?

357
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,219
Who is that with you?

358
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,224
Go on.

359
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,643
How is that?
I don't understand.

360
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,269
Why, do you think
I'm gonna go...

361
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,730
- 'Go what?'
- Mack all these girls?

362
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,148
Yeah, that's exactly
what I think you're gonna do.

363
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,775
- Oh, really?
- It's fine.

364
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,025
Who am I gonna mack?

365
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,611
- Really?
- Who?

366
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,821

Blond hottie.

373
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,887
They've accumulated
over the years.

374
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,055
Bridgett, wannabe bang.
Oh, wanna bang.

375
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,975
What? Oh-ho!
What was that one?

376
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,267
You have a Britney Miami.

377
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,478

platinum blond.

378
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,980

379
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,147
Britney Canada whore.

380
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,612
'I'm gonna take
that back asap.'

381
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,405
Get that password
lock back on before

382
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,366
you get hold
of that again.

383
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,201
[laughs]

384
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,579
No, for real, those are
names over a couple years.

385
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,833
You got that phone
about two months ago.

386
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,670
Yeah, but I switched all my...
I bought this program.

387
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,757
There's a whole process to it.
It was very time-consuming.

388
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,552
So, Britney Canada whore
won't get a call anytime soon?

389
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,429
Britney Canada whore is not
getting a call anytime soon.

390
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,355
Well, those girls mean nothing
to me, sweetheart.

391
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,317
Brody, you can do
whatever you want.

392
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,402
Okay.

393
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,778
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do.

394
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,154
You don't have to tell me
what to do

395
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,910
but you can give me
some sort of... I don't know.

396
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,415
What do you want me to tell you,
I don't understand.

397
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,419
