front of the house.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,308

is really horrible.

a great time tonight.'

the show tonight.'

maybe I'll bring their CD back

of chairs count too

about this event is that

- You guys are really good.
- 'Cool. That would be great.'

171
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,385
Are you guys gonna
go out tonight?

172
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,220
We were thinking about it.
We're not sure what to do.

173
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,847
We're doing a little after party
for a few people

174
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,642
like, literally right
down the street at One.

175
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,853
One. I've been there once.
They have really good food.

176
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,855
Let's go have a drink,
and then we'll walk down.

177

[rock music]

178
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,999
Can I get a sparkling water
and a flat water?

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,959
You should check her ID.
She's 21.

180
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,044
Whoo!

181
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,673
Surprise. Happy birthday.

182
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,050
Oh, you shouldn't have
done this!

183
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,927
I am so mad at you!

184
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh, I cannot believe
you did this.

185
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,056
I'm about to die!

186
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,933
They said it's the
brand-new one out.

187
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,518
Only out for like a week.

188
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,105
Oh...my...gosh!

189
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,731
[laughs]

190
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,234
[squeals]

191
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,778
This is what I like.
The bling in the chain.

192
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,405
[gasps]

193
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,782
I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

194
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,742
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you! Thank you!

195
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,120
This is my favorite present
I've ever gotten in my life.

196
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

197
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,960
It's too far!

198
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,129
- Celebrate! Whoo!
- I am.

199
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,136
- What's that face?
- No face.

200
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,637
Would you like
a little more wine?

201
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,432
- You seem a little serious.
- No.

202
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,641
Would you like some more?

203
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,561
- It's great.
- What?

204
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,314
- I'm having a great time.
- Me too.

205
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,320
[rock music]

206
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,512
Let's open the doors.
Let's go.

207
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,931
Does everyone know where
they're supposed to be?

208
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,849
- Are you good?
- I'm good. Yeah.

209
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,310
It looks fantastic.
Look at the mob.

210
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,188
- Now there all filing in.
- Where are all our seaters?

211
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,482
- Oh, my gosh.
- Where are the seaters?

212
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,484
Lauren for Whitney.

213
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,361
'Where are the other seaters?'

214
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,739
We need the people that are
seating the show other than us.

215
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,491
- Right.
- Come on.

216
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,243
'Sit right behind
these people.'

217
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,328
Okay, I'm just gonna have you
come over here.

218
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,039
Sorry.

219
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,458
Whitney!

220
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,625
Do you have a front-row seat?

221
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,793
Come on over here.

222
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,424
Okay. This is your table.
Okay? Cool.

223
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,883
Okay.

224
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,219
You guys are right over here.

225
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,971
(Lauren)
'Whitney, there's not supposed
to be anybody sitting there'

226
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,347
'and there are two people
sitting there.'

227
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,057
You got to keep that area clear.

228
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,684
You guys can sit in either
of these back ones

229
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,852
if you want. Yeah.

230
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,480
Whitney, can you go to 11?

231
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,857
That one in the hat
always crashes every party.

232
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,151
Right here?

233
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,819
He's not allowed
in ever usually.

234
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,446
Right here, sitting right
in front of us?

235
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,614
- Really?
- Find out from Carlos.

236
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,532
He's a crasher from way back.

237
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,744
- Wanna to take your seat?
- I think we need to start.

238
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,745
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,374
Okay.

240
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,293
I think that...
Hold on, hold on...

241
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,587
For who? Oh, hi, yes. Um...

242
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,175
[indistinct chatter]

243
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,719
I don't think you can hear me
on this.

244
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,639
- No, it's out right now.
- Oh, well, there you go.

245
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,223
How close are we to being all...

246
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,767
Um, like, honestly,
a couple minutes.

247
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,645
Sit down. I want them
to roll up the carpet.

248
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,148
Alright, let's get off
the aisle.

249
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,232
- We're good?
- Are you good?

250
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,400
Okay.

251
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,571
Nice job, Whit.
Way to crack the whip, baby.

252
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,990
My gosh. I just started
putting people...

253
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,368
That's what you got to do.
You just got to roll with it.

254
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,372
Yes. Let's go, ladies.

255
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,040
Lauren!

256
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,460
Lauren's right there.
Should I tell her we're good?

257
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,213
- Go, we're ready to go.
- We're good.

258
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,589
'Yeah. We're good.'

259
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,554
No, wait, wait,
we're bringing Hilary Duff in.

260
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,805
- We're not ready.
- Tell Lauren to wait.

261
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,307
Okay. Erik, they're all good.

262
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,684
Suzy? Suzy?

263
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,144
- They're good.
- Yeah?

264
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,145
They said we're ready
to start.

265
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,313
Alright, you guys.

266
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,730
Hi, are you there?

267
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,525
Corina, Will.

268
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,902
Lauren?

269
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,195
- We're going.
- Lauren?

270
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,238
- Have we started going?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,656
Alright, here we go.

[instrumental music]

273
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,504
We're just waiting
on Hilary Duff.

274
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,715
Erik, wait, they're seating
Hilary Duff right now.

275
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,550
Okay, you guys,
stay in your positions.

276
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,093
We're just waiting
for one person?

277
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,678
She's coming in right now.
I see her.

278
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,139
'Okay, she's here.'

279
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,683
- They're good to go.
- Alright, you guys.

280
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,393
Make this show...hot.

282
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,155
I'm gonna go do one more.

283
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,833
Right behind each other,
you guys.

284
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,679
We got, like, two more to go,
and then we're doing the finale.

285
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,599
[music continues]

- Aah! Good job, guys!
- Thank you so much.

288
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,954
Whoo!

289
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,083
Good job, everyone.

291
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,351
- What do you guys want?
- Let me get some drinks.

292
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,144
I'm gonna get one of those,
I think.

293
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,104
- Which one?
- The Naughty Schoolgirl.

294
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,898
- 'J.D., red wine...'
- Naughty Schoolgirl.

295
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,609
- 'Naughty Schoolgirl?'
- Yes.

296
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,402
'I love that. That's good.'

297
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,946
[laughter]

298
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,407
I now know why
it's the Naughty Schoolgirl.

299
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,827
- 'There's actually a sucker.'
- There's a lollipop in there.

300
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,997
- Dip it.
- Cheers, everyone.

301
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,749
- 'Thank you, guys.'
- 'Cheers.'

302
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,209
'To guys with
The Naughty Schoolgirl.'

303
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,839
It's really good.
This is my new favorite drink.

304
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,638
I'm actually from Orange County.

305
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,139
Oh, okay.

306
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,809
Southern California,
born and raised. Yeah.

307
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,693
Always.

00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,281
Hey!

00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,787
Yeah.

00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,293
- Oh, that was so good.
- What?

312
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,801
- Justin.
- Is that his name?

313
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,437
Okay. Good.
That's all that matters.

314
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,772
- We'll hang out.
- Yeah, yeah.

315
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,064
It was nice meeting you.

316
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,190

'Hey.'

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,027
Nice meeting you.
See you soon. Thank you.

'Pleasure. Pleasure.'

321
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,993
Bye! Come on, Justin.

322
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,205
[instrumental music]

323
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,006
- Did people like it?
- Did you have fun?

324
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,800
What are you hearing out here?

325
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,177
I didn't have fun,
but I thought it was amazing.

326
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,762
- It looked amazing.
- 'I thought it was amazing...'

327
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,305
- 'Did it look good?'
- Yeah, it looked great.

328
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,098
It looked great!

329
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,351
- You enjoyed it?
- Yes! I thought it was great.

330
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,936
Are you hearing good things
from all the guests?

331
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,313
- Yes. The show was amazing.
- Really?

332
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,357
Every year should be
a different designer.

333
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,734
Different designer
and a different location.

334
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,068
- Yeah.
- Good work!

335
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,905
- You did it.
- Yay! Done!

336
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,490
- Those guys were nice.
- Yeah.

337
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,326
The one was a little too touchy.
The tall one.

338
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,495
- He liked you.
- He kept grabbing me.

339
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,830
He wanted you.

340
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,623
Yeah, but I'm going home
with you.

341
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,834
That's why we work
so well together.

342
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,423
Yep, this is a very important
wish. Do not rush it.

343
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,593
I'm just so glad this year,
like, last year it was so crazy

344
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,721
and it was a big party
and all this drama

345
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,556
and Audrina trying to come over.

346
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,224
And, like, this year,
I'm with the love of my life

347
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,144
and it's so, like,
much easier and low-key.

348
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,813
This is what I want, you know.

349
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,484
Long day.
You feel good about it?

350
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,277
It was perfect. It couldn't
have gone any better.

351
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,112
Yeah, we've come
a really long way

352
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,615
since first
young Hollywood party.

353
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,158
Nice job, boss lady.
