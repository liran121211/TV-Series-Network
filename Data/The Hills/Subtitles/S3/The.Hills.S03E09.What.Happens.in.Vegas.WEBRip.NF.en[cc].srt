- We are absolutely arguing.

342
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,208
Well, let's stop arguing.

343
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,084
Come cuddle.

344
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,753
- Can we just stop arguing...
- We'll just got to...

345
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:26,963
Can we just sleep outside
and just relax?

346
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,798
No, I don't wanna sleep outside.

347
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,342
Okay, let's take a nap
and then we'll roll inside.

348
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,219
You're a jerk
and I'm mad at you.

349
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,137
Why am I jerk? I'm not a jerk.

350
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,056
Because you stand up
for people you shouldn't.

351
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,975
Well, you know what?
I stand up for everybody.

352
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:43,187
- Everybody has a side.
- I stand up for my friends too.

353
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,398
Are you gonna have problems
not to stand up for Justin?

354
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,316
I may have problems. No,
I'm-I'm standing up for Justin.

355
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,485
I like Justin.
I like to see all sides.

356
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,159
Now, come on. Let's take a nap.

357
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,079
