00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,506
- 'How was Vegas?'
- Brody kissed me.

00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,175
What?

00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,136
You guys would be
quite the couple!

00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,805
I fought with Audrina
a little bit in Vegas.

00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,015
You did?

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,184
What were you fighting about,
Justin Bobby?

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,812
- Justin was rude.
- That's not okay.

8
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,773
I know, honestly, this was me
and Audrina's first fight too

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,817
in, like, the two years
we've known each other.

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,653
It is because we live
together now, and that happens.

11
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,989
You live together.
You're best friends.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,074
You do so much together.
It's bound to happen, you know?

14
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,204
- Random.
- What's random?

15
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,207
- Jen Bunney just texted me.
- Jen Bunney?

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,209
- Weird!
- What does she want from you?

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,962
She says, she needs
to talk to me.

18
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,881
She just said,
"I need to talk to you"?

19
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,008
"I really need to talk to you."

20
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,759
Wow.

21
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,845
She probably wants
to smooth things over.

22
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,472
Are you ready to talk to her?

00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,808

of catching up to do.

Yes.

What's wrong?

29
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,679
'Jen Bunney just texted me.'

30
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,723
She wants to get lunch.

00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,811
'It kind of got me
thinking about stuff.'

I just feel like I'm-I'm
have kind of been just

33
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,359
like, overstepping
and being too judgmental

34

'like the way I've been
treating you with Justin.'

35
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,240
It's hard because
I'm a very stubborn person.

36
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,534
And I don't like to admit
when I'm wrong.

really bad.'

broken from last year.

And it's like,
I'm still dealing with all that.

I'm just so scared

the same thing.

I'm trying to think that
I'm being a good friend

and, like, I made my
roommate move out.

47

Like, she couldn't even
live with me.

And it's like,
I'm trying not to do it again.

to happen again.

you have to help me, though

being annoying

to shut up.

what she wants.

I don't know. To fix things.
I really don't know.

pretty bad once

and I don't want to see that
happen to you again.

had a really hard year.

And in my eyes,
it's not...totally worth it

for you to, like,
throw yourself back

back in.

this weekend.

Um, I had Elodie covering
for me on Friday

106
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,630
and she was like,
"Oh, yeah, it's fine.

'Don't worry.
I'll totally be there."'

Elodie never showed up.

and I got there right away.

so, bottom line is Elodie

doesn't work here
anymore and you do.

somebody cover for you

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,103
what I need you to do
is you have to communicate

to everything you promised me

and everything you said that you
would do for this job, okay?

00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,607
How did it go? It's good?

175
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,693
Yeah, I mean...it's fine now

176
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,447
like, I'm obviously not
mad at her anymore.

177
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,241
What did she say? She just...

178
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,578
I guess, um,
she just recently had lunch

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,497
with Heidi,
and Heidi was like

180
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,958
"Brody was the one who
said everything about Lauren.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,709
Like, I didn't have anything
to do with it."

182
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,420
Heidi acted like she had
nothing to do with it?

183
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,630
But, worst of all,
she's, like, blaming Brody

184
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,881
who's been my friend all along.

185
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,927
I'm like, Brody's my friend.

186
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,139
Brody has never been the one
to start trouble ever, right?

187
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,723
No.

188
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,142
It makes me mad
that Heidi's going around

189
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,726
saying that about Brody.

190
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,520
Why would she say
that Brody was doing it?

191
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,147
Looks, like, 'cause
she's blaming every person.

192
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,606
I'm gonna see him
at dinner, though

193
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,066
'so I'm gonna ask him about it.'

194
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,651
'That's good.'

195
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,986
- We'll see.
- 'Yeah.'

196
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,781
It's good,
whatever happens, happens.

197
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,409
Truth and time tells all.

198
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,411
That's what Justin said.

[instrumental music]

200
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,722
I still can't believe Brent
said anything to you.

201
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,808
That's totally not your fault.
If you get somebody to cover...

202
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,935
I didn't know that Elodie
quit that day.

203
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,812
She was just trying
to snipe you out.

204
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,273
I can't believe she was so
mad about the job, like...

205
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,359
I mean, the bottom line is
if Elodie

206
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,693
was supposed to have the job

207
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,611
Brent would have
given it to her.

208
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,325
- 'It's not my fault.'
- Wha wha wha.

209
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,910
- 'Yeah.'

210
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,206
Lesson learned.

211
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,916
Can't depend on anybody.

You don't like
a lot of people around.

217
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,780
I can't deal with it.

218
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,199

on that side.

Was that it? Oh!

222
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,753
Me and Lauren
had a talk the other day.

223
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,089
- You did?
- Yeah.

224
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,426
She felt bad 'cause she felt
like she was interfering

225
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,843
and being too controlling.

226
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,929
- She was.
- 'Yeah.'

227
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,432
I just told her, like,
I'm gonna do what I want.

228
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,434
It's my life,
and I appreciate her concern

229
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,727
but, like, stay out of it.

230
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,981
You know, like,
give me my space.

231
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,857
But she apologized.
She said sorry.

232
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,859
And, like, she's happy for me

233
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,946
and she's gonna try
to not butt in anymore.

234
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,159
I think things should be

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,329
happy and blissful
and just mellow.

236
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,332
- Like it is now?
- Yeah. That stuff...

237
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,833
I mean, you know
how I feel about that.

238
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,586
It's just, like, why?

and, uh, life's too short.'

I think maybe something between

241
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,678
her and Brody
will spark up again.

- I won!
- You're amazing.

- How are you?
- Good to see you.

Good to see you too.

You look stunning...as always.

250
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,677
I had so much fun in Vegas.
I wanna back.

251
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,261
That was fun, wasn't it?

252
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,347
That night that
you crawled into my bed

253
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,015
'my rotating bed,
and then said that...'

254
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,475
You asked me to stay and come.

255
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,644
Oh, you, no.

256
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,771
Cheers.

257
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,649
- Cheers to...
- True friends.

258
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,859
I agree. True friends.

260
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,491
So, what else? Talk to me.

261
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,411
Um, I did want to talk
to you about something.

262
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,996
Do I need a sake shot
for this one or what?

263
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,873
So, I went out to lunch
with Jen Bunney.

264
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,877
I guess she still
speaks to Heidi

265
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,130
and that, um,
she basically said that

266
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,674
Heidi blamed every reason

267
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,386
I was upset with her on you.

268
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,138
She said that you spread
every one of those rumors.

269
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,057
She's lost her mind.
They both have.

270
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,892
If that's what
she's going around saying

271
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,352
she's completely lost her mind,
'cause it's not true.

272
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,895
But you won't look at me
and tell me

273
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,854
that you know they did it.

274
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,940
I try to stay away from that.

275
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,984
I just need you to be
honest with me.

276
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,404
And if I knew something
like that about you

277
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,906
I would tell you,
because you're my friend.

278
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,617
Now,
I'm stuck in a bad position.

279
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,577
I understand that,
but it comes down

280
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,203
to wrong and right.

281
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,122
Obviously in this situation,
he's wrong.

282
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,625
And that's just plain and
simple. It's easy to see, but...

283
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,501
Then, why won't you look at me,
and tell me they did it?

284
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,379
[sighs]

285
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,260
- 'Lauren.'
- What?

286
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,845
I know 100% fact
that they did it.

287
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,806
Thank you.

'What up, yo?'

291
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,828
Did you go out last night?

292
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,830
No, I went to sleep
at like ten o'clock.

293
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,750
- 'What'd you do?'
- Well, I went to dinner.

294
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,252
- Who'd you go with?
- I just went with Brody.

295
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,630
Oh, how was that?

296
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,299
Uh, it's the first time
he finally admitted to me

297
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,093
that he knows that Spencer
said all those things about me.

298
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,804
No way!

299
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,639
'Cause, he would never
admit it to me before.

300
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,307
I mean, first he was probably
trying to have his back

301
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,809
and now that they're
not friends anymore...

302
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,144
'Here's the thing
about Brody is that...'

303
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,147
...he even, like, when
he's not your friend anymore

304
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,899
or if he breaks, you know,
he breaks up with someone

305
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,235
'he never really
says bad things about them'

306
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,070
'which is something
I really like about him.'

307
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,531
That's a great quality.

308
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,032
And so, I was like,
you know, "Brody

309
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,742
"I'm not accusing you
of anything

310
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,369
'"but you know
they're out there saying that'

311
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,495
'you're the one saying
these things about me."'

312
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,121
So, then that sparked.

313
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,748
So, then he was finally
like, "You know what

314
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,166
like, I didn't wanna
have to tell you but, yes

315
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,710
I know for a fact he did it."

316
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,838
Oh, man.

317
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,924
Do you think that Heidi
was involved at all?

318
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,513
I mean, I feel like
there's a possibility that

319
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,139
he may have done it,
and then she knew

320
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,099
and then just kinda
went along with it.

321
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,480
So, Jen needs to know
to stop spreading rumors.

322
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,691
Well, I'm gonna text her
and let her know.

323
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,651
And set the record straight.

- How are you?
- Hi, Bunney.

327
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,132
- What's up?
- Nothing much.

328
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,134

- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Yeah!

You seem, like,
stressed or something.

334
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,402
Actually,
I went to lunch with Lauren

335
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,905
and we talked about
everything.

336
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,073
And we're fine.

337
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,827
I mean, I love that you're
friends with Lauren again.

338
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,370
I think you should be friends.

339
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,496
I thought the whole thing
was silly.

340
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,081
I thought, you know...

341
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,083
So you do wanna be friends
with her again?

342
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,380
If we can put this whole
thing behind us, you know?

343
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,677
I, I mean, that would be amazing
if you guys could just...

344
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,806
...end the drama, but it's just
such a sticky situation.

You know what I mean?
It's not a little thing.

346
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,811
It's not like someone
kissed someone.

347
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,938
It's like someone put something

348
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,606
in front of millions of people.

349
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:26,152
But, I feel like
I have to, like tell you

350
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,070
Brody told Lauren that

351
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,824
you know,
you and Spencer did it.

352
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,951
I mean, obviously he's gonna
say that, it's not...

353
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,287
You really,
really, really didn't?

354
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,914
- You really didn't?
- You think I did?

355
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,916
- No. I'm think...
- You think I did.

356
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,084
Okay, I would think that
you would know better.

357
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,628
I meant Spencer.

358
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,379
- What?
- Are you sure Spencer?

359
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,091
- Yes, I'm sure Spencer.
- That's all I was asking.

360
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,052
It's, just like, a question.
'Cause I was told that.

361
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,055
I think it's funny that you're
coming and blaming me for it.

362
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,891
- I'm not blaming you.
- But, you're coming at me...

363
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,768
No, no, I just asked.

364
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,394
I'm just gonna,
like, bring it up.

365
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,189
When you say no, that's that.
It's done.

[instrumental music]

367
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,946
Should we get the check?

368
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,572
Can we get the check?

369
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,825
[music continues]

370
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,833
Hey.

371
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,586
Aah! How was, uh...

372
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,881
Did you have work today, yeah?

373
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,090
No, I had lunch
with Jen Bunney.

374
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,092
Wow, those are always fun,
aren't they?

375
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,304
'I mean, Jen was telling me
that Lauren was saying'

376
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,058
"Brody says it was all Spencer
who spread the sex-tape rumors"

377
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,434
and blah, blah, blah.

378
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,478
He's such a little bitch.

379
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,438
I told Jen, I was like,
"How could you ask me that?

380
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,232
"Like, really,
I've been your friend through

381
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,484
"all this and Lauren hasn't been
talking to you.

382
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,445
And all of a sudden, like,
out of nowhere, you know."

383
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,740
It's great that they made up.
I'm really happy for that.

384
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,533
- 'But, like...'
- He's so shady.

385
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,993
I just think it's so sad

386
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,829
that they're blaming you,
right?

387
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,000
'Spencer.'
