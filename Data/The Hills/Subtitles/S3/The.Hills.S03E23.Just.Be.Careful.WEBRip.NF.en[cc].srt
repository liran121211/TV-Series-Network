00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,547
So you know how Stephanie
was at my birthday party?

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,007
Yeah, I saw her.

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,093
I guess Spencer freaked out
at her, like made her cry.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,971
Are you serious?

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,641
People just waste so much time
being angry at people.

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,351
I mean, she's not involved
in the situation at all

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,561
so she has no reason
not to be nice to you.

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,314
- And he called her Brody.
- Oh, God.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,692
I mean, if he, oh,
that's ridiculous.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,318
Can I hear about your new job?
I'm like...

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,487
So I get to New York,
and I walk in

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,948
and it's, like,
such a different atmosphere.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,450
I mean, like, she wanted me
to see how the New York offices

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,036
work because she basically
wants to model the LA office

15
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,788
after the New York office.

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,623
So the day that I was there

17
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,625
we were working
on the Sass & Bide show.

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,585
- So fun!
- 'So fun. And the stuff...'

Wait, did you get
to work backstage?

20
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,925
Yes. My job during the show
was to, um, call the models.

21
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,969
Like, Kelly would be like,
okay, next model, out

22
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,595
and I'd be like, go, go, go.

23

- That's, like, my ideal job.
- I know.

24
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,224

doing it I was like

25

right now.

00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,282
Basically, yeah.
It's just getting

172
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,243
all the press to the shows

173
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
and making sure
that it's being covered

174
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,081
and then getting
all the clothes together

175
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,749
and just the production.

176
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,000
So, basically,
it's kind of what we've done

177
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,044
before but just more intense.

178
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,837
Exactly. It's what
we've done before

179
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,381
but it's six at a times

180
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,591
instead of, like,
one at a time, you know?

181
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,510
That's crazy.

182
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,803
You weren't there the first time
I met Kelly Cutrone, were you?

183
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,934
No, but I got a crying
phone call of you in panic.

184
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,895
Remember? It was the first
young Hollywood party

185
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,522
and you, I was prepping for it

186
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,524
and you were going
to get tickets, right?

187
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,984
Yeah, I needed them
for Lauren Howell.

188
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,195
And she was a little bit of a...

189
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,405
Oh, my god!

190
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,782
Everyone says, like "Watch out."

191
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,452
She's a little scary
and I never saw that scary side.

192
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,787
'But there's this girl Jessica
who's, like'

193
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,706
'basically the boss
in the LA office that'

194
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,750
I don't know, maybe didn't do
what she was supposed to do.

195
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,002
I didn't know
'cause I wasn't there.

196
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,590
But she brought out her fangs.

197
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
- Scary side?
- Scary. Yeah, so...

198
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,094
- I wanna see the office.
- It's really cool.

199
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,054
- Is it?

so maybe you can come by.'

Oh, that's good.
Maybe I'll come tomorrow.

Do you have, like,
friends there, like...?

203
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,730
It's not like us
working together, you know?

You did the homework

No, I did the homework

Oh, yeah.

217
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,516
I went over it with her,
and she was like...

I mean, like, you can be friends

Hi.

340
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,572
- So how was your day?
- Fine. I'm just tired.

341
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,115
Me too.

342
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,952
- I'm cleaning up.
- Thanks.

343
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,787
- A little bit.
- Was it messy?

344
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,581
'No, there were just, like,
magazines everywhere.'

345
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,755

- Oh, tell me.

Well, when you were gone today,
Heidi came over.

347
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,179
Did she just, like, show up
or did you talk to her?

348
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,598
She called me,
and she's like, "Is it okay

349
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,018
if I come and get my stuff
'cause I'm redoing..."

350
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,352
What stuff?

351
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,687
She had that box that you put

352
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,104
in a pile with the mirror.

353
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,607
Did she, like,
come in here and chill?

354
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,528
She sat down
for a few minutes, yeah.

355
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,530
She was saying, like,
how weird it was being in here.

356
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,156
Why the hell was she in here?

357
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,491
I don't know.
She came to get her stuff.

358
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,035
Grab her stuff and leave then.

359
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,494
Why is she, like, coming in here

360
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,704
and like,
makin' herself at home?

361
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,205
It's not her home anymore.

362
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,623
I know,
I honestly don't even know

363
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,624

about the whole thing.

364

It's just weird.
