1
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:06,089
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,133
- It's gorgeous, right?
- Beautiful!

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,551
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,387
There's just so much you can do
with it, so much space.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,349
See, this is what
I was talking about

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,184
with the confessionals
on the sides.

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,103
Right.
Well, we could hide those.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,064
You could hide the
confessionals. It's not gonna...

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,442
I, uh, I was thinking
maybe we could put, like

10
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,402
some photo booths in them
or something.

11
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,070
- That could be fun. Totally.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,700
We were thinking maybe,
like, the band up there

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,618
and the runway down the middle.

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,120
Totally, yeah, just straight
down the middle for sure.

15
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,498
And I know back there is a

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,334
there's a big changing
section, so...

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,128
'And this is such a huge space,
and it's an absolutely'

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,006
beautiful space,
don't get me wrong.

19
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,090
But there,
we're gonna have to make it

20
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,176
look like there's a lot
of people in it.

21
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,386
'I think we have to draw it.'

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,971
I think we have to look at it.

23
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,556
And, I'll pull together
a bunch of references

24
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,599
and furniture ideas
and drawings.

25
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,976
Right, 'cause,
she's gonna have...

26
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,686
I know Amy's gonna have,
I mean need

27
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,772
every detail in front of her
visually, so...

28
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,191
This is many more discussions
now that we've found

29
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,484
the space, thank you.

30
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,903
Well done. Great.

31
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,866
[instrumental music]

32
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,838
- Hi, Whitney. How are you?
- Hi.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,423
- 'Hi, Lauren.'
- How are you?

34
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,427
So, we're going to send you
to New York again.

35
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,012
- You've both been?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,597
'You're gonna go,
uh, on the red-eye'

37
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,808
to meet with Amy Astley
and her whole staff

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,643
'to present everything
that we discussed'

39
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,103
'for the Young Hollywood party.'

40
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,773
- Okay
- So, you'll do the whole

41
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,650
run-through as we did
at Viviana.

42
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,485
'She needs to see
all the pictures'

43
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,571
'and you should take
all the inspirations'

44
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,989
and all the changes
that we made.

45
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,240
This is them.

46
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,784
These are the ones that we had

47
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,535
and Amy's seen these.

48
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,788
'But the ones
with all the new ideas...'

49
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,998
- She hasn't seen any of those.
- She hasn't seen any of that.

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,208
- So you wanna get the drawings.
- Right.

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,461
And the color scheme
and the flowers.

52
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,880
And then you'll come back
right after the meeting.

53
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,590
- Right.
- 'So, you know that'

54
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,383
'it's serious business
in New York.'

55
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,844
You'll do a great job.
I count on you.

56
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,597
'Come back successfully
and quickly, okay?'

57
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,057
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

58
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,642
Bye.

59
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,480
Oh, man. I can't believe it.

60
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,398
I haven't been to New York
in so long.

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,985
- And we get to go together.
- I'm excited.

62
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,736
I'm really excited.

63
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,614
'I did not wanna make
this presentation by myself.'

64
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,866
As soon as she was like,
you're going to New York

65
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,160
I just, like, my closet
ran through my brain.

66
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,079
I was like, "Oh, my God.
What am I gonna wear?"

67
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,081
I mean, obviously.
Do you know what's so funny?

68
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,749
- What?
- I totally have a dress

69
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,584
on reserve for our next meeting

70
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,711
with Amy Astley, so
I don't even have to shop now.

71
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,672
[instrumental music]

72
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,274
- Well, look who it is.
- What up, bro?

73
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,777
- What's up...
- Hey, let me call you back.

74
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,863
What are you doin' here
pickin' up a little paycheck?

75
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,448
Yep, I do Saturdays
at Area with Brent.

76
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,785
Well, I haven't seen you in,
what, three months?

77
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,954
It's been a while.
I've been chillin'.

78
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,540
So, Brody left you a message
on your birthday.

79
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,834
We called you on your birthday,
and we didn't get a callback.

80
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,003
With Brody and I,
it's as simple as this.

81
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,048
I've been Brody's loyal
best friend for so many years.

82
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,841
I've defended him.
I've fought for him.

83
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,426
And then he started
hanging out with LC

84
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,139
who all she does is bash
my name, try to tear up

85
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,265
my relationship with Heidi,
all these things, right?

86
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,267
Lauren's my friend.
Brody's my friend.

87
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,603
And he should be able to hang
out with whoever he wants.

88
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,898
And if you can't accept that,
then you guys

89
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,316
are never gonna be friends.
He called you on your birthday.

90
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,986
Maybe that was a little way
to reach out to you.

91
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,571
Well...

92
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,906
If you wanna continue
your friendship with him

93
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,240
you go reach out,
you go call him

94
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,783
and you go talk to him.

95
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,494
It's, it's all about
moving forward.

96
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,206
- 'Alright.'
- I gotta go spend my money.

97
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,543
[instrumental music]

98
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,177
Hey, you ready to go to lunch?

99
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,470
You're never gonna guess
who I just ran into.

100
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,431
- Who?
- Frankie Delgado.

101
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,891
Oh, yeah, he works
for Brent sometimes.

102
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,184
What'd he have to say?

103
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,309
He was just like

104
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,561
you got to understand.

105
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,812
There's two sides of it, like

106
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,147
Brody can't believe that you

107
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,190
wouldn't be friends with him

108
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,109
over talking to Lauren.

109
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,902
I was like,
it's not about that, Frankie.

110
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,445
It's about that
I wouldn't do that.

111
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,863
And Brody's
not the kind of friend

112
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,490
I have been and will be to him.

113
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,451
So many people have said
bad things about Brody.

114
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,162
Am I friends with those people?
Yeah, right.

115
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,164
It's like, that's the difference
between Brody and I.

116
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,458
He'd be friends with somebody
who says bad things about me

117
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,168
I wouldn't do that
with my friends.

118
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,087
- Right.
- I mean, I...

119
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,672
I don't care. I really don't.

120
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,216
Well...

121
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,721
[instrumental music]

122
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,149
[upbeat music]

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,704
(Lauren) 'Thank you.'

124
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,796
Ready?

125
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,345
Hey, we're here
to see Amy Astley.

126
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,182
Okay, you can just have
a seat over there

127
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,100
and her assistant
will be right out to get you.

128
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,810
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

129
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,438
We really stepped it up here.

130
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,274
Do I look like
"Teen Vogue" Barbie?

131
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,733
I don't think I would
ever wear this

132
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,776
into the office at home.

133
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,944
It's just, like, a whole

134
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,654
different world out here.

135
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,741
- Did you practice at all?
- Um, not really.

136
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm a little nervous.
I'm like, dripping.

137
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,123
Lauren and Whitney?

138
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,000
- Come on in.
- Hi.

139
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,590
Alright, girls. Thank you.
See you in the morning.

140
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,383
- Hi, Lauren, nice to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

141
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,844
How are you doing?
Good to see you.

142
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,512
Hi, Whitney.
Oh, you got all your stuff.

143
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,140
- Yeah.
- Okay, have a seat, girls.

144
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,142
- Great to see you guys.
- You too.

145
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,519
Sorry.

146
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,271
Whitney, it looks like you
have all your presentation

147
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,522
for the Young Hollywood meeting.

148
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,149
- Ready to go.
- Great.

149
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,399
I'm looking forward
to hearing that

150
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,110
this afternoon with the staff.

151
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,696
'I think having the Marc by Marc
Jacobs Show there.'

152
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,115
You know, it's gonna be a week
after the New York Show.

153
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,909
And he's never done that before

154
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,495
'you know to restage a show,
e-especially in LA.'

155
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,622
So I'm happy that we were able
to convince him

156
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,085
that that's a good thing to do,
and actually, Lauren

157
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,295
I have heard
from Lisa Love that you

158
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,089
are a big fan of Marc Jacobs.

159
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,548
Mm-hm. He's my favorite.

160
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,133
- He's your favorite?
- 'Yeah.'

161
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,052
I've spoken to Kate Waters
who works with Marc.

162
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,179
'So, she said she'd love
to meet you and talk to you.'

163
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,305
Oh, wow.

164
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,639
So, we have to send you down

165
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,392
to Marc Jacobs, um,
now, actually.

166
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,936
Oh, okay.
So I'm not doing the meeting?

167
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,230
No, you're not gonna do
the Young Hollywood meeting.

168
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,981
'Um, Whitney can handle it.'

169
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,067
And you have about 20 minutes
to get downtown.

170
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,360
'Do you know your way
around New York?'

171
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,987
- Um, not...

- How are you?

00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,736
Come on, back with me, actually.

188
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,447
- Okay.
- We're working today, we're...

189
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,948
You know, we have
our fashion show next week

190
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,741
so we're doing
a big casting today.

191
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,576
So, Amy said that maybe
you'd be able to help with that.

192
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,828
Yeah, of course.

193
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,413
I know you maybe didn't think

194
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,580
'you were gonna
be doing this today.'

We really appreciate it.
We have a lot going on.

So, let me introduce you

I wanna introduce you to Lauren.

Michelle's gonna let you know

Let's introduce you to Venetia.

'This is Venetia Scott.
She's our stylist.'

Hi. Lauren. Nice to meet you.

206
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,603
So, I guess I'll have you
kind of running back and forth

207
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,481
doing a lot of different
things, but for the most part

208
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,483
you're just gonna be
stationed right here.

209
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,776
You'll have to do the
finishing styling, tuck them in

210
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,778
tie their bows, give them shoes

211
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,989
and then send them to me,
and I really want them to be

212
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,199
a hundred percent styled.

213
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,075
- Okay.
- Thank you.

(Amy) 'Hi, guys.'

00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,509
So, Whitney, I'm so glad
you could come from LA

218
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,929
to spearhead our
"Young Hollywood" meeting today.

219
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,766
This is Whitney's first time
to present to us as a member

220
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,643
'of our staff,
not just as an intern.'

221
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,479
So we're counting on you.

222
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,731
And, um, why don't you
go ahead and take us through

223
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,316
the, uh, location first?

224
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,693
Okay. Okay.

225
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,279
So, I have all these boards.

226
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,906
Um, what I just wanted
to start out with was

227
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,493
kind of the bird's-eye view
of the whole surrounding area

228
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,787
and the church, this will...

229
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,164
You'll come in right here
and go straight outside for...

230
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,793
- Is there valet for the cars?
- There will be valet. Yes.

231
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,170
So, they'll do the pictures

232
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,214
and then they'll immediately
go outside.

233
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,674
- So, they go out to the garden?
- They go out to the garden.

234
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,177
There's this huge tree
in the middle

235
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,431
that they want
to, um, hang chandeliers from.

236
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,849
- How many chandeliers?
- Um...

237
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,188
Um...I'm not sure on the number.

238
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,399
'Cause too many
is gonna look, mm.

239
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,610
- Yeah, a little too much.
- 'Too much.'

240
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,904
(Whitney)
'So, yeah, um, what else do I
have here?'

241
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,491
I have all these outside,
I know they're working

242
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,159
they like
a lot of wicker, maybe.

243
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,870
This is actually, looks a little
sort of weathered.

244
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,915
- 'Do you think it's too brown?'
- 'Yes.'

245
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,584
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Mm-hm.'

246
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:12,213
Um...so,
there is a straight runway

247
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,174
which will just be a carpet.

248
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,177
- Mm.
- 'But...'

249
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,638
- I think no carpet. Tacky.
- 'Yeah.'

250
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,056
- Mm-mm. Okay.
- Too sloppy.

251
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,808
It just makes it less
complicated, as well

252
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,352
to get the party started
after the show.

253
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,270
Exactly.
We don't have to roll it up.

254
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,315
- 'No carpet.'
- Okay, so, we'll nix that idea.

255
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,901
And... Okay, so, then,
these were the florals.

256
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,029
Where are these
flowers going, exactly?

257
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,281
- Um...
- 'Where do they go?'

258
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,742
I think that,
um, probably lining

259
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,245
maybe lining the side,
the walls.

260
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,124
They look like table top
arrangements to me, though.

261
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,086
So, you can go back and maybe
fine-tune some of these things.

262
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,464
- Okay.
- Alright. Good.

342
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,340
like that every day now.

343
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,301
[all laughing]

344
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,139
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

345
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,225
- To the Young Hollywood party.
- To the Young Hollywood party.

346
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,852
Whoo!

347
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,145
[instrumental music]

348
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,865
[doorbell ringing]

349
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,366
Coming.

350
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,494
- Surprise.
- Hello!

351
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,912
What up?

352
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,164
Oh! Welcome back.

353
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,125
I missed you.

354
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,168
Come on in.

355
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,422
Lot of candles in here.

356
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,090
Trying to set the mood here?

357
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,467
What's going on here?

358
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,552
So, what about New York?
Tell me.

359
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,471
- How did it go?
- It went really well.

360
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,306
We basically got there,
and she was like...

361
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,057
I didn't even know
what I was doing

362
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,643
and I went to the meeting,
and she sent me away

363
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,520
immediately to go downtown and
go to

364
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,689
the model casting
for Marc Jacobs.

365
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,525
And I got to help out,
and I actually got to meet him.

366
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,445
Um, so are you okay?
What's going on?

367
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,741
- Yeah, I, um... Spencer.
- Spencer?

368
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,618
'He called and left me a
message. He was reaching out.'

369
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,495
He misses me and, you know...

370
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,417
So, I haven't
called him back yet

371
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,919
and I don't think I'm going to.

372
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,754
You don't wanna make up
with him?

373
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,339
I mean, I-I love Spencer,
but I don't think

374
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,424
I could ever look at him
the same, ever.

375
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,761
I mean, It's like, I just don't
ever think that we'll be...

376
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,304
best friends again, you know?

377
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,226
Well, I know that the reason,
like, you guys stopped

378
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,478
stopped talking
was because he was bothered

379
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,564
that you were hanging out
with me.

380
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,482
I just don't want
to be responsible

381
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,067
at all for breaking up
a friendship

382
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,569
especially not one
that lasted so long.

383
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,987
You know what I mean?

384
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,613
I made this decision.

385
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,032
Uh, the reason why I don't
wanna talk to him

386
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,700
is for my own reasons.

387
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,830
So, listen, I think there's
too many pillows in between us.

388
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,582
Maybe, you know, just a little

389
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,083
you could come and give me
a hug or something.

390
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,752
- Oh!
- Oh!

391
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,127
Give me a hug.

392
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,713
Alright.

393
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,007
- Now I'm cozy.
- Are you?

394
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,967
Little bit.

395
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,428
How about we forget all the BS?

396
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,346
I'll always be there for you

397
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,515
and you'll always
be there for me.

398
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,600
- Okay.
- Okay?

399
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,976
Okay.

400
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,020
My candles worked, didn't they?

401
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,564
They did, actually, what
