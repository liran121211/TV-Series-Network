I know that you guys

is expand The Hyde brand

20

into other markets.

21

Exactly.
You guys are all roommates.

348
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,086
You guys are all friends,
you know what I mean?

349
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,964
It shouldn't, there shouldn't
be that heat at all, you know?

350
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,425
Then, it's like, in, uh, right,
I do try to make an effort

351
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,218
'and talk to them as a friend.'

352

She rolls her eyes
or she turns her head

353
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,681
or, like, texts on her phone.

00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,808
I'm like, I'm not gonna talk
to someone who does that to me.

355
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,143
Put it this way,
you got to think of what...

356
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,020
...how you act to people,
it's like...

357
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,980
(Audrina) 'And I, I treat people
how I wanna be treated.'

'you're getting
that same respect'

some other places, you know.
