1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,339
- Hi, girls!
- Hi.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,007
I want you guys to go
to this event

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,217
and cover it for Teen Vogue.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,848
It's, uh, Norman Lear's event to
celebrate the power of the vote.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,975
I'd like you to go,
enjoy yourselves.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,643
- Awesome.
- And this is it. Alright.

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,520
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,104
Oh, here. There's a website.

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,483
What is... declareyourself.com?

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,151
(Lauren)
'This is really exciting.'

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,863
Oh, here's a list of everyone
who's going.

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,198
- 'What?'
- What?

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,326
It says Brent Bolthouse is
a member on the advisory board.

14
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,787
'Isn't that Heidi's boss?'

15
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,622
Interesting.

16
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,169
Do you think Heidi
will be there?

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,380
I don't know.

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,674
Well, we'll see when
we get there, right?

19
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,719
And we'll handle
the situation accordingly.

20
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,724
[rock music]

21
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,319
- Hey!
- Hey.

22
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,738
What are you doing?

23
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,656
- Third cup of coffee.
- Yeah?

24
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,617
Yeah.
I'm, like, way over caffeinated.

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,327
Uh, have you heard
about that event

26
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,787
tonight the declare yourself?

27
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,622
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brent gave me a ticket.

28
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,457
- Are you going?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

29
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,543
- Yeah, we should go together.
- Yeah, definitely.

30
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,795
I heard it's like one of
the biggest events of the year.

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,797
Brent was saying.
Big red carpet.

32
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,925
Yeah, it'll be fun. It's a good
cause, too, you know?

33
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,843
- Yeah.
- Give me a call.

34
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,469
Let me know at what time
you're heading over and stuff.

35
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,930
Okay. Perfect.

36
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,434
[instrumental music]

37
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,521
[cameras clicking]

38
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,495
This is a party where
we don't have to work.

39
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,706
I know. We can enjoy ourselves.

40
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,541
- Ah!
- Let's mingle a little.

41
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,209
It's probably the best
assignment we've gotten yet.

42
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,753
[laughs] I know.

43
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,506
She said, actually said,
"Enjoy yourselves."

44
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,300
(Lauren) 'The chick who was in
"Devil wears Prada?"'

45
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,052
(Whitney) 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'

46
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,137
The really ridiculously, like,
hot guy is here.

47
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,264
- What?
- I know.

48
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,433
- Where?
- Way over there.

49
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,268
There's a couple cute guys here.

50
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,312
'I know. I was gonna say that
same thing to you.'

51
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,066
This is the first event
we haven't worked, actually.

52
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,652
- This event looks amazing!
- I know.

53
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,656
Everyone went outside.
Do you want to go out?

54
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,324
Yeah, let's go outside.

55
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,081
Want to grab a table?

56
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,007
- 'Food.'
- Wait.

57
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,549
Where's Audrina tonight?

58
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,678
Why wouldn't...
Why didn't she come to this?

59
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,138
Uh, because Lisa only gave us
two tickets

60
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,973
and because she's on a date.

61
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,391
She's on a date
with Justin Bobby?

62
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,353
[instrumental music]

63
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,339
Why didn't you get that stuff
that you put in your hair

64
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,258
and it makes it into dreads?

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,636
'Cause that defeats the purpose,
dude.

66
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,100
'I got my,
I'm not a receptionist anymore.'

67
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,727
I'm more involved.

68
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,269
'I get to help out with artists'

69
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,313
and I got my own little cubicle
in the back

70
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,025
like a table
and my own computer and...

71
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,069
Bigger responsibility.

72
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,779
Tomorrow we're working
with Sean Kingston.

73
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,365
And we're going to "Jimmy
Kimmel," and he's performing.

74
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,952
- You're not nervous, are you?
- I am a little nervous. I am.

75
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,121
Just 'cause I don't know
what to expect.

76
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,040
It's, like, my chance to really
prove that...

77
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,457
[belches]

78
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,625
[chuckles]

79
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,296
So did you ever get my phone
call that I called you?

80
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,673
Did you leave a message?

81
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,426
I called you that next morning.

82
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,721
Wait, when was that?
That was like last week.

83
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,141
Dude, if I tell you
I'd call you, I call you.

84
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,351
I know I have to work
all day tomorrow

85
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,520
but afterwards,
do you want to go out after?

86
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,064
Yea... Yeah.

87
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,733
I'm there.

88
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,072
[belches]

89
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,492
[rock music]

90
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,873
[indistinct chatter]

91
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,380
Oh, God. Heidi's right there.

92
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,633
You know that girl
I told you about?

93
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,969
She's standing over there
with her friend.

94
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,386
It's all for them.

95
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,847
Oh, my God.
She's, like, right there.

96
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,141
Is this horrible for you?

97
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,184
I'm like, it's horrible for you.

98
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,065
I think I'm gonna go up
and say something to her.

99
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,485
Hi.

100
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,616
I'm Whitney, by the way. Hi.

101
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,369
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

102
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,331
'I just haven't talked
to you, so I wanted to see

103
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,500
how you're doing
and what's going on.

104
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,919
If you want to apologize to me,
I'll talk to you.

105
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,421
Well, you know that
I didn't do anything, so...

106
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,673
Having your boyfriend

107
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,049
do your dirty work
doesn't make you innocent.

108
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,051
My dirty work? I don't have
anything to do with it.

109
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,762
Your sex tape and whatever
has nothing to do with me.

110
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,307
You think it's okay for someone
to say those things about people

111
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,017
'and go on
and think it's funny?'

112
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,185
I mean, nothing's funny.

113
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,435
It has nothing to do with me.

114
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,229
It has nothing to do with you?

115
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,315
- 'No, it has nothing...'
- Nothing to do with you at all?

116
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,275
You think it's okay
that he went and did that?

117
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,485
- That my boyfriend went...
- It's-it's okay?

118
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,403
I had nothing to do with you

119
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,156
and anything that you've done
with your ex-boyfriend.

120
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,657
That has nothing to do with me,
Lauren.

121
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,993
Okay, you can keep saying that
and make yourself think

122
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,120
you're a good person,
but you're a bad person.

123
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,039
I didn't do anything wrong.

124
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,547
Okay. So, have a great night.

125
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,799
Night, guys.

126
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,761
[instrumental music]

127
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,063
[instrumental music]

128
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,743
- Hey.
- 'Hi.'

129
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,162
- Do you want some vegetables?
- Oh, yeah.

130
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,997
I know.

131
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,249
[sighs]

132
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,042
How was your night last night?

133
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,087
We weren't sure if Heidi
was gonna be there, but she was.

134
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,588
What?

135
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,173
She, like, came up
and tried to talk to me

136
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,758
like everything was normal.

137
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,301
- Did she come up by herself?
- 'No.'

138
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,802
'Some other girl was there
with her.'

139
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,388
And she's like,
"Hi, how are you?"

140
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,890
Like, "This is so silly."
You know.

141
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,475
And I was just like, well,
you know, "You did a bad thing.

142
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,144
It's not silly.
You said these things about me."

143
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,687
She's like, "I didn't have
anything to do with it."

144
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,940
Whether she said things
about me or not

145
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,858
she knows that Spencer did.
And she knew he was doing it.

146
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,945
- 'She was doin' it and she...'
- And she let it happen.

147
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,947
Sometimes doing nothing
is just as bad.

148
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,865
What did she say, just nothing?

149
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,201
She just...
She's just in such denial.

150
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,494
How do you go to sleep at night,
like, next to someone

151
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,996
knowing they can do
terrible things

152
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,497
like that to people?

153
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,792
She used to be so,
like, just fun.

154
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,043
People change.

155
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,712
Yeah.

156
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,426
'So, you gotta work
with Sean Kingston today?'

157
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,969
- Yeah.
- 'I got to work, too.'

158
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,138
- We should go get ready.
- 'Okay.'

159
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,769
[instrumental music]

160
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,860
Your picture's gonna be up here,
Sean.

161
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,154
Yeah.

162
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,574
Let's go. Sound check.

163
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,751
- With, with Samantha. Yeah.
- Yeah.

164
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,045
- 'Yeah, I know this song.'
- You're like, wait! I know.

165
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,175
[instrumental music]

166
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,252
You know, I was supposed to go
out with Justin tonight.

167
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,254
- It's not gonna happen.
- No, I know.

168
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,423
I mean, we probably won't be
done till, like, 8:30.

169
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,050
'We were supposed to go out
at seven.'

170
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,469
No, you won't. Honestly,
there's no way in hell.

171
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,263
- You can see Justin any day.
- I know. I'll just call him.

172
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,557
I mean, I could have him

173
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,393
- No, don't do that.
- No harm.

174
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,102
- I'm at work, yeah.
- You're at work, yeah.

175
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,437
I'll just call him tomorrow.

176
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,024
- Whatever. Yeah.
- This is fun.

178
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,284
Hi.

179
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,163
- 'How are you?'
- Good. How are you?

180
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,290
Our night was quite eventful
last night. Ha-hah.

181
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,251
I don't understand
what she wants to say to me.

182
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,752
She doesn't wanna apologize,
she doesn't wanna admit

183
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,462
she's wrong,
so until that happens

184
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,423
I don't really have
anything to say.

185
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,217
Right. She doesn't know that,
though. She's just gonna...

186
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,802
- Seriously?
- What?

187
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,056
- Seriously.
- What?

188
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,850
She's on my freakin' IM.

[keys clacking]

190
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,983
She IM'ed you?

191
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,944
'What'd she say?'

192
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,321
(Lauren) '" I think we should
meet up and talk."'

193
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,616
Wha... I don't know does she
need so badly to say to me?

194
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,413
What are you saying?

195
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,581
"What do you want
to talk about?"

196
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,124
'That's what you said?'

'"I would like to put this
behind us. Everything."'

198
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,886
'Is that what she just said?'

199
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,939
What's going on?

200
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,941
'What's-what's happening?
Fill me in.'

201
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,239
- 'Lauren?'
- Sorry.

202
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,283
Is everything okay?
I just want to help.

203
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,701
No, no, no. it's fine.
I'm just...

204
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,204
She wants to meet up after work.

Thank you.

a whole lot more.

- It means you're poppin'.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

It means you're poppin'.

Basically, when you're famous

we say you're poppin'.

You're poppin'. Yeah.

And not "You rocked the house."

223
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,826
- I tore it up.
- Okay.

224
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,329
- Don't say "Rock the house."
- Or shut it down.

- Oh, we shut it down.
- Who rocks the house.

Bye, Sean. Thank you so much.
You did great.

Thanks, Sean.
It was great working with you.

[instrumental music]

240
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,709
- Good evening, sweetheart.
- Hi, love.

241
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,127
I was just reading this
interesting little iChat

242
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,963
on, uh, my computer.

243
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,216
'And unless hell's freezing
over currently'

244
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,345
it's pretty much the craziest
iChat I've ever read.

245
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,013
- What?
- '"Hey, it's Heidi.'

246
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,515
I think we should meet up
and talk."

247
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,765
Oh, the one with me and Lauren.

248
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,560
"What do you wanna talk about?"

249
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,687
You don't have to read the whole
thing to me. I wrote it.

250
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,606
Thank you. Um, I know.

251
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,149
I figured, you know,
I saw her at declare yourself

252
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,194
and I tried to talk to her and,
like, apologize for things then.

253
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,405
And I guess, you know,
she didn't hear me then

254
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,366
so I figured this has all gotten
out of hand.

255
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,825
It's like, it's just to a point

256
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,620
where I need to go over
and talk to her.

257
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,455
I was like, well,
we were friends for too long.

258
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:12,751
- 'Just... Why not, right?'
- Well, be careful.

259
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,462
You're heading
into the lion's den.

260
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,591
But life's too short to keep
having all this anger

261

from Mr. Sean Kingston.

- Sean. He sent those?
- Yeah, they're so pretty.

265
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,665
He's only 17 and he's sending
flowers already?

266
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,291
He's a ladies' man.

working with you.

Thanks for all your hard work.

I thought I didn't...

how it was gonna be

00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,883
if he was gonna be a,
like, a diva.

272
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,552
Yeah. How he was gonna act.

273
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,096
- But you did good. Very good.
- 'Thanks.'

is different now.

I'm very impressed.'

things went the other night

Just been so frustrated
and I know you have been, too.

296
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:44,235
And so many he said-she said,
stupid rumors and this and that.

297
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,447
And I can swear to you
on my life

298
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,198
and to God and to everything

299
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,576
that I really had nothing
to do with that.

300

But did Spencer?

301
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,497
I mean, I don't know if Spencer
had anything to do with that.

302
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,792
- You're lying to me.
- I'm not lying.

303
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,795
If Spencer did anything,
I'm sorry on his behalf.

304
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,297
I can't control Spencer.
I have nothing to do...

305
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,091
You know he did it,
though, Heidi.

306
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,635
Don't look at me and tell me

307
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,428
that you don't know
'cause you know.

308
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,597
Do you think I had an idea
what was going on?

309
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,515
I think that you know that
Spencer did this.

310
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,309
I think you don't want to
believe it because you love him

311
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,936
'and I understand that.'

312
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,604
'Because sometimes
when you love people'

313
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,731
you want to believe
they're good.

314
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,818
Lauren, he's not bad.
He's not bad.

315
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,403
He did this to me and you want
me to say he's a good person?

316
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,280
- Yeah, but, Lauren...
- I really...

317
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,826
I really, really wish
you could know how bad it was.

318
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,452
I mean, I wish I could
take it back.

319
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,746
You don't think that
I miss you as a friend?

320
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,624
'You don't think that I wish
that none of this happened?'

321
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,627
I had no idea anything was
happening. I really had no idea.

322
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,213
Heidi, sometimes whether you did
something or you did nothing

323
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,924
it's just as bad.

324
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,427
I'm not Spencer,
and I can't control Spencer.

325
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,555
How can you hate someone so much

326
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,851
that you literally want to
make them wish they were dead?

327
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,019
Spencer doesn't hate you.

328
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,522
I'm so sorry if...

329
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,231
(Lauren)
'This is the person that'

330
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,192
went around and made calls

331
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,695
and made an effort to make sure

332
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,488
'that everyone would hear
these things about me.'

333
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,574
This is the person
that you want to marry

334
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,451
'and spend the rest
of your life with.'

335
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,620
'And you have to live
with that.'

336
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:21,040
- Lauren, I love Spencer.
- Good. You know what?

337
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:25,294
You really must love him to
stick by him through all this.

338
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,714
I'm not saying
Spencer's an angel.

339
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,049
Well, I didn't come here to
fight with you. I really didn't.

340
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,759
'I just came here to say'

00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,553
'I really am sorry for all that
you've been through'

342
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,305
and I'm so sorry for things
that have happened this way.

343
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,932
(Lauren) 'I appreciate that.'

344
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,726
It was really hard
for you to apologize.

345
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,020
I understand that,
and I really do appreciate it.

346
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,859
But the only thing, really,
that there is to do

347
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,029
is to forgive and forget.

348
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,196
'So, I really do.'

349
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,574
'I want to forgive you...'

350
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,993
...and I want to forget you.

351
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,123
Yeah. Well, this...
It was great seeing you.

352
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,584
The apartment looks great.

353
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,044
And I hope
you have a great life.

354
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,547
So...have a great night, Lauren.
