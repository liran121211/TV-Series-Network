1
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:03,504
- 'Hey.'
- Hey!

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,046
- 'How are you?'
- 'Good, how are you?'

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,340
Good.

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,634
What's going on with you?

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,845
Jason called me last night.

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,471
What?

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,556
'No way.'

8
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,934
Where is he right now?

9
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:20,103
'He's over in Orange County
in a rehab center, so...'

10
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,314
He got out today
and he's stoked.

11
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,692
How long has it been since
you've spoken to him?

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,318
I don't even know when, like...

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,153
I feel like
the last time I really, like

14
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,280
like, met up with him
was to drop off his things.

15
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,949
So, what did he say?

16
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,701
He just want to see
how you're doing or...

17
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,495
He wants to, like,
meet and catch up.

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,122
So, do you want to?

19
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,124
I feel like he just
has a way of every time

20
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,960
I start to have
everything back together

21
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,628
and everything's good,
he's like...

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,588
- He slips right on in.
- He must have a pager.

23
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,590
That's like, "Everything's
going good in Lauren's life."

24
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,049
"Hmm, I got to call her."

25
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,259
Time to show up.

26
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,803
[chuckles]

27
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,683
[instrumental music]

28
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,655
(Jarett)
Back straight, Audrina,
let's go.

29
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,656
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen, keep it going.

30
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,408
Give me five more.

31
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,951
Good, Lauren. Two more.
You guys got good form.

32
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,452
You must have a good trainer.

33
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,287
We got to get you sweaty.

34
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,248
Push-ups. Finish the workout
strong. Let's go.

35
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,125
'Five. All the way down.'

36
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,794
- What's the matter?
- My phone just rang.

37
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,086
You don't have your phone
with you, do you?

38
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,672
- No. It's in my purse.
- Oh.

39
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,924
- 'Good.'
- You know, like, dog whistles.

40
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,466
Like, only a dog can hear 'em?

41
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,301
That's how I am
with my Blackberry.

42
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,845
No one will hear it, and I'm
like "My phone's ringing."

43
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,221
- Have you done boot camp?
- No.

44
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,765
- You haven't done it?
- No.

45
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,349
I teach boot camps.

46
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,642
Okay, I'm sorry.
So, you've never gone to it?

47
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,936
'No, I haven't.'

48
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,144
'Cause we were out last night

49
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,187
and some guy was saying that...

50
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,773
Ow! It wasn't that hard.

51
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,106
I have a buddy that
works over there.

52
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,734
- What's his name?
- Derek.

53
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,444
- Ah! That was him.
- 'Who Derek?'

54
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,820
- Mm-hmm.
- You met Derek?

55
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,113
- Yeah.
- What do you think of him?

56
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,865
He's a nice guy.

57
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,618
The four of us
should go out tonight.

58
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,786
Okay.

59
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,746
[instrumental music]

60
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,330
- Where are we going?
- Lola's.

61
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,624
- Lola's.
- That's our favorite place.

62
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,166
- We go there all the time.
- We love it.

63
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,627
We're doing shots, too.

64
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,253
What kind of trainer,
tells me to take shots?

65
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,504
Once a week.

66
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,966
[music continues]

67
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,765
It's so nice out today.

68
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,310
So, was that Jason who called
during the workout?

69
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,062
Yeah.

70
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,815
Yeah, he wants to get together.

71
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,149
Has Justin called you yet?

72
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,113
He keeps calling me,
but I'm not answering.

73
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,197
Don't you hate that?
Like, bad guys.

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,783
You're like,
"I just want to get over you.

75
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,284
I just want you out of my life."

76
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,702
And as soon as you
stop thinking about them

77
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,079
they'll, like,
send you a text message

78
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,580
or they'll call you,
'cause they know

79
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,832
that you just stopped
thinking about them.

80
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,334
It's like a radar.

81
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,461
Yeah.

82
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,630
So, we're gonna go out
and have fun.

83
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,465
No more Justin or Jason.

84
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,677
- Only new boys.
- To us.

85
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,929
[chuckles]

86
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,306
[instrumental music]

87
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,275
Brent told you how to
put them through the machine?

88
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
Yeah, but the stands, I don't
know how to mail them out.

89
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,863
And we still need to do
return labels.

90
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,156
- Good morning.
- Hi. Good morning.

91
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,699
Hey, what are you guys doing?

92
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,283
Oh, uh, not much.

93
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,743
Did you hear about
the new job opening?

94
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,953
No. What?

95
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,496
There's an opening for a new job

96
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,165
for, um, an events director.

97
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,624
- And I think that...
- Oh!

98
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,667
I know.

99
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,543
It comes with its own office!

100
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,045
[laughs]

101
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,421
- 'So much space in here.'
- I know.

102
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,716
It's like one of the biggest
offices here.

103
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,967
I'm dying for my own office.

104
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,468
Yeah, it's like a step up.

105
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,595
Yeah, a lot more
client interaction

106
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,181
and stuff like that, so...

107
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,515
I don't know
when they're gonna hire...

108
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,184
- Sounds like a big job.
- I know.

109
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,977
I don't know when they're gonna
hire anyone for it

110
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,228
but hopefully
they promote within.

111
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,938
Yeah, definitely.

112
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,190
I'm definitely gonna talk to
Brent about it.

113
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,816
- You should.
- Yeah.

114
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,442
I mean, I definitely think
that I'm ready

115
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,153
and I've worked here
for two years.

116
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,612
- That's it?
- Yeah.

117
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,157
Over two, a little over
two years.

118
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,743
So you started
right before I did?

119
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,370
A year before.

120
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,247
You know, I've worked
pretty hard, so

121
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,957
hopefully Brent will,
you know...

122
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,709
- Acknowledge it.
- Acknowledge it.

123
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,586
- When you gonna talk to him?
- I don't know.

124
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,838
I have to check his schedule
and then set up an appointment.

125
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,049
[instrumental music]

126
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,610
- 'Hello.'
- 'Hey, hey!'

127
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,153
[sighs]

128
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,821
I got some good news.

129
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,364
I love good news.

130
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,119
There's a position opening up
at Bolthouse.

131
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,913
I guess Brent's looking
for someone to be, like

132
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,206
the event director and so...

133
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,875
Event director? Very legit.

134
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,796
But, um, I think that Elodie
was saying she might want to...

135
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,257
You beyond deserve it.

136
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,008
And I think you should do
whatever it takes

137
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,843
to get that position.

138
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,804
'I'm ready to help you step up.'

139
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,431
- You're ready to help me?
- Whatever you need from me.

140
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,850
It would be amazing.
I'd get my own office.

141
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,560
And my own assistant.

142
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,063
And guess who I think
deserves it the most.

143
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,023
[music continues]

144
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,909
[indistinct chatter]

145
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,127
Back in Jersey,
there was dudes that would have

146
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,295
their heads shaved and then
they would have

147
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,963
like, no hair and just a tail.

148
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,007
That's a, that's a mullet.
What up, ladies?

149
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,424
- Hi.
- Hi! How are you?

150
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,010
- How are you?
- What's up? What's up?

151
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,469
- How are you, baby?
- Good to see you.

152
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,762
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

153
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,722
- You too.
- Good.

154
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,100
- That's a cool ring.
- Thank you.

155
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,685
Let me see that thing.

156
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,478
I should wear it
next time I work out.

157
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,022
Where're you from?
Are you from here originally?

158
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,274
I was born here but
raised in Orange County.

159
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,859
Have you ever been
to the East Coast?

160
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,901
Oh, I've been to New York.

161
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,069
New York's not bad.

162
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,946
How's Jersey different?

163
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,532
A lot of the construction thing
going on and, like, just...

164
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,076
- It's cool, I mean it's like...
- They build a lot?

165
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,577
We build, we're builders.

166
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,455
Why do you have a
Michigan state T-shirt?

167
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,000
'Cause it cost 40 cents
in the thrift store.

168
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,918
That's a good reason to wear it.

169
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,588
Well, now the thrift stores are
like 50, 60 bucks for shirts.

170
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,299
I was in one the other day
in Melrose.

171
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,009
It was like,
it's vintage. 70 bucks.

172
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,136
And like, I bought,
I have like nine shirts at home

173
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,470
that were all 40 cents.

174
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,140
Now vintage is,
like, more trendy.

175
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,226
That's why they can mark it up.
You know what I'm saying?

176
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,853
Well, isn't it weird that
I can buy a shirt for 40 cents

177
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,980
and then a year later, I could
probably find the same shirt

178
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,815
and it's gonna be 40 bucks?

179
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,775
- That's very weird.
- I know. I found that out.

180
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,654
That's why I got them all
before I got out here.

181
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,989
Good job.

182
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,116
[instrumental music]

183
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,507
No, you don't.

184
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,300
What?

185
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,106
Be honest. You totally have
girlfriend issues, don't you?

186
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,317
'Cause I had a boyfriend
for like a year

187
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,152
and I have like
a million issues from that.

188
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,949
There's not a nice way of
saying, "That's your problem."

189
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,284
Yes, it is.

190
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,761
[music continues]

191
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,959
- Hey.
- Hi.

192
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,462
- What's going on with you?
- Just got back from school.

193
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,671
'How was school?'

194
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,173
Glad to be out of the classroom.

195
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,799
Are we working in here today?

196
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,843
Yeah, I'm supposed to

197
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,970
color-coordinate
these clothes right here.

198
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,721
Give me my job, boss man.

199
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,556
- Basically, that's your job.
- Okay. Got it.

200
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,101
- I think I can figure it out.
- 'Okay.'

201
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,894
So, what's up? What's new?

202
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,023
I'm just tired 'cause
I was out late last night

203
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,649
and now I'm sleepy.

204
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,818
What were you doing
so late last night?

205
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,155
Me and Audrina went out with
Jarett and this kid Derek.

206
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,241
- Jarett as in our trainer?
- Jarett as in our trainer.

207
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,118
- And how was it?
- It was kind of brutal.

208
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,120
[chuckles]
'Oh, God.'

209
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,247
Tell me all about it.

210
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,041
On the first date,
don't tell me that

211
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,793
you like me more than
any girl you've ever met.

212
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,171
- That's scary.
- Right? It's not just me.

213
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,006
I feel like a guy should know

214
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,799
not to talk about himself
for two hours straight.

215
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,802
At least you weren't there
with him by yourself.

216
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,346
- 'That would have been a...'
- Don't even say that.

217
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,014
That's not even funny.

218
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,557
Guys need to realize that

219
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,267
they may have to wait
a little while

220
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,186
and they shouldn't be
so desperate.

221
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,439
Do you know that every guy that
I've gone out with since Jason

222
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,107
I've only gone on
a first date with?

223
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,692
- Really?
- No second dates.

224
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,445
I have a one-date curse
that I need to break.

225
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,700
I think it's just one of those
things you have to go through.

226
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,161
Not everyone's gonna be like
your Prince Charming.

227
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,541
[instrumental music]

228
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,344
Hey, Heidi.
You want to come in?

229
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,179
I know you wanted to talk.

230
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,314
- How's it going?
- Um...

231
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,941
Well, I heard about
that job opening up

232
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,527
for the event director,
so, I was thinking maybe

233
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,653
I could be considered
for that position.

234
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,573
It's a team decision
'cause obviously you'd work

235
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,366
really, really closely
with Rob and Brian.

236
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,867
You'd work underneath them.

237
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,786
'And then there's also,
you know, Elodie.'

238
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,288
Well, I feel like
I've been here a long time

239
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,789
and I've worked
really hard and

240
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,124
I'd definitely be
up for the task

241
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,708
if I'd be able to be considered.

242
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,668
So it means a lot
bigger of a position

243
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,254
'than what
you're doing currently.'

244
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,964
- Yeah.
- 'Okay, interesting idea.'

245
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,048
Let me think about it.

246
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,217
[instrumental music]

247
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,479
Um, Jarett texted me,
he said that

248
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,648
we need to get our butts
in the gym ASAP.

249
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,983
We've been slacking.

250
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,318
[doorbell rings]

251
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,902
Come in! It's open.

252
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,446
- Hello?
- 'Hi.'

253
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,822
- <i>Hola!</i>
- 'Hi!'

254
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,865
- 'Hello!'
- It's party time.

255
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,826
So, what's going on?

256
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,078
Audrina, I heard you got
in a fight with Justin Bobby.

257
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,955
Yeah, but
I'm still gonna, like...

258
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,833
You know, I'm not gonna
go out of my way or anything

259
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,293
but I'm still gonna...

260
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,128
- Be friendly?
- 'Yeah.'

261
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,421
You're being paged.

262
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,840
[cell phone buzzing]

263
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,425
- Hello?
- Okay.

264
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,843
- You pick up unknown numbers?
- 'Hi.'

265
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,136
- 'What're you doing?'
- Um...

266
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm cooking with the girls.

267
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,181
I'm with Lo and Audrina.

268
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,265
Oh, is that your daddy?

269
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,058
- Jason.
- No way.

270
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,726
I don't believe you!

271
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,770
I thought you were just
calling me to be nice.

272
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,772
Creepy.

273
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,941
Oh, I don't know.

274
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,568
(Jason)
'Okay, well, yeah. Okay.'

275
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,278
(Lauren)
'Okay, bye.'

276
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,113
So, Jason's doing good?

277
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,865
You never know with him.

278
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,784
And I was like, I think
we're good as friends.

279
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,162
You can't just be just friends
with somebody like that.

280
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,875
Hmm.

281
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,044
(Audrina)
Okay, Lauren, I'm gonna
ask you one of these.

282
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,339
"If, starting now,
you could have $500 a day

283
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,132
"until you next touched
your lover

284
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,093
how long do you think you would
avoid physical contact?"

285
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,222
You're not in a relationship.
That doesn't count.

286
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,891
Okay, "How many times
have you fallen in love

287
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:10,021
and allowed yourself to
just be swept away?"

288
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,524
- Once?
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,984
- Was that Jason?
- Yup.

290
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,695
[instrumental music]

291
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,263
Derek called me yesterday,
and he, like

292
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,347
he left me a message,
I haven't...

293
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,932
- He called you?
- Yes.

294
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,351
Oh! You should listen to it
right now.

295
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,894
I, like, kinda
don't want to know

296
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,062
what he's gonna say.

297
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,063
He'll probably be like...

298
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,356
"Hi, wifey.

299
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,274
Ready to go get married?"

300
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,192
That's not funny.

301
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,069
Is it just me?
Am I, like...

302
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,071
No, you just know
what you want

303
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,323
and you're, you know, you're
not gonna settle for any less.

304
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,491
[laughs]

305
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,825
Lauren, put it on speaker.

306
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,244
- I want to hear it.
- No.

307
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,704
- Please?
- No, he was like...

308
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,205
"I'm just calling to see
if you wanted to

309
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,082
get together tonight
for a drink."

310
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,084
Negative.

311
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,254
Maybe I just have, like, too
high of standards in my head.

312
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,632
There's no perfect guy.
No one's perfect...

313
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,760
Obviously, I don't want
a perfect guy, like...

314
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,511
I like imperfection, but...

315
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,348
This is so random.

316
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,476
Last night, Justin called me.

317
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,810
He wanted to talk, and he
apologized and blah, blah, blah.

318
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,564
'Cause I hadn't answered
any of his calls

319
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,858
or anything for a week.

320
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,444
So...

321
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,070
You know,
I answered the phone

322
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,239
and I wanted to hear
what he had to say.

323
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,950
So, he apologized
and said he was sorry.

324
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,412
And he never says sorry,
and he said sorry.

325
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,332
- And...
- So, how did it end?

326
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,751
It basically ended, like,
I told him, like

327
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,254
"Maybe we're better off
just being friends."

328
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,674
You're not just friends.

329
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,550
I just think that
you want to be with him

330
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,051
when he's the good Justin.

331
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,679
'Mm-hmm.'

332
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,806
But he can't always be
the good Justin.

333
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,184
And you can't just like
half of who a person is.

334
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,478
[instrumental music]

335
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,745
- Hey, Lacey.
- 'Hey, Heidi.'

336
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,121
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

337
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,414
Good, thank you.

338
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,960
- Morning!
- 'Good morning.'

339
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,587
- 'How are you?'
- Good, how are you?

340
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,592
- Morning!
- Hi, what are you doing?

341
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,594
- Congratulations.
- 'Thank you.'

342
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,055
So, are you gonna decorate it?

343
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,350
Um, yeah, definitely gonna
put up some picture frames

344
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,227
and stuff, but...

345
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,855

No.

Well, good for you.

348
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,865
- I mean. I'm glad.
- I mean, I'm...

349
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,200
- Yeah. Sorry it, didn't...
- That's okay.

350
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,827
- 'Work out...'
- No, that's fine.

I didn't want it
to be like that.

354
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
- 'You know what I mean?'
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

355
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,961
No, but good for you,
I mean...

356
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,424
As long as you appreciate it
as much as I would have.

357
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,008
- I do.
- But no hard feelings.

358
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,010
No, exactly.
It's not personal.

How long do you have off today?

Just this time to come out
and have coffee?

I have, well, I don't really
have anything going today.

381
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,649
I already went to
my morning group.

This place is cute.
It's so quaint.

how it happened.'

- What?
- The whole breakup thing.

It was just, like...

387
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,288
...we totally stopped talking.

388

Had to.

389
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,792
I had to make
a clean break from you.

I know. It was hard.

though, again.'

I, you know, I told you I'd be
your friend again eventually.
