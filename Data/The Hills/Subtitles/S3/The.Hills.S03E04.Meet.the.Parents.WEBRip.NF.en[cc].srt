She doesn't need
to worry about it.

with Brody again?

with my exes though.

with Brody and I is that

each other's company.

along really well.

if I brought Justin?

No, no, no, he said you can
bring people, so...

it's like a party.

We're gonna get our fitness on.

176
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,722
You guys should get on the one
next to us and start racing.

177
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,391
I'm not going on the kayak.

178
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,393
- You're at a beach.
- I'm too afraid.

179
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,895
- You want a boogie board?
- 'Yeah, Serena.'

[chuckles]

185
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,293
Go, go, go.

186
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,668
'Oh, oh.'

187
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,920
'Go, go, go.'

188
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:47,592
Go, go, go.

00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,011
Ah, my finger.

191
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,222
Ah!

192
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,848
- I broke my finger.
- You alright?

193
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,434
Yeah, I'm fine.
Swear to God, swear to God.

194
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,102
- It's broken, trust me.
- It is.

195
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,937
It's broken, I know about that.

196
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,815
Yeah, Lauren did it.

197
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,192
[instrumental music]

198
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,906
This has really
nice stuff in here.

199
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,574
Did you want to go in anywhere?

200
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,534
I got to get a Crested Butte
T-shirt ASAP.

201
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,620
Let's go in
and get your T-shirt.

202
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,247
I tried to buy you one before
and Heidi was like

203
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,417
"Don't send him a T-shirt."

204
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,960
(Heidi)
'What do you think
about Spencer?'

205
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,796
He's...nice.

206
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,673
He's-he's polite.

207
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,217
And as long as that's
the person you like, then...

208
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,386
Yeah, I've always
said I wanted, you know

209
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,347
a guy like my daddy, so...

210
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,723
Well, if you think
he's that way, then

211
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,267
that's all that's
important to me.

212
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,810
(Heidi)
'No, I love him a lot.'

213
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,187
I'll take it slow,
though, you know.

214
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,688
One day at a time.

215
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,482
I need to talk
with him and see how...

216
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,276
...see, you know, I haven't had
that talk with him.

217
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,944
Well, let me know
if you have that talk.

218
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,863
Yeah, I look forward to it.

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,212
That won't move past.

222
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,629
Oh, my God.

223
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,715
Here, let me see.
Isn't that bad.

224
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,884
I-I swear to God, look.

225
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,219
Was that playing football?

226
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,803
This part won't
move right here.

227
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,929
I'm just gonna go
get this checked out.

228
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,473
Okay. Bye.

229
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,228
- 'Thanks, daddy.'
- 'You're welcome, sweetie.'

230
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,189
- So good.
- Nice out here today, too.

231
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,649
- Yeah.
- Nice little breeze.

232
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,527
- Everybody good?
- We're all good.

233
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,070
- Can I get anything for you?
- I'm good, thanks.

234
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,029
Spence? Let's go have
a little talk.

235
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,822
What do you say, buddy?

236
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,615
Let's do that.

237
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,576
- Be back in a little bit.
- See you back, buddy.

238
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,036
If I'm not back, come get me.

239
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,579
[laughing]

240
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,417
Well, I'm glad
you came out and, uh...

241
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,377
I get a chance to meet you
and we can talk

242
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,670
a little bit and I can get to
know you a little better.

243
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,465
You know, I just want to
kind of build that trust

244
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,884
that I have with Heidi
with you somehow.

245
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,054
I mean, all I can tell you is,
in my whole life, I never

246
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,390
never thought I was gonna
be the kind of person

247
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,393
that wanted to
get so serious with a girl ever.

248
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,270
'Cause I was like, "Oh, I'll get
married when I'm 50."

249
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,812
'And it's like,
at the end of the day'

250
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,147
I just love spending

251
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,774
every second with Heidi, so...

252
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,486
But Heidi has been
this type of gal that

253
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,447
would be very social,
and then she would get

254
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,823
a boyfriend, and she would lose
all of her friends

255
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,910
because she would kind of, they
would become secondary to her.

256
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,538
And, I mean, now
all she has is you.

257
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,209
But if things were to go south,
what would happen to her?

258
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,046
I-I just hate to have her have
all her eggs in one basket.

259

'Look at him.
He's such a flirt.'

261
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,527
'He's been ignoring me
all afternoon.'

262
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,407
Serious, that guy should be
jumping to date you.

263
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,284
Right?

264
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,288
[indistinct chatter]

265
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,920
I mean, it's way worse. I got to
get surgery in ten days.

266
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,508
- What?
- Oh, my God!

267
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,301
That's all 'cause of you.
It's all 'cause of you.

268
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,052
Well, you won't believe,
I'll show you what happened.

269
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,971
(Lauren)
'Oh, my God!
You've got an X-ray!'

270
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,931
Well, laugh it up, guys.

272
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,352
All they do is laugh.
Yeah, keep on laughing.

273
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,312
Can't wait till
it happens to you.

[instrumental music]

275
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,822
I'm so happy
that you're in a loving

00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,407
'mature relationship.'

277
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,409
Spencer could be the guy
that ends up being

278
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,827
you know, your husband.

279
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,829
Could be,
that's who I want to be.

280
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,789
Well, he's made a huge effort
to come all the way out here to

281
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,667
Colorado and get
to know your family, and...

282
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,793
I can't imagine my life
without Spencer.

283
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,920
Like, he's my best friend.
He's my boyfriend.

284
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,464
He's my everything,
and I got no...

285
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,840
I know,
and that's kind of my concern

286
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,091
because I don't think...

287
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,552
You don't need to be concerned

288
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,303
this is my life
and what I'm doing...

289
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,557
My only concern for you is,
if, you know

290
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,765
that you guys
end up having trouble

291
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,059
where are you gonna go?

292
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,977
I have a lot of friends.

293
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,979
A lot of Spencer's friends,
and they have girlfriends

294
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,525
and hang out with
a lot of them, and...

295
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,902
What happened between
you and Lauren?

296
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,945
It seemed like it was just all
of a sudden...

297
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,198
She was upset that I was
spending time with Spencer.

298
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,326
That couldn't be the only thing,
there must be something...

299
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,704
It just seems to me that
there's a lot, I mean, if you...

300
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,664
I don't even want to talk
about this right now.

301
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,626
It just seems like
everything's getting magnified.

302
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,752
I just don't think we'll ever
be friends again.

303
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,798
And that's it.

306
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,313
I feel really bad.
I'm so sorry you got hurt.

307
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,107
I'm gonna tell him what
everybody said to him.

308
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,359
Because girlfriend of mine,
Lauren laughed at me

309
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,569
when I walked in.

310
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,279
It's kind of funny, though.

311
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,281
Just listen to me,
right now, if you were to

312
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,283
start laughing at me, it'd be
like, "It's kind of funny."

313
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,702
But when I first walked in,
for you to just laugh at me...

314
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,579
Brody, look at me,
look at me. If I was like...

315
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,914
"I hurt my finger and
I got to get my finger fixed."

316
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,293
And I came back with a full,
like arm cast to my elbow

317
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,169
it would be a little funny,
'cause it was unexpected.

318
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,921
You have to understand
something.

319
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,798
I'm a little
insecure about <i>this,</i> <span style="bodyStyle"> okay?</i>

320
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,635
'So please understand that.'

321
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,011
It's not a big deal,
but it's like, it kind of sucks.

322
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,764
Will you guys just
chill out, please?

323
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,349
God. See, that was nice.

painted this whole place.

327
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,154
I would love to come
and help you guys.

328
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,656
I would love to paint
your apartment.

329
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,325
Heidi just repainted
our apartment.

330
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,909
- Heidi painted our apartment.
- A nice white.

331
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,869
It's a very beautiful color.

332
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,623
So, Spencer, I'm impressed with
your commitment with this ring.

I wanted her to know'

with her.

'and bounce back
from those, and...'

00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,598
I would marry her today,
so, I mean, it's...

341
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,767
she deserves the world, so...

00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,859
Where's Whitney? She should have
been here at 8:00.

345
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,153
I was at work with her today,
and she was not feeling well

346
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,071
all day, so she went home.

347
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,907
Spencer's not here, either.

348
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,993
- You guys are good?
- Yeah. No, we're good.

349
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,539
- It's... We're good.
- I honestly...

350
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,581
He's just always
with Heidi constantly.

351
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,041
No, I know, I get that.

352
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,835
Because, honestly,
like, the last

353
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,047
whatever times I've seen you
out, never Spence...

354
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,466
I get it. I lost a best friend
last year, too.

355
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,095
(Spencer)
'Now, I see
why she hates on every'

356
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,806
'other chocolate soufflé in LA.'

357
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,766
This is the real deal.

358
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,434
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

359
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,602
(Spencer)
'We'll be waiting.'

360
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,106
What an angel.

361
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,359
(Darlene)
'So, Spencer, it seems to me
that Lauren saw'

362
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,695
'as Heidi getting
taken away from her.'

363
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,572
Why does there have to be
an either or?

364
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,324
It's literally like a
stubborn, immature, selfish

365
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,744
little girl who's like,
"I want Heidi to myself!

366
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,620
You don't share her."

367
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,789
It's literally like that.
That's what it's about.

368
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,712
Heidi could have benefited
from having her as a best friend

369
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,047
and you as a boyfriend.
There's room for everybody.

370
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,591
Especially with a heart
as big as Heidi's.

371
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,217
What are you talking about?

372
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,511
As a best friend, you know,
to be there

373
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,055
for two years, and to work
as hard as you did...

374
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,932
Why are we
talking about Lauren?

375
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,726
[rock music]

376
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,066
My mom, she's was like,
"I'm so glad you

377
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,737
have Audrina in LA
because I love Audrina so much."

378
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,614
And she's been
such a good roommate.

379
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,407
It's hard
to find good friends.

380
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,368
Heidi is just, she let
Hollywood go to her head.

381
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,454
It changed her, it turned her
into a different person

382
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,581
and she let a guy
influence her.

383
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,207
You know what I mean?

384
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,667
I know, but you don't,
like, understand.

385
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,044
I know guys do do that

386
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,963
but you just got to stick
with your friends.

387
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,467
But only to a point.
Like, Jason hated Heidi.

388
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,469
Like, he hated her.

389
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,930
And, like, he always said,
like, "I don't care

390
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,432
like, your friends like me."

391
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,559
You don't wanna let people in.
It's hard for you.

392
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,686
And once you let those people
in, you don't want to

393
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,480
let them go,
and when they...up you're like

394
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,022
"Why would you do that to me?

395
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,858
"Like I gave you my feelings.

396
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,277
I did everything for you,
and you screwed me over."

397
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,781
It's like...I wish Heidi
was a better person

398
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,074
but, I mean, you
have Lo, you have Jill.

399
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,327
You have all your amazing
friends, Lauren.

400
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,203
I love you to death.

401
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,165
I would do
anything for you, ever.

402
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,459
It's just hard
losing a best friend.

403
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,669
I know.

404
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,090
- I love you.
- I love you too.

405
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,806
(Heidi)
'Alright,
I'm gonna go to bed.'

406
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,768
I'll be in there
if you need anything.

407
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,273
- Alright, I love you.
- Love you.

[instrumental music]

409
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,204
I'm gonna go grab us
a couple of drinks.

410
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,831
I haven't seen
Justin in forever.

411
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,666
I'm gonna try to call him.

412
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,959
He probably
won't even answer.

[instrumental music]

414
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,891
Hey, Justin left this
on the couch.

415
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,059
He put my helmet on the couch?

416
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,728
'He just left me?
He's gone?'

417
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,982
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

418
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,028
Seriously, I'm done.

[sobbing]

420
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,080
- I'm done.
- I know.

421
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,541
- I can't do it anymore.
- Look at me.

422
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,670
Homeboy wore combat boots
to the beach.

423
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,006
I know you don't wanna call
that your boyfriend.

424
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,008
I know you don't.

425
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,176
Him leaving this on the table

426
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,637
not saying bye, like...
I'm done.

427
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,847
I'm over it.

428
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,682
Hey, baby.

429
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,894
Life's tough.

430
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,772
Both: We'll get our own helmets!

431
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,733
- I love you.
- I love you.
