1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,964
Ugh, what a long night. Jeez.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,715
That was one of the crazier
things that's ever happened

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,425
to me, her screaming at me.
I'm just like...

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,469
- You're pathetic.
- I'm like, What did I do?

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,304
I have no idea what
you're even talking about.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,222
You're brainwashed. That's why.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,684
Ooh! Master,
what should I order for lunch?

8
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,226
[chuckles]

9
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,979
Hmm.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,481
No, I just don't even know
what her problem is.

11
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,025
And Audrina. Oh, my God.
This is between me and Lauren.

12
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,697
"You can go back to whatever
you were doing, little lady."

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,033
Lauren, I think she was
in a really bad relationship

14
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,703
so I think she thinks
I'm the same way as her.

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,455
You know, like, you're
choosing the wrong guy and...

16
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:42,041
Like, I'm going through the same
thing and it's not, you know?

17
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,919
You can't even compare.

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,216
We still have to get
all this stuff for the apartment

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,385
and start really moving in.

20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,266
Maybe I'll pick out, like,
some paint colors for the walls.

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,894
Whatever.

22
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,729
Like a light yellow.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,814
Light yellow?

24
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,065
[imitates buzzer]

00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,069
[instrumental music]

26
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,541
(Lauren)
'So who is this guy Justin?'

27
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,960
We liked each other
right when we first met.

28
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,837
'I was working
at Quixote Studios.'

29
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,630
But I was actually
dating someone else

30
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,424
and he was calling me.

31
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,009
And when I called him,
he was with someone else.

32
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,301
And then he wasn't,
and then I wasn't

33
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,054
and we started hanging out.

34
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,180
So, why'd you stop dating then?

35
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,016
'Cause I went to Vegas with him

36
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,810
and they were partying
and then...

37
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,437
Wait a minute!

38
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,939
'They wanted to go
to that strip club.'

39
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,648
That was the same Justin?

40
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,026
- Yeah, so...
- He abandoned you in Vegas.

41
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,028
Yeah. I know what you think.

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,821
I think there's a reason
you stopped seeing him

43
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,657
and that getting back into it,
you're gonna have

44
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,285
the same reasons
to stop seeing him again.

45
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,704
It's not like
I'm gonna marry the guy.

46
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,081
I'm just going on a date.

47
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,165
I'm keeping my opinions
to myself.

48
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,834
They just get me in trouble.

49
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,628
Meow meow meow meow.

50
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,005
Well, afterwards,
we're going to Forty Deuce.

51
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,883
I'm going with you and Lo.

52
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,552
It'll be fine. You'll have fun.

53
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,096
'Then you'll come out
with the girls'

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,847

00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,112
- Honey, I'm home.
- Oh!

57
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,864
My favorite part of the day.

58
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,911
Oh, my God. What is this?

59
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,871
It's a protein shake.

60
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,458
No, no, no, no. What is this?

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,167
You said we needed
to get some art.

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,840
- I got us some art.
- 'Did you design this?'

63
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,675
(Spencer) 'I had a little part
to do with it.'

64
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,594
- 'The money signs?'
- 'That was my detail.'

65
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,680
'But I thought you were
gonna pick, like, pick out'

66
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,389
paint colors with me
and we were gonna put up

67
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,725
like paintings
and that kinda thing.

68
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,727
We can still do that. We have
how many walls in this place?

69
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,312
Yeah, but it's a whole
different vibe now.

70
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,066
It's not even, like, a girly...

71
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,610
It's not anything.
I don't know.'

72
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,112
Uh.

73
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,489
What's wrong?

74
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,620
- It's a gift.
- It's a great gift.

75
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,080
It's a gift to yourself?

76
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,125
That's mean. A gift to myself?

77
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,377
This is our living room.

78
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,920
I guess.

79
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,297
Maybe I can cheer you up
with some good news.

80
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,758
Uh, you have white paint
coming tomorrow?

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,553
This weekend, we're going
on a little romantic getaway

82
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,805
to Santa Barbara,
to the beach house.

83
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,725
I got lots of surprises
planned for Santa Barbara.

84
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,435
[jazz music]

85
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,290
- How are you? Good.
- Good. How you doing?

86
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,043
- You look cute.
- So do you.

87
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,128
Nice. I don't know,
it's good to see you.

88
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,178
'Cheers.'

89
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,729
So, I don't get
what half this stuff is.

90
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,313
Tell me one thing
that you think you know

91
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,815
and then let's get it.

92
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,109
Okay.

93
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,907
(Lauren)
'Audrina's been gone for,
like, two and a half hours'

94
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,492
and she said, she was like,
"I'll only be gone an hour."

95
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,328
Didn't they date, like,
a while ago or something?

96
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,706
[sighs] 'Rekindled flame.'

97
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,499
[laughing]

98
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,501
'I don't think he was very nice
to her, though.'

99
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,797
- What do you mean?
- Stories I've heard.

100
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,633
- Well, what did he do?
- 'He abandoned her in Vegas.'

101
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,094
Oh, oh, my gosh!

102
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,805
You know there's that one
person you always go back to?

103
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,723
'You'll date other people,
but like'

104
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,642
'you kind of want to run
into them when you're out.'

105
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,518
Yeah, well, it's like somebody
that you always have a crush on.

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,939
Exactly.
He's kind of that for her.

107
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,942
Do you think that they're
gonna be boyfriend-girlfriend?

108
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,527
<i>Yo no se.</i>

109
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,113
'But I mean, I'm all
about second chances.'

110
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,573
- 'I've done second chances.'
- Yeah.

111
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,785
Do you think people
can really change though?

112
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,370
I think that everyone can change
if the right person comes along

113
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,373
and I think that every girl
wants to be the right person.

114
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,959
She wants to be,
every girl wants to be

115
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,961
the one girl
that can change that guy.

116
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,672
But why do you have to have
a guy that you have to change?

117
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,924
Don't you wanna meet somebody
that's good already?

118
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,134
That's too easy.

119
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,513
Look at you go in this thing.
I like that.

120
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,765
- I'm working out.
- No, you're looking hot.

121
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,521
I like how you're cutting pieces
and I'm eating 'em.

122
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,858
You haven't seen
the new apartment, have you?

123
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,401
Unh-unh. I haven't.

124
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,321
You're with, uh, Lauren, right?

125
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,281
- Yeah.
- 'How do you like it?'

126
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,573
'It's fun.'

127
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,370
- See how different I am now?
- 'You are different.'

128
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,874
- See?
- You're better.

129
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,125
You're not so bad.

130
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,586
So what's this guy's name,
Justin?

131
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,672
- Okay, his name is Justin.
- 'Yeah.'

132
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,133
But he, like, wants
to change it to Bobby.
- Why?

133
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,010
But people keep calling him
Justin Bobby.

134
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,138
[laughing]

135
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,934
We have to be nicer.

136
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,770
[whispers]
'We have to be nicer.'

137
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,273
- Hi.
- Audrina's home!

138
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,524
How are you guys?

139
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,318
Lo, this is Justin. Justin, Lo.

140
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,819
(Lauren) 'Justin, I think
I've met you before.'

141
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,863
I know, I know, I did.
Hi. How's it going?

142
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,490
- 'It's nice to meet you.'
- Nice to meet you, too.

143
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,993
- How was dinner?
- It was good. We went to, uh...

144
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,120
- 'What was it called?'
- Cobra and Matadors.

145
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,082
We couldn't really understand
the menu, but it was good food.

146
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,666
Yeah? So, Justin, I heard

147
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,877
you are trying to change
your name to Bobby?

148
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,088
- My friends call me Bobby.
- Oh. Can I call you...

149
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,881
Everyone was confused on what

150
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,674
you're being called.
Is it Justin or is it Bobby?

151
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,343
No, like all my friends call me
Bobby, and it's just...

152
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,679
Oh! So you don't want us
to call you Justin Bobby?

153
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,224
You can call me
whatever the hell you want.

154
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,685
- I kind of like Justin Bobby.
- 'Whatever floats you.'

155
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,229
Let's see, let's see your room.

156
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,774
Do you think, do you think
we hurt his feelings?

157
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,276
I don't know.

158
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,237
[laughing]
He didn't like us very much.

159
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,780
[Justin coughs]

160
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,575
Well, we're gonna
go to Forty Deuce.

161
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,286
- You're going right now?
- 'Yeah.'

162
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,124
- Oh.
- I know.

163
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,333
I mean...

164
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
Are you gonna go?
You have seats, don't you?

165
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,130
Well, I was planning on going,
but you can go.

166
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,383
Do you wanna come or...

167
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,636
Okay.

168
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,722
- Bye.
- 'Have fun, lovebirds.'

169
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,433
Bye. It was good seeing you.

170
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
(Lo) 'Bobby, it was really
nice to meet you.'

171
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,021
- 'Bye.'
- 'Bye. Drive safely.'

172
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,773
That was really weird.
She invited me.

173
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,067
And we had two tickets to go.

174
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,820
[whispers]
I think that Justin Bobby
took your ticket.

175
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,238
[laughing]

176
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,157
- You think?
- Yeah.

00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,082
[upbeat music]

178
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,560
Hi.

179
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,646
- How was your night?
- It was fun.

180
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,523
Uh, Justin, I like him.

181
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,651
I mean, basically,
he wants to start over

182
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,113
'and he's definitely changed
since like two years ago.'

183
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,614
So I'm gonna give him a chance

184
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,367
and we're gonna see
what happens.

185
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,077
A chance to, like,
be your boyfriend?

186
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,331
Well, not boyfriend,
we're just seeing, you know?

187
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,333
Jus, he doesn't
open up very easily

188
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,960
but he wants to, like,
get to know you, too

189
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,505
'cause you're, like,
my best friend and roommate.

190
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,298
So we should all
go out together.

191
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,508
Do you want salsa
with your eggs?

192
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,717
'Yeah.'

193
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,515
You'll like him.
Like, he's different.

194
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,059
And I know I used to vent to you
about what he used to be.

195
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,978
All I know about him is
you, yeah, you venting.

196
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,522
So I don't know
any good things about him.

197
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,981
Well, that was a long time ago

198
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,649
whenever you and Heidi met him.

199
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,360
And I didn't really
know you that well

200
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,944
but I know Heidi
didn't like him either

201
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,530
from right off the bat.

202
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,114
I mean, he's just,
he seems different.

203
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,866
We'll see, you know?

204
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,119
'I wonder if he has
any cute friends for you.'

205
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,500
Remember, Audrina,
you and I have very...

206
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,044
- Different tastes.
- Different tastes. I know.

207
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,587
Different, but the same.

210
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,101
This is, uh,
this is a big deal in my life.

211
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,728
I definitely want you
to be my best man, so...

212
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,939
Best man? For what?

213
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,566
Dude, I'm probably
gonna pop the question

214
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,858
tomorrow at my beach house.

215
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,360
- What?
- Dude...

216
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,029
You're talking
about getting married?

217
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,156
You can't even say that
with a straight face.

218
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,908
What is that little smirk?

219
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,785
That's 'cause it's not married,
it's getting engaged.

220
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,162
It's the first step to marriage.

221
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,664
Homie, you've been dating
Heidi for one year...

222
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,959
But it's been the best year
of my entire life.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,877
Just because you all of a sudden
get in a relationship

224
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,754
where it's great, that doesn't
mean you need to get married.

225
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,631
Not great. Flawlessly perfect.

226
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,633
- But you know what I means?
- I can totally...

227
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,302
- You get her hopes up...
- It's not about hopes.

228
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,637
I would go marry her
in Vegas right now.

229
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,347
Is there a rule you have to...

230
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,308
You're not trying to get
married right now, Spencer.

231
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,727
- You're 23 years old.
- I'm turning 24, player.

232
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,438
Oh, but it's like, homie

233
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,648
get married at like 30, 35.

234
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,650
It's like, wait.
You got to live your youth.

235
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,944
'You wanna really waste
your whole youth?'

236
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,904
By the way, did you bring
your credit card?

237
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,739
I think, I'm gonna need to
borrow like $100,000 from you.

238
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,825
You're not using
my credit card, fool.

This is your ring.

240
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,787
I'm not stupid enough
to get married at 23.

00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,721
I don't know if I ever told
you about this guy named Justin.

246
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,765
You might have, I think you
might have mentioned him to me

247
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,143
in passing, but not...
Why? What's going on?

248
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,061
Well, I've known him
for two years.

249
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,730
It's always been off and on.
I don't know what we are.

250
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,441
He wants to, like,
start over and, like

251
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,652
take things slow, and I had...

252
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,279
Like, Lauren doesn't like him,
because she knows of

253
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,657
like, you know, things
in-in the past

254
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,326
that have happened, and she
doesn't want me to get hurt.

'But then, with me, like'

00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,164
I-I have to learn the hard way

258
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,082
and I have to do things myself.

259
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,168
I can't listen to people
and listen to their cautions.

to be serious with him

head down here today?

Any special reason
or are you just...

317

for a day or two.

Oh. Do you like him?

326
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,189

how you were holding up

with your rough series
of events.

it was gonna harden you

a little bit on life and...

330
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,908
I mean, people, a lot of times,
when you go into Hollywood

331
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,035
it brings out a side in people
that isn't necessarily good.

332
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,079
But you have to realize
it's just in Hollywood, right?

nice to me in LA

339
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,052
they didn't,
they're not from LA.

340
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,055
Yeah, but I think
they get caught up in LA.

00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,268
(Spencer)
'Oh, and in all seriousness...'

342
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,189
...you're pretty much
the most amazing human

343
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,191
I've ever met in my whole life.

344
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,277
And that's so real

345
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,362
and every single day
I'm with you

346
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,948
I really am happier every day

347
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,699
and it's so real that

348
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,576
every time I wake up
next to you, I'm just like

349
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:37,413
"Ah! You're there! Yay!
You're still there."

350
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,124
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you

351
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,627
so I got this for you.

352
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,838
- I love you.
- I love you more.

353
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,632
- I really do.
- I don't think so.

354
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,175
I don't even know
what hand the wedding ring

355
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,594
'goes on, so you can...'

356
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,262
'It's a little big, I'm sure,
'cause nobody has'

357
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,181
'such cute hands as you.'

358
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,272
I don't know. I just...

359
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,858
I love you more than anything.

360
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,693
When people told me
don't be with him

361
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,069
I was just like,
"You obviously don't know him

362
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,532
because he's the most amazing
guy I've ever met in my life"

363
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,368
and I never had a relationship
like this.

364
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,453
It's so fun. It's so everything.

365
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,413
And you're always there

366
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,625
and I know for my whole life
that you'll always be there.

367
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,586
And I know that
you're the most loyal

368
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,840
amazing, loving,
everything person

369
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,592
and I love you more than
anything in the whole world.

370
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,596
I just want you to know that

371
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,974
people are,
most people are good.

372
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,226
I know, I mean, I know
there's a difference between

373
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,811
like good people
who do bad things

374
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,771
and bad people
who do bad things.

375
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,232
I don't want you to have
trust issues, because I just...

376
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,150
I'm going to, I had, like

377
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,028
the three most important people
in my life in the last year...

378
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,865
That's why, that's why
I'm worried about you.

379
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,450
You have a great internship
and you've got some good friends

380
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,327
and you're going to school.

381
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,747
'And I don't want you
caught up in all that drama.'

382
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,749
And, you know, if you start
focusing on that again

383
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,417
it's gonna take you off-track.

384
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,252
'I really want you
to stay focused'

385
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,214
and do your thing,
and you're gonna be so great.
