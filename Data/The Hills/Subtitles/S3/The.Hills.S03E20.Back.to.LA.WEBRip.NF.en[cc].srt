you need to figure out'

that would hang clothes'

173

'We had Crystal Mirrors
with "Daily Candy."

177
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,834
Excuse me.

178
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,170
- Hi, I'm Kelly Cutrone.
- Hi.

179
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,629
- I'm Whitney.
- How are you?

180
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,756
- Good, how are you?
- I'm well.

181
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,966
Nice to meet you.

182
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,551
Listen, uh, I don't
have a lot of time

183
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,637
so I just wanted to say
thank you for coming.

184
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,473
I don't know what you know
about People's Revolution

185
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,393
but we have three offices,
we have one in New York

186
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,144
one in Los Angeles,
and one in Paris.

187
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,313
We produce more shows
in New York than anyone.

188
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,399
We're a full-service
branding company.

189
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,859
'By the way, if we do decide
to do this together'

190
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,403
we would want you
to come to New York

191
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,363
and work with us
during fashion week.

192
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,365
Our office here is really
about styling.

193
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,242
We do 65... Mike, don't you
think, like

194
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,120
eighty five percent of
our pulls come from...

195
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,955
'It's from stylists
coming into the showroom.'

196
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,249
So 85 percent of what
this office generates

197
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,501
is an influx of traffic
from stylists

198
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,421
'that are usually working
with the celebrities.'

199
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,381
I mean, why do you want
to work on this side of it?

200
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,175
I think that the more
opportunities I have

201
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,053
and the more opportunities
I put myself out there for

202
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,512
'I should take advantage.'

203
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,973
'I just think
working at Vogue'

204
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,724
'was an unbelievable
experience.'

205
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,603
I just wanted a job that,
uh, I could do more.

206
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,147
What are your strengths, like

207
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,940
why should I let you
come work here?

208
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,235
I could probably be
very helpful, in terms of...

209
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,528
...whether it's, you know,
stylists that come in here

210
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,949
and pulling for photo shoots
or styling for lookbooks

211
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,575
or styling for runway shows.

212
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,535
Lisa said a lot of
great things about you

213
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,580
and she's not an easy person
to please all the time.

214
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,708
'I mean, we have the same
kind of work aesthetic.'

215
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,419
So, let's just go out on a limb.

216
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,045
We'll just do it,
and we'll see how it goes

217
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,839
'and we'll reevaluate
everything.'

218
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,342
But I think it's really
important to let you know this.

I don't know, are you
just tired from your trip?

Just weird being back.
I don't-it's something...

00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,284

awkward seeing Brody last night.

the girlfriend there?

No.

'It's hard because
we're all friends'

347
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,544

And this, Brody has a way
of making me feel like

351
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,012
I'm never good enough,
and I hate that feeling.

352
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,888
And I feel like I need
to prove it to myself

353
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,390
and, like, that's
the only reason

354
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,684
- But that's not a good reason...
- Sweety.

355
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,934
- What?
- Of course!

356

You're good enough for Brody.

that has to work to get you.

Aw, you have to say that
'cause you're my friend.
