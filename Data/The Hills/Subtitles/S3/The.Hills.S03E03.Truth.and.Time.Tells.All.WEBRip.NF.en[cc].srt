When did it happen?

Okay, so, it was last weekend.

And, um, we were up
at the beach house.

for you" and, you know...

You don't know
he spray-painted on the wall?

- No.
- So, he did that.

And I was just like, "Oh,
what kind of surprise is it?"

You're not pregnant, are you?

- No way.
- Okay.

- No way.

00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,525
So, any-who...

177
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,282
What do you think, Lauren?
Do you think he's a good guy?

178
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:33,370
You know, it takes more
than a couple drinks to tell.

179
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,039
It's not about all me
this time, you know?

180
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,166
(Lauren) 'Tell me what you
think about me.'

181
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,751
Give me my evaluation.

182
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,171
No, I want it.
I want to hear it.

183
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,133
You love Lauren, right?

184
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,884
I'm actually really
in love with her.

185
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,097
- I didn't know who to...
- Date her.

186
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,932
I'm trying to, but I got to get

187
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,392
through you to get to her.

188
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,937
You're such a...

189
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,692
Do you want your evaluation?

190
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,071
No. I don't care.

191
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,781
Audrina cares.

192
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,034
It is what it is. Let's go.

193
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,036
It is what it is.

194
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,625
Well, I'm glad
we got to do drinks.

196
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,672
Audrina, call me later.

00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,299
- I love you.
- I love you.

198
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,549
Be safe.

199
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,093
I'll call you in a little bit.

driving with her.

Oh.

205
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,705
I'm so sleepy today.

206
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,249
I'm so...
I could go to sleep right now.

207
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,169
So, Justin, last night,
was being weird.

208
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,712
It was so awkward.

209
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,630
Uh, it was awkward for you?

210
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,174
I'm glad you were there with me.

211
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,176
You try being the third wheel
on that date.

212
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,346
He wasn't nice.

213
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,722
No, he wasn't.

214
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,768
- I'm sorry.
- Yep.

215
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,854
[laughs]

216
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,107
He was really rude
and disrespectful.

217
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,775
Really, though, like,
when you look at Justin

218
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,278
do you say, "Oh, there looks
like a gentleman?"

219
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,822
No.

220
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,282
Do you think
I should even call him

221
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,368
and hear what he has to say?

222
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,162
Do you really wanna know what I
think or are you just asking?

223
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,621
Oh, obviously not.

224
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,499
You are...
You know what I'm gonna say.

225
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,125
I know what you're gonna say
'cause that's what I'm thinking.

226
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,793
Just leave it.

227
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,170
You should have a guy
that makes you feel

228
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,547
happier, not upset.

229
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
You know what I mean?

230
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,675
I don't think
that's much to ask for.

231
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,513

I realized'

236
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,503
that on Monday, we need to go

237
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,840
like you've been saying,
buy plates...spoons.

238
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,426
- 'A table.'
- Yeah.

239
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,969

uh, coffee table.'

Mm-hmm.

'And what else do we need?'

245
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,689
We need everything.

246
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,275
We don't even have
anything in here.

This mural is so much
more fun to look at

248
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,403
than a blank wall.

249
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,156
I feel like we're
literally in a playhouse.

250
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,949
I talked to Elodie
about living here

251
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,910
and about this,
and the video games.

252
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,703
And she was just like,
"Spencer doesn't

253
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,539
make the decisions with you,
he just does that?"

254
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,416
And I was just kind of, like...

255
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,502
"Yeah, I guess he does.

256
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,920
I guess we're not making
these decisions together."

257
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,713
They're not decisions.
They're surprises.

258
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,882
Okay, there's a difference
between surprises

259
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,884
and coming home
and seeing in, like...

260
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,514
spray paint all over the walls
and video games there and like...

261
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,516
- 'That's stressful?'
- It was a little stressful.

'Which part was stressful?'

I know, and I got
fruity pebbles, too.

270
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,295
I haven't had fruity pebbles
in a really long time

271
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,630
and they looked really good.

272

No. I'm kind of in a rut.

Justin Bobby or whatever?

with them the other night.

- What do you mean?

He's just weird.
Like...I don't know.

It was just like, he was just
like being disrespectful.

- No.

I would have been like

to like him for her sake.

in, like, a week.

some of your comments

were really rude, so...

I didn't mean anything by it.

334
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,006

'It's not a big deal.'

Well, you're like me and that's

345
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,527

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,461
and enjoy the company
and have fun when we go out

352
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,589
and do things and not
let the...get in the way.

'But if we look beyond it
and we're just cool with it...'

354
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,467
So, do you want to look
beyond it?

355
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,720
I've already looked beyond it.
I don't... I...

356
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,764
I take you for who you are
and the person you are

357
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,890
and the heart that you have.

358
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
And I don't let anybody

359
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,143
interfere with that.

360
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,105
I think truth and time
tells all.

361
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,860
Okay, so, cheers
to truth and time.

364
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,117
Yo-yo.

365
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,161
Hi.

366
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,667
Surprise!
I have a surprise for you!

367
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,962
Are you kidding right now?

368
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,800
I mean, were you kidding
when you put it up?

369
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,302
This is a surprise,
just like you surprised me.

370
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,931
I surprised you
with a beautiful mural.

371
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,641
You surprised me
with a...
- Beautiful white wall.

372
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,560
- Boring white wall.

373
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,270
You can't really be mad at me.

374
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,647
- I can't?
- 'No.'

375
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,069
I mean, I just can't even
believe you did this.

376
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,573
Well, we can decide what to do
with this wall together.

377
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,370
'I mean, I don't know
what to tell you.'

378
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,414
You can't be mad at me.
I mean...

379
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,249
- I can.
- No, you can't.

380
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,421
I mean, I thought we should
make decisions together

381
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,382
what furniture we get,
what we put on the walls

382
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,133
what dishes we get.

383
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,720
You know, it's all
us being together. That's...

384
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,137
I totally agree.

385
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,059
You know, if we're really
gonna, you know, do this

386
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,811
engagement thing
and everything, it's, like...

387
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,272
our whole life,
our decisions...are together.

388
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
- Hmm?
- Hmm, yeah.

389
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,822
Hmm.

390
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,534
So, from now on

391
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,704
should we agree to make
decisions together?

392
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,415
What could I do without you?

393
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,124
Don't say it like that.

394
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:12,508
Anyways, so this is
what it is. So...

395
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,595
So this is what it is. So great.

Great, great painting job.

397
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,974
Thank you. I thought I did well.
