1
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,673
- Oh, my gosh.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:09,301
- Oh, a real house.
- This is amazing.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,512
- This is so pretty.
- Yeah, pretty.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,806
I love the palm trees.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,641
You have to see the inside.
It's so pretty.

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,186
- 'Oh, my gosh.'
- This is so pretty.

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,730
- I love all the arched...
- Do you love it?

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,524
(Lauren) 'This will be, like,
our TV room with, like'

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,109
big couches, and, like,
we'll have pictures

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,862
all over the walls
of, like, everyone.

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,781
- Yeah.
- Let's go see the guesthouse.

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,992
- My living quarters.
- Outside we go.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,785
Oh, this is adorable back here...

14
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,745
- 'So, here's my little...'
- 'Here's your room.'

15
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,372
Audrina's little house.

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,165
- The chateau Audrina.
- It's so cute.

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,959
It's very Mediterranean
with the floors.

18
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,252
I know. Are you gonna be okay
staying back here?

19
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,338
Yeah. I like that it's private.

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,842
Oh, good. I'm glad you like it.

21
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,970
It's just gonna be so cool
out here in the summer.

22
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,555
So this is, like,
the sunroom over here.

23
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,264
- Yeah, and this is the kitchen.
- Yeah.

24
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,017
- This is so pretty.
- Oh!

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,643
- Isn't it?
- 'Do you guys like it?'

26
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,896
I love it. It's gonna be
an amazing party house.

27
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,438
Are you kidding?

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,524
We have to have the best
housewarming party.

29
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,609

This morning. I don't know.

35
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,630
- It wasn't this cold yesterday.
- I know.

36
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,716
(Lauren)
'How fun is it gonna be now
that we all live together?'

37
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,634
- We're gonna shop.
- 'I know.'

38
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,844
Audrina and I eat
completely different

39
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,137
so you know, we shop separately.

40
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,806
I'm so glad that
she wanted to move in.

41
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,516

- I was really nervous.

00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,893
Oh!

43
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,895
Yeah, that's mine. Thank you.

'Who's coming to the
housewarming party tonight?'

45
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,482
I don't know yet. I know
that Stephen's in town tonight.

46
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,859
And he was gonna call me
around 6:00.

47
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,029
- Stephen?
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,239
- Stephen Colletti?
- Yup.

49
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,284
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

50
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,286
'You haven't talked to him
in forever.'

51
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,747
Wait. You guys
are hanging out again.

52
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,749
That melts
my little black heart.

53
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,251
Oh, that's so cute!

54
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,878
You've always loved Stephen.

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,213
Love is a strong word, Lo.
You, I love.

56
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,549
- Hey, that's exciting.
- It's not exciting.

57
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,926
It's not a thing. It's just...

58
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,552
(Lo) 'It's not a thing?'

59
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,096
It always turns into a thing.

60
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,098
It can't be a thing
because if it's a thing

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,558
then it, it gets this build-up
and then I get my hopes up.

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,269
I can get my hopes up for you.

63
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,355
How long did you like each other
for in high school?

64
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,482
'And after high school?'

65
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,489

- You're always here.
- Yeah.

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,719
- 'Hi.'
- 'Hi.'

73
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,888
Can I get a chai boba?

74
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,473
- Sure.
- Thanks.

Oh, that sucks!
Oh! I just swallowed a ball.

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,273
Isn't that the point
of those things?

78
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,733
No, you're supposed to chew 'em.

79
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,986
So what's up with you?

80
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,280
(Stephanie)
'Um, Lauren invited me
to her housewarming party.'

81
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,118
And you wanna go?

82
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,872
Like, I just don't understand.

83
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,374
Do you have any, like, family
loyalty? Like, this is...

84
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,128
It's crazy that you can say that
when you became best friends

85
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,380
with my ex-boyfriend
when I hated him

86
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,883
and every day when I'd come
home, he was at the house.

87
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,054
He wasn't really a boyfriend,
I hate to tell you.

88
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,889
Just 'cause you went
to semiformal with him.

89
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,724
Spencer, you know
that was my boyfriend.

90
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,433
Don't even try to act
like it wasn't a big deal...

91
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,895
You can put any title
on a semiformal date.

92
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,105
You're such a jerk.

93
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,234
How am I supposed
to tell Heidi that

94
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,070
you're thinking about
going to LC's party?

95
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,072
I'll tell Heidi.

96
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,698
Heidi put this behind her,
I feel like.

97
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,783
I feel like, you're
the one holding the grudge.

98
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,412
Um, yes, I guess that's what
I'm doing, holding a grudge.

99
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,497
Heidi's not.

100
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,417
Alright. Well, I have nothing
more to say to you, really

101
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,796
so you can take your boba
and leave me at peace.

102
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,883
I don't wanna leave like this.

103
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,719

- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

108
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,327
I thought I heard my name.
I had my music on loud.

109
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,123
Do we have, like, a pretty bowl
we can stick limes in?

110
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,208
A bowl? We don't have any bowls.

(Lauren)
'We are kind of hopeless.
Did you sleep okay last night?'

112
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,380
- Yeah.
- I still need to get curtains.

113
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,466
I wonder if our neighbors
have seen me naked yet.

114
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,842
Probably.

115
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,136
(Lo)
'We're gonna have a fun party.'

116
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,138
Yeah. Did you invite Stephanie?

117
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,473
Yeah. I don't know if she's
coming or not. I'll text her.

118
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,392
Jarett's coming
and then Justin's coming.

119
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,561
'Maybe my sister's coming
and my brother.'

120
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,814
Wait. Rewind.

121
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,732
I wanted to hear about Justin.

122
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,694
Is that not a subject
we're allowed to talk about?

123
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,362
Maybe he'll wear his cowboy hat.

124
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,410
- Is Brody coming?
- Oh, I think so. I don't know.

125
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,122
- 'I should text him though.'
- Who did you invite, Lauren?

126
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,040
- Which guys?
- You'll see. You'll see.

127
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,917
I'll see?
Why don't you just tell me?

128
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,795
I, well, I invited Stephen.

129

Stephen Colletti?

130
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,841
When was the last time
you talked to him?

131
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,759
- Last night.
- Oh, you did?

132
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,386
She's been talking to him.

133
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,933
Well, did you invite him,
like, as a friend?

134
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,810
Don't get all ninth grade on me.

135
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,395
I know, but you guys have, like,
always kind of had a thing.

- Hello.

147
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,424
Looks nice in here.
We got you something.

148
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,886
- A little housewarming gift.
- What is that?

149
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,637
It's our third juicer.

150
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,181

153
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,026
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

154
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,196
I am just on my way out.

155
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,740
Out to where?

156
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,408
So far. To Hollywood.

157
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,912
I'm actually gonna go
to a housewarming party.

158
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,787
- It's, uh...
- 'Whose party?'

159
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,581
Lauren's.

160
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,624
You're kidding.

161
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,212
I really thought
you'd be cool with this.

162
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,256
I mean, what would
make you think that?

163
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,549
It's, like, retarded
that I feel guilty

164
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,260
sitting in class next to her
when she invites me

165
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,802
to a housewarming party,
I'm like, well

166
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,512
let me run it
by Heidi and Spencer.

167
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,932
If you are feeling guilty
and asking for permission

168
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,017
that's 'cause you feel like
you're doing something wrong.

169
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,228
The only reason
I came here is because

170
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,021
when I went
to her birthday party

171
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,648
and Kimberly told you,
you got really mad at me.

172
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,817
Because you were lying to me.
You weren't telling me anything.

173
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,444
You were trying
to keep secrets from me

174
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,029
and, like, being shady about it.

175
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,448
I'm not being shady
so if I go tonight

176
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,033
and I hadn't told you about it...

177
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,659
Then you would have been
being shady about it.

178
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,079
You see? You're totally
contradicting yourself.

179
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,290
I'm saying I don't get why
you can be friends with her.

180
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,541
'The one person in my life
I don't get along with'

181
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,044
and you're becoming
best friends with her.

00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,963
Like, where's your loyalty?

183
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,220
This just seems, like,
so middle school, but I mean...

184

Are you just, are you,
like, hanging out with anyone

185

00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,312
No, I'm just gonna be here.

how this all started

188

It was fun, we did it
kind of outside

262
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,361
and we lit, we had
a little barbecue fire pit

out there, and we lit that.
