1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,881
- Morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,343
I have to tell you something.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,052
Tell me.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,888
I went out to this new club

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,598
called the Green Door.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,433
And I'm standing there
talking to my friends

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,727
and these two girls
are standing behind me

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,020
and I turn around,
and she's like

9
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,606
"Hi, my name is Stephanie Pratt

10
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,274
'"and I just want you to know
that you're a...bitch'

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,610
and you and Lauren are done."

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,820
I met that girl before.

13
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,530
'I had no idea he had a sister.'

14
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,365
She's a loony.

15
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,492
- Kind of looks like him too.
- It's a she-Pratt.

16
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,161
- It <i>is a she-Pratt.</i>
- That's the thing.

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,246
It's like, the only thing
worse than Spencer

18
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,123
is a she version of Spencer

19
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,209
because she's capable
of all the same things

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,503
but at the end of the day,
a guy can't hit a girl.

21
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,214
A girl can hit a girl.
You know what I mean?

22
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,924
[chuckling]
Oh, God.

23
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,092
[instrumental music]

24
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,484
[knock on door]

25
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,819
Coming.

26
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,530
- Hey.
- Hi.

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,949
- How are you?
- Uh, so much traffic.

28
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,409
Oh, Hollywood.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,953
- This is nice!
- What up, sis?

30
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,120
- Hi.
- Pound it out.

31
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,581
'Where are the jellyfish?'

32
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,790
They went on vacation.

33
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,625
- Mom's house?
- No.

34
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,836
The electricity went off,
and they were gonna die.

35
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,047
- Heidi forgot to pay the bill.
- You were supposed to pay it.

36
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,423
Six months she hasn't paid it.

37
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,090
- Shut up.
- 'This is crazy.'

38
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,761
I've never seen
two people so in love.

39
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,095
Look at that. I didn't
even pay her to say that.

40
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,265
Um, do your parents
know about the wedding?

41
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,600
Do <i>you know about the wedding?</i>

42
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,976
Yeah, Tibet.

43
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,062
See, we're going to Tibet.

44
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,939
We're <i>not</i> <span style="bodyStyle"> going to Tibet.</i>

45
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,732
Don't you think Tibet
is a fun place to get married?

46
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,943
I wanna go to Croatia
when I get married.

47
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,736
See, the Pratts know
what's up

48
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,946
with international weddings.

49
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,238
You only get married once.

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,740
I wanna have a fun wedding

51
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,199
but I don't wanna have, like...

52
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,035
I wanna have
your mom there, I...

53
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,537
Heidi wants to have
a wedding in a church with...

54
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,581
With, like, a priest
who actually marries you.

55
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:06,334
Oh, my God! Roxy and I went
online to become ministers.

56
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,712
'How did I forget this?
I could marry you.'

57
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,798
- She could do everything.
- Please let me do it.

58
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,841
Right. I don't want,
I don't want that.

59
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,551
[instrumental music]

60
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,486
Where do you wanna go tonight?
I don't even know.

61
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,446
Well, we'll have to find where
all our friends are going.

62
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,406
Where is Brody and Frankie
going tonight?

63
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,950
Brody and Frankie
are both going to Opera.

64
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,409
Maybe we should just go there.

65
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,870
I don't know if Justin's
coming tonight.

66
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,080
Have you talked to him tonight?

67
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,415
'No, he hasn't called me back.'

68
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,334
Surprise.

69
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,253
You have to have a relationship
that functions in public.

70
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,131
- You know what I mean?
- 'Yeah.'

71
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,049
And I understand that guys,
like, they can't help it

72
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,426
when, like, a cute girl
walks by or catches their eye

73
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,971
but with Justin,
it's like, come on

74
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,556
like, you don't need to do it
to every girl that walks by.

75
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,600
You mean he, like, checks
girls out in front of you?

76
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,145
We were at L'Scorpion's,
and these two girls walked by

77
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,354
and he just totally
went like that.

78
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,648
Like, what are you doing?

79
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,900
Like, I don't care, but I
want him to be more attentive

80
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,985
and he's not doing it.

81
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,361
He just doesn't care.

82
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,946
'It's like,
whenever we're together'

83
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,447
he's so different
than when we're out

84
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,533
in public with friends and...

85
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,451
It's like whenever we're out

86
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,911
it's like we don't
know each other

87
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,203
and then whenever
we're together

88
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,998
we're, like, together, you know?

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,708
If you guys were hermits

90
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,417
you'd have, like,
the perfect relationship.

91
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,460
Pretty much.

92
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,837
[both chuckling]

93
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,048
[instrumental music]

94
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,933
[indistinct chatter]

95
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,110
Oh, say hello.

96
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,237
- Very sweet of you.
- I'm up.

97
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,947
What up? How are you?

98
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,032
Good, how are you?

99
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,325
Amazing. How you been?

100
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,036
- Um, I don't even know.
- 'What do you mean?'

101
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,787
He's been in la-la land.

102
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,707
He doesn't have time
for anyone...not even me.

103
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,294
(Brody)
'Oh, my God.'

104
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,047
That's Spencer's sister
over there.

105
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,175
'That's Spencer's sister
over there.'

106
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,972
(Lauren)
'Oh, my God.'

107
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,892
Brody, what are you doing here?

108
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,894
'You're on the evil side.'

109
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,729
Come home with us.

110
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,397
(Roxy)
'We just want to warn you guys'

111
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,899
to stop messing with Heidi.

112
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,776
Like, just stop
being mean girls.

113
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,318
What have I done to her?

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,446
Uh, you've made it
to everyone... Why...

115
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,573
Just because you hate Spencer.

116
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,825
I haven't done anything to her.

117
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,202
You don't know me.

118
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,121
Do you know me?

119
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,330
No, I love Heidi.
I know Heidi.

120
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,458
I used to love Heidi too.
I understand.

121
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,043
'I don't... I'm sorry
I don't like your brother'

122
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,253
'for personal reasons.'

123
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,921
I-I don't get along with Heidi.

124
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,631
That's kind of our business.

125
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,759
Heidi's my family now.
They're getting married.

126
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,263
When you hate my brother,
it makes me hate you.

127
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,681
I love your brother,
but he...up

128
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,600
and that's his fault,
and he has to deal with that.

129
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,769
'It's not between you.
It's not between her...'

130
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,980
Heidi's business and her
business is their business.

131
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,482
Stop getting involved
in what you don't... Stop.

132
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,985
It's just really...of you,
Brody.

133
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,070
...of me? What did I do?

134
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,362
Alright, this isn't a big deal.

135
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,573
Let's just, let's just leave.

136
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,117
Let's just go.

137
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,743
Don't fight other
people's battles.

138
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:33,167
Ah, drama.
Always drama, drama, drama.

139
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,046
[both laughing]

140
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,134
(Broody)
'I still don't understand
the whole'

141
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,469
'"come home with me" thing.
Did you get that one?'

142
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,113
(Brody)
'What's Justin Bobby
doing over there?'

143
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,532
[indistinct chatter]

144
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,247
Did he just kiss her?

145
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,623
(Brody)
'Oh, my God.'

146
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,584
[up beat music]

147
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,438
Oh, my God.
What just happened?

148
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,486
You okay?

149
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,514
I saw you guys
kissing at the bar.

150
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,975
- What? Are you kidding me?
- 'Oh, am I kidding you?'

151
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,186
'I swear to God,
I did not kiss him.'

152
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,562
I did not do nothing.

153
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,772
Then what was that at the bar?

154
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,982
We all saw it.
We were standing there.

155
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,282
(Audrina)
No, that's it. Him.

156
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,576
He's smiling and laughing at me
and he won't even talk to me.

157
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,953
(Lauren)
'It's okay.'

158
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,495
'Do you wanna run across
to the lot?'

159
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,914
Let's go to the lot
to go to the car.

160
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,082
Come on. Let's go.

161
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,750
'Justin, leave her alone.'

162
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,364
No! You were at the bar, Justin.

163
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,949
(Justin)
'Doing what? What did I do?'

164
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,378
Where are they walking to?

165
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,797
(Lauren)
'Dude, he was kissing
another girl at the bar'

166
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,299
'like, right in front of her.'

167
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,800
Should we just leave?

168
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,385
I'm not gonna leave her
behind a dumpster

169
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,347
'yelling at the guy
who just made her cry.'

170
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,029
So what are we doing?

171
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,033
[Audrina sighs]

172
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,265
I just keep waiting around

173
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,766
for you to make a decision

174
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,727
and I just,
I can't keep waiting.

175
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,316
So you don't care if I went
and dated other guys?

176
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,484
Of course, I would.

177
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,902
I mean, I'm not a...

178
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,945
I mean, seriously, truly.

179
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,572
Of course I would.

180
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,658
But then when I wait around

181
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,411
for you to call and, like

182
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,619
ask me out, you don't do it

183
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,996
so I just sit there and wait.

184
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,040
Do you think that's fair to me?

185
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,922
So what?

186
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,435
[instrumental music]

187
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,734
- 'Hello.'
- 'Yo.'

188
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,069
'What are you doing?'

189
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,739
- 'Oh...my...God.'
- What?

190
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,409
You're never gonna believe
who I saw last night.

191
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,161
Good morning.
Would you like some cereal?

192
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,705
- No. Um...Brody.
- 'Brody?'

193
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,001
With Lauren, Audrina

194
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,379
and who's that guy

195
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,256
who's like a wannabe
Wilmer Valderrama?

196
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,966
- 'Frankie Delgado?'
- Yes.

197
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,218
'This is so crazy.'

198
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,261
'So, Roxy and I are at Opera'

199
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,431
and we see Brody,
and so we go over.

200
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,850
He's sitting next
to Lauren and Audrina

201
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,935
and they're like...

202
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,813
And I was like, look,
you have a problem with Spencer

203
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,106
I have a problem with you.

204
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,525
[chuckles]
You said that to who?

205
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,235
To Lauren.

206
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,737
I mean, if some girl
was talking so much...about me.

207
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,198
(Spencer)
'That's what I said to Brody,

208
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,949
that's why
I'm not friends with him

209
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,742
'cause he hangs out with
somebody that talks...about me

210
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,370
'and that's over his head.'

211
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,122
And I was like,
"Look, I'm Heidi's best friend"

212
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,083
and Brody was like,
"Oh, please."

213
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,293
- He did not say, "Oh, please."
- 'Yeah.'

214
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,882
And Lauren was just staring
at Roxy and I.

215
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,718
She was like, Heidi hurt me

216
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,761
and you made her choose
you or Spencer.

217
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,305
She didn't make Audrina choose.

218
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,349
Like, she doesn't
like Audrina's boyfriend

219
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,186
who, by the way, was kissing
some redhead at Opera.

220
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,812
- In front of Audrina?
- 'Audrina was there.'

221
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,608
- What did Audrina do?
- I have no idea.

222
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,402
But he seems like the
nicest one out of all them.

223
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,489
The bottom line
is if we broke up tomorrow

224
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,074
'she would call you
and be like'

225
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,992
'"I heard the good news.
Let's go to lunch."'

226
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,537
Please, please, please, please.

227
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,205
- You're welcome.
- Good work.

228
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,998
Well, you'd do it for me.

229
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,627
- 'I would.'
- I know. Thanks.

230
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,921
Anyways, I am so sick
of talking about these people.

231
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,007
- So, let's change the subject.
- Let's get Heidi some earmuffs.

232
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,009
[laughing]

233
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,223
[instrumental music]

234
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,400
Aah! I have to tell you
about last night.

235
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,860
There is so much that went on,
we went to Opera.

236
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,572
'And Justin was there'

237
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,074
and he was making out with
the redheaded chick at the bar.

238
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,163
Yeah. I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

239
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,830
I was just, like...

240
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,500
"...This isn't happening."
I was like, no!

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,669
'Like, no one was there,
everyone was leaving...'

242
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,254
And he thought you left,
so he went to the bar made...

243
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,880
That's what he does probably
when I'm not around.

244
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,924
So I was, like,
seriously, it's over.

245
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,135
Like, that is the last thing.

246
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,221
It's the straw that broke
the camel's back. Right.

247
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,765
Well, then I get in the car

248
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,767
and then he gets in
and I'm like...

249
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,727
'So, my friend Kelsey,
she's like'

250
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,395
"Where do you want me
to drop you off?"

251
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,147
And I'm like,
"Take him to his apartment."

252
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,816
So we dropped him off,
we didn't talk

253
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,610
the entire time in the car,
it was silent.

254
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,779
'We dropped him off, he's like,
"Come on, I'll take you home"'

255
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm like, "No, I'm serious

256
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,032
this is it,
it's over, go, leave."

257
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,159
Have you, has he called you
or anything since?

258
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,410
'Yeah, he doesn't
think I'm serious'

259
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,120
'and he wants to talk to me.'

260
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,955
I'm like, Justin,
I'm not joking this time.

261
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,291
It's over, like, look at me,
I'm dead serious.

262
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,336
And you can only take so much
a-abuse, to a certain extent

263
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,254
before you, you know...

264
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,048
You respect yourself more
than that. Don't let him...

265
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,425
But I still have to see him
and end it for good.

266
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,052
'And you have to hold strong
to that though.'

267
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,930
- Like, don't... Don't give in.
- Yeah, I know.

268
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,266
I'm not.
I'm gonna do it tonight.

269
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,228
[instrumental music]

270
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,513
[door bell ringing]

271
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,816
- You covered it.
- I did cover it.

272
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

273
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,402
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

274
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,737
- How are you?
- Good.

275
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,321
- Good?
- Yes.

276
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,115
You can come in.
It's kind of messy.

277
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,200
Yeah? What are you doing?

278
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,327
Just being mellow.

279
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,831
'Yeah. How are you?'

280
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,583
I'm okay, a little tired.

281
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,130
I don't know.

282
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,173
I feel like
I just need to move on.

283
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,217
If that's what
it takes for you.

284
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,470
- I told you.
- What did you tell me?

285
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,597
I already told you everything.

286
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,015
- When?
- At Opera.

287
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,394
I don't even know what
the...that was about at all.

288
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,229
- 'I really don't.'
- You didn't kiss her?

289
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,857
No, I didn't, and that's
what trips me out the most

290
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,234
is the fact that people run up
and you run up

291
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,945
to me and say
that I kissed her

292
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,279
I don't even know
who you're talking about.

293
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,323
I saw her. She kissed you.

294
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,283
You guys, I saw you,
and so did other people...

295
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,744
You can look me in the eye
and tell me out of all this...

296
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,621
- Yes, I saw you kiss her.
- You saw me kiss her.

297
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,581
She leaned over and kissed you,
and you let her.

298
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,124
- And I let her?
- Yeah.

299
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,168
Well, I think you're wrong...

300
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,004
No, I'm not, 'cause I wasn't
the only one who saw it, Justin.

301
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,632
Of course. Of course
your friends say they see it?

302
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,342
'Of course,
they're gonna say that.'

303
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,636
Your friends
don't fathom me whatsoever.

304
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,888
You were at the bar with that
girl and I was gonna...

305
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,556
I think you believe
what you wanted to see.

306
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,558
Why would I wanna
see that, Justin?

307
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,060
I have no idea, because I know
I didn't do anything wrong.

308
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,813
I just...

309
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,606
[sighs]
...I just needed those feelings

310
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,900
that I have for you,
Justin, I really like you

311
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,485
'but I don't know
what it is with you.'

312
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,904
I don't know
why I always go back.

313
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,365
Like, what am I doing?
Like, I'm just hurting myself.

314
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,033
I need to stop.
I need to move on.

315
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,785
But I want you to know
like I love hanging out

316
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,620
with you,
I love being with you.

317
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,039
I-I, you know,
I don't want that stuff to end.

318
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,001
You know what?
It's like, hopeless.

319
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,045
It would never work.

320
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,547
'It's just...'

321
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,718
...hopeless.

322
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,850
I just think
it should just be over

323
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,852
and just be friends.

324
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,989
I decided.

325
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,873
[sighs]
Maybe sooner than later.

326
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,208
- Yeah.
- Good.

327
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,044
- Well...
- Bye.
