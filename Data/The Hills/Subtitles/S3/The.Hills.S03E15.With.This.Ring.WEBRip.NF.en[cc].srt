You got dirt and stuff
all over you.

177
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,927
- Everywhere?
- All over.

178
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,637
- You can wipe it off for me.
- You got it.

179
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,930
La Cantina, 8 o'clock?

180
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,640
- I'm down.
- I'll pick you up.

181
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,475
Okay.

182
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,019
[instrumental music]

183
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,655
I'm definitely wearing a crown.

184
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,657
'Think of the pastries
we can get at the wedding.'

185
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,243
Ah! The catering.

186
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,912
Where do you buy
bride magazines, by the way?

187
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:20,125
Is it a crime that I bought
little bridal magazines?

188
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,085
- Not even a little bit.
- Oh, okay.

189
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,586
I just don't think
you'd need 'em.

190
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,672
Bride one, bride two.

191
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,548
'Oh, we're getting serious now.'

192
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,093
What do you have to figure out
in there?

193
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,428
Whatever I want to figure out.

194
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,347
What dress I'm wearing,
and stuff.

195
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,223
I just never thought I would
ever want to get married.

196
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:39,186
This is just so crazy, like,
"Whoo! Looking to get married!"

197
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,855
And look, we can get China
with our names on it.

198
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,024
[instrumental music]

199
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,994
(Whitney) 'Jarett asked
if he could take me out'

200
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,455
so I was like, whatever.

201
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,998
Oh, he hearts you.

202
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,251
I don't know
if he hearts me, but...

203
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,795
- 'What?'
- No, it's just cute.

204
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,923
I'm not even gonna think about
it, I'm just gonna, like...

205
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,301
Please, it's a first date.
First dates are exciting.

206
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,802
Yeah, first dates are exciting
but first dates

207
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,888
can also be
really uncomfortable.

208
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,849
[instrumental music]

209
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,361
(Jarett) 'Have you ever been
here before?'

210
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,029
- 'No, never.'
- It's gonna be fun.

211
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,531
It's a beautiful night out.

212
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,907
- Yeah.
- Beautiful night out.

213
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,450
'Fabulous night out.'

214
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,995
Thank you.

215
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,166
- So, this is the place.
- This is so nice.

216
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,293
- It's chill.
- 'Yeah.'

217
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,878
- This is it.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,547
- Thank you.
- 'You're welcome.'

219
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
Cheers. To having fun.

220
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,176
[chuckles]

221
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,344
You are dressed beautifully.

222
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,346
'Oh, thank you very much.'

223
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,473
I don't really come out
to Hollywood so much, you know.

224
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,350
You don't like to come here
'cause you don't wanna get...

225
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,602
No.
It's not even about the scene.

226
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,604
Like, you know,
I'll go out to these places

227
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,981
and just go dancing
and not involve myself, but...

228
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,443
We should have been to a place
where we could have danced.

229
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,735
I mean...

230
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,903
You're ready to dance.

231
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,488
Maybe not at this point.

232
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,697
Maybe in a couple hours.

233
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,408
Couple hour. Cheers to that.

234
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,992
Cheers, cheers to dancing
in a couple hours.

235
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,828
I'm gonna hold you
accountable on that.

236
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,372
Okay.

237
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,625
But, yeah, I don't know...

238
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,502
- What's your sign?
- 'I'm a Pisces.'

239
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,837
- Pisces.
- Why? Do you, like, know signs?

240
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,465
No. I feel like that's the
biggest question with someone.

241
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,385
- Oh, what's your sign?
- I don't really know.

242
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,721
I don't really know much
about my sign, but yeah.

243
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,390
So, what is your dream?

244
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,975
What do you see yourself
doing in LA, yeah

245
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,726
in, like, a couple years?

246
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,686
I take the training thing
seriously, you know.

247
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,022
I started working with a record
label training a bunch of girls.

248
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,650
They're getting ready to go on
tour with their record album.

249
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,693
So, we'll this this
only from New York.

250
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,654
You're only one that hustle.
'You're from New York, right?'

251
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,739
'You're on the hustle
from the fashion industry.'

252
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,367
'You're so busy. You probably
don't have time to date much.'

253
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,827
I just came out
of a relationship.

254
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,078
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

255
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,163
And now I'm having fun.

256
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,039
Yeah, that's how I am.

257
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,749
I got out of a relationship
in May.

258
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,502
- Now you need time to relax.
- Yeah!

259
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,545
I don't wanna be
attached to anyone.

260
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,006
I just wanna,
like, enjoy myself.

261
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,133
You're right, that's the reasons
I asked you to come out.

262
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,384
- We're two single people.
- 'Yeah.'

263
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,428
- Yeah!
- Having fun.

264
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,678
- 'Exactly.'
- Right?

265
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,431
- Cheers.
- 'Cheers.'

266
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,266
- You like the cheers.
- Cheers again.

267
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,226
[instrumental music]

268
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,499
[door closes]

269
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,546
- Welcome home, sweetheart.
- Hey!

270
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,880
'How was work?'

271
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,757
Long, tiring.

272
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,135
Well, you can sleep,
uh, in the car.

273
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,679
'Where are we going?'

274
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,014
'We're going on
a little adventure.'

275
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,849
I packed for you. Don't worry.

276
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,560
For what? Aah!

277
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,521
We're going to Las Vegas
to get married.

278
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,441
I got us the honeymoon suite.

279
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,694
Spence.

280
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,986
[sighs]

281
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,488
Did you already pay for this?

282
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,114
Deposit.

283
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,617
I really hope
you're kidding with this.

284
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,369
Why would I be kidding?

285
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,163
Because I told you
I don't want to elope, like.

286
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,582
We already went to the church.

287
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,166
We already talked
to the minister.

288
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,626
Lots of people get married
on their own

289
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,712
without family
and friends there.

290
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,130
It's just distractions.
And it's not about them.

291
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,798
'It's about us getting married.'

292
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,176
But it's about me, too,
and I want them there.

293
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,054
Like, my dad walking me
down the aisle

294
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,056
'like, that means a lot to me.'

295
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,766
I don't understand how you
don't realize that by now.

296
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,768
I've been telling you
how much this means to me.

297
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,064
I just don't get how you don't
care how I feel about this.

298
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,773
It's not about not caring.

299
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,901
'You're making it all
these other things...'

300
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,279
'No, I'm not. I just want our
family and friends to be there.'

301
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,198
Like, is that
so much to ask for?

302
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,658
'I'm sick of these surprises.'

303
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,410
I'm sick of coming home
and being, like

304
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,495
what's gonna be there,
what's going on?

305
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,122
This isn't, like,
Spencer's relationship

306
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,082
and you decide what we do.

307
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,336
'We're not supposed
to be fighting'

308
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,380
about our wedding
this is suppose to...

309
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,923
'We're not fighting
about our wedding.'

310
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,258
We're fighting
about wedding planning

311
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,303
which is such a hassle.

312
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,513
I mean, if I'm too much
of a hassle for you

313
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,641
then I'm sorry,
like, I don't know.

314
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,351
Maybe we should just
think about it longer.

315
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,312

316
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,899

[music continues]

318

[instrumental music]

319
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,447
- Hey, girlie.
- Hey.

320
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,657
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

321
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,241
I haven't seen you all day.

322
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,118
I know. I've kind
of been hiding out.

323
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,578
- Hiding?
- 'Yeah.'

324
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,497
- Why? What's up?
- 'Not a lot.'

325
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,374
I just kind of...

326
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,752
...got in a huge, huge fight
with Spencer last night.

327
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,213
'I come home, and there
are two bags packed there.'

328
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,548
And he just kind of says

329
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,257
"Oh, we're going to Vegas."

330
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,385
and I was like,
"What are you talking about?

331
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,969
"Do you not even listen
when I speak?

332
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,389
Like, do you not hear
anything I say?"

333
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,641
Whoa, he can't make that
decision without you, though.

334
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,560
I got so mad and I was like

335
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,103
you know what, when you decide

336
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,272
'that you want to take
this seriously, let me know'

337
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,775
and he left, he left the house.

338
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,986
Like, I wouldn't even...
I wouldn't have left, you know?

339
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,740
I mean, I can't see, I could
see leaving to blow off steam.

340
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,116
Like, if we can't even
figure out a fight

341
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,203
how are we supposed to figure
out our lives together?

342
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,914
You guys just gotta put
everything out on the table.

343
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,791
I don't know.

344
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,293
Sorry.

[instrumental music]

346
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,224
Thank you. Can I have some,
do you have any sweetener?

347
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,352
- Sweetener? Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you.

348
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,396
So I have to tell you
about my date.

349
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,356
- I've been dying to tell you.
- I know. Really?

350
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,901
It was actually
really, really comfortable.

351
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,611
I mean, as far as first dates go

352
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,781
you know, you usually
don't know what you're doing.

353
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,449
Did he dress up?

354
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,410
He wore a V-neck American
apparel shirt, I think.

355
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,203
Like a really tight shirt.

356
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,748
Shoes. The shoes tell it all.

357
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,208
- I wasn't into the shoes.
- Ooh.

358
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,377
I got more of a friend vibe
from him.

359
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,504
Do you think he, like,
got friend vibe from you?

360
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,089
Like, was it, like,
an obvious friend vibe

361
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,591
or do you think
maybe he likes you?

362
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,551
He invited me to go out
after with him.

363
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,095
So, like, I mean,
I guess that's a good sign.

364
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,723
It felt good
to get out there too.

365
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,142
Wait, how did you end it?
Did you kiss him?

366
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,602
No kissing.

367
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,978
I think for the most part a guy

368
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,187
can tell if you wanna kiss him.

369
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,355
I don't have a rule.

370
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,482
You know, if I'm feeling it

371
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,691
I'm not opposed to it.

372
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,276
'But what happens if a guy'

373
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,153
'goes in for it
and that's your rule?'

374
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,238
- You go to the side.
- Oh.

375
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,740
- Awkward. That's so awkward.
- Not really.

376
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,826
You can make it,
like, not awkward.

377
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,661
Knowing me,
I would make it awkward.

378
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,370

381
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,434
Honey, I'm home!

382
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,104
Where'd you sleep last night?

383
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,315
Uh, at my parents' house.

384
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,066
- Really?
- Yeah.

385
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,069
I found you these there.

386
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,614
Thank you.

387
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,115
They smell great.

388
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,659
You don't like them?

389
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,035
I love them.

390
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,499
So, um...can I call a truce?

391
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,876
You can apologize.

392
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,836
I'm so sorry
that I did not respect

393
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,922
your need to have
the wedding of your dreams.

394
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,591
And I want to do
whatever in the world

395
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,886
makes you happy forever
and I love you.

396
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,137
And if that means big wedding

397
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,806
let's have the biggest
wedding ever.

398
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,058
No more surprises.

399
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,643
I just don't want...

400
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,231
Just last night was just so...

401
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,233
I don't know. I don't
even know how to describe it.

402
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,903
It was the first time we slept
apart, our first big fight.

403
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,112
I didn't realize it was
such a big ordeal for you.

404
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,740
I just can't believe
you didn't sleep here.

405
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,616
I can't believe you left.

406
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,660
Like, I wouldn't have left.

407
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,039
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,083
Apology accepted.

409
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,545
And I would like you
to not throw this down

410
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,338
because I want you to marry me.

411
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,464
And I'm so sorry.

412
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,008
I just get all stressed out

413
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,887
thinking about
a big production and ordeal

414
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,056
when all I really want
to do is just marry you.

415
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,607
Thank you for the flowers.
Thank you for the apology.

416
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,026
- I'll take it.
- I missed you.
