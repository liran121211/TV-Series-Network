1
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:03,952
what are you gonna sing first?

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:06,341
I'm gonna sing to make you feel my love by bob dylan.

3
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:10,712
go ahead.

4
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:34,937
love that song.

5
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:38,240
so tell us about yourself.

6
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:42,177
I'm from magnolia, texas.

7
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,445
it doesn't matter where you

8
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:44,313
Start...

9
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:45,380
ankeny, iowa.

10
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:46,081
taylor, michigan.

11
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,216
las vegas, nevada.

12
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:48,250
salt lake city, utah.

13
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:49,351
it doesn't matter who you

14
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:50,419
Are...

15
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,855
I'm a farmer.

16
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:54,489
I work in the oil field.

17
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:55,757
I work at a retail clothing

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,693
Store.

19
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,862
it takes a nation to make an

20
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:01,396
Idol.

21
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:30,592
they come from all corners of

22
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:32,527
The country with dreams bigger

23
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,029
Than any of us could ever

24
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35,230
Imagine.

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,467
America, this is where they come to be heard.

26
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:42,671
all: Is american idol!

27
00:01:56,987 --> 00:02:12,634
our search for a superstar

28
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,871
Continues in austin, texas.

29
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:19,675
Thousands have shown up in hopes of receiving a golden ticket and

30
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:21,643
Moving on to the next round in hollywood.

31
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:24,680
come on down here, guys. But to find a superstar, it

32
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:27,816
And we have three: Jennifer

33
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:31,486
Lopez, keith urban, and harry

34
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:32,788
Connick, jr.

35
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,223
They're back for their second day together, and they're

36
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:38,360
Excited to find your next idol. It's really cool.

37
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:40,896
You're sitting here listening to people sing and, you know, doing

38
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:42,931
What they love to do. Just, like, I look forward to

39
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,234
Going to work every day.

40
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:50,706
where'd the princess go? He's here.

41
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:55,544
oh, okay. Where is everybody?

42
00:02:55,546 --> 00:03:03,618
Oh, my god. Where are these guys?

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,087
are you gonna wear the jacket?

44
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:06,655
Keep it off? Show the guns? I'm gonna hold it over one

45
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:10,892
Shoulder. What are they doing, you

46
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,995
Think? It's much more effective when

47
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,763
I say you're going to hollywood like this.

48
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,164
when you have a cape on? Yeah.

49
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:20,302
oh, finally!

50
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:22,204
you like? This is my new joint.

51
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,239
no, I hate it. This is how the kids are

52
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:26,074
Wearing it. No.

53
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:30,312
I'm kidding. Come on. You can't think I'm serious.

54
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:32,581
I am excited. I'm nervous.

55
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:37,352
I'm worried a little bit. Let's go.

56
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:41,256
I just hope I make an impact on them.

57
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:43,625
look at that black guitar. That's some serious ink.

58
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,761
yeah. Tell me your name.

59
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,196
I'm jesse. Jesse roach. Hey, jesse.

60
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:54,069
What made you come in today? I actually was in my garage

61
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,772
One day practicing, and a neighbor lady came up that I had

62
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:59,107
Never seen in my life and sits down in my garage.

63
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,643
you should have saw her face. She's like, "There's a crazy

64
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:05,313
Woman that's in my garage." Ever since then, we're

65
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:07,949
Like this. One day, she said, "I signed

66
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:12,154
You up for american idol." She had booked a hotel, and we

67
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:15,290
Are going to austin to try out. I had no choice because she paid

68
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:19,528
For it. What are you gonna sing,

69
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,163
Jesse? I'm gonna sing some k.T.

70
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,931
Oslin, do ya. Sweet.

71
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,033
cool.

72
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,835
I love the black guitar. Mm.

73
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,647
I love you. I love--I love what you're

74
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,282
Wearing. I love the black guitar.

75
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,451
I love your vibe. And more than that, I really do

76
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:18,453
Love your voice. And I think you could make

77
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,988
Records, I think you could be an artist.

78
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,790
thank you. Yeah, you've got a lot of

79
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,825
Soul. You have a story that's way

80
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:26,761
Older than you are, and that's what I--what I hear and feel

81
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,196
When you sing. That's what I love about your

82
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,031
Voice. There is an example of a

83
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:33,702
Voice with rasp that I wasn't distracted by the sound.

84
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,170
no, it was so pure. Yeah.

85
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:38,607
I'm gonna say yes. I'mon say yes.

86
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:42,744
yes. Is that the one...

87
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,980
so jesse snags the first golden

88
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:48,917
Ticket in texas and swaps her garage for our hollywood stage.

89
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,486
Congratulations. She said that I could do it,

90
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:54,322
And I did. And she's going to hollywood.

91
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,625
I'm going to hollywood. It's a very simple journey.

92
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:58,326
You come in. You audition in front of three

93
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,962
People. And little by little, they

94
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,765
Emerge. Little by little, you see kind

95
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:06,801
Of, you know, the cream rising to the top.

96
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,637
I loved her. Yeah, she was great.

97
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,307
who's next?

98
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:18,747
I believe I'm one step closer to my dream today.

99
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:22,017
This is a big opportunity that not many people get, and I'm

100
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:36,498
Really like nothing else. I get to be someone on stage

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,533
That I don't normally get to be in real life.

102
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:50,712
Audition today. It's just gonna be a chance to

103
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,380
Finally get to show what I can do.

104
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,259
I loved it. I loved the tone in your voice.

105
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:07,128
I love your confidence. I'd be hard-pressed to see

106
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,365
Someone come and stand here and sound as good.

107
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,933
I think that there's a really, really beautiful voice

108
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:13,268
There. Thank you.

109
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,204
you're going to hollywood. Oh!

110
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:18,707
thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna bring it on.

111
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,575
bring it on. I'm gonna bring it.

112
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:23,345
see you in hollywood, man. Yes!

113
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:29,050
she sounds quite

114
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:30,919
Disappointed out there. Yeah, she's not happy about

115
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,755
It at all. All the contestants have

116
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:38,426
Come here for one reason and one reason only--to get one of

117
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,528
These. It would really prove to my

118
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,398
Family that "A," I really am talented and, hey, this is

119
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,602
Something that I take seriously. Just as far as validation of

120
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:50,438
Talent. I'm auditioning here.

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,407
But also one of my close friends, quiandra, she's

122
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,676
Auditioning as well. We're very close.

123
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:57,312
He's like my little brother. When he came to the school,

124
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:59,881
Nobody really talked to him. And the kids, they were mean to

125
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:01,716
Him. She really reached out to me,

126
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:04,219
And we became great friends. So she's always there for me.

127
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:08,290
She's like a big sister. If I don't make it and jamiah

128
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:11,326
Does, then he's gonna have my 100% support.

129
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,561
the first note. That's all that matters.

130
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:16,564
oh, my god. You gotta have 'em at hello.

131
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,000
yeah. Hello.

132
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,735
tell us a little bit about yourself.

133
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:22,604
I love music. Music is all I do.

134
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:24,839
Music is who I am. Quiandra, what are you gonna

135
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,741
Do for us today, baby? I'm gonna show how it's done

136
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,276
Today. Nice!

137
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,845
Love you! I feel confident.

138
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,914
I wanted to try one of my originals on you, actually.

139
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,249
yeah? Okay.

140
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,583
so. What are you saying?

141
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:36,951
both: Yellow ticket, yellow ticket, yellow ticket...

142
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:38,386
yellow ticket, yellow ticket, yellow ticket, yellow ticket.

143
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:20,195
well, I love your voice. I think you've got a great look.

144
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:22,197
I think you've got great confidence.

145
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:26,901
I think you have as good a shot of working in this industry

146
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:30,972
As many of the people out there. See, it wasn't--everything

147
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:34,943
Wasn't perfect in it. There's so much more to grow for

148
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,379
You. And I feel like this type of

149
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:41,950
Competition actually might be a really good thing for you.

150
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,718
Shall we vote? Yeah.

151
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,087
I'm gonna say no. It's a no for me this time

152
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,623
Too. That's a no for me too.

153
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,293
sorry. I'll start, and I'll vote

154
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,629
Yes. It's a yes for me.

155
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,364
it's a yes for me. We want you to come to

156
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:59,067
Hollywood! Whose life is about to

157
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,202
Change? Find out after the break.

158
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,496
welcome back to idol.

159
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,983
The next dramatic step toward

160
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,752
Stardom is about to be taken by

161
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,154
One lucky contestant.

162
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:14,825
But whose dream is going to be realized?

163
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:24,235
quiandra snatches that

164
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,572
Coveted golden ticket. She's up!

165
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,307
congratulations. Thank you, thank you.

166
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,809
we'll see you in hollywood. Whoo!

167
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:34,512
leaving jamiah with only a brave face.

168
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,013
hey, guys. Hey, man. What happened?

169
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,448
what's up, ryan? How you doing, buddy?

170
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,617
good, good. Any luck?

171
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,519
no, not this time. But you know what?

172
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:43,387
I think I did pretty good considering the circumstances.

173
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,022
good, man. Well, good to meet you.

174
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,724
thank you. Good luck.

175
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,125
Your pal over here wants to give you a hug.

176
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,394
She's waiting for you. Aww.

177
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,230
My little brother, I'm proud of him for doing the best he could,

178
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:57,468
But he still didn't make it. I don't even know how to feel

179
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,637
About that.

180
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:09,513
sorry, 64-b is out of place.

181
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:14,118
64-b. I love it.

182
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
hello. Hi, baby.

183
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,822
how are you all doing? Good. How you doing?

184
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,390
I'm good. What's your name?

185
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,058
oh, I can't believe it. I'm megan miller.

186
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,893
hi, megan. She's very excited to meet

187
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,096
Harry, I think. I am very excited because

188
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,864
You're from louisiana also. Where are you from?

189
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,899
I'm from a place called ethel.

190
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,801
It's about an hour north of baton rouge.

191
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,704
do you know ethel? Of course I know ethel.

192
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,740
I went to high school in ethel, and--

193
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,475
they don't have a high school in ethel, we share a zip code.

194
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,010
yeah, I know. I almost tried to get it past

195
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,278
You, but I couldn't. What you got?

196
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,014
I'm gonna sing last name by carrie underwood.

197
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:44,348
okay.

198
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,201
I like that.

199
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:24,755
I love the kind of cry and rasp in your voice.

200
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:26,991
thank you.

201
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:30,194
the only thing--I loved it too--I was worried about when

202
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:32,596
it is kind of a--

203
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,032
well, steven tyler power. My boy steven.

204
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,702
yeah, but I think about--I mean, some people are sort of

205
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:39,670
Immune to that. Like, he's a perfect example of

206
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:43,040
Somebody who can scream and still be able to scream the next

207
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,975
I have always been a

208
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,977
you didn't find any--that

209
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,679
not at all.

210
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,247
I sing four or five shows a week.

211
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,816
and there's another danger

212
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,752
Too I find sometimes with singers who have that kind of

213
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:59,123
Impassioned rasp, which, if it sounds like it's a lot of work

214
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,359
To get it out, it can be a lot of work for the audience

215
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,328
Listening. Whatever effort it takes you to

216
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,097
Form it, it takes exactly the same for an audience to listen

217
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,431
mm-hmm.

218
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,233
yeah.

219
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,735
you should be.

220
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,636
you happen to have a great voice, and I like your work

221
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,038
Ethic. So I'm gonna say yes.

222
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,074
I'm gonna say yes too.

223
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:18,876
oh, I love you guys so much.

224
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,278
you're going to hollywood, baby.

225
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,514
you didn't make it? Don't do that to me!

226
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:27,618
I'd be shocked if she has a

227
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,453
I think some people can hold

228
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,322
we'll find out.

229
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,656
yeah, for sure.

230
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,991
thank you so much.

231
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,392
good job. We'll see you in hollywood.

232
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,829
my name is grace field.

233
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:42,199
I am 27 years old, and I am a professional piano player.

234
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,435
I play a lot at restaurants and bars.

235
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:47,938
I play probably, like, five to seven nights a week.

236
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,708
I trained in music and art in college, and I have a post-grad

237
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,010
Degree in music as well. And then I've been playing ever

238
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,212
Since. Hey, guys.

239
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,914
welcome to austin, texas!

240
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,682
thank you.

241
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:01,519
I am grace field.

242
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,587
I'm originally from austin, texas, the best city in the

243
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,256
World. I'm a little partial.

244
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,991
yeah.

245
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,826
I do play piano.

246
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,528
that's awesome. Air high five.

247
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,797
oh, absolutely.

248
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,431
okay.

249
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,167
I'm gonna get pitch from my phone, if that's cool with you

250
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:22,239
Guys. All right.

251
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,996
thank you, grace. I'm not sure this is the right

252
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,299
Type of competition for you. I mean, american idol is looking

253
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:51,135
For, like, a powerhouse superstar performer.

254
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:53,804
It was all over the place. It was--it was frenetic.

255
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,506
it was just a little bit

256
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:59,343
Kinda like you were a little bit nervous because I felt like

257
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:01,312
The vibrato was a little bit out of control.

258
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,980
I think that might be her

259
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,015
Vibrato, though. I really do.

260
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,351
I'm not sure if you have the

261
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:11,589
Entire package for what american idol is looking for.

262
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,791
what happened?

263
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,960
I don't know. I don't think they--I don't

264
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,828
Think I was what they were looking for.

265
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,866
that's a good question.

266
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,702
I was thinking about that.

267
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:27,471
You know, it's really--it's like a great voice or a great look.

268
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:29,139
that's what we're always waiting for.

269
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:30,541
the spikes represent the hardness.

270
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:32,309
The pink kinda represents the softness.

271
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:35,446
or charisma or just something memorable.

272
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:38,148
my brothers and my dad, they all work in the oil field just

273
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,484
oil worker?

274
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,253
all three of us are gonna hear something different.

275
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:47,925
it's more than singing.

276
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,098
I felt like there was real

277
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,499
thank you.

278
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:58,168
how much do you like working on the oil rigs?

279
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,737
I don't want to do it forever.

280
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:02,273
I'm looking for people that are serious about being in the

281
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,375
I hope you take this

282
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,510
Seriously, bro, 'cause you're going to hollywood.

283
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,746
thank youo mu.

284
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:13,250
we're just waiting for

285
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:16,787
Somebody to come in and go-- where we just go, "Oh, my god!"

286
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,989
Oh, my god. Are your eyes blue, green?

287
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,525
you're a pretty guy.

288
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,394
and a no from me and keith.

289
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,829
there. I said it.

290
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,831
I don't like it. I don't like being upstaged by

291
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,934
it's just not the eyes.

292
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:31,769
The skin is gorgeous, the hair's not bad.

293
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,304
my name's spencer lloyd.

294
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:35,172
I'm from bryant, arkansas. And I'm 19 years old. S.

295
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:38,142
you hate him.

296
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,710
I love him.

297
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:41,345
your name is really cool, spencer lloyd.

298
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,680
you look like that.

299
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,882
You--even if you suck, you're carrying around a guitar.

300
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,951
I just--I don't like--what's to like?

301
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:49,053
girls are going for this.

302
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,255
yeah, I know. I know. I'm unhappy.

303
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,290
I'm gonna sing a colton

304
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,658
Dixon song. Is that cool?

305
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,261
this is torture for me.

306
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,897
young lady, you look nervous.

307
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:05,035
Are you nervous? Why? Is that your brother?

308
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:40,437
cool.

309
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,972
now, I'm gonna be straight up with you.

310
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:43,807
You seem like a really sweet guy.

311
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:50,114
the part that's missing for me is you're an okay singer.

312
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,717
But to follow you--I think about this stuff as a performer.

313
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,786
You're gonna go out, and you're gonna sing.

314
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,589
Whoever's lined up next to you is gonna have to deal with the

315
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,126
Deafening screams of your looks and your sweetness.

316
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,894
There's something to be said for that.

317
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,529
and also the fact that he can sing.

318
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,164
I wouldn't be saying this if

319
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,799
I totally know what harry's

320
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:10,634
Saying, and I agree. There's so many ways to

321
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,503
Entertain. And for me entertaining is just

322
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,738
Keeping my attention and engaging me in what you're

323
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,340
Doing. And you totally did that.

324
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:17,841
I agree. I think that there's a really,

325
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:20,778
Really beautiful voice there. I really enjoyed that.

326
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,084
harry?

327
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:31,889
you're gonna bring something to american idol that needs to

328
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,158
Be there. It's an image thing.

329
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,661
it's a yes from me too, man.

330
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:42,399
you're going to hollywood.

331
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:52,276
god, if you didn't-- it's the--there's not much

332
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:54,044
Difference between screams of delight and terror.

333
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,446
it really sounds exactle

334
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,681
I can host upside-down.

335
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,384
Come on! Congratulations.

336
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,349
nothing compares to this, really.

337
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,381
This is the top. This is american idol.

338
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,093
so what--have you got any ideas on what you're planning

339
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,294
To audition with?

340
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:31,204
well, it's kinda top secret. Hello.

341
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,839
hello, how you doing? How's it going?

342
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:35,275
What is your name? My name is marlon lindsey.

343
00:19:35,277 --> 00:19:37,877
and what brings you here? I'm gonna be the next

344
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,512
American idol. All right.

345
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:41,748
I've been wanting to try out for about eight or nine years

346
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,485
Now, but by me being in the army for six years, it kinda put a

347
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:47,520
Hold on it. And this is a dream come true

348
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,422
For me. Good for you, baby. Okay.

349
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,624
So what are you gonna sing? I'm gonna sing a change is

350
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:55,161
Gonna come get it.

351
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:26,726
both: Wow.

352
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,561
so what's the plan?

353
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:30,997
to just have, like, singing good to singing really bad and

354
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:33,900
Help it put--promote my movie career.

355
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:35,401
yeah.

356
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,904
Nobody does it, but I'm gonna sing a bad audition.

357
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:39,639
yeah.

358
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,608
but it goes against my plan,

359
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,243
we want you to come to

360
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,512
come on, marlon!

361
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:48,748
now, when the light goes green, just head in there.

362
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,184
all right. You'll see once it's all--comes

363
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,086
Together. It'll be really funny.

364
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:55,889
hey.

365
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:58,057
that doesn't sound quite right.

366
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,460
Usually the judges' voices are like, "Yo, dog.

367
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:07,133
I'm not feeling it, yo. We're in the pound."

368
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:11,237
Or like, "That bloody--was bloody awful."

369
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:21,481
Austin is a place where panhandlers are relatively

370
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:26,819
Honest, and the lawyers and attorneys wear dreads, so...

371
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:31,457
is this america's got talent?

372
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:34,994
so let me ask you a question.

373
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:37,597
What are you gonna sing? Oh, I'm gonna sing never

374
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,032
Gonna give you up by rick astley.

375
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:41,034
all right.

376
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:50,843
come on, bro.

377
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,712
You know you can't sing. There's people out there--

378
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,080
you want me to sing a real song?

379
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:57,083
no. No. Because you've disrespected the

380
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,585
Process. There's people that wait their

381
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,119
Whole life for this. That's not funny to me.

382
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,521
I'll sing one more song. I promise.

383
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:04,057
okay.

384
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,427
and so the auditions roll

385
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:10,563
Right along, and a new idol phrase is born.

386
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,999
that's right, you are.

387
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:18,504
word.

388
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:20,673
Some of the people that audition do not belong in this

389
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,875
Business. But let's also be real.

390
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,544
Sometimes you gotta stop the bleeding.

391
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,846
all right.

392
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:30,950
let's get this rally going.

393
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:40,660
hey, guys. Fantastic.

394
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:42,061
good, good, good.

395
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,796
doing great.

396
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,133
now people have to tell you who you remind them of.

397
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:49,102
okay. I hear that every now and then,

398
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,903
it's got to be our president.

399
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:53,673
oh, goodness. Let me be clear.

400
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:58,978
well, you have to understand

401
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,250
That live we live in a nation that is completely torn...

402
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:07,820
and we must stand together as

403
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:10,089
One nation.

404
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,759
that's phenomenal. That's so great.

405
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,861
yes!

406
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:16,229
what are you planning on singing?

407
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:18,831
I'm gonna sing my songs know what you did in the dark by

408
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,166
yeah.

409
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,170
up.

410
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,604
up.

411
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:07,647
I loved it. Absolutely loved it.

412
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:12,018
I love that tone in your voice. I love your confidence, all

413
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,586
thank you. I appreciate that.

414
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:15,655
yeah, there's something about certain people that when they

415
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:18,057
Come into the room, they change the kind of energy and the

416
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,659
Chemistry that's happening in the room.

417
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,561
thank you, jennifer.

418
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,796
there was something there that made all of us kind of perk

419
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,165
Up and go, "Oh, who is this person?"

420
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,633
you know what I--you know

421
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:30,870
What I like about you is that american idol really is like a

422
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:33,473
Checklist. Like, can you sing?

423
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,942
And do you have charisma? And things like that.

424
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,877
And it was a little eerie sometimes 'cause I really

425
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:39,278
it felt like obama

426
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,680
I went back into president

427
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:42,115
that's right.

428
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:44,383
I wouldn't say you're the greatest singer I've ever heard.

429
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:47,653
But you're so likeable, it's a yes from me.

430
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,856
it's a yes from me.

431
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,657
it's a yes from me too.

432
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:57,730
you will not be disappointed. I can assure you.

433
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:59,065
congrats, man. Thank you.

434
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,434
good luck to you. Thank you, guys.

435
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,603
gotcha. Whoo! Yeah!

436
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,439
you did it, t.K. Congratulations, man.

437
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:09,208
Good job, buddy. I appreciate it.

438
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,543
you've seen who the judges

439
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:11,911
Are sending to the next round...

440
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:13,146
I'm gonna say no.

441
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:14,413
it's a no from me too.

442
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:15,681
now with a new twist for

443
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,383
Season 13, let's see if you can

444
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:18,885
Spot the talent too.

445
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,787
Where is this contestant headed?

446
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,255
Hollywood or home?

447
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,032
chime in right now using the

448
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,767
Hashtags below, and we'll see if

449
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,877
You're right after the break.

450
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,261
before the break, we asked if

451
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,202
You were in sync with our

452
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:40,725
Judges.

453
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,331
so did they put mckenna

454
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,533
Dennis through to the next

455
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:51,534
Round?

456
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:54,270
who else is heading to

457
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,337
Hollywood?

458
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,909
The quest continues.

459
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:02,378
The contestants have been waiting all year for this

460
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,146
Moment. This is just so

461
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:05,714
Nerve-wracking. I'm telling you.

462
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,983
because everything is on the line.

463
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,585
nervous? Very nervous.

464
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:11,954
I think I'm more excited than nervous.

465
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:18,794
so here's what's gonna happen.

466
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:20,763
I'll put you in there. It's a chamber. Just hold tight.

467
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:23,165
Stand in there. Finish warming up, deep breath,

468
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,967
Whatever you wanna do. When the green light goes on,

469
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:27,002
Open the next door. It's all you.

470
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:28,337
Good luck. I appreciate it.

471
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:33,809
thank you. I'm not nervous.

472
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:38,747
maybe I should've rethought

473
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:41,150
Losing 130 pounds and then wearing sleeveless.

474
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:43,452
the tip of the tongue and the tongue and the lips.

475
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,435
my heart just hit the floor! Stop!

476
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:02,104
Give me a minute! It's like a haunted house out

477
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,241
There.

478
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:10,179
into the chamber you go. I'm getting locked in here.

479
00:27:10,181 --> 00:27:13,782
shh. Whoa.

480
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:16,018
Whoa. Howdy.

481
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,220
hi. Hi, ho.

482
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,588
Hello. Hi.

483
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,858
hi. My name's tristen langley.

484
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,460
tristen? Yes, ma'am.

485
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:26,228
who's-- this is my mom.

486
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,930
okay. Well, wait a minute I kinda

487
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:29,298
Remember you. Wow.

488
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
I was on the very first season.

489
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:34,503
singing always something there to remind me, nicki

490
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:36,805
my mom was on the first

491
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:39,708
Season of american idol. She got third.

492
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,177
so it was kelly, justin-- kelly, justin, me.

493
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,512
and you. Yeah.

494
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:44,980
wow. Well, the first time I made

495
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:47,182
An appearance, I guess you could say it was when I was four years

496
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,952
Old. I gave my mom a rose when she

497
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:52,121
Was onstage. Well, what's your little

498
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:53,489
Boy's name? Tristen.

499
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,357
tristen, thanks for being here, buddy.

500
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,759
hi, baby. Hi, mom.

501
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:59,828
Her being up there just inspired me to start singing.

502
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,032
I wanted that, to make people happy and just to love what I

503
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:07,102
Do. Oh, my goodness.

504
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,271
So cute. Okay.

505
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,907
What are you gonna sing? I will be doing santeria by

506
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:14,009
okay.

507
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:07,663
there's a second-generation

508
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,298
that's really cool.

509
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,600
that's nuts.

510
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:13,168
this is something. This is history right here,

511
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,536
yeah.

512
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:16,338
this is tough because it's a perfect story.

513
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,407
I just think if mom weren't here, and the story weren't

514
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:22,111
Here, I can guarantee you it wouldn't work for me.

515
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:26,749
I totally disagree. It wasn't, you know, blow you

516
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:30,319
Away, but it was definitely a really, really good voice.

517
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,221
yes, I am.

518
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:33,856
yeah, but isn't that what--

519
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:35,290
how 'bout that?

520
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:38,060
tristen, look, you've got a

521
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:41,096
Great voice, but, man, when you choke it like that, you can do

522
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:43,332
It for effect once or twice...

523
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,134
Kind of thing. But you can't stay in that

524
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,136
Place or you will have no voice left.

525
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:48,771
I'm gonna say yes.

526
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:50,572
I think you're worth another try, but he's right.

527
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:52,174
If you don't get that under control--

528
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:53,575
and learn how to open up and

529
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:55,110
Let those notes out, you're gonna get into trouble.

530
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:56,712
But it's a yes for me. I'll take a look at you one more

531
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:58,647
thank you.

532
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,551
thank you.

533
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:08,390
man.

534
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:13,762
15.

535
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:16,465
whoo!

536
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:21,703
no?

537
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:26,308
congratulations, man! Good job, good job. You got it!

538
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,744
dr. No.

539
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:31,313
it's come full circle, hasn't

540
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:32,648
oh, I know.

541
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,850
congratulations.

542
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,885
it's hard to do that, you

543
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:38,387
what he was doing? Yeah.

544
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:40,189
at 15?

545
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:41,690
yeah, crazy.

546
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,926
this is a very big day.

547
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:47,329
This day could change your life forever!

548
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:48,363
it would mean the world to me

549
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:50,032
To have this opportunity to show

550
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,267
My family that I really am

551
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,803
Talented.

552
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:56,004
I'm an artist.

553
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:57,739
That's what I do.

554
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:58,874
adam, you lived in your car

555
00:30:58,876 --> 00:30:59,641
For a couple of years?

556
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:00,776
I did.

557
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:01,810
I was sleeping in my car out of

558
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:02,578
Choice.

559
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,579
I no longer wanted to work.

560
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:04,379
All I wanted to do was play

561
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:07,216
Music.

562
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:08,450
ever since I was about three

563
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,351
Or four, I've been watching this

564
00:31:09,353 --> 00:31:11,286
Show.

565
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,287
You know, I've been secretly

566
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,858
Practicing my whole life, yeah.

567
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,859
the green light hits green,

568
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:17,559
Go on in.

569
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:18,227
okay.

570
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:18,961
N I ng in here?

571
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:19,962
you can sing.

572
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,130
I've been, you know,

573
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:22,331
Struggling to find what I need

574
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,599
To do like any other

575
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:27,536
22-year-old.

576
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:28,871
I just need to work this out for

577
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:30,439
Me and my son.

578
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,274
hey, guys.

579
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:33,709
hello.

580
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:35,344
we all want you to just

581
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:36,879
so much.

582
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:38,580
really, really destroy it. We're rooting for you.

583
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:54,062
this thing has become iconic

584
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:57,699
In our country.

585
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:00,836
american idol is about

586
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:05,707
you're going to hollywood, baby.

587
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:08,277
there it is.

588
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:11,346
for me, it's not american idol material.

589
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,748
thank you, man.

590
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,417
all right.

591
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:24,226
whoo!

592
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:32,367
it's okay.

593
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:39,805
welcome back to austin,

594
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:42,772
Texas, where our search for a

595
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,974
Superstar has led us way off the

596
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:47,143
Beaten path.

597
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:55,518
I'm from goliad, texas.

598
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,754
My dream of being a singer is something that's not new.

599
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,856
It's been here since I was four years old.

600
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:02,425
Growing up, my family supported my dreams, but there was a lot

601
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:05,895
Of people that didn't, including my ex-fiancee.

602
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,531
She flat out told me I didn't have the talent, the skill, or

603
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:12,001
The look, or the charisma. I never gave up hoping one day

604
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:15,472
I could be america's next idol. How y'all doing, guys?

605
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:17,207
nice to see y'all.

606
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,908
it's an honor to be in front

607
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,877
Of legends like you guys, man. Keith, I used to sing your song

608
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:22,846
To girls in high school. J-lo, my goodness.

609
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,814
You are an unfathomably good performer.

610
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:26,483
I loved it when you got blown up in independence day, harry.

611
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,218
which songs of mine did you

612
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,886
Sing to the girls in high school?

613
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:31,654
making memories of us. That was actually my favorite

614
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:32,989
One. Cool.

615
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,524
and what scene are you referring to when you talk about

616
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,559
Me getting blown up? Oh, the one I got blown up in.

617
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,328
after the black knight speech, and you know what?

618
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,363
It was awesome. I loved it. Hilarious. It made me laugh.

619
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:41,764
You were my favorite character. And you got blown up.

620
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,466
I was like, "Oh, my goodness. His buddy's gone."

621
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:47,103
I like you.

622
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,605
thank you. What's your name?

623
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:51,040
my name is l.J. Hernandez. What you gonna sing, baby?

624
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:52,775
well, I'm gonna sing I'll be by edwin mccain.

625
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:55,478
okay, let's hear it. All right.

626
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,033
When you're 25? Yeah.

627
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:18,368
that's in two years.

628
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,802
well, I'll be better, you know.

629
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,237
are they glow sticks? Now, what happened there?

630
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,106
oh, now, that is just-- you scared me when you pulled

631
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:24,541
Those out. I didn't know what they were.

632
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:26,042
I'm sorry. Props. You know, for like, going above

633
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,510
And beyond, being different. But they're glow sticks that

634
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,013
Don't glow. Well, they were an hour ago,

635
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:31,848
But not anymore. Good timing on that.

636
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,182
I can relate. I tried to time it just

637
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:34,684
Right. I could tell that you put a

638
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:36,753
Lot into it and that you rehearsed it and you took it

639
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,187
Seriously. Yeah.

640
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:40,089
it was really fun to watch. Yeah, well, my ex-fiancee

641
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,058
Told me I'd never be here. So, you know.

642
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,294
but here you are. That's why she's your ex.

643
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,896
harry, what do you think? That's a no.

644
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:49,632
I think you know that, voice-wise, for american idol,

645
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,801
It's maybe not the way to go. Well, thank you, guys.

646
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:53,136
I appreciate that. I really do.

647
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,470
absolutely. Coming from professionals

648
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:55,905
Like you all that have been in the industry, it means a lot to

649
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,240
Hear that. You know?

650
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:58,608
But thank y'all a lot. Y'all have a good day, all

651
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,943
Right? You, too.

652
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:01,945
well, thank you. Thank you, man.

653
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:06,082
what happened? No? No ticket today?

654
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:08,685
not today, bud. But, hey, don't give up on your

655
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:10,153
Dreams, guys. That's right.

656
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:11,821
well, better luck next year. In this situation, the cowboy

657
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,023
Cowboys up and gets back on that horse.

658
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:15,758
Good-bye. I'll see y'all next season.

659
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,797
J-lo, call me, all right? That woke me up a little bit.

660
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,665
austin has that effect on people.

661
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,535
The best part of the job is when we give somebody an

662
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:28,004
Opportunity to get the break they're looking for.

663
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:30,273
I mean, that's it for me. How are y'all?

664
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:31,841
we're good. How are you? Good, man.

665
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:33,209
I'm so good. I'm glad to be here.

666
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:34,744
glad you're here. We're happy to have you.

667
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:36,479
What's your name? John fox.

668
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:38,348
and where are you from? I'm from magnolia, texas,

669
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,083
Which is a small town outside of houston.

670
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:46,122
I live at home with my mom and dad.

671
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:48,691
I was at a four-year school. And then I was like, "This

672
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,627
Isn't what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to do music."

673
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:53,896
So I moved back home. Now I'm stuck there for a

674
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,932
Little while, so... and what do you do?

675
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm a worship leader, actually.

676
00:35:57,302 --> 00:36:01,037
ah. John wrote a song for church.

677
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,442
He was six years old. I wanna be an artist.

678
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:11,481
I wanna be a singer. I finally get that opportunity

679
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:14,884
To just show the world what I have.

680
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,519
what are you gonna sing? I'm gonna sing to make you

681
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:19,255
Feel my love yeah. Great song.

682
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,582
right on, john.

683
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:22,351
gosh, nice voice.

684
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:23,686
thank you so much.

685
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:25,088
It's good to play in front of y'all.

686
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,489
yeah.

687
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,591
it's always so cool to, like,

688
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:31,260
Imagine what someone is gonna sound like.

689
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:32,995
And then, when they sing, be totally surprised.

690
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,330
I love what then that

691
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:35,765
yeah, it's like--I did not

692
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,333
Expect your voice to sound like that.

693
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:38,835
I'm not sure what I expected,

694
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,269
yeah, it was so refreshing

695
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:41,704
Today. We've had so many guitarists

696
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:43,206
Come in and sing. And they don't have the

697
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,041
Authority in their voice. And they end--the guitar ends up

698
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:46,843
Being the thing that's the loudest and the most dominating

699
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,244
yeah.

700
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,645
and you didn't have that problem at all.

701
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:50,980
I loved it.

702
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,448
you're such a great guitarist, by the way, keith.

703
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,816
thank you. Oh, well, that's it.

704
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,618
thank you. Thank you.

705
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,720
are we voting?

706
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:59,155
yeah. It's a yes from me anyway.

707
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:00,490
thanks, keith. I appreciate it.

708
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:02,358
it's a yes for you?

709
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,361
yeah! Thank you so much.

710
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:07,964
great job, man.

711
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,499
congratulations.

712
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:13,269
all right. See you all there.

713
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:21,277
good job, buddy.

714
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,045
you got it, man!

715
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,781
we're so proud of you!

716
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:26,549
I mean, what's so interesting is that he likes being a worship

717
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,718
Leader. Like, he's the guy who sets the

718
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,853
Tone for where the service is gonna go.

719
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,522
oh, yeah.

720
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:33,923
that's what he does for a job.

721
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:39,395
That's really cool. I like that.

722
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:43,599
go, john!

723
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:46,702
look at ryan. Ryan's sleeping on the job.

724
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:48,538
you are so lucky you woke up

725
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,306
hi, guys.

726
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:52,708
So what do we think of the day here in austin?

727
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,310
I thought it was a pretty good day.

728
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:57,680
I think jesse roach was good.

729
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,682
there was a guy that was

730
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:01,551
oh, right.

731
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:03,619
But the exciting part about this show is that you get to see

732
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:05,087
that's it.

733
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,989
like, you watch these young people evolve.

734
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,691
so we're in the beginning of the journey.

735
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:11,093
And we have to wait and see, like, who becomes that because

736
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,862
We might have seen the american idol.

737
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:14,530
I agree with that.

738
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,199
are there any issues with the family here?

739
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:17,700
we're good.

740
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:19,268
I feel like I have total control.

741
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,703
It's great.

742
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,371
and she won't even sit with us on the same seat.

743
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:23,873
I feel like we're on love

744
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,374
Connection. You're gonna have to choose

745
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:27,476
Between bachelor number one, bachelor number two, and

746
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:29,345
Bachelor number three. Where's chuck woolery when we

747
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:30,680
Need him? We'll be back.

748
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:34,217
it's the final rose. Here. Good-bye.

749
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:38,855
you don't want my rose? After the break, we're

750
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:42,358
Setting up shop in san francisco.

751
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,061
I'm gonna say yes and pray that keith says yes too.

752
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:54,503
yay! You're going to hollywood!

753
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:57,640
find out who gets the gold right after this.

754
00:39:57,642 --> 00:40:00,710
I like your voice a lot. Baah!

755
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:03,079
that was intense.

756
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:09,877
the hunt

757
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:13,521
for your next idol takes us west to san francisco.

758
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:17,131
I'm gonna drive over the golden gate bridge to go into

759
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,700
San francisco. And today's the real audition

760
00:40:19,702 --> 00:40:21,902
Day. I'm really excited.

761
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:30,110
but who in this crowd will

762
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:33,180
Get that all-important golden ticket?

763
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:37,751
are you ready?

764
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:41,822
At stake is our prestigious trip to hollywood.

765
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:44,625
I may be working behind this register, but today we have

766
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:49,463
Some voices out here you guys just need to hear.

767
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:53,601
ennir, keith, and harry are primed for the task ahead.

768
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,236
I'm excited about san fran.

769
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:56,537
And we gonna find some great

770
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,005
People here.

771
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,473
there's so many of a

772
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:00,674
Particular kind of singer that,

773
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:02,009
When someone ces iwho isn't

774
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:04,044
Anything like them, that's the

775
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,013
First time I find myself really

776
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:07,948
Being interested.

777
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,749
we're looking for something

778
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,718
That we've never seen before.

779
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,353
yeah.

780
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:14,655
let's hope.

781
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:20,828
ready to go?

782
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,797
so ready. Let's get it.

783
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:29,270
I'm rachel leery. I'm 17, and I'm a senior at

784
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:33,073
Monte vista high school in danville, california.

785
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:37,311
I love singing and playing the guitar.

786
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:41,415
I'm not putting pressure on

787
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,717
You, but you have to make this next round of idol so I can

788
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,053
you already yelled at him to

789
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:48,689
Take his shirt off at the first concert we went to.

790
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:52,359
"I'll take your shirt, keith."

791
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:02,403
When I'll go in there, I'll probably, like, try and play it

792
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:05,639
Really cool so I don't, like, wipe the drool off my chin from

793
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:10,077
Seeing keith.

794
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,779
hi.

795
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm rachel.

796
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:14,615
hi, rachel.

797
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,016
what's your full name?

798
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:17,818
rachel leigh rolleri.

799
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,486
okay. What are you gonna sing?

800
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:21,755
stay okay.

801
00:42:56,459 --> 00:42:58,926
I like that.

802
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:00,828
I like that kind of stuff.

803
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:04,932
it's a confidence that that takes.

804
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,591
all right, cool.

805
00:43:30,593 --> 00:43:32,126
you said it's been a long day, or it's gonna be a long

806
00:43:32,128 --> 00:43:33,961
it's gonna be both.

807
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:36,664
also, that chord was meant

808
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:39,299
To be an a flat 7 when you said, "Begs you not to go."

809
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:40,968
It's a great chord. It's a good one.

810
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,803
what is he even talking

811
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:45,773
About? I just go by what I feel.

812
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:47,708
What is that look that you gave in the middle?

813
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,710
sometimes I, like, get all nervous, and I hear something

814
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:51,945
That I think maybe you guys did. And I'm just like, "Oh, I'm

815
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:54,081
you have such a beautiful

816
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,216
Voice, baby. You've got a great voice.

817
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,685
thank you, keith urban.

818
00:43:57,687 --> 00:43:59,053
you know what's great? Is that it's you.

819
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,487
it's really pretty.

820
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:01,889
you have a little cry in the back of it too.

821
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:03,290
a little tear in the back of

822
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,692
it's very mature for 17.

823
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:07,261
thank you.

824
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:08,629
and you play guitar really well too.

825
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:09,963
thank you.

826
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,632
I agree. It's a sort of understated

827
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:14,868
Confidence that you have, which is extremely important in

828
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,470
American idol. It's important in life.

829
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:18,005
it's attractive too. It's very attractive.

830
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:20,708
But I will say this. The first time you thought you

831
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,178
Flubbed, and you kind of gave us those eyes, it was really cute.

832
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,480
And I said, "I love that there." The second time, it's like,

833
00:44:26,482 --> 00:44:28,182
"Okay, she flubbed again." The third time, it's a bad

834
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:29,650
Habit. Yeah.

835
00:44:29,652 --> 00:44:32,152
don't do that anymore. Don't tip the fact that you

836
00:44:32,154 --> 00:44:34,955
Think you messed up because maybe we did miss it.

837
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:37,691
But we didn't. But we might have.

838
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:39,693
they actually say there's no wrong notes, just the look on

839
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:44,331
Your face. Rachel's first concert was a

840
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,100
Keith urban show? That's right.

841
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:48,035
was that your influence? Probably--

842
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:53,474
it was probably mine. Yeah?

843
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:56,376
it's a yes from me. Yes from me!

844
00:44:56,378 --> 00:44:59,980
yes! Thank you so much!

845
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:02,382
I must say you are all wonderful.

846
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:03,851
Thank you very much for your time.

847
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:05,319
you're gonna do great out there, baby.

848
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:06,653
thank you so much. You are.

849
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:09,022
See you in hollywood. Congratulations, rachel.

850
00:45:09,024 --> 00:45:11,692
there it is.

851
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:14,228
oh, my gosh. Hello, there. She's really good.

852
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,131
yeah.

853
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:18,599
I like the thickness in her tone.

854
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:20,100
yeah, it's--that's what it was.

855
00:45:20,102 --> 00:45:21,568
I couldn't think of how to say it, it was--

856
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,970
it was like the cher thickness.

857
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:24,972
Like, . Yeah, like a little something

858
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:26,373
Going on in there. I don't know.

859
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:27,741
I won't do that again. I'm sorry.

860
00:45:27,743 --> 00:45:29,376
please. That'd be great. We'll keep an eye out for

861
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:31,445
Rachel in hollywood. But it looks like the

862
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:54,268
Where I'm from, not a lot of people have been able to make it

863
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,204
To where I'm sitting. I feel like I was just born to

864
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,295
I went to the junior olympics twice when I was ski racing.

865
00:46:21,297 --> 00:46:25,499
And then I started really getting into music.

866
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:30,204
And my passion for music just kind of consumed me.

867
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:51,291
I'm auditioning today because I have a really unique style.

868
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:53,760
It's a lot different from a lot of other people.

869
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:57,397
I don't look like someone who sings like how I sing.

870
00:47:02,137 --> 00:47:04,872
from the way you look to the way you sound, I felt it was

871
00:47:04,874 --> 00:47:07,641
Very authentic. I like your voice a lot.

872
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:11,044
I think you've got a big voice, a huge voice.

873
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:13,413
It was like--it wasn't even raw. It was primitive.

874
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,148
yes. In a really good way.

875
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,317
Like, primitive talent. Thank you.

876
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:18,652
I think you know what the answer's gonna be.

877
00:47:18,654 --> 00:47:20,687
we're all saying the same thing.

878
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:23,423
You're going to hollywood! Yes!

879
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:25,425
it's a yes. Going to hollywood.

880
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:28,395
you're going to hollywood. Nice job, athena.

881
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:30,530
thank you.

882
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:35,402
whoo!

883
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:38,739
oh, my god!

884
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:41,141
oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

885
00:47:41,143 --> 00:47:45,545
I'm going to hollywood! I'm going to hollywood.

886
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:49,816
oh, my god. Next?

887
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:14,107
how you guys doing today? Good.

888
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,976
real good. My name emmanuel zidor.

889
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:18,578
I'm 24 years old. I'm originally from miami, but I

890
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,747
Live in atlanta, georgia. You have a great voice.

891
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:22,449
thank you so much. And a great entry.

892
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:24,051
I mean, the floor thing. A good entrance.

893
00:48:24,053 --> 00:48:25,752
it scared me a little bit. I'm not gonna lie.

894
00:48:25,754 --> 00:48:27,487
A little bit.

895
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,656
sometimes good theater is scary, you know?

896
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:31,191
that was nice.

897
00:48:31,193 --> 00:48:32,960
how 'bout you sing something else for us?

898
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:35,362
okay. Just wanna hear your voice.

899
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:37,264
okay. Okay?

900
00:49:06,295 --> 00:49:09,062
thank you. I'm gonna cry.

901
00:49:09,064 --> 00:49:11,765
don't cry. Don't cry 'cause then I cry.

902
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,600
And then we'll all be crying. And then I have to fix my

903
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:17,537
Makeup. Or someone will.

904
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:20,140
they. Oh, I'm not supposed to cry

905
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:22,542
On camera at all, girl. You know I'm not--

906
00:49:22,544 --> 00:49:23,910
oh! Did you just go like-- yeah, you just flipped--

907
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:25,612
Man, you ain't got no hair, and you're flinging your hair.

908
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:30,917
he's flinging a bald head.

909
00:49:30,919 --> 00:49:32,786
and that was really, really beautiful.

910
00:49:32,788 --> 00:49:34,154
thank you. Really, really beautiful.

911
00:49:34,156 --> 00:49:36,156
yeah. I believe in myself.

912
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:40,360
I've been told by so many people that I can't do this.

913
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:43,630
I remember I went into my seventh grade class, and I told

914
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:46,933
My teacher, "I'm gonna be on american idol, I'm gonna win."

915
00:49:46,935 --> 00:49:49,169
And he told me, "You will never be on that show.

916
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:51,805
you have three music teachers

917
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:53,807
Up here, and what you do you think all three of these music

918
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:57,778
yes!

919
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:02,015
yes!

920
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:06,219
don't hurt your voice. Yes!

921
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:14,461
I can't believe that I'm going

922
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:25,372
welcome back to the bay area

923
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:28,297
Where, after a great start, the

924
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:29,898
Judges are one big, happy

925
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,766
Family.

926
00:50:30,768 --> 00:50:32,401
they're good.

927
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:33,869
are they?

928
00:50:33,871 --> 00:50:35,571
whoo-h0o!

929
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:39,775
me anywhere near this thing because it's really

930
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:45,080
Scary. I mean, it is really freaking me

931
00:50:45,082 --> 00:50:48,550
Out. It is so creepy it's broken--

932
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:52,488
are these all piercings?

933
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,356
I'm trying to figure out all this outfit right now.

934
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:56,325
that's unbelievable. I wouldn't like to be standing

935
00:50:59,096 --> 00:51:04,066
thank you so much.

936
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:05,767
I'm sorry.

937
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,469
my bracelet!

938
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:09,304
that just totally stabbed three of my fingers.

939
00:51:09,306 --> 00:51:11,306
does anyone have a tetanus

940
00:51:11,308 --> 00:51:12,908
bye, sadie.

941
00:51:15,946 --> 00:51:17,613
there's a place called sheep ranch?

942
00:51:17,615 --> 00:51:19,181
yeah. It's actually open-range.

943
00:51:19,183 --> 00:51:22,284
no.

944
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:24,052
would you use a shorn-off shotgun?

945
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:25,954
yeah.

946
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:27,723
I'm gonna hit you with a jazzier version of I want you

947
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:30,392
Back. I love jazzy.

948
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:41,503
what is your definition of "Jazzy"?

949
00:51:41,505 --> 00:51:43,972
I'm just curious. What I intended to convey is

950
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:46,174
That I was gonna change up the song a little bit, so I added a

951
00:51:46,176 --> 00:51:47,709
Little bit of stuff. Right.

952
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:49,845
Don't use the word "Jazzy." That's not a word.

953
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:53,482
hatchet. We should vote.

954
00:51:53,484 --> 00:51:56,752
it's a no, man. He had you at jazzy, didn't

955
00:51:56,754 --> 00:51:58,820
He? You can't say anything that

956
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:01,723
Has to do with jazz for harry. He doesn't wanna know about it.

957
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:03,358
no, but it's one of those words like "Pitchy."

958
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,194
We all know what it means, but it's incorrect.

959
00:52:06,196 --> 00:52:08,363
So it's called singing out of tune.

960
00:52:08,365 --> 00:52:10,032
Which are not gonna do, by the way.

961
00:52:10,034 --> 00:52:11,967
hey, how are you doing? Good. How are you?

962
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:15,103
good. So who are you?

963
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:17,339
I'm katelynn johnson. I'm 15 years old, and I'm from

964
00:52:17,341 --> 00:52:18,674
North plains, oregon. You're 15?

965
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:21,677
that's just crazy. God, you are not 15 years

966
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:23,011
Old! Enough!

967
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:24,746
Enough with the practical jokes on american idol.

968
00:52:24,748 --> 00:52:26,582
That's impossible. You're 32 years old.

969
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,451
You're from new york city, and your name is beth goodwin.

970
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:33,388
that's impo--come on!

971
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,357
I'm 15, and I'm from north

972
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,059
Plains, oregon.

973
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:38,193
North plains, oregon, is a

974
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:39,261
Really small town.

975
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:43,765
And I live on a 46-acre horse ranch.

976
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:47,769
We raise horses, get on the atv.

977
00:52:47,771 --> 00:52:51,506
I just run around and feed them. It's really fun living there.

978
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:53,709
It's a dream. Even though I love the country

979
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:56,979
Life, I still like to sing blues and keep it pop.

980
00:52:56,981 --> 00:52:59,681
And hopefully I'll surprise the judges and come out with a

981
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:01,617
Golden ticket. So what are you gonna sing

982
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:03,652
Today? Something's got a hold on me

983
00:53:03,654 --> 00:53:05,821
By etta james, but the christina aguilera version.

984
00:53:05,823 --> 00:53:07,656
okay. Okay.

985
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:46,561
all right, katelynn. So, you know, you're not ready.

986
00:53:46,563 --> 00:53:51,266
You need time to work on who you--who you are.

987
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:57,105
It's a no. I feel like you're talented.

988
00:53:57,107 --> 00:54:00,942
It's not perfect. But I feel like we could maybe--

989
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:04,579
I'm hoping for something.

990
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:12,020
I'm still thinking. Look, I really liked it.

991
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:15,223
I like your voice a lot. I think you've got a big voice.

992
00:54:15,225 --> 00:54:17,626
I think at 15, you're like, you're gonna figure it out

993
00:54:17,628 --> 00:54:19,961
Really quick. But I think it's extraordinary.

994
00:54:19,963 --> 00:54:22,297
And I loved it. Thank you.

995
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:24,433
I'm gonna say yes. Thank you.

996
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:39,448
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

997
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,117
yeah. Yeah.

998
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,119
I think you're talented, girl. Come here.

999
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:45,520
congrats, katelynn. Come on, katelynn.

1000
00:54:45,522 --> 00:54:47,723
You're going to hollywood. You gotta get those nerves

1001
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:49,558
Under control. Thank you so much.

1002
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,761
it was rocking out there. She'll be good.

1003
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:54,730
she was all over the place. What?

1004
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:56,898
she was all over the place, but she's talented.

1005
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,502
she's gonna be good. It'll be good. You'll see.

1006
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:06,508
katelynn's been given the

1007
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,810
Chance of a lifetime and is lost

1008
00:55:08,812 --> 00:55:11,580
For words.

1009
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:13,348
me?

1010
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,784
Oh, I don't know. But back in the holding

1011
00:55:15,786 --> 00:55:18,420
Room, it's a very different story.

1012
00:55:18,422 --> 00:55:20,322
it's not like I just jumped into this.

1013
00:55:20,324 --> 00:55:24,059
Everything has been happening to me like it's supposed to.

1014
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:26,895
When I let this out, it's gonna be amazing, you guys.

1015
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:29,765
I have something that the world honestly needs to hear.

1016
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:32,100
Hi, america. I'm ronald james reed.

1017
00:55:32,102 --> 00:55:35,437
I feel like I embody the spirit of being the next american idol.

1018
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:37,939
That's just goal number one. I have a bunch of goals through

1019
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:42,911
World disease, hunger, and famine, and war are gonna be

1020
00:55:42,913 --> 00:55:44,613
Ended. And I'm gonna play a part in

1021
00:55:44,615 --> 00:55:46,848
That. I know that.

1022
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,383
what do you envision? What do you see?

1023
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:51,186
I see the world in a place where all of this happens

1024
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:53,321
Everywhere every day. And that can happen.

1025
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:55,123
We're gonna do it, you know? Well, you've got the right

1026
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,992
Spirit. You've got the right attitude.

1027
00:55:56,994 --> 00:55:58,960
You got the right energy. It's contagious, your

1028
00:55:58,962 --> 00:56:02,798
Enthusiasm. Baah!

1029
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,437
hello. Hi.

1030
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:11,373
oh, my god.

1031
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,508
describe that moment, right then, when you first laid eyes

1032
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,477
On jen. I have been waiting for this,

1033
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:19,948
Jennifer lopez, for more years than I can even put into words

1034
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,716
Right now. Aww.

1035
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:25,053
What are you gonna sing? For you.

1036
00:56:25,055 --> 00:56:26,955
It's one of my favorite songs. Okay.

1037
00:56:26,957 --> 00:56:28,290
do you have a stool somewhere?

1038
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:29,624
Can I-- right there.

1039
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:33,395
just grab that one right there.

1040
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:30,418
you're a sweetheart.

1041
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,054
The vocals, you know, are not strong enough.

1042
00:57:33,056 --> 00:57:35,957
dude, so sweet.

1043
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:38,326
I really wanted your vocals to be where your personality is.

1044
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:41,296
yes, they are!

1045
00:57:41,298 --> 00:57:43,999
on rare occasions can you

1046
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:48,470
Split art up into subjective and objective, the subjective being

1047
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:52,207
Opion,he objective being right or wrong.

1048
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:58,013
And this is very easy to say. Your singing just wasn't there.

1049
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,614
it's okay.

1050
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:01,016
I have to say no, ronald. I'm sorry.

1051
00:58:01,018 --> 00:58:02,918
it's a no. Thank you for coming, man.

1052
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,087
oh, my god.

1053
00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:10,859
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1054
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:13,962
he keeps saying, "J-lo," It's

1055
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:17,299
I didn't make it,

1056
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:18,700
oh, no.

1057
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:22,437
you made it here.

1058
00:58:22,439 --> 00:58:23,905
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

1059
00:58:23,907 --> 00:58:26,374
be strong. Let's go. Let's do it.

1060
00:58:30,793 --> 00:58:33,481
It took candice glover three

1061
00:58:35,218 --> 00:58:37,319
Years. I can do it in two, maybe.

1062
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:39,554
Hey, whatever. I'll do it. But until then, I'm gonna keep

1063
00:58:39,556 --> 00:58:41,656
that's it. That's right.

1064
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:43,458
walk outta here proud.

1065
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:52,300
see you later, all right?

1066
00:58:52,302 --> 00:58:54,102
okay.

1067
00:58:54,104 --> 00:58:56,771
that's character-building.

1068
00:58:56,773 --> 00:59:00,308
my voice will resound.

1069
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,378
It's gonna be monumental. It's gonna change things.

1070
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,013
oh, yeah, he gonna be all

1071
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:08,283
Right. Wait till next year.

1072
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:10,218
well, look out.

1073
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,987
okay, thank you.

1074
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:14,689
see you later. Buh-bye.

1075
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:23,578
welcome back to our san francisco auditions.

1076
00:59:23,846 --> 00:59:26,514
What do you think we will find while we're here?

1077
00:59:26,516 --> 00:59:28,316
well, I think you're gonna find the best talent.

1078
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:29,684
you know, san francisco,

1079
00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:32,386
Everybody flocks to here. It's like the summer of love.

1080
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:35,623
sure.

1081
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:49,303
yes.

1082
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:51,639
thank you.

1083
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:53,541
and tell my girl I said I love her.

1084
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:55,343
oh, what's her name?

1085
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:58,846
The singer. What's her name? Oh, ro--uh, randy.

1086
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:05,119
it's a sign.

1087
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:07,088
I'm telling you, you're gonna

1088
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,689
all right, I hope so.

1089
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:10,191
and they're waiting in that room right now, waiting for you

1090
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:13,861
To hear 'em. "Hey, come and look for me."

1091
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:15,663
hello.

1092
01:00:15,665 --> 01:00:16,998
hey.

1093
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,766
good. How are you guys?

1094
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:20,935
what's your name?

1095
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:23,337
and where are you from?

1096
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,373
I am from forestville, california.

1097
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:28,576
I am 26 years old.

1098
01:00:28,578 --> 01:00:30,678
and what are you gonna sing, sweetie?

1099
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,347
okay. Go ahead.

1100
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:55,803
I love it.

1101
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,601
okay, baby. Interesting.

1102
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:30,204
It's interesting. For idol, it's interesting

1103
01:01:30,206 --> 01:01:32,440
Because I can hear you on a record.

1104
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:35,643
I can hear you on some great tune like that and think, you

1105
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:37,745
Know, "Wow. I love the sound of this guy's

1106
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:40,347
Voice. And it's super cool.

1107
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:44,185
I'm generally a pretty darn

1108
01:01:44,187 --> 01:01:46,854
yeah, it feels like that, and

1109
01:01:46,856 --> 01:01:49,590
Then the music took me someplace else.

1110
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,325
do you do a lot of writing? Do you write a lot of your own

1111
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:52,693
yes, I do.

1112
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:55,830
that's what you strike me as, a good singer/songwriter,

1113
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:58,232
Storytelling guy. This is the truth.

1114
01:01:58,234 --> 01:02:01,102
Half of me sort of thinks you'd get to hollywood week, and you

1115
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:03,471
Would just be crushed by all the singers out there because of

1116
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:06,307
That environment. The other half of me goes, "But

1117
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,610
Your staunch originality wouldn't have competition in

1118
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:12,146
That lane." No one's doing what you do.

1119
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:14,682
I agree.

1120
01:02:14,684 --> 01:02:16,484
For being such a happy guy, man, that's about as

1121
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:19,253
Misanthropic as you can get. I mean, that's very down.

1122
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:21,555
Like, really down. And idol is not that.

1123
01:02:21,557 --> 01:02:23,891
Everybody else is happy. And so you have a--you have your

1124
01:02:23,893 --> 01:02:25,893
Own spot in the sadness. You know what I'm saying?

1125
01:02:25,895 --> 01:02:28,729
So it's interesting. I'm not sure if it's--if it's

1126
01:02:28,731 --> 01:02:30,698
Idol interesting. But it is very interesting.

1127
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,800
let's take a vote.

1128
01:02:32,802 --> 01:02:38,372
you're interesting enough for

1129
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:41,809
Me to see you one more time. I'm gonna say yes to hollywood

1130
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:48,048
For this guy. It's up to these guys now.

1131
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,384
what are they doing with him in there?

1132
01:02:50,386 --> 01:02:53,888
coaching. Giving opinion and advice.

1133
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,524
what up?

1134
01:02:56,526 --> 01:03:02,463
oh, uh-oh.

1135
01:03:02,465 --> 01:03:04,365
he has a really, really beautiful tone.

1136
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:06,367
Okay. Can he go up? Can he go down?

1137
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:08,435
Does it get melodic at some point?

1138
01:03:08,437 --> 01:03:10,304
well, that's-- if he doesn't do--

1139
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:12,540
how are you doing?

1140
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,109
yeah, I'm--it hasn't sunk

1141
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:17,912
it's beginning to sink in.

1142
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:21,048
I've been working really hard at the singer/songwriter

1143
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:25,419
Career for a long time. And to be able to do this and

1144
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:30,291
Move up to the next part is unbelievable and really, really

1145
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:31,825
we'll see you in hollywood,

1146
01:03:31,827 --> 01:03:33,160
David. Congratulations.

1147
01:03:33,162 --> 01:03:34,495
thank you very much.

1148
01:03:34,497 --> 01:03:36,130
nice to meet you.

1149
01:03:36,132 --> 01:03:38,532
I'd be interested to see if

1150
01:03:38,534 --> 01:03:40,467
He gets kicked out of his lane and starts getting tempted--

1151
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:43,037
yeah, but in a bad way.

1152
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,672
Like, I--he's like, "Man, that ain't working."

1153
01:03:50,746 --> 01:03:52,880
Like, whoo!

1154
01:03:52,882 --> 01:03:56,517
I'm leaving. I am leaving.

1155
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:59,453
really--it was really good.

1156
01:03:59,455 --> 01:04:00,854
hi.

1157
01:04:00,856 --> 01:04:02,189
how are you doing? Good timing.

1158
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:03,824
twins?

1159
01:04:03,826 --> 01:04:05,693
yes!

1160
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:09,296
Special place in my heart for twinnies.

1161
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:12,166
and I'm sierra moreno.

1162
01:04:12,168 --> 01:04:14,969
We're a dynamic duo. That's what we call ourselves.

1163
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:17,838
Singing is our lives, and we aren't really good at anything

1164
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,640
Else. So...

1165
01:04:19,642 --> 01:04:22,643
we're not. We are ready to get this thing

1166
01:04:22,645 --> 01:04:25,546
Together, get further than hollywood week.

1167
01:04:25,548 --> 01:04:28,115
let's just say someone needs to call the ambulance because

1168
01:04:28,117 --> 01:04:32,119
who's gonna go first?

1169
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:33,587
me?

1170
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:36,056
okay. All right.

1171
01:04:36,058 --> 01:04:37,791
this is selena, and that's sierra.

1172
01:04:37,793 --> 01:04:39,360
I'm gonna be singing try by

1173
01:04:39,362 --> 01:04:41,262
okay, go.

1174
01:05:13,262 --> 01:05:15,863
okay.

1175
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:18,265
Let's have you sing, and then we'll come back and do it all

1176
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:22,436
come on up, sierra.

1177
01:05:22,438 --> 01:05:24,605
it's so hard to do this in front of you.

1178
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:26,640
gosh dang it.

1179
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:26,867
okay. Come on over. Come on up, selena.

1180
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:30,270
nervous?

1181
01:06:30,272 --> 01:06:31,939
Good face. Can you tell? I mean...

1182
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:36,677
When you first went, selena,

1183
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:39,813
You have kind of the feel for

1184
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:41,081
Being onstage.

1185
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:44,151
But that felt a little forced. It didn't feel free.

1186
01:06:44,153 --> 01:06:47,287
When you sang I felt, "Oh, wow." I actually liked it a little bit

1187
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:50,324
Better. But again the nerves were so in

1188
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:53,026
Control that you guys did a good job.

1189
01:06:53,028 --> 01:06:56,864
I would say a good job, a decent job, but it just didn't flow.

1190
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:58,966
selena, when you sang, I thought your voice was rlly

1191
01:06:58,968 --> 01:07:00,401
Good. I think you're a really good

1192
01:07:00,403 --> 01:07:03,337
Singer. But then, sierra, when you sang,

1193
01:07:03,339 --> 01:07:06,006
I thought your voice was good. It didn't hit me in the same way

1194
01:07:06,008 --> 01:07:08,709
That selena's voice hit me, but you have more of a kind of

1195
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:11,278
Outgoing star power about you. You know, and there's so many

1196
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,514
Things that make up grabbing someone's attention.

1197
01:07:13,516 --> 01:07:15,716
Yours does it--did it vocally, and your does it

1198
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:18,719
Performance-wise for me. People ask me sometimes, "Is

1199
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:20,521
It hard being a judge on american idol?"

1200
01:07:20,523 --> 01:07:22,756
And the answer is, "No," Because every contestant that walks

1201
01:07:22,758 --> 01:07:27,094
Through the door is prepared for a judgment.

1202
01:07:27,096 --> 01:07:29,496
yeah. I also probably--even more

1203
01:07:29,498 --> 01:07:32,533
Than I know music, understand the dynamics of sisters in a

1204
01:07:32,535 --> 01:07:35,502
Household 'cause of my three daughters, which is why I'm

1205
01:07:35,504 --> 01:07:38,305
Gonna say this like this. One of you is clearly the better

1206
01:07:38,307 --> 01:07:42,342
Singer. As a set, you won't make it.

1207
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:45,245
Individually, there's a decision that's gonna have to be made,

1208
01:07:45,247 --> 01:07:46,947
And I have no problem making that decision.

1209
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:48,649
But it's probably gonna be harder on you.

1210
01:07:58,985 --> 01:08:00,074
I think you did yourselves a

1211
01:08:00,478 --> 01:08:01,477
Disservice by coming in

1212
01:08:01,479 --> 01:08:02,712
Together, which is why I'm gonna

1213
01:08:02,714 --> 01:08:03,679
Put this like this.

1214
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:06,816
One of you has a better chance than the other.

1215
01:08:06,818 --> 01:08:08,985
yeah, so we're gonna separate you first.

1216
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:11,654
let's start with selena,

1217
01:08:11,656 --> 01:08:13,956
yeah.

1218
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:17,893
I'm gonna say yes to selena.

1219
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:19,695
I'm gonna say yes to selena too.

1220
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:22,865
I'm gonna say yes to sierra too.

1221
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:24,567
I gotta say no to sierra.

1222
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:28,004
this is what makes the job

1223
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:30,473
mm-hmm.

1224
01:08:30,475 --> 01:08:32,141
they are twins.

1225
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:35,478
I'm looking at you as two young women who came in and made a

1226
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,548
Very distinctive decision. I think it was the wrong

1227
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:44,587
okay.

1228
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:50,092
this is for you, sweetie.

1229
01:08:50,094 --> 01:08:54,397
sierra.

1230
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,766
you're welcome.

1231
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:58,200
I know it was probably a hard decision for you.

1232
01:08:58,202 --> 01:09:00,002
thank you for coming.

1233
01:09:00,004 --> 01:09:01,837
you don't like me.

1234
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,040
ah, that's not true. That's not true.

1235
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:05,908
no, baby. I like you.

1236
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:07,310
thank you.

1237
01:09:07,312 --> 01:09:10,613
Thank you for coming, both of you.

1238
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,550
she started crying for her sister before--

1239
01:09:14,552 --> 01:09:16,252
she knew that she was--she

1240
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:17,787
did you see the way they were

1241
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:19,488
uh-huh.

1242
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:23,326
selena, when she was singing, sierra was looking at her like,

1243
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,528
mm-hmm.

1244
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:30,866
when selena was watching sierra, she was ice.

1245
01:09:30,868 --> 01:09:33,269
She knows. They know.

1246
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:47,817
you always gotta be prepared for it.

1247
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,220
There's two of us, so there's always a chance of one going on

1248
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:52,855
I wasn't--

1249
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:58,361
I'm just so happy for you. You rocked it.

1250
01:09:58,363 --> 01:10:00,696
I can't--I don't think I'm gonna stop crying for a while.

1251
01:10:00,698 --> 01:10:06,602
so sierra will have to wait and watch from the wings.

1252
01:10:06,604 --> 01:10:10,206
And many of the contestants are sharing the same pain.

1253
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:12,174
is there any way I can just

1254
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:14,043
I appreciate that, brother.

1255
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:17,646
aww, baby.

1256
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:19,415
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

1257
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,784
they entered the chamber with such promise.

1258
01:10:21,786 --> 01:10:23,886
oh, I'm gonna do this. Yes.

1259
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:26,055
but not every dream can come true.

1260
01:10:26,057 --> 01:10:28,824
you're just not quite ready. So it's gonna be a no.

1261
01:10:28,826 --> 01:10:31,460
it's okay.

1262
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:33,028
aw, not the face we wanted to see.

1263
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:36,098
The chamber can become a gateway to heartbreak.

1264
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,202
but it can also serve as a

1265
01:10:40,204 --> 01:10:43,172
Portal to superstardom.

1266
01:10:43,174 --> 01:10:52,014
my name is briana oakley. I am 17 years old, and I am a

1267
01:10:52,016 --> 01:10:55,217
I auditioned last year, season

1268
01:10:55,219 --> 01:10:56,218
12.

1269
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,589
your light, your cool hair, it was just--it all works for

1270
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:03,225
I made it to hollywood week,

1271
01:11:03,227 --> 01:11:06,128
But I got sent home. And I was crushed.

1272
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:09,765
But I made the decision to come back this year the minute that I

1273
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:12,468
Got cut last year. I'm not gonna give up.

1274
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,704
I'm relentless.

1275
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:20,009
hi.

1276
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,343
I know you.

1277
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:23,345
yes. I was here last season.

1278
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:25,247
you said I have...

1279
01:11:27,585 --> 01:11:30,019
I said you had cool hair. Can you tell those two your

1280
01:11:30,021 --> 01:11:32,888
my name is briana oakley.

1281
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,191
what did you take away from last season?

1282
01:11:35,193 --> 01:11:37,893
when I didn't make it last year, I was--

1283
01:11:37,895 --> 01:11:41,397
I was pretty devastated. I'm not gonna lie.

1284
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:43,966
But, I mean, I learned from that experience that I want this even

1285
01:11:43,968 --> 01:11:46,402
More. So it's why I'm back.

1286
01:11:46,404 --> 01:11:48,637
I'm gonna sing stay by sara

1287
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:50,806
okay.

1288
01:12:17,268 --> 01:12:19,468
17.

1289
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,704
jordin sparks.

1290
01:12:21,706 --> 01:12:23,772
mm-hmm.

1291
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:43,926
I could keep you singing, but it would just be for my own

1292
01:12:43,928 --> 01:12:45,327
but why? Right.

1293
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:46,962
simple as that. Beautiful, baby.

1294
01:12:46,964 --> 01:12:48,931
you remind me of jordin

1295
01:12:48,933 --> 01:12:52,167
Sparks a little bit, so young and so powerful.

1296
01:12:52,169 --> 01:12:54,103
really great.

1297
01:12:54,105 --> 01:12:55,504
you know what I really liked

1298
01:12:55,506 --> 01:12:57,473
About that? You are proud to sing, because

1299
01:12:57,475 --> 01:12:59,041
yeah.

1300
01:12:59,043 --> 01:13:00,442
yeah.

1301
01:13:00,444 --> 01:13:01,911
there's nothing wrong with the other styles.

1302
01:13:01,913 --> 01:13:03,379
It's just nice to hear somebody say--

1303
01:13:03,381 --> 01:13:04,880
yeah, and I gotta say, I

1304
01:13:04,882 --> 01:13:06,515
thank you.

1305
01:13:08,185 --> 01:13:09,518
oh, my god, thank you!

1306
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,020
nice job.

1307
01:13:11,022 --> 01:13:12,655
absolutely.

1308
01:13:12,657 --> 01:13:14,223
it's so nice to meet you all.

1309
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:16,392
great, briana.

1310
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:17,893
thank you so much! Aah!

1311
01:13:17,895 --> 01:13:19,995
oh, my gosh, thank you so

1312
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:23,132
Much. Oh, my god, aah!

1313
01:13:23,134 --> 01:13:25,668
I can't wait!

1314
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,036
"Oh, my god, oh, my god,

1315
01:13:27,038 --> 01:13:28,504
she sang well.

1316
01:13:28,506 --> 01:13:30,005
really well.

1317
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:33,342
yeah, I remember her.

1318
01:13:33,344 --> 01:13:38,180
I'm going to hollywood! Whoo!

1319
01:14:36,353 --> 01:14:39,287
okay, stop. You're a good singer.

1320
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:41,223
I'm gonna say yes.

1321
01:14:41,225 --> 01:14:42,958
I'm gonna say you're going to

1322
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,392
you're going to hollywood,

1323
01:14:44,394 --> 01:14:48,797
Baby!

1324
01:14:48,799 --> 01:14:50,565
and he comes out with a ticket.

1325
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:54,302
I'm going to hollywood!

1326
01:14:54,304 --> 01:14:57,873
let's get it.

1327
01:14:57,875 --> 01:15:01,443
so the dreams of these two music makers have come true.

1328
01:15:01,445 --> 01:15:04,512
But would this california gold rush continue?

1329
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:08,049
I love entertaining. I love being in front of people.

1330
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:10,785
I am highly confident that I will walk out with a golden

1331
01:15:10,787 --> 01:15:15,523
Ticket today.

1332
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:17,592
My nickname is "Daddy guns," By the way.

1333
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:19,461
whoa.

1334
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:21,463
you wanna attack me?

1335
01:15:21,465 --> 01:15:23,865
I mean, you wanna throw down? I'll throw down with you, man.

1336
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:25,367
Seriously, I'll throw down with you.

1337
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:27,602
yay, he's a lover!

1338
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:29,537
that timing was amazing.

1339
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:31,206
the skin on this guy is like--

1340
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:32,674
wow, look at that.

1341
01:15:32,676 --> 01:15:34,609
I look like that.

1342
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:36,044
I just didn't wear that shirt. I coulda done it.

1343
01:15:36,046 --> 01:15:37,779
I'm amazing.

1344
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:39,514
yeah, you're so freaking

1345
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:41,182
very firm.

1346
01:15:41,184 --> 01:15:42,517
I work on it. I do my best.

1347
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:44,286
yeah. What do you do? You swing the kettle bells?

1348
01:15:44,288 --> 01:15:45,720
think he swings the liberty

1349
01:15:45,722 --> 01:15:47,155
shouli gi all my secrets

1350
01:15:47,157 --> 01:15:48,757
Out on tv? I eat right for the most part.

1351
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:51,293
I do a lot of low-weight, high reps, and then I mix it up

1352
01:15:51,295 --> 01:15:53,061
do you sing?

1353
01:15:53,063 --> 01:15:55,397
I sing, yeah, I do.

1354
01:15:55,399 --> 01:15:56,898
let's go?

1355
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:01,403
all right.

1356
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:33,301
sorry, gaddy.

1357
01:16:33,303 --> 01:16:36,404
um, you're a really sweet

1358
01:16:36,406 --> 01:16:39,007
I can do it some more.

1359
01:16:39,009 --> 01:16:40,342
no, no, no.

1360
01:16:40,344 --> 01:16:43,044
I-I-it's--

1361
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:44,846
It's--

1362
01:16:44,848 --> 01:16:47,248
it's a no for me, baby.

1363
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,683
me too.

1364
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:50,085
Thank you for coming in, though, man.

1365
01:16:50,087 --> 01:16:51,419
thank you so much.

1366
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:57,659
oh, my god.

1367
01:16:57,661 --> 01:16:59,027
I was a little bit too nervous.

1368
01:16:59,029 --> 01:17:00,528
you think that's what it was?

1369
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:02,130
yeah, I think that's what it was.

1370
01:17:02,132 --> 01:17:04,666
I was just like, looking at the two of you just to see your

1371
01:17:04,668 --> 01:17:07,168
I've never heard a sound like

1372
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,471
That, much less a voice. Just a sound that when--

1373
01:17:09,473 --> 01:17:11,172
yeah, it was even--

1374
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:33,228
My name is adam roth. I'm from sacramento, california.

1375
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:36,998
I'm 28 years old, and I am a sound healer.

1376
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,270
I do sound healing for a living. Well, music is the universal

1377
01:17:42,272 --> 01:17:45,407
Language of love and light and of everything.

1378
01:17:45,409 --> 01:17:48,176
It's the most powerful thing there is.

1379
01:17:48,178 --> 01:17:50,645
It's actually healing us from the inside out.

1380
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:53,748
what does that mean, sound? Like, music therapy kinda, or--

1381
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,183
you know about the chakra systems?

1382
01:17:55,185 --> 01:17:56,651
a little bit, not too much.

1383
01:17:56,653 --> 01:17:58,953
well, energy systems in our body that correlate with how

1384
01:17:58,955 --> 01:18:02,057
Our--we feel emotionally and our drive and whatnot, there's ways

1385
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:05,427
To send frequencies to those individually to line them up and

1386
01:18:05,429 --> 01:18:07,529
To get us feeling balanced and feeling peaceful.

1387
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:10,131
he's doing it right now.

1388
01:18:10,133 --> 01:18:12,000
doing it--I believe that music is intentional.

1389
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:14,869
oh, that was the wrong

1390
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:17,038
oh, sorry.

1391
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,873
dude, you just put me to

1392
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:20,275
Sleep. I just felt so at peace for--

1393
01:18:20,277 --> 01:18:22,644
I felt like I died or something. Really, I went to heaven up in

1394
01:18:22,646 --> 01:18:24,045
my man.

1395
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:25,747
yeah. I saw my family and stuff.

1396
01:18:25,749 --> 01:18:27,816
whoo!

1397
01:18:27,818 --> 01:18:31,286
okay.

1398
01:18:31,288 --> 01:18:33,021
My dear, my love, what are you gonna sing?

1399
01:18:33,023 --> 01:18:35,857
I'm gonna sing hallelujah by cohen or buckley, however you

1400
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:39,494
okay.

1401
01:19:35,919 --> 01:19:37,352
thank you.

1402
01:19:37,354 --> 01:19:40,155
I feel guilty and unclean. Like I need to go to confession

1403
01:19:40,157 --> 01:19:41,489
you do.

1404
01:19:41,491 --> 01:19:44,325
it was a strange performance

1405
01:19:44,327 --> 01:19:47,462
'cause you've got an interesting voice, but, like, your usage of

1406
01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:50,365
It was, like, so schizophrenic that I'm baffled.

1407
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:52,367
yeah, I know what he meant,

1408
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:54,903
That your voice is really beautiful, and you use it really

1409
01:19:54,905 --> 01:19:59,340
Well, but it--there was something to me that felt like,

1410
01:19:59,342 --> 01:20:01,276
"Is he forcing this? Is this fake?"

1411
01:20:01,278 --> 01:20:02,977
I feel ya.

1412
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:06,214
I think what I'm doing is I'm trying really hard 'cause this

1413
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:08,883
right. We should vote.

1414
01:20:11,988 --> 01:20:18,693
I am going to say... Yes.

1415
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:21,863
he just called you "My man."

1416
01:20:21,865 --> 01:20:23,464
just to crank it up.

1417
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:25,533
again, the power of god.

1418
01:20:25,535 --> 01:20:27,902
just lay the sound therapy

1419
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,871
Trip on him. You'll break him down.

1420
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:43,985
yes!

1421
01:20:43,987 --> 01:20:45,887
Thank you so much! Thank you so much!

1424
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:56,231
I love you.

1425
01:20:56,233 --> 01:20:57,665
"Of course I'm going to hollywood.

1426
01:20:57,667 --> 01:21:01,803
do not listen to one word he

1427
01:21:01,805 --> 01:21:03,204
Says. He's a--

1428
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,872
good luck. Thanks, man.

1429
01:21:04,874 --> 01:21:06,341
thank you very much. Thank you, guys.

1430
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:07,742
you're welcome.

1431
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:10,111
Oh, my god. That was hilarious.

1432
01:21:10,113 --> 01:21:11,713
I think I know what you mean by something that was a bit

1433
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:14,549
what's that?

1434
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:17,118
my man.

1435
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,720
how are you?

1436
01:21:18,722 --> 01:21:21,155
congratulations.

1437
01:21:21,157 --> 01:21:22,790
I'm stoked. I've been--I've been calm all

1438
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,726
Day, and now it's time to let it out.

1439
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:26,694
whoo, I'm going to hollywood.

1440
01:21:26,696 --> 01:21:28,963
there's another side of you.

1441
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:32,200
keith, just give me a beat, and give me the yes.

1442
01:21:32,202 --> 01:21:34,502
Please. I will do anything I can.

1443
01:21:37,907 --> 01:21:40,675
Thank you so much. Oh, my god.

1444
01:21:40,677 --> 01:21:44,012
that was an intense--that was

1445
01:21:44,014 --> 01:21:47,682

1446
01:21:47,684 --> 01:21:50,084

1447
01:21:50,086 --> 01:21:51,753
was it?

1448
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:57,659
yeah, it was a good day.

1449
01:21:57,661 --> 01:21:59,193
we don't have a lot of these

1450
01:21:59,195 --> 01:22:01,429
Left, so that's always a good sign.

1451
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:05,733
did we find some stars here

1452
01:22:05,735 --> 01:22:07,335

1453
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:09,437
I mean, the people that were good, they were great.
