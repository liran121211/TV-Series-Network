?Your eyes ?Maybe one day ?You'll understand why

00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:19,892
For some, it was an

00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,961
For some, it was an opportunity to cap off a solid

101
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:22,772
For some, it was an opportunity

102
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:23,896
to cap off a solid week of performances and

103
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:24,409
Opportunity to cap off a solid

I like that.

112
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:34,006
But for others, yesterday's

113
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:35,508
But for others, yesterday's time in the spotlight proved

114
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,403
But for others, yesterday's time

115
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:37,743
in the spotlight proved just too much to handle.

116
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:41,814

But the judges will consider not only yesterday's

122
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,664
But the judges will consider

123
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:50,690

Not only yesterday's performance,

125
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,392
but their entire idol journey to date in

126
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:53,067
Performance, but their entire idol

127
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,059
journey to date in determining who moves on to the

128
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:54,963
Idol journey to date in determining

129
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:56,228
who moves on to the live stage and who will watch

130
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,968
Determining who moves on to the live

131
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,097
stage and who will watch from home wondering what could

132
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:58,449
Live stage and who will

133
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,165
watch from home wondering what could have been.

134
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,215
From home wondering what could have been.

135
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:01,033
Our contestants will have to sit

Room, waiting for their name to be called.

When they hear their name,

00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,091
Be called. When they hear their name,

145
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:08,808
they'll walk through this door

146
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,467
When they hear their name,

147
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,010
they'll walk through this door and board the elevator to head

00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:11,416
They'll walk through this

00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,145
door and board the elevator to head upstairs.

150
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:12,842
And board the elevator to head upstairs.

151
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:13,346
With so much on the line, you

152
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:14,333
Upstairs. With so much on the line,

153
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:15,348
you can only imagine the pressure as

154
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,046
With so much on the line, you can

155
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:17,249
only imagine the pressure as they wait for these doors to

156
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:18,526
Can only imagine the pressure as they

157
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,320
wait for these doors to open, and when they do, it's

158
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:21,212
They wait for these doors to open,

159
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:22,522
and when they do, it's time to take that long walk

160
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:23,369
Open, and when they do, it's time

161
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,624
to take that long walk towards our judges--keith,

162
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:25,497
Time to take that long walk towards

163
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,693
our judges--keith, jennifer, and harry--who have

164
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,324
Towards our judges--keith, jennifer,

and harry--who have had the difficult job of

166
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:28,652
Jennifer, and harry--who have

167
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:29,595
had the difficult job of narrowing down this very

168
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:30,258
Had the difficult job of

169
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,664
narrowing down this very talented group of singers.

170
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,198
Narrowing down this very talented group of singers.

171
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,100
Once each of them arrive here,

172
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:34,648
Talented group of singers. Once

173
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:35,601
each of them arrive here, they'll sit in the chair for

174
00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:36,911
Once each of them arrive here,

00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:39,572
they'll sit in the chair for what will be the final judgment.

176
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm very nervous at the

177
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,608
Moment.

178
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,646

Oh, my god. Are your eyes blue? Green?

Are your eyes blue? Green? Green, mix of brown,

Green? Green, mix of brown, something.

Something. You're a pretty guy. So that's a yes from jen.

You're a pretty guy. So that's a yes from jen.

So that's a yes from jen. And a no from me and keith.

368
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,142
And a no from me and keith. Well, spencer definitely has

369
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:44,710
Well, spencer definitely has the look, but does he have the

370
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:45,329
Well, spencer definitely has the look,

371
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,078
but does he have the talent to take him to the

372
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,947
The look, but does he have the talent to take him to the top 30?

373
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:48,915
Talent to take him to the top 30? How you doing, spencer?

374
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:49,882
Top 30? How you doing, spencer? I'm doing pretty good.

375
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:51,617
How you doing, spencer? I'm doing pretty good. Take a seat, man.

376
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:52,952
I'm doing pretty good. Take a seat, man. Yes, sir.

00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:54,420
Take a seat, man. Yes, sir. How you feeling?

378
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,422
Yes, sir. How you feeling? A little nervous, you know.

379

How you feeling? A little nervous, you know. Okay, spencer, so...

380
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:00,026
A little nervous, you know.

381
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:00,460
Okay, spencer, so... when you started off in

382
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:00,895
Okay, spencer, so... when

383
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:01,694
you started off in hollywood week, for me, you

384
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:02,051
When you started off in hollywood week,

385
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:02,362
for me, you were, like, one of the

386
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:02,995
Hollywood week, for me, you were, like, one of the front-runners.

387
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:03,963
Were, like, one of the front-runners. I was like, "Wow."

388
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,965
Front-runners. I was like, "Wow." When I saw you sit at the piano

389
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:06,758
I was like, "Wow." When I saw you

390
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,933
sit at the piano and sing that song super simple,

391
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,000
When I saw you sit at the piano and

392
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,736
sing that song super simple, I felt like, "Okay, this guy

393
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:11,177
And sing that song super simple,

394
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:11,837
I felt like, "Okay, this guy really stands out."

395
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:17,577
?And I

396
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:23,048
?Am feeling so small

397
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,100
?It was over my head ?And

398
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:31,591
I know nothing at all yesterday, in the final

399
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:32,394
?And I know nothing at all yesterday,

400
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,325
in the final performance round, spencer did

401
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:34,056
Yesterday, in the final performance round,

402
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:34,560
spencer did an original song.

403
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,310
Performance round, spencer did an original song.

404
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:35,762
It didn't quite have the same

405
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:36,452
An original song. It didn't

406
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,497
quite have the same impact on the judges.

407
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:38,431
?Don't me wrong

408
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,766
?Makeup can go a long way

409
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,900
?And some cute clothes

410
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:43,335
?Help you get through the day

411
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:44,704
?Make sure your nails

412
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:45,671
?Are filed

413
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:47,073
?And go ahead and polish

414
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,208
?That beautiful smile

415
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,175
?All I'm saying is

416
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:51,611
?Just be yourself

417
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:55,748
?And don't get caught up ?In everybody else ?Just be you

418
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,450
?In everybody else ?Just be you ?And make that your goal

419
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:59,284
?Just be you ?And make that your goal ?'cause who you are

420
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:03,288
?And make that your goal ?'cause who you are ?Is beautifu-u-ul

421
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,615
?'cause who you are ?Is

422
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,223
beautifu-u-ul even though it showed us that

423
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:04,950
?Is beautifu-u-ul even though

424
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,125
it showed us that you wrote and--obviously, you

425
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:06,776
Even though it showed us that you

426
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:07,860
wrote and--obviously, you play guitar and piano, all of

427
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:08,192
You wrote and--obviously, you

428
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:08,761
play guitar and piano, all of that stuff was good.

429
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:09,646
Play guitar and piano, all of that stuff was good.

430
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:10,195
We all--we take everything into

431
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:10,803
That stuff was good.

432
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:12,198
We all--we take everything into consideration.

433
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,229
We all--we take everything into consideration.

434
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,833
The song itself wasn't, you

435
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:14,366
Consideration. The song itself wasn't,

436
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:14,800
you know, something that really

437
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:15,687
The song itself wasn't, you know,

438
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,136
something that really showcased you in the best way, I

439
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:17,968
Know, something that really showcased

440
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:19,204
you in the best way, I thought, and so did keith and...

441
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:19,679
Showcased you in the best way,

442
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,373
I thought, and so did keith and... we agree.

443
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,207
Thought, and so did keith and... we agree. And harry on that.

444
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:23,576
We agree. And harry on that. So when we were coming down to

445
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:24,091
And harry on that. So when we

446
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:24,977
were coming down to it, it became a really, really

447
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:26,699
So when we were coming down to it, it became a really,

448
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,847
really tough decision, as much as we

449
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:28,493
It, it became a really,

450
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,782
really tough decision, as much as we love you.

451
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:33,626
Tough decision, as much as we love you.

452
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:36,188
And we've made a decision.

453
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:46,826
Okay, spencer, so when you

454
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,894
Sang your original song,

455
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:49,862
Honestly, I think it worked

456
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,463
Against you.

457
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:55,027
So when we were coming down to it, it became a really,

458
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:57,403
really tough decision, as much as we

459
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,106
It, it became a really,

460
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:02,508
really tough decision, as much as we love you.

461
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,648
Yes, we do.

462
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,549
Yes, we do. Yes, we do, spencer.

463
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:11,750
You showed us some star

464
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,352
You showed us some star quality, and we would be honored

465
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:13,662
You showed us some star quality,

466
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:14,019
and we would be honored if you would.

467
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:14,787
Thank you.

468
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,855
So we have the first of our

469
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:18,891
So we have the first of our top 15 guys.

Thank you, guys.

471
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:22,127
You're welcome.

472
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,664
It's a big challenge and

473
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,565
It's a big challenge and there's a lot of talented

474
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,460
It's a big challenge and there's

475
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,800
a lot of talented musicians here, and I'm really

476
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:29,468
There's a lot of talented musicians here,

477
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:30,201
and I'm really hoping that, you know, I could

478
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:30,736
Musicians here, and I'm really hoping that,

479
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:31,270
you know, I could go a long ways with this.

480
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:33,872
We'll see how it goes.

481
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:34,973
Next to take the ride

482
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,943
Next to take the ride upstairs, jillian jensen.

00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:39,911
Upstairs, jillian jensen. Jillian.

485
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,580
Yesterday, jillian chose as her

486
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:43,148
Final performance piece an

487
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,451
Original song, a risky but

488
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:46,952
Calculated decision.

489
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,865
The reason I decided to do this song today was,

490
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,157
I guess, because I wanted to show you

491
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,171
This song today was, I guess,

492
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,126
because I wanted to show you guys exactly who I am as an

493
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:55,678
Because I wanted to show you guys

494
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,595
exactly who I am as an artist, 'cause I think the point

00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:57,663
'cause I think the point of american idol isn't just to

00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:58,291
Artist, 'cause I think the point of

00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,365
american idol isn't just to find someone as a winner of this

499
00:11:59,367 --> 00:11:59,635
Of american idol isn't

500
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,198
just to find someone as a winner of this year.

501
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,994
Find someone as a winner of this year.

502
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:01,600
It's supposed to find someone

00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:02,143

Hanging in there? Hanging in there,

00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:57,361
yeah. I have to say, this was the

933
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:58,475
Hanging in there, yeah. I have to say,

934
00:22:58,476 --> 00:22:59,530
this was the most intense week ever.

935
00:22:59,532 --> 00:22:59,971
I have to say, this was the most

936
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:00,631
intense week ever. And I think it was because we

937
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,718
Most intense week ever. And I

938
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,701
think it was because we had so many great people, you

939
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:04,535
And I think it was because we had so many great people, you know?

940
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:06,070
Had so many great people, you know? At the end of the day, we're

941
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:08,272
Know? At the end of the day, we're really looking for--and the

942
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:08,877
At the end of the day, we're really

943
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:09,774
looking for--and the difficult task for us, I think,

944
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:10,628
Really looking for--and the difficult task for us,

945
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:11,276
I think, was kind of honing it down to

946
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,142
Difficult task for us, I think,

947
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:13,677
was kind of honing it down to who is the american idol?

948
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,319
Was kind of honing it down to

949
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,446
who is the american idol? Who could be that person?

950
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:15,992
Who is the american idol?

951
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:17,148
Who could be that person? Who has that whole package?

952
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,816
Who could be that person? Who has that whole package? You know?

953
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:20,433
Who has that whole package?

954
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:22,887
You know? And so at the end of the day...

955
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:23,431
You know? And so at the end of the day...

956
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:23,788
we really believe that that

957
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,134
And so at the end of the day...

958
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:24,589

The talent is just so great this year,

00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:54,479
it's just--they can't pick everybody, you know?

1027
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:56,222
This year, it's just--they can't pick everybody,

you know? Can't pick everybody.

1029
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,493
Pick everybody, you know? Can't pick everybody.

No from us, but you know, talent and

That's why it's been so hard for us, you know?

1324

Thank you, guys. If you guys could give us a chance to talk...

1734
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,390
If you guys could give us a chance to talk...

1735
00:43:25,391 --> 00:43:26,441
you talk about stress.

1736
00:43:26,443 --> 00:43:28,744
Chance to talk... you talk about stress. My first reaction was--

1737
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:30,011
You talk about stress. My first reaction was-- they can hear.

1738
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:30,912
My first reaction was-- they can hear. But I was still

1739
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:32,715
They can hear. But I was still more interested in some weird

1740
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:33,915
But I was still more interested in some weird way in jessica.

1741
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,016
More interested in some weird way in jessica. Yeah.

1742
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:36,452
Way in jessica. Yeah. I disagree.

1743
00:43:36,454 --> 00:43:37,486
Yeah. I disagree. I think the other one proved

1744
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:38,051
I disagree. I think the

1745
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,154
other one proved that she's better right now.

1746
00:43:39,156 --> 00:43:46,128
Oh!

1747
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:52,402
You sounded good. What are your thoughts?

1748
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:56,839
Um...jessica's got a slightly

1749
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:57,125
What are your thoughts?

1750
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:57,706
Um...jessica's got a slightly broader spectrum.

1751
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:58,574
Um...jessica's got a slightly broader spectrum. Diversity, yeah.

1752
00:43:58,576 --> 00:43:59,441
Broader spectrum. Diversity, yeah. Agreed.

1753
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:02,411
Diversity, yeah. Agreed. But jesse is compelling.

1754
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:06,782
By just a little bit. It's just so... yeah.

1755
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:07,616
It's just so... yeah. 'cause they're so--

1756
00:44:07,618 --> 00:44:08,917
Yeah. 'cause they're so-- infinitesimally small, narrow

1757
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:09,585
'cause they're so-- infinitesimally small, narrow margin.

1758
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:17,326
Guys, you can come back.

1759
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:24,132
We're doing the right thing, yes? I think somehow we have to

1760
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:26,202
Yes? I think somehow we have to make a decision.

1761
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:29,172
I think somehow we have to make a decision.

1762
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:31,106
So...there's so many things.

1763
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:31,765
Make a decision. So...there's so many things.

1764
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:32,174
This is the hardest decision

1765
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:32,650
So...there's so many things. This

1766
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:33,442

I've always wanted it

1804
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:30,499
equally and it just hurts a little bit to...

1805

And it just hurts a little bit to...

1806
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:34,202
To... feel defeated.

I don't know how else we could have decided.

Could have decided. But you know, it's about moments.

Mm-hmm. There's a lot of people who I went to school with who are

I'll be devastated, but at least I made it this far, and

2073
00:50:57,728 --> 00:50:58,129

you know what I mean, it's because there's so many

2088
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:11,618
So hard, you know what I mean, it's

2089
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:13,342
because there's so many people who sing so great and who

2090
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:14,140
It's because there's so many people who

2091
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:15,244
sing so great and who have the same dream that you do.

2092
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:16,177
Mm-hmm.

2144
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:35,214
How's the room feeling

2145
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:36,382
How's the room feeling downstairs?

2146
00:52:36,384 --> 00:52:37,584
It's sad to see your friends

2147
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:38,250
It's sad to see your friends go.

2148
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:38,918
Yeah.

2149
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,820
Made such a family over the

2150
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:41,988
Made such a family over the past couple days.

2151
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,322
You know when there's intense

2152
00:52:43,324 --> 00:52:44,390
You know when there's intense experiences like that, it's

2153
00:52:44,392 --> 00:52:44,940
You know when there's intense

2154
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:45,925
experiences like that, it's like--it joins everybody

2155
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:46,426
Experiences like that, it's like--it joins everybody together.

2156
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:47,326
Like--it joins everybody together. It's like, "We're in this

2157
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:47,860
Together. It's like, "We're in this together!"

2158
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:48,761
Especially in this business,

2159
00:52:48,763 --> 00:52:49,562
Especially in this business, because we're all artists...

2160
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:50,362
both: YEAH.

2161
00:52:50,364 --> 00:52:51,297
both: SO WE'RE ALL SO OPENLY

2162
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:53,199
So we're all so openly emotional all the time that it's

2163
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:54,028
So we're all so openly emotional all

2164
00:52:54,029 --> 00:52:55,201
the time that it's even more extreme, that bonding,

2165
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:55,448
Emotional all the time that

2166
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:55,868
it's even more extreme, that bonding, I think.

2167
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:56,536
Yeah, definitely.

2168
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:57,269
Yeah, definitely. It's hard to see people who

2169
00:52:57,271 --> 00:52:57,910
Yeah, definitely. It's hard

2170
00:52:57,911 --> 00:52:59,071
to see people who share the same love interest as

2171
00:52:59,073 --> 00:52:59,821
It's hard to see people who share the

2172
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:00,873
same love interest as you do be really sad about it.

2173
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,308
And everybody's so talented.

2174
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:02,876
Yeah, totally.

2175
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:03,743
So it's--you know, as

2176
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,578
So it's--you know, as difficult as it is for you to be

2177
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,051
So it's--you know, as difficult

2178
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:06,813
as it is for you to be like, "Oh, why this person?

2179
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:07,209
Difficult as it is for you to be like,

2180
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:07,614
"Oh, why this person? Why that person?"

2181
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:08,582
Like, "Oh, why this person? Why that person?"

2182
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:09,248
You know, it's just as hard for

2183
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:09,916
Why that person?" You know, it's just as hard for us, you know.

2184
00:53:09,918 --> 00:53:10,583
Yeah.

2185
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:11,117
We're, like, down there

2186
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,285
We're, like, down there looking at all your pictures and

2187
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:12,657
We're, like, down there looking

2188
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:13,219
at all your pictures and thinking about all the

2189
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:13,772
Looking at all your pictures and

2190
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,721
thinking about all the performances, and saying, "Okay,

2191
00:53:14,723 --> 00:53:15,322
Thinking about all the performances,

2192
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:16,088
and saying, "Okay, who really fits this mode?"

2193
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:16,756
Yeah.

2194
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:17,557
"Who belongs in here?"

2195
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,257
Yeah, totally.

2196
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:18,791
You know?

2197
00:53:18,793 --> 00:53:19,592
You know? "Who are the american idols

2198
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:20,259
You know? "Who are the american idols here?"

2199
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:20,927
"Who are the american idols here?" "Who could be?"

2200
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:21,594
Yeah.

2201
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:22,394
And that's what it comes down

2202
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:24,296
And that's what it comes down to.

2203
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:26,132
Like most others, mk had a

2204

Thanks, alex. I like that song. His song may have impressed

3020
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:00,585
I like that song. His song may

3021
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:01,764
have impressed the judges, but with the spots

3022
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:02,647
His song may have impressed the judges,

3023
01:15:02,648 --> 01:15:03,801
but with the spots dwindling, the question remains,

The judges, but with the spots dwindling,

3025
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:06,503
the question remains, is there room for alex preston?

3026
01:15:06,505 --> 01:15:06,843

3038
01:15:13,212 --> 01:15:13,822
People to start writing their own music,

01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:14,311

Own music, start pursuing their own dreams. How's it going?

3041
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,679
Own dreams. How's it going? Take a seat.

3042
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:17,881
How's it going? Take a seat. You're like linus with his

3043
01:15:17,883 --> 01:15:18,715
Take a seat. You're like linus with his security blanket.

3044
01:15:18,717 --> 01:15:19,382
You're like linus with his security blanket. Mm-hmm.

3045
01:15:19,384 --> 01:15:20,283
Security blanket. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

3046
01:15:20,285 --> 01:15:22,719
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I can relate.

3047
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:24,587
Yeah. I can relate. Let me ask you, did you think

3048
01:15:24,589 --> 01:15:25,500
I can relate. Let me ask you,

3049
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,789
did you think you would make it this far?

3050
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:27,851
Let me ask you, did you think you

3051
01:15:27,852 --> 01:15:29,426
would make it this far? Honestly, I didn't really

3052
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:29,823
You would make it this far? Honestly,

3053
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:30,327
I didn't really think I would make it this far,

3054
01:15:30,329 --> 01:15:30,839
Honestly, I didn't really think I

3055
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,628
would make it this far, because my style is so much

3056
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,192
Think I would make it this far,

3057
01:15:32,193 --> 01:15:33,263
because my style is so much different, and I didn't know if

3058
01:15:33,265 --> 01:15:34,561
Because my style is so much different,

3059
01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:36,233
and I didn't know if it would be taken to in this

3060
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:36,718
Different, and I didn't know if

3061
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:37,467
it would be taken to in this positive way, and--

3062
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:38,471
It would be taken to in this positive way,

3063
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:39,236
and-- you have an unusual thing.

3064
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:39,973
Positive way, and-- you have an unusual thing.

3065
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:40,437
It's not something that comes

3066
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:41,082
You have an unusual thing. It's not

3067
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,039
something that comes through idol all the time, your

3068
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:42,588
It's not something that comes through

3069
01:15:42,589 --> 01:15:43,373
idol all the time, your particular style, your way of

3070
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:44,544
Through idol all the time, your particular style,

3071
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:45,309
your way of playing and singing.

3072
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:46,204
Particular style, your way of playing and singing.

3073
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:46,776
That's why it's been so hard for

3074
01:15:46,778 --> 01:15:46,989
Playing and singing.

3075
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:47,477
That's why it's been so hard for us, you know?

3076
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:48,178
Mm-hmm.

3077
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,347
Hey, we need to decide on

3078
01:15:50,349 --> 01:15:52,249
Hey, we need to decide on this before board goes away.

3079
01:15:52,251 --> 01:15:53,583
I--for some reason, I lean

3080
01:15:53,585 --> 01:15:54,351
I--for some reason, I lean into a "Yes."

3081
01:15:54,353 --> 01:15:55,252
This is what I say.

3082
01:15:55,254 --> 01:15:56,719
Okay.

3083
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:57,888
We're gonna go back over all

3084
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:58,721
We're gonna go back over all these later, right?

3085
01:15:58,723 --> 01:15:59,857
We will, and we'll have our

3086
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:00,523
We will, and we'll have our notes on them.

3087
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:01,191
Yeah, right, okay.

3088
01:16:01,193 --> 01:16:01,959
Wherever there's a question

3089
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:02,760
Wherever there's a question mark, we'll discuss it a little

3090
01:16:02,762 --> 01:16:03,181
Wherever there's a question mark,

3091
01:16:03,182 --> 01:16:03,627
we'll discuss it a little bit more.

3092
01:16:03,629 --> 01:16:06,396
I'm glad that you've made it

3093
01:16:06,398 --> 01:16:11,068
I'm glad that you've made it this far, but we just can't take

I'm glad that you've made it this far,

3095
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:14,737
but we just can't take everybody.

3096

This opportunity means everything to me.

3135
01:16:57,749 --> 01:16:58,549
I would always watch the show

3136
01:16:58,551 --> 01:17:00,017
I would always watch the show and be like, "Oh, I could never

3137

I would always watch the show and be like,

My heart is like... the dreaded eliminations

3376
01:23:31,462 --> 01:23:32,762
The dreaded eliminations continue.

3377
01:23:32,764 --> 01:23:34,097
The dreaded eliminations continue. Do you belong in this

3378
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:35,164
Continue. Do you belong in this competition?

3379

Do you belong in this competition? Just really want to make my

3380
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:37,566

For cj and casey, it's down

3383
01:23:39,671 --> 01:23:40,770
Mom proud. For cj and casey, it's down to the wire.

3384
01:23:40,772 --> 01:23:41,476
For cj and casey, it's down to the wire.

3385
01:23:41,477 --> 01:23:41,970
One of you are going through

3386
01:23:41,972 --> 01:23:43,739
To the wire. One of you are going through and one of you are not.

3387
01:23:43,741 --> 01:23:44,402
One of you are going through and

3388
01:23:44,403 --> 01:23:45,374
one of you are not. We're making our way to the

3389
01:23:45,376 --> 01:23:47,810
And one of you are not. We're making our way to the idol top 30.

3390
01:23:47,812 --> 01:23:49,044
We're making our way to the idol there's so many talented

3391
01:23:49,046 --> 01:23:49,778
Idol there's so many talented girls here.

01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,114
I'm just, like, shaking.

3393
01:23:51,116 --> 01:23:52,248
It's crazy.

3394
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:53,149
You're the last girl in the

3395
01:23:53,151 --> 01:23:53,949
You're the last girl in the top 15.

3396
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:54,883
You're gonna make me cry.

3397
01:23:54,885 --> 01:23:55,984
I can't believe who we're

3398
01:23:55,986 --> 01:23:56,752
I can't believe who we're turning away.

3399
01:23:56,754 --> 01:23:57,520
I can't handle this.

3400
01:23:57,522 --> 01:23:58,254
We're in a real conundrum.
