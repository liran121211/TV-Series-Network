â™?I gave you all I had â™?And you tossed it

18
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,650
â™?In the trash â™?Tossed in the trash

19
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:33,187
â™?You did â™?To give me all your love

20
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:41,662
â™?Is all I ever asked â™?I'd catch a grenade for ya s

21
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:45,633
â™?I'd throw my hand â™?On a blade for ya

â™?I'd jump in front â™?Of a train for ya

23
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:52,873
Obrigado, você será 
um pesadelo para

24
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,543
os outros nesta competição.

25
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:58,245
Uau, sua voz tem um tom 
tão lindo com presença

26
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,414
É isso, realmente me surpreendeu.

27
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,017
Só não esperava isso 
vindo de você.

28
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,352
E realmente acredito que
tem uma grande voz.

29
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,388
Obrigada.

30
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,394
Pessoal, mas este é 1/3 deste 
ticket que posso lhe oferecer

31
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:16,197
Vou te dar o meu também.

32
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,766
Ei, ei, ei me faça um favor

33
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:20,401
Antes de ir embora, olhe pra camera

34
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,303
Gostaria que você diga

35
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:25,272
"Meu nome é Marrialle Sellars,
e pretendo ser a seguinte

36
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,475
American idol." eu queria 
ver você fazendo isso

37
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,544
Meu nome é Marrialle Sellars,

38
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:31,880
e pretendo ser a seguinte
American idol."

39
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,451
Isso!

40
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,551
E ela será a proxima 
American Idol?

41
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,651
ou vai ser um dos outros 75 mil candidatos?

42
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,651
Você que decide.

43
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,651
Decide a jornada 
de uma estrela agora.

44
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,433
Hoje é o dia finalmente que nos iremos 
para as audições do American Idol.

45
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:36,299
hello, we're here. Life could change today.

46
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:41,941
I'm hoping that I have

47
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:45,511
Success today.

48
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:49,515
today is the day.

49
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:55,031
this is me, having the best

50
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:58,868
Day of my life. We are now going outside to

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,537
Say hello to the contestants who are waiting to audition today in

52
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,373
Foxborough. Get 'em fired up.

53
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,641
estão prontos para deixarem suas casas 
para trás para ir pra Hollywood serem

54
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:10,541
as proximas superestrelas da musica, 
é pra isso que estão aqui?

55
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:18,875
Here we go!

56
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:22,897
it feels good. A little deja vu.

57
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,262
good to see you again. Back here.

58
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:30,067
man, I am fired up. How you doing, man?

59
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,502
really well. Good.

60
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,806
hey, guys. Hey.

61
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:42,222
It's so cool for me to be sitting with y'all because

62
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:44,524
You've done it. And as a viewer for so many

63
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:47,360
Years, to see the process, it's a completely different

64
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:48,871
Perspective. You really feel the lives of these people. Right.

65
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:51,763
I think you have an immense responsibility, in a way.

66
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:54,165
it's fun, but at the same time, it's serious about finding

67
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,368
Somebody great. Yeah, because it's their big

68
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,936
Moment too. This is, like, everything to

69
00:04:57,938 --> 00:04:59,304
Them. Yeah.

70
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:02,140
I don't know what kind of judge I'm gonna be, other than

71
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:05,744
To say that I have to be honest. To send somebody out of the room

72
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:09,047
Crying is a terrible feeling. But if it's the right thing to

73
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:12,117
Say, I think you have to say it. I really love it.

74
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,552
I really feel like there's a magic to what happens here,

75
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,622
Watching somebody's dream come true right before your eyes.

76
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:20,892
I mean, the best part is when we give somebody an opportunity

77
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:22,827
To get the break they're looking for.

78
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,430
We're all in greenish today. This is a good sign.

79
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,999
wow, wow. This is a good sign.

80
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,536
the auditions in boston start

81
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:34,906
Right now.

82
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:38,410
But who will get the first ticket of season 13?

83
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:41,279
my name is troy durden, and I'm from boston, massachusetts.

84
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:45,150
I'm really good. Like, I--if a 10 is the highest,

85
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:47,419
I'm 100. Most of the time I get, like,

86
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,521
Standing ovations, and people love it.

87
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,922
They feel it. You know what I'm saying?

88
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,457
It's not even just about the applause.

89
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,694
It's about them feeling the music.

90
00:05:55,696 --> 00:06:00,865
I got this golden ticket because I know that I got what it takes.

91
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:05,904
It's about fighting to the top. And that's it.

92
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,772
how you doing? Hello. How are you?

93
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:09,674
how are ya? I'm good.

94
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:11,042
where you from? I'm from boston.

95
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,577
I'm from here. What's your name?

96
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,479
my name is troy. Nice to meet you, troy.

97
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,814
hi, how are you? I'm good.

98
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,349
I love to twerk. Okay.

99
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,750
do you know how to twerk, j.Lo?

100
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,752
I'm not much of a twerker these days.

101
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,120
sure, you were doing it in the green room.

102
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:23,521
shut up. Would you mind twerking with

103
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:24,856
Me? I would like to see you

104
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,191
Twerk, though. Okay, that's cool.

105
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,692
Can you give me--can y'all clap your hands with me, please?

106
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:31,997
yep. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

107
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,232
Hey, hey. I can twerk better than that.

108
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,633
oh, that's it? I bet you can.

109
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:38,136
no, I don't have my twerking

110
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:41,439
Outfit on. Um, you go, sweetie.

111
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,575
â™?Someday I wish

112
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,510
â™?Upon a star

113
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:47,178
â™?And wake up where the clouds

114
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,214
so did not expect over the rainbow right now.

115
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:58,556
â™?Behind me â™?Somewhere

116
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:08,533
â™?Over the rainbow â™?Bluebirds fly

117
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:17,308
â™?If birds fly â™?Over the rainbow

118
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:28,920
â™?Why then â™?Why can't I?

119
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:31,689
I kinda love that.

120
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,159
I would like to see

121
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,827
Somewhere over the rainbow while twerking.

122
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,629
yeah! Twerk over the rainbow.

123
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:43,668
â™?Somewhere â™?Over the rainbow

124
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,238
â™?Bluebirds fly booty, booty, booty, booty.

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,542
aw, yeah. â™?Birds fly

126
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:55,380
â™?Over the rainbow â™?Why, oh, why

127
00:07:55,382 --> 00:08:01,786
â™?Can't I?

128
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:05,657
ask, and you shall receive. I think we should vote.

129
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,859
troy, I vote yes. I vote yes.

130
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:11,563
abso-frickin'-lutely. Oh, my god!

131
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:13,465
Thank you so much. Thank you, baby.

132
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:16,334
Listen, I want everybody to take you seriously too, though.

133
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,937
We have fun, and we do it, but there's a voice there.

134
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,039
And you need to work on that and get up in there--

135
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,841
did you say he needs to work on that?

136
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,909
can you twerk on it? You might twerk on it

137
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:26,978
A little bit more, okay? Thank you so much.

138
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,614
yes.

139
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,757
it is a long shot, but it--

140
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,196
Just might twerk.

141
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,854
and now we're back.

142
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,233
we're so back. We're back.

143
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,380
are we ready? We're rolling.

144
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,963
oh, my gosh. Mom, there's so many people

145
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:58,899
Here. You know, this could be the

146
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:01,135
Start of the biggest thing of your life.

147
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,804
yes. My name's sam woolf.

148
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,340
I'm from bradenton, florida, and I'm 17 years old.

149
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:09,276
I lived with my mom for most of my life.

150
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,646
And when I was about 13, she left, and so then I ended up

151
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:15,749
Moving in with my dad. He had some depression problems,

152
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:18,686
So I had to move in with my grandparents.

153
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,955
I'm sure they'll love you. Just be yourself.

154
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,523
papa roy's pretty much like my father.

155
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,226
He's always there to support me whenever I sing and tries to get

156
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:28,429
Me places to sing. I'm sort of his "Agent."

157
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:32,266
I call him "Mr. Wonderful." When I walk in, I'm just

158
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,302
Gonna be confident and just do my thing, sing my heart out.

159
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,870
Thanks for all you guys coming out.

160
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:39,440
This first song is called lego house by ed sheeran.

161
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,986
â™? 171 00:10: 00:10:44,242 â™?I'm gonna pick up the pieces

162
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,735
â™?And build a lego house

163
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:56,640
â™?And if things go wrong â™?We can knock it down

164
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:59,543
â™?My three words â™?Have two meanings

165
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:03,113
â™?But there's one thing â™?On my mind

166
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:07,351
â™?And it's all for you â™?But it's dark

167
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,153
â™?In a cold December â™?But I got you to

168
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,590
â™?Keep me warm â™?If you're broken

169
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:14,391
â™?I will mend you â™?And I'll keep you sheltered

170
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,194
â™?From the storm â™?That's raging on

171
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:20,431
â™?Now I'm out of touch â™?I'm out of love

172
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,334
â™?I'll pick you up â™?When you're getting down

173
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,936
â™?And out of all these â™?Things I've done

174
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:28,105
â™?I think I love you â™?Better now

175
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:30,674
â™?And I'm out of sights â™?I'm out of mind

176
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,143
â™?I'll do it all â™?For you in time

177
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:34,678
â™?And out of all

178
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,414
â™?These things I've done â™?I think I love you

179
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,216
all right.

180
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,718
Good lord, your pitch is incredible.

181
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,086
thank you.

182
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:43,887
man, I really, really like your voice.

183
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,624
I like that you play and sing. And I've never heard lego house

184
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,425
Done so fast like an auction song, but--

185
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,894
that's such a difficult song.

186
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,997
But it was really, really good. Thank you, thanks a lot.

187
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,065
yeah, I liked it a lot. You know, when you first came

188
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,135
In, it was just like--it was like, "Ooh, I'm a little bit

189
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,570
Scared. I'm not gonna look up from

190
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:00,904
My guitar. I'm gonna look down.

191
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,539
I'm gonna look up." And all of a sudden, it just

192
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,675
Kinda opened up like a flower. Like, it started revealing

193
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:06,777
Itself. And it was really beautiful.

194
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,746
I really enjoyed that. Thank you.

195
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,948
I'll tell you what I didn't like.

196
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,652
I didn't like the fact that you have a treble clef tattoo on

197
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,887
Your arm. And I have a 17-year-old

198
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,356
Daughter, and I've been telling her that she can't have

199
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:21,358
A tattoo. And that tattoo looks frickin'

200
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,760
Great on you. Does it?

201
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,128
yeah. Oh, thank you.

202
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,330
not to mention how well you sing...

203
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,366
yeah. And how good the entire

204
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,301
Package is. Well, thanks a lot.

205
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:32,803
I appreciate that. Let's vote.

206
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,973
What do you think? I'm gonna say yes.

207
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:39,276
I'm gonna say no to the tattoo but yes to you.

208
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,978
okay. Oh, god.

209
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,249
I'm gonna say, would you like

210
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,751
To go to hollywood? Yes.

211
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:49,453
come and get your card, dude. Thank you so much.

212
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,755
Oh, my god. Awesome, man, absolutely.

213
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,524
thank you, sam! Yay!

214
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:55,292
whoo! Yeah!

215
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,728
whoo! He sounds frickin' great.

216
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,463
both: Oh, my god. His pitch, you know.

217
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,798
that was so hard, what he did.

218
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,434
beautiful pitch. I loved the whole thing.

219
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:05,211
Like, I would go and listen to that.

220
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:05,985
mm-hmm.

221
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,867
that was nice. My daughters are gonna go

222
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:17,173
Absolutely crazy over that kid.

223
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:20,406
this is my amazing boy who never ceases to amaze me.

224
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,189
there was a little thing that

225
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:26,433
He did that you do, which is that--

226
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,316
brilliance? Yeah, brilliance, right.

227
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:29,837
please.

228
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,550
imagine your future... this opportunity means

229
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:41,619
Everything to me. I'd rather die chasing

230
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,564
A dream than die giving up. You, as a worldwide

231
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:44,681
Superstar. It's what I've always wanted

232
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,159
To do. It's worth every sacrifice.

233
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:50,629
you can make it happen. It's the american dream.

234
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,931
That's why I'm here. Today's the day.

235
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:56,268
it's not easy, but, man, is it worth it...

236
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,571
I worked so hard for what I want.

237
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:03,175
as we get to know... both: Mwah.

238
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:05,677
the kids aiming for the stars...

239
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,180
I'm done parking cars, baby. I'm going to hollywood.

240
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:10,582
I'm coming back to brooklyn with that american idol slip.

241
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:13,018
I think I'm gonna win this competition, hands down.

242
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,654
by following their heart. When I walk into that room

243
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,355
Today, I'm gonna blow the doors off the place.

244
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:20,192
if you're not the best, you're not working hard enough.

245
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:23,328
audacious...

246
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,030
come on, you've disrespected the process.

247
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,665
There's people that wait their whole life for this.

248
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,500
intimate... music was my medicine.

249
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:31,670
and that guitar seemed like it basically kinda saved his

250
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,405
we'll share this journey

251
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,140
Together as we continue our

252
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:36,808
Two-hour, two-city audition

253
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,542
Tour.

254
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:40,345
It's all right here on idol,

255
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:42,781
Because this is your story.

256
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,651
America, this is your show.

257
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,820
oh!

258
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:56,361
to find america's next

259
00:13:56,363 --> 00:13:58,363
Superstar...

260
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:03,768
We hit the road.

261
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,063
We set up auditions in seven

262
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:12,089
Cities coast to coast, making

263
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,878
Stops in small towns along the

264
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,576
Way with our idol bus tour.

265
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,640
the fact that y'all would come here is just awesome.

266
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,209
but however they got here, they're going to have to sweat

267
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:26,447
whew.

268
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,849
I'm really nervous.

269
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,318
the last stop before the

270
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,155
Biggest moment of their lives in front of the best panel we have

271
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:39,259
Ever assembled. Starting with a big welcome back

272
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,529
And celebrated superstars in the

273
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:43,397
Business.

274
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,833
I missed the show, I missed the singers.

275
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:49,069
It's such a big opportunity for someone, and they know that this

276
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,871
Is their moment. And if they seize the moment,

277
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:54,341
jennifer lopez is the

278
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:57,811
Ultimate triple threat, selling

279
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,680
More than 75 million albums

280
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:02,182
Worldwide and racking up over

281
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,184
A billion dollars at the box

282
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:04,852
Office.

283
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,787
The multimedia superstar has

284
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:07,855
Transformed the global

285
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:10,924
Entertainment scene.

286
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:11,959
And we're thrilled to save a

287
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,794
Seat for four-time grammy winner

288
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:17,664
And guitar god keith urban.

289
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,266
With five consecutive

290
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:22,069
Multiplatinum albums already,

291
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,472
This country superstar's latest release fuse has taken the world

292
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:30,978
By storm, debuting at number one here in the states, canada, and

293
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
I want to give them the best

294
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:36,617
Critiquing and guidance I can, but not sort of have them be

295
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:40,320
Humiliated in front of everybody.

296
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,589
and the newest addition to

297
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,157
The judging panel is three-time

298
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,260
Grammy and two-time emmy winner

299
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,028
Harry connick, jr.

300
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,264
He began his multifaceted career

301
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,065
As a five-year-old piano prodigy

302
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,233
In new orleans.

303
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,635
And we now know him as a

304
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,403
Multiplatinum singer, musician,

305
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:59,907
Songwriter, and composer.

306
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,174
And as an actor, he has dazzled

307
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:02,409
Us in the world of film,

308
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:04,645
Television, and broadway.

309
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:06,547
But with all that expertise,

310
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,949
What is he hoping for?

311
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,952
what I want more than anything this season, I really

312
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,087
Want it to be a dogfight. I want the people watching at

313
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,757
Home to say, "How do we pick?"

314
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,193
but all three have one

315
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:22,563
To find america's next

316
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,597
Superstar.

317
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,099
And they just may be in this

318
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,536
Very crowd.

319
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:30,737
I'm so excited.

320
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,705
The adrenaline is just keeping

321
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:32,906
Me thumping.

322
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,674
I know, I couldn't sleep at

323
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:34,408
All.

324
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,611
I had to take the bus here,

325
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,046
Then had nowhere to stay,

326
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,114
So I slept in the park.

327
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:42,282
but it was the morning's

328
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,184
Talent, which truly found a home

329
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,019
On the idol stage.

330
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,187
â™?I've been fighting

331
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,757
â™?With the wind for so long

332
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,996
â™?And I am close to giving in â™?But I won't

333
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:57,464
I've always believed in meant-to-bes.

334
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,500
And it seems like when things happen in my life, that they go

335
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,336
In the right direction, as long as you're being positive and

336
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,137
Continually focusing on what you want to do.

337
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:09,109
â™?Please don't pull me down â™?Pull me down again

338
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:14,081
â™?Please don't pull me down â™?Pull me down again

339
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,184
â™?Hold my hand

340
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:18,952
â™?Ooh, baby

341
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,554
â™?It's a long way down

342
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:27,327
â™?To the bottom of the river â™?And if you fall

343
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,030
I want that golden ticket so bad.

344
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,466
I've always wanted it. Ever since the show started

345
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,536
When I was, like, five or six, I've always been like, "Mommy,

346
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,839
I'm gonna be on that. Mom, I'm gonna be on that show.

347
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,541
Just wait." â™?Hold my hand

348
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:45,078
â™?Ooh, baby â™?It's a long way down

349
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,182
oh, we--we grooving over

350
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,517
yeah.

351
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,052
â™?If you ask me

352
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,587
â™?How I'm doing

353
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,956
When it comes to music, the moment I have a guitar in my

354
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,059
Hand or the moment I'm onstage or there's music playing, like,

355
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:03,296
That's when I feel complete. Like, that's the only time that

356
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:08,802
I feel myself. â™?At a table set for two

357
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:14,107
â™?And finally I'm forced â™?To face the truth, yeah

358
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:19,713
â™?No matter what I say â™?I'm not over you

359
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:24,051
good lord. I like your tone a whole lot.

360
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,553
I like the soul and passion you've got.

361
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,789
love your look. Love the whole thing.

362
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,892
I frickin' loved it. So I'm gonna vote no.

363
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,660
Just kidding. Come on.

364
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,095
no, no, no.

365
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,897
yay!

366
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,568
welcome to hollywood.

367
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,903
can I hug you?

368
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,471
yes, I know--

369
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:47,340
look at-- anybody's ever asked to hug me.

370
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,443
I got to tell you, only because will & grace was one of

371
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:50,911
My favorite shows in the entire world.

372
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,846
that's so sweet. Thank you so much.

373
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,236
â™? 415 00:23: 00:23:31,275 Oh,

374
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:55,949
jen. I am impressed by the rocks that

375
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:06,159
with so many golden tickets

376
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,895
going to hollywood!

377
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,031
it seemed boston was on a hot streak.

378
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,433
I'm taylor hildack from westfield, massachusetts, and

379
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:17,070
This is my idol yes, hi.

380
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,573
what's your freaking name?

381
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,875
I'm freakin'-- I'm taylor hildack.

382
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,211
taylor freakin' hildack.

383
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,613
there she is. Nice to freakin' meet you.

384
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,482
nice to freakin' meet you. I freakin' love you, by the way.

385
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,317
I would kiss you, but

386
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,651
but that would be

387
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,253
yeah, it'd be weird.

388
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,122
both: Mwah!

389
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,354
hi.

390
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:38,250
good. How are you?

391
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:40,377
you guys look beautiful.

392
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,446
thank you. What's your name?

393
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,943
what do you do?

394
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:48,612
I'm a jazz vocalist at a community college.

395
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,047
Hey. And--

396
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,548
are you winking at me for the community college part?

397
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,517
oh, oh.

398
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,420
and I get my associate's next semester hopefully and then

399
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:58,856
Transfer on to a more, like, prestigious music college.

400
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:00,190
what are you gonna sing today?

401
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:03,227
I can do before he cheats, good.Nderwood.

402
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,195
â™?Oh, right now

403
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:06,630
â™?He's probably up behind her

404
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:07,865
â™?With a pool stick

405
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,033
â™?Showing her

406
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,468
â™?How to shoot a combo

407
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,906
â™?Oh, but he don't know â™?That I dug my key

408
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:19,410
â™?Into the side of â™?His pretty little souped up

409
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:22,446
â™?Four-wheel drive â™?Carved my name

410
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:27,484
â™?Into his leather seat â™?I took a louisville slugger

411
00:20:27,486 --> 00:20:30,320
â™?To both headlights â™?Slashed a hole

412
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:34,725
â™?In all four tires â™?Maybe next time he'll think

413
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:39,496
â™?Before he cheats okay.

414
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,498
I feel like your voice is really strong.

415
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,267
For the most part, it was really, really good.

416
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:45,536
I really liked it. I just think that the voice

417
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,204
Needs a lot of work, baby. I really do.

418
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,639
okay. I feel like you have

419
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:51,508
A strength, but the range was an issue with limitation in

420
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,876
Your range. Yeah.

421
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,778
vocal-wise, I-I think you're good.

422
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,614
I don't know if I would put you in the great category.

423
00:20:57,616 --> 00:21:01,018
I think if you practiced, you could get your sound open.

424
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,987
There's a quality there that is a grating quality.

425
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:06,090
And it didn't--it just didn't do it for me.

426
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,958
okay. All right, let's take a vote.

427
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,893
Uh, I'm gonna say yes. Thank you.

428
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,162
I think she's worth seeing in hollywood for sure.

429
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,831
I-I have to say no. Okay.

430
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,233
I think singing is a big part of it, and I don't think your

431
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,634
Voice is strong enough. Okay.

432
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:20,904
Please, keith, please. Oh, you always put it on me.

433
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,006
I can prove you wrong right now if you want.

434
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,142
I know you can, baby, but today is the day.

435
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:26,810
I have to say no. Okay.

436
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,240
whew. Wow, guys.

437
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,609
thank you, guys. Thank you.

438
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:35,112
bye, have a good day. You too.

439
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:37,281
huge mistake. You think so?

440
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:42,620
I think so.

441
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:44,054
are you willing to fight for her?

442
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:46,857
I thought I was. I guess I lost.

443
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:49,927
It's okay. We can go to the next one.

444
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,196
oh, harry was harsh. But he just gave good advice,

445
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:54,732
I thought. You could never have made it

446
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,368
In the dance world if you didn't have a huge repertoire of

447
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,036
Technique. You can't just go out there

448
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,605
And shake it. You got to know your .

449
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:04,108
yeah, you do. And with that, the bar was

450
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,610
Officially raised. There's touches of nice

451
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:08,379
Singing, but it's just not enough.

452
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,885
this is my seventh time, and I've yet to make it.

453
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:16,520
you're just coldhearted. No, I just feel like

454
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:18,122
The standard has to be a little bit higher.

455
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,556
you know what I'd describe you as?

456
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:22,993
Harsh.

457
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:25,596
no, the word on the street is you're harsh, harry.

458
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,631
growing up in a time where they have pitch-correcting

459
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,067
Software, and you could really use it.

460
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:31,769
this is her dream.

461
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:35,406
I know, brother, everybody wants it bad when they come in

462
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,608
Here, but there wasn't enough for me to feel it.

463
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,712
well said, dude.

464
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:44,982
yeah. You're okay.

465
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:47,053
You're okay. You're okay, you're okay.

466
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,636
you're adorable, sweetie, but it's a no.

467
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:53,565
it's a no for me today.

468
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:54,644
it's a no. Thank you.

469
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,141
It's been, like, a dream of mine.

470
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:01,345
I really wanted to make it.

471
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,949
it's the worst part of the

472
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:10,454
Job. You're so good at it, though.

473
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,790
you're right.

474
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,358
join me over here when I call you.

475
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,930
99325 and 57344. Just join me right over here,

476
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,066
Okay?

477
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:26,470
All right, so just follow me this way, and I'll take you to

478
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,540
Your audition, okay? Our jersey girl stephanie,

479
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,875
Here. Yes.

480
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,676
16? 16 years old.

481
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,946
I'm a jersey girl. I love going to the shore and

482
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:39,917
Hanging out with my friends. And what about your favorite

483
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,485
Artists? Who do you like?

484
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,687
my favorite artist is jennifer lopez.

485
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,456
well-- I'm gonna meet her!

486
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,392
are you? Where is she?

487
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:52,263
she's in the room. I would love to follow in j.Lo's

488
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,765
Footsteps. She is such a great role model

489
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,334
For girls. It's time for a jersey girl to

490
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:00,371
Win this, and I hope that girl's me.

491
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:03,107
Hello. What's your name?

492
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,175
stephanie hanvey. I'm not sure if you're

493
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,145
Familiar with this lady, but-- yes.

494
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,613
her name's jennifer. I know.

495
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,950
I'm so honored to be here in front of you.

496
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,952
You opened so many doors for latinas.

497
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,554
aw, thank you. That's sweet.

498
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,723
you look like you're ready to audition for american idol to

499
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,091
yeah, I've been ready.

500
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,261
â™?Seems like everybody's

501
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,096
â™?Got a price

502
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:26,964
â™?I wonder how

503
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,999
â™?They sleep at night

504
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,169
â™?When the sale comes first â™?And the truth comes second

505
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,839
â™?Just stop for â™?A minute and smile

506
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,674
oh, my god.

507
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:37,608
I can't even believe that says

508
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,976
American idol.

509
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,211
â™?It's not about

510
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,281
â™?The money, money, money â™?We don't need

511
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,284
â™?Your money, money, money â™?We just want

512
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,087
â™?To make the world dance

513
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:59,263
the singing, for me, needs

514
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,799
Some work, but it's not just a singing show.

515
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:05,669
There's more things goon. You got a great way of

516
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,838
Performing. And that--I found that really

517
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,842
Interesting. There's, like, a composure

518
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,579
About you that was very powerful.

519
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:21,352
I-I think your voice needs some time to develop.

520
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,854
What do you say? I-I like you.

521
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,556
I like you. And he's right.

522
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,259
You do need some work. I just felt like, I don't know,

523
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,462
There was something emotionally lacking to me.

524
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:34,465
And maybe it was your nerves. I don't know.

525
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:40,404
should we vote? Hmm.

526
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:45,743
I know.

527
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:00,199
hmm.

528
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,864
I'm gonna say... Yes.

529
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,161
I feel like there was some nice stuff in there.

530
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:16,530
It just--it was so inconsistent.

531
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:24,504
I'm gonna say yes. I want to see her one more time

532
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:26,273
just for your information,

533
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:30,010
there you go!

534
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:32,245
Oh, no.

535
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:33,747
oh, my god! Oh, my god!

536
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:35,148
oh, mom and dad.

537
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,085
oh, my god! Oh, my god, baby!

538
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:39,786
oh, my god.

539
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:49,065
here, this is for you.

540
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,767
oh, my god! It's jennifer!

541
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,869
come over here, and give jen

542
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:55,405
A hug. Come around the back.

543
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,411
come over around the back. thank you so much.

544
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,765
congrats, man. She did great.

545
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,166
thank you.

546
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:06,538
oh, my god!

547
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,441
I'm so just honored to be

548
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:12,878
Here and grateful. And I want to say, back home,

549
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,047
I'm gonna do this for all of you.

550
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,949
I'm gonna win it all! So let's go!

551
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,918
aw, that makes me feel so

552
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,187
yeah, that was a good one.

553
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:25,357
she just--she can die happy now that she met you.

554
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,094
one of j.Lo's biggest fans

555
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:33,699
Has reason to celebrate. But can lightning strike twice?

556
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:36,145
you're such a good role model to me.

557
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:37,901
You're such an amazing person. You're such a talented person,

558
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:40,488
You know. It just--you make me want to be

559
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:44,615
thank you.

560
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:44,585
not you so much, harry.

561
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:46,220
it was apparent.

562
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:48,022
oh, that's nice.

563
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:52,226
what are you gonna sing,

564
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,828
paris by

565
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,431
okay, let's get it.

566
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,498
â™?You've got me

567
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,835
â™?Down on the floor

568
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:05,473
â™?So what'd you bring me â™?Down here for

569
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,943
â™?You've got me â™?Down on the floor

570
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:13,514
â™?So what'd you bring me â™?Down here for

571
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:18,186
â™?If I was a man â™?I'd make my move

572
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:21,889
â™?And if I was a blade â™?I'd shave you smooth

573
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:25,560
â™?And if I was a judge â™?I'd break the law

574
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:29,797
â™?But if I was from paris â™?If I was from paris

575
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,935
â™?I would say ooh la la â™?La la la la la la

576
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:38,372
cute.

577
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:40,174
I could hear that you were

578
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,376
Losing your breath. And I know that's nerves.

579
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:44,045
but I feel like you have

580
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:46,080
thank you so much.

581
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,382
you're 15 years old, which I cannot believe.

582
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:51,385
You have a lot of confidence. It's not easy to get up there

583
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:56,023
And, as you're losing breath, still find, pull, and make it

584
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,559
thank you.

585
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,529
thank you so much.

586
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:05,366
I think it's important that, as an artist, to figure out the

587
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,069
Songs that are right for you. And in this case, in your case,

588
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,260
Specifically, songs that are kind of age appropriate.

589
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:12,258
Considering you sing about shaving me smooth really was

590
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,127
all right.

591
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,796
you're such a dad.

592
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,265
I mean, I'm a mom, but--

593
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:22,168
I just think there are other songs, like, that I would like

594
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,507
To hear you sing, things that a 16-year-old should be singing.

595
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:28,975
maybe I'm old-fashioned that

596
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,443
okay.

597
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:32,312
but I was so thrown by your song choice.

598
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,114
This is gonna be a tough one. I have to sit on this for

599
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:35,782
okay.

600
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:37,417
I wasn't bothered by the song choice at all.

601
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,219
well, you're from australia,

602
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:40,787
I'm listening for--I'm mean--

603
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:42,288
and that's as southern as it gets.

604
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,091
I'm listening to--I mean, tanya tucker singing delta dawn

605
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:47,227
At 13, and I just think-- what are the lyrics of

606
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:48,828
Delta dawn? I'm just saying--

607
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,797
they're not shaving you smooth and making love in a car.

608
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,732
anyway, I like your voice a lot, baby.

609
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:54,200
Absolutely love it. Thank you so much.

610
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:55,735
I do too. Let's vote. I'm gonna say yes.

611
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:58,338
I'm gonna say yes. I say yes.

612
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,740
yes! You're going to hollywood.

613
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:02,599
you're going to hollywood, baby.

614
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,015
thank you so much. You're welcome.

615
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:06,950
good luck. Congrats.

616
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,219
and tell your mom thanks. Yeah, no, she's in love with

617
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:10,620
You. She has all your cds.

618
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:15,358
I got it, no, I got it. Oh, my god.

619
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,460
that creeped me out, man. What did?

620
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:18,962
That she was singing-- 'cause you have daughters that

621
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,830
Age. Got a ticket!

622
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:24,434
so morgan's off to hollywood,

623
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:28,638
The land of dreams. But perhaps our next contestant

624
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,077
Was already there.

625
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,746
How you doing, america? I'm james, and I'm from

626
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:39,749
Norwich, connecticut. I razzle-dazzle burgers, I flip

627
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:43,353
'em, and I'm 22 years old. The music industry sucks, man.

628
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:45,555
You know what I'm saying? Any time I turn on the radio,

629
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:47,724
I'm like, "What is this? What is this?

630
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:49,993
I don't want to listen to that. Mama, turn it off."

631
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:51,761
mom pick this out, james? Oh, yeah, yeah.

632
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:55,432
She said, "Son, whatever you do, you do it with your heart."

633
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:57,333
good luck. Let's make her proud.

634
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:01,871
james.

635
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:03,339
hello. Both: Hey.

636
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,941
how you doing, man? How are you?

637
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:06,376
I'm doing great. You're doing great?

638
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,710
yes, I am. What's your name?

639
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,946
I'm james earl. James earl.

640
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,681
how you guys doing? James is cool.

641
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,483
yeah, see--that's right. He's letting us know.

642
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:15,718
if I could be that cool, walking into the room--

643
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,954
That's just natural for you, isn't it?

644
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,256
yeah, it's very natural.

645
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:21,791
what kind of music do you like?

646
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,726
What do you want to sing? Who do you want to be as far as

647
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:25,628
An artist? As an artist, I got to say

648
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,997
I want to be like r. Kelly, michael jackson, and

649
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,766
Luther vandross. You know what I'm saying?

650
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,367
oh, I love luther. I used to walk back from high

651
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:34,237
School listening to my walkman and study luther.

652
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,572
luther was my favorite singer.

653
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,107
really? What year was that? That was, like, '83.

654
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:39,175
oh, so I wasn't even born yet.

655
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,249
I was-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:45,700
I know I look great.

657
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,268
yeah, yeah. It looks like you ain't aged

658
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,037
A bit. Thank you, thank you.

659
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,072
I love him. I do too.

660
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:53,975
You are perhaps the coolest guy I've met in a long time.

661
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,643
thank you. Yeah.

662
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:57,211
I'm gonna go to sleep happy now.

663
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,946
aw. I'm gonna sing one of my own

664
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:01,516
Songs that I made. It's called everything in life.

665
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:03,451
â™?Three minus one

666
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:05,053
â™?And one plus one

667
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,220
â™?That equals two

668
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:07,588
â™?Life with you

669
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,124
â™?There's no dividing us apart

670
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:13,027
â™?There's no subtracting â™?From the heart

671
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:17,165
â™?Maybe that I'm blind â™?Just in my mind

672
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:23,004
â™?Can you tell me â™?What you see

673
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:27,442
â™?Everything in life â™?Is so much pain

674
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:33,948
â™?And it feels so good â™?You know my name

675
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,983
You know, just a little razzle-dazzle, that's all.

676
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:40,488
yeah, really entertaining. I truthfully think you're really

677
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,790
Cool. Oh, man--

678
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:45,393
I'm cool, man. Didn't get a word of that.

679
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,228
I'm sorry. I do that sometimes.

680
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,931
I don't know why. As much as I really wanted

681
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,933
You to kill it... mm-hmm.

682
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:53,835
the voice wasn't there. Oh, okay.

683
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:55,837
do you do anything el, other than sing?

684
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,638
well, I do little jokes here and there.

685
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,407
you got a good joke for us at least?

686
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,075
why did the dog go in the water?

687
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:02,642
why? He didn't want to be a hot dog.

688
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:07,357
I like it. You ask my opinion, that's

689
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,159
Your calling. Oh, thank you now.

690
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,694
It's all right. As a singer, I'm gonna have

691
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,362
To say no. Okay.

692
00:33:12,364 --> 00:33:15,566
I love your many talents, man, but it's a no for me.

693
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:16,967
no problem. Thank you.

694
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:18,635
thank you so much. Thank you.

695
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:20,604
oh, man, they said they didn't like it.

696
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:22,940
They did not like the razzle-dazzle.

697
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:24,841
I loved him. I love him.

698
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,643
I want him to, like, open my show.

699
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:28,745
yeah. My life hasn't ended yet.

700
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:32,294
Till the day I die, then that's when I quit.

701
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,151
â™? 821 00:46: 00:46: â™?It's almost too good â™?To be true

702
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:40,351
â™?You're the perfect man

703
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:43,346
â™?For me

704
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:44,648
â™?I love you

705
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:50,520
â™?I do

706
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:53,223
it's pretty. I like your voice.

707
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:54,658
what are you looking at me for?

708
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,793
'cause I wanted to see what you'd do.

709
00:33:56,795 --> 00:34:00,897
I'm not as taken by the smoke and mirrors of pentatonics as

710
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,566
no.

711
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:04,968
I-I'm not--

712
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,672
no, it's tone. There's tone, and it's not just

713
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:12,342
it just didn't do it for me.

714
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,178
you have something special, and you have something really,

715
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,947
Really to build on, a real talent.

716
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,616
And whether it's the pa-pa-pa-pa thing, it doesn't matter.

717
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:21,651
You have a good voice. And I think that you should

718
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:25,121
Really stick to it and maybe come back next year.

719
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:26,723
It's a no for me. I'm sorry.

720
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,358
it's a no, I'm sorry.

721
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:33,144
what's the thing you're

722
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,846
pentatonics?

723
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:37,048
yeah, it's basically we have

724
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,516
you're gonna throw these

725
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:40,919
Things at america, and america's gonna be like, "What the--"

726
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:43,221
no, but, you know, what's wrong with challenging america?

727
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:44,789
okay, so here it is.

728
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,782
challenge me! Tell me what the hell it is. yes.

729
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,038
you know how you have do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do?

730
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:48,845
there's also do, di, re, ri,

731
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:50,246
yes, yes, yes.

732
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:53,149
there's 12. Pentatonics are the classic

733
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:57,520
Go-tos for r&b singers, gospel singers, jazz musicians.

734
00:34:57,522 --> 00:34:59,088
those are the five notes that

735
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,391
You hear everybody do the runs on, those five notes.

736
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,860
you know too damn much.

737
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:08,197
I have boston bing cherries.

738
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,666
Boston bing, a buck a bag. How many, how many, how many,

739
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:12,602
we should eat some lunch

740
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:13,936
Right now. You should definitely eat

741
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:15,671
no, I'm fine.

742
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:18,223
tea with a little honey.

743
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:19,992
lemon.

744
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,427
I'm fine. My name's austin percario.

745
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:24,529
I'm 17. I'm from warren, new jersey,

746
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:27,599
And I'm a senior in high school. My mom is such a stage mom.

747
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:31,103
drink a lot of water to hydrate yourself.

748
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:34,072
I am hydrated. She loves to coach me and loves

749
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:36,241
I love valerie.

750
00:35:36,243 --> 00:35:38,643
It's my favorite song, I think, that you sing really well.

751
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:40,912
I'm going to do what I feel is best for me at the end of the

752
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,515
Day, so I love you to death, but stop.

753
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,584
okay, hi. Hi.

754
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:47,986
tell us about yourself. My name's austin percario.

755
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:51,656
I'm 17 years old, soon to be 18. So if I do go to hollywood week,

756
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:54,259
I will be alone without my nice!

757
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:58,063
so I love my mom, but she's sort of a stage mom, so--

758
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:59,831
where is she? Outside.

759
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,600
bring her in. Bring her in.

760
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,468
oh, my god. She's gonna cry or pee,

761
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,104
Whichever comes first. Both: Or pee.

762
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,325
I hope she cries first.

763
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,094
Hi. You're a stage mom.

764
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,829
You didn't see the stage. I know.

765
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:16,164
I bumped into the stage. How are ya?

766
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,266
how are you? How excited are you right

767
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:20,301
Now? I'm really nervous.

768
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,336
he said you were gonna cry.

769
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:23,771
well, we're excited to hear him sing.

770
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:25,273
we're just glad you cried first.

771
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:27,475
yeah. What are you gonna sing?

772
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,577
how about titanium yeah.

773
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:30,945
okay.

774
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:33,147
yeah, she's not nervous at

775
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,582
that's how I would be if my

776
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:37,418
she's already good enough to

777
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,053
yeah.

778
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:41,055
already. Just that move alone, you got

779
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:42,857
The gig with me. So if nothing else works out--

780
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,425
I've never seen her this uncomfortable.

781
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:45,927
are you ready?

782
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:48,930
lookit.

783
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:50,698
â™?I'm bulletproof

784
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,767
â™?Nothing to lose

785
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:58,239
â™?Fire away, fire away â™?Ricochet

786
00:36:58,241 --> 00:37:04,078
â™?You take your aim â™?Fire away, fire away

787
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,949
â™?You shoot me down â™?But I won't fall

788
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:11,594
â™?I am titanium â™?You shoot me down

789
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:16,723
â™?But I won't fall â™?I am titanium

790
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,385
I like you.

791
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:20,882
I think you have a nice voice. I think you know your voice

792
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,637
Well. You have a great look.

793
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,823
the pentatonics, see?

794
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,783
that's my girl right there.

795
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,936
and it was good. That's right.

796
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:30,710
yeah.

797
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,279
thank you.

798
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:34,812
I was fascinated by the

799
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:37,619
Voice. It's like justin bieber at

800
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:38,904
00 a.M. I bet he sings like that.

801
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:43,683
It had this kinda raspy, cool, haggard-y thing with this nice,

802
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:46,752
Clean pop thing with it as well. It was a really interesting mix.

803
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:48,654
I think the fact that you

804
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:53,259
Referred to your mom as a stage mom is a good thing, because in

805
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:57,963
My opinion, she's gonna be spending a lot of time on and

806
00:37:57,965 --> 00:38:00,333
hopefully.

807
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:02,835
I'm gonna say yes.

808
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:05,071
keith?

809
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:07,573
mom's like, "I'm gonna kill

810
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:09,408
"I will."

811
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,580
thank you.

812
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,685
welcome to hollywood.

813
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,054
Lookit.

814
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,484
she's gonna take the ticket.

815
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:25,987
yeah, here you go. That's for you.

816
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:29,551
she peed.

817
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:36,248
they called austin a star.

818
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,185
I'm going to hollywood

819
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,521
Without my mom!

820
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:48,560
I just really want to be able to stand out 'cause there's so

821
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:50,695
Many people here. It's crazy.

822
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,043
There's tons. Hi.

823
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:52,930
I'm awesome.

824
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:53,740
both: Good.

825
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,422
tell us your name and everything.

826
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,414
oh, my name's kaitlyn jackson.

827
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,327
kaitlyn jackson.

828
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,494
so what are you gonna sing

829
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:01,221
I wrote a song called

830
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:04,277
Another angel. When I was younger, I was, like,

831
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,841
11, I opened for mark wills at the chenango county fair.

832
00:39:07,192 --> 00:39:09,559
oh, yeah. And during that, my

833
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:12,295
Grandfather had a heart attack in the grandstands during the

834
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:13,663
Last song. Wow.

835
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:17,920
and so--I'm sorry. They were able to save his life.

836
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,305
thank god. I'm really sorry.

837
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:19,988
I didn't think I was gonna cry. Mm.

838
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:22,016
they were able to save his life that day, but

839
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:26,183
Unfortunately, he did pass away the day after I wrote it, so he

840
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:31,069
Never got to hear it. We want to hear it.

841
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:36,307
â™?He was out in the crowd

842
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,343
â™?Drowned out the speakers

843
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:40,412
â™?For cheering so loud

844
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,614
â™?I had just dedicated

845
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:46,518
â™?His favorite song â™?When I noticed

846
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,022
â™?The cheering was gone â™?He'd fallen in

847
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:56,661
â™?The arms of a stranger â™?An angel who saved him

848
00:39:56,663 --> 00:40:02,000
â™?From danger â™?Sometimes you don't

849
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:09,841
â™?Get a moment to pray â™?And this time

850
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:15,647
â™?It could have gone â™?Either way

851
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:21,586
â™?I guess god didn't need â™?Another angel that day

852
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,054
there you go. I love that, whoo!

853
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,556
yeah. Thank you very much.

854
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:26,791
mm. If you can write a song like

855
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:31,696
That and be inspired by that and need to write about that, and

856
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:35,467
You're 15, wow. I want to give her a ticket.

857
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,535
yeah. You mentioned that your

858
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:39,771
Grandpa never heard it. I disagree.

859
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:43,174
he'listing in heaven. I can start the voting

860
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:46,444
Process by saying 100% absolutely.

861
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:50,648
absolutely yes for me too. Thank you so much, guys.

862
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,350
beautiful job. That was awesome.

863
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,952
thank you. Beautiful job too.

864
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:55,553
ooh, thank you so much. 15.

865
00:40:55,555 --> 00:40:57,589
congratulations to you. It was great to meet you

866
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:58,923
Guys. You too.

867
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:00,325
I'll see you guys in hollywood.

868
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,659
yes, you will. Yeah.

869
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,895
that was crazy. That's gonna be fun watching

870
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,931
Her week to week. That's gonna be really fun

871
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:09,384
'cause she's smart and she knows--

872
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,553
she's smart, and she has heart.

873
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:17,759
yeah.

874
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:21,563
I am so excited. I never expected this.

875
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,533
Oh, my goodness gracious. We've got much more from

876
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:28,871
Massachusetts as idol auditions roll on from boston after the

877
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:29,505
Break.

878
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,776
so we know who you are and that sort of

879
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:45,703
I wonder what the judges are

880
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:46,886
Kind of looking for.

881
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,545
â™? 1058 00:58: 00:58: I guarantee the winner is in

882
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:54,550
This room.

883
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:59,770
my name is keith london. I am from hazleton,

884
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:01,672
what do you do back there?

885
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:05,442
I just do, like, odd-end jobs all over--all over the country.

886
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:07,344
I sing on the street.

887
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:09,480
Painting things, lifting things for elderly.

888
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:11,215
that's good?

889
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:12,583
all right.

890
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:14,718
I support myself. Student loans hit me hard every

891
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,320
right.

892
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:18,489
so I thought, "Why not take a chance and try out for the show

893
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,324
And maybe make a better life for me?"

894
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:21,658
well, good luck, man. Nice to meet you.

895
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,993
appreciate it.

896
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:24,928
how's it going?

897
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,363
hey.

898
00:42:26,365 --> 00:42:27,898
what's up, guys? I'm good.

899
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,633
your name's keith london, right?

900
00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:31,435
and you're 21.

901
00:42:31,753 --> 00:42:33,152
What are you planning on singing?

902
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:35,788
I'm gonna sing roar by katy perry.

903
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,123
all right.

904
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:40,693
all right.

905
00:42:40,695 --> 00:42:44,864
â™?I used to bite my tongue where am I starting?

906
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,833
good time to bite your tongue.

907
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:48,000
â™?I used to bite my tongue

908
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,368
â™?And hold my breath

909
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,736
â™?Scared to rock the boat

910
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:52,171
â™?And make a mess

911
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,240
â™?So I sat quietly

912
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:57,343
â™?Agreed politely

913
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:59,946
â™?I guess that I forgot â™?I had a choice

914
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:02,915
â™?I let you push me past â™?The breaking point

915
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,251
hmm.

916
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:08,955
mm.

917
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:10,690
yeah.

918
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:13,326
â™?I got the eye â™?Of the tiger

919
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:17,330
â™?The fighter â™?Dancing through the fire

920
00:43:17,332 --> 00:43:22,668
â™?'cause I am a champion â™?And you're gonna hear me

921
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,204
â™?Roar â™?Louder

922
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:30,576
â™?Louder than the lion â™?'cause I am a champion

923
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:37,917
â™?And you're gonna hear me â™?Roar

924
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:40,286
okay, stop.

925
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:42,021
I don't want you to ruin it.

926
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:45,691
'cause I kinda like it because, um, I like that song, but you

927
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:48,461
oh, thank you.

928
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:49,962
there was something about the way he sang it...

929
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,664
and just made me hear the

930
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,766
Words a little bit more. Maybe I wasn't paying attention

931
00:43:53,768 --> 00:43:55,301
no, when you do a song like

932
00:43:55,303 --> 00:43:56,636
you know what I mean?

933
00:43:56,638 --> 00:43:58,304
and it has nothing to do with the artist who sang it,

934
00:43:58,306 --> 00:43:59,906
yeah.

935
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:01,707
right.

936
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:03,075
that's right.

937
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,644
that's, like, all I'm listening for.

938
00:44:04,646 --> 00:44:07,547
It's fantastic. Harry, did it move you?

939
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:09,992
it didn't move me as--I get what you're sayi

940
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:11,560
Like, when you strip all the drums and production out of--

941
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:12,995
Of course it's gonna sound more intimate.

942
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:14,529
yeah.

943
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:16,198
that doesn't do it for me. I thought it was okay.

944
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,835
And if they are feeling something, that says a lot about

945
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:22,037
The type of stars that this show produces.

946
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,072
This show produces stars that move people.

947
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:26,909
at the end of the day, I'm

948
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:29,378
Gonna remember you because you have a unique look, you have a

949
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,315
Unique way of being, and that's enough for me.

950
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:36,051
yes for me.

951
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:40,422
I--honestly, I don't think you're a good enough singer.

952
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:43,258
congrats, man.

953
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,594
yeah, man.

954
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,062
thank you.

955
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:49,531
you guys were totally digging

956
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:52,167
It, and I was kind of all right with it, but I'm like, "That's

957
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:54,703
yeah.

958
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:58,240
that's entertainment.

959
00:45:04,528 --> 00:45:06,608
so keith is off and running.

960
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:10,313
next.

961
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:13,016
but maybe the race is already over.

962
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:15,385
I think I'm gonna win this competition hands down.

963
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:17,820
my name's sam, and I'm from

964
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:21,991
Taunton, mass. And I love music.

965
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:25,928
I've written so many songs, countless amount of songs.

966
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,664
I've been playing the guitar for ten years, and what I love most

967
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:32,568
About it is just the-- just the--

968
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,772
um--

969
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,875
since I'm pretty good at singing

970
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:42,311
And playing now, basically, I don't practice anymore.

971
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:44,881
I just want to learn, like, as much about music as possible.

972
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:46,682
yeah. No, that's great.

973
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:48,384
I don't want to put all my eggs in one--I don't want to put

974
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:51,020
All my chickens in--I don't want to count my chickens before they

975
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:54,624
Hatch. I'm gonna blow these judges away

976
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,995
By just completely blowing the roof off the place, you know.

977
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:01,364
I'm sam.

978
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:05,535
you guess that on yourself--

979
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:07,503
what?

980
00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:09,939
no, I'm a guitar player.

981
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:12,141
oh, are you? Excellent. Fantastic.

982
00:46:12,143 --> 00:46:13,743
where are you from?

983
00:46:13,745 --> 00:46:15,778
taunton, massachusetts.

984
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,547
taunton. Some people say it "Taunt-on."

985
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:19,048
some people say it "Tan-ton."

986
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,550
whatever.

987
00:46:20,552 --> 00:46:22,218
you can call it whatever you want, I don't care.

988
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,587
You can call it boston for all I care.

989
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:26,456
that's hometown--exactly.

990
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,591
Excellent. What song are you gonna do for

991
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:29,992
well, do I have the

992
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:32,061
Opportunity to sing three songs or--

993
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:33,596
perhaps the first one might tell us the answer to that.

994
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:35,231
well, 'cause I had a plan to sing an original song because

995
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:37,567
well, do the worst one first.

996
00:46:37,569 --> 00:46:38,935
so you want me to do the original one first?

997
00:46:38,937 --> 00:46:41,237
okay.

998
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:45,007
do the original.

999
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:46,509
the original tells us a lot

1000
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,111
it's called love doesn't last

1001
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:49,712
Forever. That's true. Go ahead.

1002
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,115
it is true, isn't it? All right, here we go.

1003
00:46:52,117 --> 00:46:57,420
â™?Haunting memories

1004
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:59,789
â™?Of you

1005
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:05,428
â™?Are all â™?Gone

1006
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,366
â™?And never to return â™?And I've learned

1007
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:16,139
â™?That love doesn't last â™?Forever

1008
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:21,077
â™?Love â™?Doesn't last forever

1009
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,112
okay. 'cause that song was lasting

1010
00:47:23,114 --> 00:47:25,281
Forever. â™?Forever

1011
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:27,650
that song lasted forever?

1012
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:29,385
yeah, it wasn't-- it wasn't good.

1013
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:31,087
all right. So should we vote?

1014
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,156
we will. That's a no for me.

1015
00:47:33,158 --> 00:47:34,857
yeah, it's a no. I'm sorry.

1016
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,192
it's a no? Me too.

1017
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:37,660
all right. It's all right. Thank you, sam.

1018
00:47:37,662 --> 00:47:41,397
thanks, sam. He's pissed at you two.

1019
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:42,899
yeah, but he was looking at yo

1020
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,267
no, he wasn't. Oh, yeah.

1021
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:45,768
this time he was-- they weren't looking--

1022
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,236
no, he was-- he was looking at the two of

1023
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:50,806
You.

1024
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:54,810
Oh, god, I crack myself up. "This is a singing competition.

1025
00:47:54,812 --> 00:47:58,347
You got to be a good singer to make it in this competition."

1026
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:00,416
I have perfect pitch.

1027
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:03,052
You know, I'm probably a better musician than j.Lo and keith

1028
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:05,922
Urban and tony connick, jr., combined.

1029
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:10,359
Sam atherton signing out. But no offense to harry, most

1030
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:13,462
Of the boston contestants were here for one reason and one

1031
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:16,499
Reason only. If I were to sing in front of

1032
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:21,103
Jennifer lopez, I literally might cry.

1033
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:23,773
I think I'm most excited to, like, see--like, just to see

1034
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,342
J.Lo. Hi, j.Lo.

1035
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:31,347
hello.

1036
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:33,449
you're gorgeous, j.Lo. Obviously you know that, though.

1037
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:34,951
they all walk in and stare at you, jen.

1038
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,419
they do? Yeah, we're like bookends up

1039
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:38,020
Here. Nobody even looks at us.

1040
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:40,923
I do track. I did track.

1041
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:42,258
really? We have a lot in common.

1042
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,659
yeah. Yeah.

1043
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:45,161
so, harry, what were you doing the other day?

1044
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:46,729
well, I went to the bar, and I got drunk 'cause nobody knew

1045
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:48,931
Who I was. Oh, my god.

1046
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:51,200
Jennifer lopez is looking at me.

1047
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:51,923
what about us? It's all about jen.

1048
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,112
"I want to hug you. You're my idol."

1049
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:56,614
We're--I'm just sitting up here. Great.

1050
00:48:56,616 --> 00:48:59,250
I'm actually a mensa member. You're assuming that we're

1051
00:48:59,252 --> 00:49:01,886
Not mensa members. Oh, I am.

1052
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:03,855
I'd be about 143. What are you?

1053
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,857
142. Exactly.

1054
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,892
Continue. Wow.

1055
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:10,062
I've never been this close to celebrities before.

1056
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:11,203
neither have I.

1057
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:18,335
I have to say no. Our panel.

1058
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:19,002
thank you now.

1059
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:19,670
It's all right.

1060
00:49:19,672 --> 00:49:20,871
yes.

1061
00:49:20,873 --> 00:49:22,472
absolutely.

1062
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:24,474
welcome to hollywood!

1063
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:25,842
now you be the judge.

1064
00:49:25,844 --> 00:49:29,112
â™?They call

1065
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:33,517
â™?The rising sun

1066
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,253
â™?And it's been

1067
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,587
â™?The ruin

1068
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:40,557
â™?Of many a poor boys

1069
00:49:40,935 --> 00:49:42,065
before the break, we asked

1070
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:43,618
You if erin christine was going

1071
00:49:43,687 --> 00:49:45,116
To hollywood or going home.

1072
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:50,819
â™?In new orleans

1073
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:02,177
boston pride.

1074
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:04,524
Seriously, you've got the greatest sports teams in the

1075
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:07,226
World, right there, all over it, bar none.

1076
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:09,695
ready?

1077
00:50:09,697 --> 00:50:11,197
shanon, what style singer are

1078
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:13,399
I am an r&b style singer.

1079
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:16,636
I sing back home in texas a lot. It was always school, football,

1080
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,137
what position did you play?

1081
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,072
okay.

1082
00:50:20,074 --> 00:50:22,175
You're looking at a former offensive lineman.

1083
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:23,876
I guarantee you there's one

1084
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:25,845
Person at home thinking I'm making this up.

1085
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:30,049
Ryan seacrest, dunwoody high

1086
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:31,517
School.

1087
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:32,952
the way you just looked at

1088
00:50:32,954 --> 00:50:34,854
Me, I don't know if I do. Okay, what am I gonna be, a

1089
00:50:34,856 --> 00:50:36,689
yeah, sure.

1090
00:50:36,691 --> 00:50:40,092
That's a great stance. You ready?

1091
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:41,188
â™? 1319 01:11: 01:11:31,486 Oh!

1092
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:42,495
â™? 1320 01:11: 01:11: all: touchdown.

1093
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:56,042
he won.

1094
00:50:56,044 --> 00:50:59,278
anyway, good luck in the

1095
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,847
thank you, sir.

1096
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,415
still got a little speed

1097
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:04,183
I'm just afraid.

1098
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:08,087
That's all. Ugh.

1099
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:13,187
â™?It's crazy how

1100
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:14,955
â™?Your heart just has

1101
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:17,992
â™?A mind of its own

1102
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:21,428
â™?Y â™?Like when it smiles

1103
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,332
â™?And makes the choice â™?On its own

1104
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,568
â™?Mm

1105
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:32,139
â™?Well, the funny thing â™?About this heart of mine

1106
00:51:32,141 --> 00:51:36,977
â™?That knows what it wants â™?See my mind tries

1107
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:38,846
â™?To deny it â™?But, girl

1108
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:44,918
â™?I can't fight what I know â™?I know

1109
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,722
falsetto's a biggie.

1110
00:51:48,724 --> 00:51:54,728
â™?Girl â™?Ooh, ooh, ooh

1111
00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:00,768
â™?See I want you â™?Baby

1112
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:07,975
I want you.

1113
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:10,811
you're going to hollywood.

1114
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:13,414
man, what, no key change?

1115
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,716
no key change.

1116
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,951
congrats, man.

1117
00:52:17,953 --> 00:52:19,987
thanks for everything,

1118
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:22,556
you're welcome.

1119
00:52:22,558 --> 00:52:24,391
yeah!

1120
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:25,726
was that crazy?

1121
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:27,061
the lord dwelleth in hollywood.

1122
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:31,031
whoo! â™? 1353 01:13: 01:13:16,858 So-- oh!

1123
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:35,169
he, like, really zoned into you.

1124
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:37,471
yeah.

1125
00:52:37,473 --> 00:52:39,273
who would you sing to if you walked in here singing a love

1126
00:52:39,275 --> 00:52:40,641
if you were a guy?

1127
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:43,143
I'm just--oh.

1128
00:52:43,145 --> 00:52:44,845
yep.

1129
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:47,181
oh, we got someone coming in.

1130
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:50,350
hi.

1131
00:52:50,352 --> 00:52:52,853
I almost wore that exact thing.

1132
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:54,388
I'm surprised it still fits

1133
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,756
yeah.

1134
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:57,091
my name is stephanie

1135
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:58,892
are you a cheerleader?

1136
00:52:58,894 --> 00:53:00,494
yeah.

1137
00:53:00,496 --> 00:53:02,362
no.

1138
00:53:02,364 --> 00:53:03,897
I've just been practicing

1139
00:53:03,899 --> 00:53:06,133
and what are you singing for

1140
00:53:06,135 --> 00:53:06,829
today I'm gonna be singing

1141
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:07,972
Grace potter, ooh la la. Okay.

1142
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,182
â™?You got me here

1143
00:53:10,184 --> 00:53:12,818
â™?On the floor

1144
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,687
â™?So what'd you bring me

1145
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:16,756
â™?Down here for?

1146
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:17,924
â™?Oh

1147
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:21,027
â™?If I was a blade â™?I'd shave you smooth

1148
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:24,564
â™?If I was a judge â™?I'd break the law

1149
00:53:24,566 --> 00:53:29,101
â™?And if I was from paris â™?If I was from paris

1150
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:30,970
â™?I would say â™?Ooh la la

1151
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:34,674
â™?La la la la la â™?Oh, yeah

1152
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:37,910
â™?If I was a man â™?I'd make my move

1153
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:41,514
â™?And if I was a blade â™?I'd shave you smooth

1154
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:44,584
â™?And if I was from paris ooh, la la.

1155
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:46,819
yes, ooh la la.

1156
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:50,289
I'm worried about your voice. I was watching your abdomen,

1157
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:52,258
And that--I mean, you have a lovely abdomen.

1158
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,994
But I was just watching you sing, and it seems like it's

1159
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:56,462
All coming from here up... yeah.

1160
00:53:56,464 --> 00:53:58,331
and I just wonder how long you could sustain that.

1161
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,932
how you can sustain that. Yeah.

1162
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:01,534
obviously, you know how to move, and you know how to be in

1163
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:04,236
Front of a crowd and stuff, but it has to be an entire package.

1164
00:54:04,238 --> 00:54:06,172
And vocally, I wasn't really feeling it.

1165
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:09,141
hmm. It's funny because I disagree.

1166
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:10,543
I feel like she-- don't argue with me,

1167
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:12,144
Jennifer. Jennifer, I will slap you on

1168
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:13,713
National television. I have no problem.

1169
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:16,215
I'm sorry. That would never happen.

1170
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:19,785
you're right. I'm just kidding.

1171
00:54:19,787 --> 00:54:22,388
I feel like she had more soul than I expected.

1172
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,790
I don't know, maybe I'm judging bo by its cover.

1173
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:28,294
It's not a lot of a cover, but--

1174
00:54:28,296 --> 00:54:30,162
it's like a pamphlet, I think.

1175
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:32,999
right, right, right, right. The voice, to me, soul-wise was

1176
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:36,168
Surprising in a good way. Yeah, I felt the same.

1177
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,471
It's weird. I almost had a combination of

1178
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:40,773
These two because they're--I kept wanting her to sing

1179
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:42,108
Longer... mm-hmm.

1180
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,477
yeah. To see some of the nerves go

1181
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,612
And see you start to become, you know, more you.

1182
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:48,180
'use I feel like that's in there.

1183
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:49,915
yeah. I'm gonna go out on a limb.

1184
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,917
I'm gonna say it's a yes for me. Thank you.

1185
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:54,286
honestly, I don't think you're a good enough singer.

1186
00:54:54,288 --> 00:54:56,122
okay. You know, I would say no.

1187
00:54:56,124 --> 00:54:59,025
right. I'm a bit on the fence.

1188
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:05,931
Um... Gosh.

1189
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:08,768
And I think if I'm on the fence, it would have to be a yes today.

1190
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,604
oh! Yes.

1191
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:13,472
okay.

1192
00:55:13,474 --> 00:55:17,276
this is what it means.

1193
00:55:17,278 --> 00:55:19,211
thank you, thank you. I'm definitely gonna get a

1194
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:20,546
Hug on this one. Yeah.

1195
00:55:20,548 --> 00:55:21,947
don't hug him. I'll give you a hug.

1196
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:24,316
thanks. Thank you. Hey, rest your voice.

1197
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:26,252
oh, it's-- wow!

1198
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:28,587
oh, my god!

1199
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,322
it's a yes. If there's four of 'em, it's a

1200
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,924
Yes.

1201
00:55:31,926 --> 00:55:33,659
Sorry. I didn't know that was part of

1202
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:36,162
The package. You need four more.

1203
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:38,197
I just said no to four cheerleaders.

1204
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:40,499
That's--if I had that chance in high school--

1205
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,401
I think I know why her voice went out.

1206
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:44,670
yeah, exactly.

1207
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:50,976
I'll.

1208
00:55:50,978 --> 00:55:53,379
that's not a split. This is a split.

1209
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:54,847
no. Here we go.

1210
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:57,583
hard to do.

1211
00:55:57,585 --> 00:56:01,287
don't go away.

1212
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:06,058
More unforgettable auditions as the judges drive deep into the

1213
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,328
Heart of austin, texas, in search of the next

1214
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:13,115
American idol. The other competitors are

1215
00:56:13,117 --> 00:56:15,351
Gonna be very intimidated by you.

1216
00:56:15,353 --> 00:56:17,954
you perform with everything.

1217
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:20,456
that might be my first

1218
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:23,960
Goosies of the season. Absolutely unexpected.

1219
00:56:23,962 --> 00:56:25,461
whoo! All right, let's go back to

1220
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:26,896
The ranch. Oh!

1221
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:40,159
it's such a--such a pleasure

1222
00:56:44,465 --> 00:56:46,331
what's your name?

1223
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:48,567
jacob. And where you from?

1224
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:51,069
where on earth is that?

1225
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:52,704
you know what I love most

1226
00:56:52,706 --> 00:56:54,039
what's that?

1227
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:56,775
after everything you say, you strum that same chord.

1228
00:56:56,777 --> 00:56:58,343
can I just say something and

1229
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:00,012
yes.

1230
00:57:00,014 --> 00:57:01,447
but you gotta find--he's gotta find the fitting

1231
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:02,981
okay, jennifer, you look

1232
00:57:02,983 --> 00:57:06,485
Lovely today.

1233
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:08,086
Jennifer, you don't look so good today.

1234
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:13,058
jennifer, you could look good.

1235
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,894
oh!

1236
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:18,564
oh!

1237
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:21,900
welcome to a land tucked between western folk and indie

1238
00:57:21,902 --> 00:57:23,969
Rock.

1239
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:25,704
it's the live music capital of the world, so if you can't

1240
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:29,007
Find music here, you're not looking in the right place.

1241
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,510
whoo!

1242
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:33,396
to austin, texas. â™? 1533 01:21: 01:21:

1243
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:37,579
austin is such a music town. You know, I think I'm from the

1244
00:57:40,484 --> 00:57:43,251
Music capital of the world in new orleans.

1245
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:45,554
But, you know, austin will make you think twice about that.

1246
00:57:45,556 --> 00:57:48,390
I'm representing. Come on.

1247
00:57:48,392 --> 00:57:51,793
I don't know what to expect.

1248
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:55,564
I'm always ready to be surprised.

1249
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:57,165
keith, will you take a picture with me?

1250
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,733
bye.

1251
00:57:58,735 --> 00:58:00,602
oh, my god!

1252
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:05,874
He smelled so good. Oh, my god, he was fabulous!

1253
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:08,043
the part a lot of people forget is how daunting it is

1254
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:11,546
Coming in and standing in that studio in front of, you know,

1255
00:58:11,548 --> 00:58:14,049
The three of us, with no band, no music.

1256
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:16,351
You got cameras everywhere, lights.

1257
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:18,653
And, you know, you can see that moment happen.

1258
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:21,857
I mean, I would freak out. I really would.

1259
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:24,860
you guys are totally real.

1260
00:58:24,862 --> 00:58:26,461
a little too real sometimes.

1261
00:58:26,463 --> 00:58:27,390
by the way, my mom said that when you walked by, she smelled

1262
00:58:27,453 --> 00:58:28,196
that was me.

1263
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:31,302
okay, one of you guys smelled really good, and--

1264
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:32,445
what are you gonna sing?

1265
00:58:32,553 --> 00:58:34,453
cupid's got a shotgun by carrie underwood.

1266
00:58:34,455 --> 00:58:38,190
â™?Oh, we gave up on arrows

1267
00:58:38,192 --> 00:58:40,993
â™?A long, long time ago

1268
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,594
â™?Turns out I'm too hard â™?To hit

1269
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:46,098
no pressure.

1270
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,068
no pressure. Big smiles.

1271
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,170
it's hard.

1272
00:58:51,172 --> 00:58:56,341
â™?Cupid's got a shotgun â™?And he's pointing it at me

1273
00:58:56,343 --> 00:58:57,709
can I ask you a question?

1274
00:58:57,711 --> 00:59:01,346
so are you, like, the person

1275
00:59:01,348 --> 00:59:04,049
That they write in your yearbook, like, "Most likely

1276
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:06,752
yeah--I don't want to be

1277
00:59:06,754 --> 00:59:08,220
that's--no, no.

1278
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:10,222
it sounds like you're a big

1279
00:59:10,224 --> 00:59:12,558
okay.

1280
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,860
american idol is the biggest possible platform you could

1281
00:59:15,816 --> 00:59:17,215
yeah.

1282
00:59:17,217 --> 00:59:20,152
are you ready to bring it week in, week out against

1283
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:22,154
and it's hard because you can

1284
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:24,256
Be nervous sometimes, right? And I get it.

1285
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:26,258
I'm gonna say yes.

1286
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,326
I still feel like you have a lot of work to do.

1287
00:59:28,328 --> 00:59:30,195
but it's a yes.

1288
00:59:30,197 --> 00:59:33,165
as much as I don't want to

1289
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:35,467
Say it, I'm gonna say no.

1290
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:38,036
all righty.

1291
00:59:38,038 --> 00:59:40,153
â™? 1582 01:23: 01:24: aw,

1292
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:43,708
baby. â™? 1583 01:24: 01:24: that one hurt.

1293
00:59:49,516 --> 00:59:51,983
you have next year, okay?

1294
00:59:51,985 --> 00:59:53,919
I told keith urban you said he smelled good.

1295
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:56,555
next.

1296
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:02,106
â™?Emeralds from mountains

1297
01:00:02,108 --> 01:00:04,742
â™?Thrust towards the sky

1298
01:00:04,744 --> 01:00:05,542
â™?Stop me

1299
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:08,946
â™?And steal my breath

1300
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:09,713
all right, all right.

1301
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:10,848
It's just not there yet.

1302
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:15,719
â™?Blown away

1303
01:00:15,721 --> 01:00:18,822
you have a nice voice, but it takes more than that.

1304
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:21,225
he gave it a shot.

1305
01:00:21,227 --> 01:00:23,660
I think I just got scared.

1306
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,529
it sucked.

1307
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:31,602
I work so hard for what I want, and I'm just so happy

1308
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:33,971
yes!

1309
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:38,342
whoo!

1310
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:41,378
yes!

1311
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,847
truth is all â™? 1604 01:24: 01:24:59,526 â™?That I can hear

1312
01:00:51,057 --> 01:00:53,257
when you want something that bad, you work really hard for

1313
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:55,292
It, and it just feels good to know that your hard work paid

1314
01:00:55,294 --> 01:00:57,428
and I'm gonna be here next

1315
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,563
Year, and I'm gonna work my butt off until next year.

1316
01:00:59,565 --> 01:01:01,331
I'm gonna be right here next year.

1317
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:02,966
she--she's got a little fight in her.

1318
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:05,594
lots of new elements this

1319
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:08,934
Season, one of which is this. The chamber.

1320
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,375
This is the final spot where contestants can prepare before

1321
01:01:13,377 --> 01:01:15,978
They face one of the most important moments of their life.

1322
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,347
all right, I can do this. I can do this.

1323
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:20,182
little bit nervous. More excited than nervous,

1324
01:01:20,184 --> 01:01:22,418
what the hell am I doing

1325
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:26,188
when the light goes green,

1326
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,258
hey.

1327
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,659
hey.

1328
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:32,461
we're so good.

1329
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:34,959
eight years I've been trying

1330
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:36,794
now, wait, why didn't you

1331
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:40,965
I-I--

1332
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:44,569
I didn't feel I was creative enough yet.

1333
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:47,905
what's your name?

1334
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:52,043
my name is savion wright, and I'm from jasper, texas.

1335
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:56,848
One of the hardest things for me, as a kid, was school because

1336
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:03,021
sometimes his behavior could

1337
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:06,224
music was one of the outlets

1338
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:10,061
mm, good luck.

1339
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:12,830
all right, thank you, ma. My parents bought me my first

1340
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:15,199
and that guitar seemed like

1341
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:18,136
It basically kinda saved his life.

1342
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:22,073
what I say is musicas m medicine, and it still is.

1343
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:24,075
I just--I want to compliment

1344
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:26,077
Y'all so much. Like, I've been listening to

1345
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,646
you do know who I am, right?

1346
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:30,682
yes, sir. Harry connick, jr.

1347
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:34,318
no, I am chris isaak.

1348
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,622
Wicked game. What are you feeling?

1349
01:02:37,624 --> 01:02:40,825
I'm just so excited.

1350
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:42,827
yeah? And then I'm in suspense at

1351
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:45,363
The same time. It's too much--it's too much

1352
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:46,898
To deal with. It is.

1353
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,800
what are you gonna sing? I want to show y'all some

1354
01:02:48,802 --> 01:02:50,535
Of my creativity. I want to give y'all an

1355
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:51,869
Original. Okay.

1356
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:53,504
great, give it all you got.

1357
01:02:59,779 --> 01:03:07,351
â™?Hiding in fear â™?Of what I really am

1358
01:03:07,353 --> 01:03:12,190
â™?Afraid of the pain â™?That I will cause

1359
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:14,726
come on. â™?I don't want you to see

1360
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:17,028
â™?The dark side of me mm.

1361
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:21,933
â™?I'm afraid you'll believe â™?The dark side of me

1362
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:24,102
â™?If you believe what you see it's a good song.

1363
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:29,006
â™?I'm afraid you'll believe â™?Both sides of me

1364
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:32,443
yeah. That was really great.

1365
01:03:32,445 --> 01:03:34,212
Really great. You wrote that, huh?

1366
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:36,080
yes, ma'am. Well, the one thing that came

1367
01:03:36,082 --> 01:03:40,685
To mind that I think you really are gonna have to work on is how

1368
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:43,855
To be nice to people...

1369
01:03:43,857 --> 01:03:48,726
Because the other competitors, if my counterparts share my

1370
01:03:48,728 --> 01:03:52,830
Sentiment, are gonna be very intimidated by you.

1371
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:54,899
thank you so much. You know what's great?

1372
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,201
You perform with everything. Everything about you is

1373
01:03:57,203 --> 01:03:58,603
Happening. You can't look away.

1374
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:00,171
I mean-- there's a performer there.

1375
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:01,672
There's a real performer there. Yeah.

1376
01:04:01,674 --> 01:04:05,276
I want to vote. It's no for me.

1377
01:04:05,278 --> 01:04:06,644
yeah, me too. Me too.

1378
01:04:06,646 --> 01:04:07,979
terrible. Awful.

1379
01:04:07,337 --> 01:04:08,703
we're just kidding! Yes!

1380
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:12,340
oh, my god!

1381
01:04:12,342 --> 01:04:15,176
I'm gonna just give you this. Eight years.

1382
01:04:15,178 --> 01:04:16,944
she's bringing it to you. Eight long years.

1383
01:04:16,946 --> 01:04:18,679
it was worth the wait. That's for you.

1384
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:21,616
thank you so much. You're welcome.

1385
01:04:21,618 --> 01:04:23,017
my mom... oh, hi, mom.

1386
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:25,253
is, like, your biggest fan. Hi, mom.

1387
01:04:25,255 --> 01:04:29,624
I'm so happy for you.

1388
01:04:29,626 --> 01:04:33,961
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my god!

1389
01:04:33,963 --> 01:04:38,366
Thank y'all so much. You're welcome.

1390
01:04:38,368 --> 01:04:41,536
congratulations. Hard work pays off, right?

1391
01:04:41,538 --> 01:04:48,176
yes, sir.

1392
01:04:48,178 --> 01:04:51,746
Oh, my god! I'm so happy.

1393
01:04:51,748 --> 01:04:55,049
what kind of mind does it take to say, "I'm gonna wait,"

1394
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:56,751
And next year, "I'm gonna wait again, I'm gonna wait"?

1395
01:04:56,753 --> 01:04:58,219
like, "I'm not good enough to myself yet."

1396
01:04:58,221 --> 01:04:59,554
I really dig that. That's crazy.

1397
01:04:59,556 --> 01:05:00,922
yeah. That's really cool.

1398
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:13,325
â™? 1742 01:33: 01:33: I got to call somebody important.

1399
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,843
keith, how are ya?

1400
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,712
I'm good. You know what's really weird?

1401
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:19,313
I'm speaking upside-down on

1402
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,083
are ya?

1403
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,252
well, you are australian.

1404
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,220
go!

1405
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:32,126
the city's probably gonna be

1406
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:33,761
Pretty busy today because american idol is in town

1407
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,721
Filming. â™? 1754 01:34:

1408
01:05:35,693 --> 01:05:37,735
01:34: but no matter if they came to us by car...

1409
01:05:40,006 --> 01:05:43,474
american idol! Plane, or the american idol

1410
01:05:43,476 --> 01:05:46,377
Bus... ready for auditions.

1411
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:50,581
all the austin contestants were ready to bring it home.

1412
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,428
gonna meet j.Lo. Super excited.

1413
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:54,550
one little day could, like, change my life forever.

1414
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:58,967
I've always envisioned myself just being in that spot,

1415
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:02,304
Auditioning for the judges. It's a must that I get this

1416
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,906
Golden ticket. I won't leave here without a

1417
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:08,377
â™?Believe me

1418
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:11,713
â™?Dear, when say

1419
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:14,816
I have two mothers, my biological mom and my

1420
01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:17,519
Godmother. They've been there for me

1421
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:20,455
Through everything. I look up to them.

1422
01:06:20,457 --> 01:06:25,093
â™?Whispered good-bye

1423
01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:27,362
â™?As she got on a plane

1424
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:33,101
â™?Never to return again â™?But always in my heart

1425
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:34,770
â™?Oh I'm a valet parker.

1426
01:06:34,772 --> 01:06:38,106
I've been doing that since I was 18 years old.

1427
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:40,509
Any way I can make money, really, doing music, I try to

1428
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,712
Do, and the other thing is just parking cars.

1429
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:47,416
â™?Her heart is breaking

1430
01:06:47,418 --> 01:06:51,586
â™?In front of me â™?I have no choice

1431
01:06:51,588 --> 01:06:52,487
â™?'cause she walks

1432
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:54,389
â™?Downtown with a suitcase

1433
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:56,525
â™?In her hand

1434
01:06:56,527 --> 01:07:00,562
â™?Looking for â™?A mysterious dark-haired man

1435
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:03,832
I'm from mason, texas. My dad is a cowboy.

1436
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:06,234
â™?He was meeting you â™?Here today

1437
01:07:06,236 --> 01:07:08,570
Our life has pretty much revolved around cattle and

1438
01:07:08,572 --> 01:07:11,773
Horses. â™?In the sky

1439
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:13,175
thank you. Thank you.

1440
01:07:13,177 --> 01:07:14,609
like miranda lambert when she was 15.

1441
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:16,845
sweet. 15, 14 years old, right?

1442
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:18,880
if you want to pursue country music, I think you got a great

1443
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:20,649
Voice for it. Yeah.

1444
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:23,552
I'm gonna say yes. I'm gonna say yes too.

1445
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:26,922
I'll say yes too. Yay, justin!

1446
01:07:26,924 --> 01:07:28,690
â™?This is gonna be â™?The best day of my life

1447
01:07:28,692 --> 01:07:30,292
congratulations. You're welcome.

1448
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:32,461
you are so handsome to me. Oh, bless you, baby.

1449
01:07:32,463 --> 01:07:37,766
and I'm just me.

1450
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:40,268
whoa! I'm done parking cars, baby.

1451
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,504
I'm going to hollywood. I'm going.

1452
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:45,874
whoo!

1453
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:49,511
Yes!

1454
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:52,380
all right, let's go back to

1455
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:53,715
The ranch. Oh!

1456
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:56,518
oh, my gosh.

1457
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,856
my gosh. All right.

1458
01:08:00,858 --> 01:08:02,891
I have a good feeling about today.

1459
01:08:02,893 --> 01:08:07,262
keep it . Keep it rolling.

1460
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:08,763
hi. How's it going?

1461
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:10,465
hi. Good.

1462
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:12,200
you're from the south? I am.

1463
01:08:12,202 --> 01:08:14,035
I'm from georgia. Okay, good.

1464
01:08:14,037 --> 01:08:16,071
What are you gonna sing? I'm gonna sing

1465
01:08:16,073 --> 01:08:18,273
Up to the mountain. Hit it. We're ready.

1466
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:28,027
â™?Some days I look down

1467
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:33,332
â™?Afraid I may fall

1468
01:08:33,334 --> 01:08:36,102
mm-hmm. â™?And though the sun

1469
01:08:36,104 --> 01:08:41,173
â™?Shines â™?I see nothing

1470
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:48,114
â™?At all â™?Oh, when I hear your

1471
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:53,786
â™?I can hear your sweet voice â™?Whoa

1472
01:08:53,788 --> 01:09:04,230
â™?Oh, come and go â™?Telling me softly

1473
01:09:04,232 --> 01:09:06,732
hmm. â™?I love

1474
01:09:06,734 --> 01:09:10,402
â™?I love you so mm.

1475
01:09:10,404 --> 01:09:15,474
don't say another word, please.

1476
01:09:15,476 --> 01:09:17,610
Oh, my god. You want to sing a little bit

1477
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,146
Of something else? Take a deep breath.

1478
01:09:20,148 --> 01:09:21,547
don't cry. You're gonna make me cry.

1479
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:24,016
sorry. Don't cry because it'll make

1480
01:09:24,018 --> 01:09:26,085
It hard to sing. Why do you wanna hear another

1481
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:27,686
Song? I didn't.

1482
01:09:27,688 --> 01:09:29,121
I mean, that's beautiful. I didn't want to hear

1483
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,523
Anything. I said, "Don't talk.

1484
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:32,024
Don't do anything, just--" All right.

1485
01:09:32,026 --> 01:09:34,560
So can you dance maybe? No, I--

1486
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:37,229
I think we should just vote. That's a yes from me.

1487
01:09:37,231 --> 01:09:39,865
oh, my god. It's a double yes from me.

1488
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:41,934
I want you to think about something.

1489
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:45,037
Some people on this panel are very easily impressed by licks.

1490
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:46,705
what? What?

1491
01:09:46,707 --> 01:09:48,073
it's true. Let me tell you something

1492
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:50,376
About you, okay? That's not true.

1493
01:09:50,378 --> 01:09:53,212
as I was saying, some people on this panel are very easily

1494
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:54,779
Impressed by... Runs and--

1495
01:09:54,906 --> 01:09:58,660
Well, don't listen to me. Congrats!

1496
01:09:59,015 --> 01:10:01,015
that's what you get that's what you get for

1497
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:03,050
Insulting me! You were more--you were

1498
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:04,101
Focused on the golden ticket. I wish you the best of luck.

1499
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:05,758
I was gonna give you some advice, but--

1500
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,693
I would love--no, I would love to hear it, I really would.

1501
01:10:07,695 --> 01:10:09,629
you will hear it in hollywood.

1502
01:10:09,631 --> 01:10:11,197
Congratulations. Oh, my god.

1503
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,932
Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much.

1504
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:14,534
great job, madelyn. Oh, my god, oh, my god.

1505
01:10:14,536 --> 01:10:16,002
thank you, baby. Nice work.

1506
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,837
thank you so, so much. Congratulations.

1507
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,473
come on.

1508
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:22,174
we are not impressed because she did licks.

1509
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,643
how do you know I was talking about you?

1510
01:10:23,645 --> 01:10:25,177
you said some people. How do you--

1511
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,713
there's only two of us! What?

1512
01:10:27,715 --> 01:10:30,983
some people means more than one.

1513
01:10:30,985 --> 01:10:33,419
every time somebody sings the slightest lick...

1514
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:35,087
you didn't say "Some--" I can hear both of y'all go,

1515
01:10:35,089 --> 01:10:36,556
"Ooh, ooh." No, no, I didn't think--

1516
01:10:36,558 --> 01:10:38,157
"Ooh!" Do one thing.

1517
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:41,994
roll the tape back. â™?Oh, oh

1518
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:45,932
mm-hmm.

1519
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:49,402
mm. I will punch you in the

1520
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:52,238
Stomach. Or somewhere.

1521
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,207
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! I told you.

1522
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:59,245
ahh.

1523
01:10:59,247 --> 01:11:02,582
more auditions coming up from austin right after this.

1524
01:11:02,584 --> 01:11:06,118
Please don't move. Is he talking to me?

1525
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,267
yeah, don't move.

1526
01:11:08,269 --> 01:11:13,891
knock, knock.

1527
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:14,334
who's there?

1528
01:11:15,624 --> 01:11:16,356
control freak.

1529
01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:17,057
Now you say, "Control freak

1530
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:18,592
Who?"

1531
01:11:18,594 --> 01:11:26,233
I know.

1532
01:11:26,235 --> 01:11:27,968
that would be original. They wouldn't expect it.

1533
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:29,736
I'm about to go in front of the judges.

1534
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:33,206
I'm a little nervous. I definitely want to show the

1535
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:37,143
Judges that I'm different and not like everyone else.

1536
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:41,414
I plan to plan maroon 5's love somebody on the ukulele,

1537
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,984
And I hope that that sets me apart.

1538
01:11:43,986 --> 01:11:47,087
â™?I really want to love â™?Somebody

1539
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:50,690
â™?I really want to dance â™?The night away

1540
01:11:50,692 --> 01:11:51,591
â™?I know we're only

1541
01:11:51,593 --> 01:11:52,726
â™?Halfway there

1542
01:11:52,728 --> 01:11:54,694
â™?But you take me all the way

1543
01:11:54,696 --> 01:11:56,796
â™?Take me all the way

1544
01:11:56,798 --> 01:11:58,365
â™?I really want to touch

1545
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:00,100
â™?Somebody

1546
01:12:00,102 --> 01:12:01,167
â™?I think about you

1547
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:02,936
â™?Every single day

1548
01:12:02,938 --> 01:12:05,839
â™?Taste of the poison

1549
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:07,440
â™?Paradise

1550
01:12:07,442 --> 01:12:11,711
â™?I'm addicted to you â™?Don't ya know

1551
01:12:11,713 --> 01:12:16,650
â™?Which way is right?

1552
01:12:16,652 --> 01:12:18,585
â™?Which way is wrong?

1553
01:12:18,587 --> 01:12:19,819
â™?How can you say

1554
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:24,658
â™?That I need to move on? â™?You know we're headed

1555
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:29,162
â™?Separate ways â™?Whoa, whoa

1556
01:12:29,164 --> 01:12:32,632
â™?And it feels like â™?I am just too close

1557
01:12:32,634 --> 01:12:37,170
yes.

1558
01:12:37,172 --> 01:12:42,075
â™?There's nothing â™?I can really say

1559
01:12:42,077 --> 01:12:44,578
that might be my first

1560
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,948
dude, you got a great voice.

1561
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,116
Really great voice. And I was shocked.

1562
01:12:50,118 --> 01:12:51,484
here, take it. You're going to hollywood.

1563
01:12:51,486 --> 01:12:55,555
going to hollywood!

1564
01:12:55,557 --> 01:12:58,758
golden ticket.

1565
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,361
yes, yes, yes, yes!

1566
01:13:01,363 --> 01:13:04,431
when I--when I watch the show, it's mostly a cappella,

1567
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:07,267
So it's kind of a different vibe for me seeing so many people

1568
01:13:07,269 --> 01:13:09,736
whoo!

1569
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:11,504
I think that it does give them a little bit of a leg up

1570
01:13:11,506 --> 01:13:15,909
'cause they have their key, and they have background music.

1571
01:13:19,281 --> 01:13:24,684
â™?Down down down â™?Down down down

1572
01:13:24,686 --> 01:13:27,220
Look, I need to learn how to play the acoustic guitar.

1573
01:13:27,222 --> 01:13:30,857
Like, it was one of them guys that was back there playing it,

1574
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:34,294
And I got kinda jealous 'cause I don't know how to do it yet.

1575
01:13:34,296 --> 01:13:36,229
Now, y'all told me I could bring my guitar.

1576
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:38,164
I haven't learned how to play it yet, so this is my buddy,

1577
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:40,467
Airy. This is my air guitar.

1578
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:41,835
Y'all ready for it? Yes.

1579
01:13:41,837 --> 01:13:43,603
humming bass line to

1580
01:13:49,211 --> 01:13:50,844
Wow! Oh, yeah.

1581
01:13:50,846 --> 01:13:54,381
â™?Very superstitious oh, come on.

1582
01:13:54,383 --> 01:13:59,052
â™?Writing on the wall â™?Hey

1583
01:13:59,054 --> 01:14:04,391
â™?Seven years of bad luck

1584
01:14:04,393 --> 01:14:07,260
â™?The good things in your past so natural.

1585
01:14:07,262 --> 01:14:12,232
â™?Oh, no â™?When you believe in things

1586
01:14:12,234 --> 01:14:16,036
â™?You don't understand â™?Then you suffer

1587
01:14:16,038 --> 01:14:18,338
â™?Yeah

1588
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,707
it's so natural for you, I wanna throw this pen at you.

1589
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:23,009
is that a piano on your arm?

1590
01:14:23,011 --> 01:14:24,344
You have a... yeah.

1591
01:14:24,346 --> 01:14:25,712
keyboard or something? I was checking that out.

1592
01:14:25,714 --> 01:14:27,981
that's how I keep tune, man. That's how you keep tune?

1593
01:14:27,983 --> 01:14:29,883
yeah, yeah, yeah. You take this real seriously?

1594
01:14:29,885 --> 01:14:32,185
extremely. Like, this is my life.

1595
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:34,354
I'm in--I'm literally in love with music.

1596
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:36,122
If I could marry it, I'd totally do it.

1597
01:14:36,124 --> 01:14:37,691
I think your voice is something special.

1598
01:14:37,693 --> 01:14:39,125
thank you, thank you, thank you.

1599
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:40,493
yeah, I think you know you can sing.

1600
01:14:40,495 --> 01:14:42,162
both: Yeah. And you believe it, right?

1601
01:14:42,164 --> 01:14:45,832
my tattoo says, "I am music," And I believe every bit of it.

1602
01:14:45,834 --> 01:14:47,867
I'm gonna say yes, yes, and double--you're my triple yes

1603
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:50,003
Today. Oh, well, then we don't need

1604
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:51,805
To answer. Right.

1605
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:54,507
her triple yes is more powerful than our yes.

1606
01:14:54,509 --> 01:14:56,443
it's a yes. Whoo!

1607
01:14:56,445 --> 01:14:59,212
Yes! Oh, my god!

1608
01:14:59,214 --> 01:15:00,747
no, he sounds great. Oh, yeah.

1609
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:02,082
yeah. He can sing.

1610
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:03,450
I thought he was the best singer today, for sure.

1611
01:15:03,452 --> 01:15:05,452
yeah, I agree. Hold on one second.

1612
01:15:05,454 --> 01:15:07,253
Whoo! A whole powerful bunch of

1613
01:15:07,255 --> 01:15:08,922
Yeses in there, huh? Yeah.

1614
01:15:08,924 --> 01:15:10,690
J.Lo gave me a triple yes. A triple yes.

1615
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:12,025
That's good news. Yeah.

1616
01:15:12,027 --> 01:15:13,426
well, congratulations. Appreciate it, man.

1617
01:15:13,428 --> 01:15:14,894
we'll see you in hollywood, malcolm.

1618
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:16,496
I can finally--when they put that camera in my face and

1619
01:15:16,498 --> 01:15:19,203
They say, "How was it?" I'm like, "It was great!"

1620
01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:20,622
yeah. It was awesome!

1621
01:15:31,021 --> 01:16:24,573
â™? 2011 01:52: 01:52: hello.

1622
01:15:32,576 --> 01:15:33,359
I'm doing good.

1623
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,223
Jennifer lopez, I've been tracking you since day one.

1624
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:39,892
yes, ma'am.

1625
01:15:39,894 --> 01:15:41,293
how does it feel being this close to jennifer right now?

1626
01:15:41,295 --> 01:15:43,662
that famous laugh. That famous, beautiful laugh.

1627
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:44,997
I just--oh. I got a glance of you...

1628
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,465
and I started tearing.

1629
01:15:46,467 --> 01:15:48,233
he does--he has no idea I'm even sitting here.

1630
01:15:48,235 --> 01:15:49,768
he's not liing you.

1631
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,503
right.

1632
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,138
they don't get us.

1633
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,673
they don't understand us.

1634
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,976
you know what I mean?

1635
01:15:57,978 --> 01:15:59,845
I know how it feels to be this close to jennifer lopez.

1636
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:00,898
I want to know what you think

1637
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,263
It feels like to be this close to your hero.

1638
01:16:03,374 --> 01:16:06,375
I mean, it seems--it's amazing, jennifer lopez.

1639
01:16:06,377 --> 01:16:08,744
I got a quick glance of you, and I just started crying 'cause

1640
01:16:08,746 --> 01:16:10,379
oh, my god.

1641
01:16:10,381 --> 01:16:12,247
oh, oh, my god.

1642
01:16:12,249 --> 01:16:14,583
Please don't cry. Oh, babe, come here.

1643
01:16:14,585 --> 01:16:16,719
why are you crying?

1644
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:21,023
But don't cry about it. Oh.

1645
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:23,659
'cause I was never planning to meet you this soon, you know.

1646
01:16:23,661 --> 01:16:26,829
just to be able to hug you

1647
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:29,465
And to see you, to know that you're really here with the rest

1648
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:32,835
Of us, it just makes me feel so good inside, jennifer lopez.

1649
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:37,873
But I'm gonna get it together, right?

1650
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:39,241
we got to get it together.

1651
01:16:39,243 --> 01:16:40,609
yes, ma'am.

1652
01:16:40,611 --> 01:16:42,745
you're a sweetie. Ful. Oh.

1653
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:46,014
you know how you know you're

1654
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:47,649
A megastar? When they say--when they call

1655
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:49,051
both names.

1656
01:16:49,053 --> 01:16:50,519
isn't that right, keith urban?

1657
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:53,055
that is, harry connick, jr.

1658
01:16:53,057 --> 01:16:54,757
I know, that's right.

1659
01:16:54,759 --> 01:16:57,526
we got it, jennifer lopez.

1660
01:16:57,528 --> 01:16:59,228
you're so sweet. Okay, baby.

1661
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,662
what are you gonna sing for

1662
01:17:00,664 --> 01:17:02,097
I want to sing one of your

1663
01:17:02,099 --> 01:17:03,465
okay.

1664
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:05,367
the hold it don't drop it. Okay.

1665
01:17:05,369 --> 01:17:08,404
you got me in the spirit. All right, go ahead.

1666
01:17:08,406 --> 01:17:09,371
â™?You don't know

1667
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:10,506
â™?What you're doing

1668
01:17:10,508 --> 01:17:13,242
â™?What you're doing to me

1669
01:17:13,244 --> 01:17:15,811
â™?Try to stop me â™?Can't stop me

1670
01:17:15,813 --> 01:17:20,048
â™?'cause you got what I need â™?You got me all open

1671
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:22,284
â™?And now you're trying â™?To leave

1672
01:17:22,286 --> 01:17:24,887
â™?Hold it, don't drop it â™?Can't stop it, stop it

1673
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:28,991
â™?Can't drop it, won't drop it sorry, it's all like, "Ooh!"

1674
01:17:28,993 --> 01:17:31,994
I know, it's coming out like that, but I promise it sounds a

1675
01:17:31,996 --> 01:17:35,731
Lot better. Oh, my god, you're so cute.

1676
01:17:35,733 --> 01:17:38,400
What do you think, keith? Oh, roland, you're just the

1677
01:17:38,402 --> 01:17:40,536
Sweetest spirit... oh, my goodness.

1678
01:17:40,538 --> 01:17:42,671
but it's a no for me. It's a no for me too.

1679
01:17:42,673 --> 01:17:44,506
I'm sorry, baby. â™?You don't know

1680
01:17:44,508 --> 01:17:47,810
â™?What you're doing â™?What you're doing to me

1681
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,346
no, I didn't make it. Oh.

1682
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:53,115
I know. It's just, when I seen her,

1683
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:55,184
It didn't come out. It was like, "Ah!" You know,

1684
01:17:55,186 --> 01:17:58,220
Like--but I got to hug her and everything, so that's--

1685
01:17:58,222 --> 01:18:00,422
I'm happy. It was a dream come true for

1686
01:18:00,424 --> 01:18:03,025
Him. He got to meet harry connick.

1687
01:18:03,027 --> 01:18:04,693
junior. You say the full name if

1688
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:07,563
You're a superstar. It's not every day keith

1689
01:18:07,565 --> 01:18:10,933
Urban, j.Lo, and... Harry connick, jr., gets to

1690
01:18:10,935 --> 01:18:12,568
Come see you sing. He had to think who you were

1691
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,169
For just a split second. I noticed, I noticed.

1692
01:18:14,171 --> 01:18:16,672
There's nothing like keith urban, jennifer lopez, and--

1693
01:18:16,674 --> 01:18:18,340
yeah, that guy.

1694
01:18:18,976 --> 01:18:22,811
what is that guy's name, the one--the new guy?

1695
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:27,282
j.Lo, keith urban, and, um--

1696
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:29,751
oh, he is? Yeah, henry--

1697
01:18:29,753 --> 01:18:33,589
mister... What is his name?

1698
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:36,124
Harry. Can you google him right now?

1699
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:37,926
I mean, I hope he doesn't see this and get offended, but I

1700
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:41,663
Didn't even know who he was. Hello, keith, jennifer.

1701
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:45,701
Hey! Harry connick, jr.

1702
01:18:45,703 --> 01:18:47,803
What a good-looking guy.

1703
01:18:47,805 --> 01:18:50,439
harry connick, jr.?

1704
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:51,373
yeah.

1705
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,709
I'm actually the biggest celebrity, which is why I'm

1706
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:57,279
Actually a hologram. I'm at home in my bedroom.

1707
01:18:57,281 --> 01:19:00,182
it rhymes with robert downey, jr., or something like that.

1708
01:19:00,184 --> 01:19:01,517
he's from louisiana. Is he black?

1709
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:03,218
no, he's white, but he sounds black.

1710
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,553
hey. Oh, my god.

1711
01:19:04,555 --> 01:19:07,022
I've been waiting for the last year, like, couple years to

1712
01:19:07,024 --> 01:19:08,690
Meet you. Let me guess.

1713
01:19:08,692 --> 01:19:10,292
Keith and jennifer. Probably j.Lo's gotten most

1714
01:19:10,294 --> 01:19:12,427
Of the attention today, but I read your wikipedia page every

1715
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:14,329
Day before going to sleep. Who are we talking about, me?

1716
01:19:14,331 --> 01:19:15,664
who, me? Me? Harry.

1717
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:16,999
really? See?

1718
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,333
I got one! It was you!

1719
01:19:18,335 --> 01:19:19,801
I got one! He's the guy that's been

1720
01:19:19,803 --> 01:19:21,303
Reading it. Cue the music.

1721
01:19:21,305 --> 01:19:23,305
You know who I am!

1722
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:27,075
oh!

1723
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:29,511
It's so nice. My dreams are coming true.

1724
01:19:29,513 --> 01:19:31,647
I'm touching you. There's something weird about

1725
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:33,148
That, harry. It's very weird.

1726
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:34,806
I could actually hear the music in my head.

1727
01:19:34,808 --> 01:19:36,407
yeah. It's all slow motion.

1728
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:38,409
it's all gonna happen. Could he actually sing while

1729
01:19:38,411 --> 01:19:40,011
You're holding him? That would be--

1730
01:19:40,013 --> 01:19:41,345
we could try that. Yeah.

1731
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:43,448
I'm up for that. How about this?

1732
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,184
If you blow us away on the first song, I'd like to pick you up

1733
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:47,885
And hold you like a baby on the second.

1734
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:52,657
that is a weird incentive.

1735
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:54,292
all right, baby, what you gonna sing for us?

1736
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:55,860
oh, my god! What's your name?

1737
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:58,396
munfarid zandi. And where you from?

1738
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:01,999
I'm from sugar land, texas, but I was born in lahore,

1739
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:04,469
Pakistan. I like how you said...

1740
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:06,103
I'm from texas and pakistan.

1741
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:08,773
It was like--that's my favorite part.

1742
01:20:08,775 --> 01:20:10,141
what song are you gonna do today?

1743
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:11,809
I'm doing crazy for you by adele.

1744
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:13,177
hit it.

1745
01:20:13,179 --> 01:20:17,482
all right.

1746
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,217
uh-oh, I'm getting my biceps warmed up, baby.

1747
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:20,518
that's right, you need to--

1748
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,220
â™?Found myself today

1749
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:23,988
â™?Singing out your loud

1750
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,922
â™?Your name

1751
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:27,525
â™?You said I'm crazy

1752
01:20:27,527 --> 01:20:28,493
â™?If I am

1753
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:30,761
â™?I'm crazy for you

1754
01:20:30,763 --> 01:20:33,498
â™?Sometimes sitting

1755
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,667
wow.

1756
01:20:36,669 --> 01:20:40,137
â™?Wishing you were here â™?Well, it's you

1757
01:20:40,139 --> 01:20:45,977
â™?Who makes me lose â™?My head

1758
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:48,079
check out how he's snapping.

1759
01:20:48,081 --> 01:20:52,216
â™?I keep on trying â™?Fighting these feelings away

1760
01:20:52,218 --> 01:21:00,791
â™?But the more I do â™?The crazier

1761
01:21:00,793 --> 01:21:02,660
okay.

1762
01:21:02,662 --> 01:21:04,161
I know.

1763
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:05,630
yes!

1764
01:21:05,632 --> 01:21:07,832
aww.

1765
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:09,333
there'll be music to

1766
01:21:09,335 --> 01:21:10,968
here we go. Okay.

1767
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,436
what are you gonna sing?

1768
01:21:12,438 --> 01:21:13,871
okay, what are you gonna sing for us now?

1769
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:15,373
okay, okay.

1770
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:17,108
there you go.

1771
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:18,943
You can put your head on my shoulder.

1772
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:20,878
uh...

1773
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,882
â™?I just want you close â™?Ooh

1774
01:21:24,884 --> 01:21:27,818

1775
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:36,527
â™?You can be sure

1776
01:21:36,529 --> 01:21:40,064
this is phenomenal. Give him his ticket.

1777
01:21:40,066 --> 01:21:41,732
harry, you've never sounded so good.

1778
01:21:41,734 --> 01:21:43,501
we'll see you in hollywood!

1779
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:48,105
I'm bringing him to my hotel.

1780
01:21:48,107 --> 01:21:50,641
I love you.

1781
01:21:50,643 --> 01:21:52,343

1782
01:21:52,345 --> 01:21:54,579

1783
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:57,982
'cause I love him.

1784
01:21:57,984 --> 01:22:00,585

1785
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:04,155
yeah.

1786
01:22:04,157 --> 01:22:05,890
and while munfarid celebrates

1787
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:07,992
His triumph, news arrives that

1788
01:22:07,994 --> 01:22:10,227
Keith urban's release fuse

1789
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:12,129
Topped the charts in not one,

1790
01:22:12,131 --> 01:22:14,198
But three countries.

1791
01:22:17,136 --> 01:22:20,171
â™?Hold me close â™?Don't let me go

1792
01:22:20,173 --> 01:22:21,806
Am I heavy now? Uh, pretty much.

1793
01:22:21,808 --> 01:22:23,474

1794
01:22:23,476 --> 01:22:26,611

1795
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:29,313
Celebrations for those headed to hollywood.

1796
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:33,884

Arkansas, louisiana,

1806
01:23:02,882 --> 01:23:07,218
My home state of georgia, and as far away as michigan,

1807
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,954
Making that 21 from the austin auditions.

1808

01:23:13,926 --> 01:23:18,496
Grand total of 45 going to hollywood.

1810
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:22,466

More big texas talent takes

Center stage for day two in

1815
01:23:31,044 --> 01:23:31,709
Austin.

1816
01:23:31,711 --> 01:23:33,811

you got a bit testy.

1824
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:54,127
sometimes good theater is scary.

1825
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,996
it's gonna be a good season.
