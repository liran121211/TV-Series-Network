People come from tiny little

5
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:21,865
True in a lot of ways. People come from tiny little towns.

6
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:22,598
People come from tiny little towns. They don't have the

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,367
Towns. They don't have the opportunities.

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:25,101
They don't have the opportunities. When we can give 'em that

9
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:25,693
Opportunities. When we can

10
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:26,670

opportunity and take that raw talent to the next level,

13
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:28,907
Opportunity and take that raw

00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,306
talent to the next level, that's what I love.

15
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,943
When the door closes, there's

When the door closes, there's no going back.

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,445
Brecken and bailey, I love

Give it to us. ?

38
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:26,964
What else could bring us to the mountains of northern utah...

39
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,098
The mountains of northern utah... heading out to salt lake to

40
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,600
Utah... heading out to salt lake to try out for american idol.

41
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:31,037

Than the chance of finding an

46
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:36,239
american superstar? When american idol came to

47
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:36,640
American superstar? When american

48
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,174
idol came to salt lake, I had to jump at the

49
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:37,986
When american idol came to salt lake,

50
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:38,709
I had to jump at the opportunity.

51
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,743
Salt lake, I had to jump at the opportunity.

52
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:42,813

Jennifer lopez.

60
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:59,195
No other show has really produced the stars like idol has.

61
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:01,031
Produced the stars like idol has. We really take the time to go

00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:04,044
We really take the time to go through so many people.

64
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:04,634
It's not a show that's cast like

00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:05,249
Through so many people. It's not

66
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,169
a show that's cast like some of the other shows.

67
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:06,500
It's not a show that's cast like

68
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,037
some of the other shows. I feel like this is the day

69
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,769
Some of the other shows. I feel

70
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,972
like this is the day that holds my destiny in hand.

71
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:09,601

Yeah.

192
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,276
The screams--I love that.

193
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:27,243
I went in there, and I was

194
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,044
I went in there, and I was talking to them, and she wasn't

195
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:28,560
I went in there, and I was talking to them,

196
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:28,979
and she wasn't smiling or anything.

197
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:29,645
Sure.

198
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:30,346
And then I started singing,

199
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,482
And then I started singing, and she was like...

200
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:33,820
And then I started singing, and she was like...

201
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:34,617
I was like, "Oh, thank god."

202
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,390
And she was like... I was like,

203
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:36,286
"Oh, thank god." Are you kidding me?

204
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:37,387
Each city has its own kinda

205
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,555
Each city has its own kinda feel to it, and that's so

206
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,723
Each city has its own kinda feel to it, and that's so exciting.

207
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:40,229
Feel to it, and that's so exciting.

Yeah, I like that.

?Right to my heart

231
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:16,200

233
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,108
?You can light up the dark ?Try

00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,638
as I may I could never ?Explain what I hear when you

235
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,452
?Try as I may I could never

236
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,676
?Explain what I hear when you ?Don't say a thing

237
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:33,410
All right!

238
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:34,277
Cool, cool.

239
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,178
As soon as you started

240
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,280
As soon as you started singing, it was like you had me

241
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:37,625
As soon as you started singing,

242
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:38,014
it was like you had me immediately.

243
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:38,682
Wow.

244
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:39,415
The fact that you, you know,

245
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,018
The fact that you, you know, use an axe for a living is

246
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,731
The fact that you, you know,

247
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,153
use an axe for a living is extremely intimidating to me.

248
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:43,954
I'm not trying to intimidate

249
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:44,487

250
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:45,288

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,322

I love your tone.

I love your tone. I love your vibrato.

314
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,115

00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:23,821
I mean, I know I'm a decent singer and everything,

319
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,254

Singer and everything, but I

321
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,155
didn't think I was good enough to be american idol.

322
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:28,624

to confidence because I think you're a lot better maybe

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,702
Regard to confidence because I think

Thank you.

1052
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,345

Not ed sheeran.

1054
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,048
No, not ed sheeran-y.

1055
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,582
No, no.

1056
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:08,283
No, no. You got your own thing going

1057
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,217
No, no. You got your own thing going on, man.

1058
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,084

looking down, and the hair is in the

1064
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:14,183
Musician thing going on, looking down,

and the hair is in the face, and all that kinda stuff,

and all that kinda stuff, which is kinda cool.

1068
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:16,958
Okay.

1069
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,626
But I would like too, to

1070
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,760
But I would like too, to kind of have you come out of

1071
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:19,201
But I would like too, to kind

00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:19,928
of have you come out of that shell a little bit.

1073
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,345
Kind of have you come out of

1074
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:21,029
that shell a little bit. You know what I mean?

1075
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:21,930
Yeah, I'm really working on

1076
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:22,897
Yeah, I'm really working on it, actually.

1077
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:23,732
Right.

1078
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:24,466
I kinda like it.

1079
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,199
Dj, is that--I mean, is that

1080
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,300
Dj, is that--I mean, is that what you want?

1081
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:26,753
Dj, is that--I mean, is that what you want?

1082
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:27,068
Some people are comfortable in

1083
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,803
What you want? Some people are comfortable in that spot.

1084
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:29,971
I love writing my own stuff.

1085
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,639
Yeah.

1086
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,305
And I love putting my own

1087
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,374
And I love putting my own spin on things 'cause, you

1088
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:33,675
And I love putting my own spin on things 'cause, you know--

1089
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:34,476
What do you think, baby?

1090
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,243
Yeah.

1091
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:36,745
Yeah. I just--I had mixed feelings

1092
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:37,546
Yeah. I just--I had mixed feelings the whole time 'cause there's

1093
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:37,903
I just--I had mixed feelings the whole

1094
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:38,380
time 'cause there's somethin' about your voice that

1095
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:38,716
The whole time 'cause there's

1096
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:39,247
somethin' about your voice that I really like.

1097
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:39,914
Yeah.

1098
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,749
But it was a balance between

1099
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,651
But it was a balance between sort of mysterious versus

1100
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,366
But it was a balance between

1101
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,386
sort of mysterious versus disinterested.

1102
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:45,987
Yeah.

1103
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,788
And it erred too much

1104
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,889
And it erred too much sometimes into the sort of

1105
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:48,558
And it erred too much sometimes

1106
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,591
into the sort of disinterested side, which makes

1107
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:50,389
Sometimes into the sort of disinterested side,

1108
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,892
which makes me disinterested.

1109
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:51,841
Disinterested side, which makes me disinterested.

1110
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:52,461
I got to find something riveting

1111
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:53,108
Me disinterested. I got to find

1112
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,129
something riveting in there that glues me to you.

1113
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:54,999
I got to find something riveting in

1114
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,365
there that glues me to you. And for me, it wasn't quite

1115
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:56,774
In there that glues me to you.

1116
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,331
And for me, it wasn't quite enough there.

1117
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,132
Okay.

1118
00:22:58,134 --> 00:22:58,900
I know exactly what you're

1119
00:22:58,902 --> 00:22:59,401
I know exactly what you're saying.

1120
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:00,101
Yeah.

1121
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:00,836
I was really lucky the other

1122
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,803
I was really lucky the other day 'cause I got a chance to do

1123
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:02,246
I was really lucky the other day

1124
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,004
'cause I got a chance to do this little thing with paul

1125
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,847
Day 'cause I got a chance to do this

1126
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,039
little thing with paul simon, and he does not move.

1127
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:05,835
This little thing with paul simon,

1128
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:06,841
and he does not move. He doesn't sing loud.

1129
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,280
Simon, and he does not move. He doesn't sing loud.

1130
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:09,143
But he also has 800 number one

1131
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:09,925
He doesn't sing loud. But he

1132
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:11,346
also has 800 number one songs that everybody knows.

1133
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:11,961
But he also has 800 number one songs

1134
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:12,814
that everybody knows. I'm out there jumping on the

1135
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:13,065
Songs that everybody knows.

1136
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:13,482
I'm out there jumping on the piano, I'm tap--

1137
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:14,248
Whoo!

1138
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,083
I'm doing--I mean, but that's

1139
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,451
I'm doing--I mean, but that's just--that's me.

1140
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:16,990
I'm doing--I mean, but that's just--that's me.

1141
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:17,318
And if you were a young paul

1142
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,004
Just--that's me. And if you

1143
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,120
were a young paul simon--like, I see exactly

1144
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:19,516
And if you were a young paul simon--like,

1145
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:19,921
I see exactly what you're saying 'cause it

1146
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:20,742
Simon--like, I see exactly what

1147
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,090
you're saying 'cause it borderlines on disinterest.

1148
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:22,757
Okay.

1149
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,425
Shall we vote?

1150
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:24,826
Shall we vote? I'm gonna say yes.

1151
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,027
Okay.

1152
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,596
I think there's a blossom to

1153
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:28,430
I think there's a blossom to be had here.

1154
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:29,564
Do you?

1155
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:32,534
I do. I really do.

1156
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:42,177
I'm still on the fence.

1157
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:51,185
You got it. Nice job, man. Congratulations, bro.

1158
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:52,487
Something interesting.

1159
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:54,222
Yeah. Even if it's a spark.

1160
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,290
Yeah. Even if it's a spark.

1161
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,191
Hello?

1162
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:57,926
Hey, dad.

1163
00:23:57,928 --> 00:23:59,628
Hey, dad. I made it to hollywood.

1164
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,430
There you go, baby!

1165
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:02,163
Yeah.

1166
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:03,398
That's my boy!

1167
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,299
Yeah.

1168
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,067
You may still be wondering

1169
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,137
What happened to julie awful.

1170
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,271
You be the judge.

1171
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:12,106
?I know you haven't made

1172
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:14,309
?Your minds up yet

1173
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,810
?But I would

1174
00:24:15,812 --> 00:24:18,447
?Never do you wrong

1175
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,048
?No

1176
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,782
?I've known it

1177
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:23,618
?From the moment that we met

1178
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,086
Hollywood or home?

1179
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,954
Chime in right now using the

1180
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,589
Hashtags below, and we'll see if

1181
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,890
You're right after the break.

1182
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,429
Before the break, we asked if

1183
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,164
Have good news or bad news for

1184
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,265
Julie awful.

1185
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,132
?No doubt in my mind

1186
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:39,434
?Where you belong

1187
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:39,968
Cute.

1188
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,736
I like your voice.

1189
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:43,272
It just wasn't--you just

1190
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,440
Didn't have the confidence to go

1191
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,876
Right.

1192
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:47,576
Now, I hate using that term

1193
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:48,110
Over and over again, but

1194
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,378
Sometimes that's what it is.

1195
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,012
Absolutely.

1196
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:50,812
There's enough of a pretty

1197
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:54,083
Voice there to maybe explore.

1198
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,183
I'm gonna say yes.

1199
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:56,251
I got to say no.

1200
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:59,455
Ooh. I can do this.

1201
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,056
I got this.

1202
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:02,958
I know you think you have it.

1203
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,326
I know you think you deserve

1204
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:09,298
Another shot, and I think that

1205
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,502
You deserve another shot, so

1206
00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:17,072
Welcome to hollywood.

1207
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:17,907
Whoo!

1208
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,074
He's a cruel person.

1209
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:19,741
Two yeses.

1210
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:20,342
I have to tell you something.

1211
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,343
Go ahead.

1212
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,144
My mom best friend--she's

1213
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,378

That's why this american idol

1388
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:20,002
Addiction. That's why this

1389
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:21,016
american idol has been so important to me, is

1390
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:21,889
That's why this american idol has been

1391
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,152
so important to me, is because I'm sober, and I'm doing

1392
00:29:23,154 --> 00:29:23,661
Has been so important to me, is because I'm sober,

Really, you know. Trying to see if I still... I love that.

Trying to see if I still... I love that. Got this, sober.

1414
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:42,271
I love that. Got this, sober. I believe in that.

1415
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:42,904
Got this, sober. I believe in that. Absolutely.

1416
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,572
I believe in that. Absolutely. Yeah.

1417
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,473
Absolutely. Yeah. Do you have support now?

1418
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:46,174
Yeah. Do you have support now? I do. Amazing support.

00:29:46,176 --> 00:29:47,142
Do you have support now? I do. Amazing support. Who from?

00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:48,577
I do. Amazing support. Who from? My family.

1421
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,181
Who from? My family. I was engaged, and then he was

1422
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:52,808
My family. I was engaged,

1423
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:53,983
and then he was not supportive of this american

1424
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:54,414
I was engaged, and then he was not

1425
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:55,084
supportive of this american idol thing, I think, just

1426
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:55,520
Not supportive of this american idol thing,

1427
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:55,985
I think, just because of everything we've been

1428
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:56,259
Idol thing, I think,

1429
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,886
just because of everything we've been through.

1430
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:57,657
Because of everything we've been through.

1431
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:58,220
And he said, "You do this, and

1432
00:29:58,222 --> 00:29:59,088
Through. And he said, "You do this, and we're done."

1433
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,689
Oh, did he think maybe he

1434
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,092
Oh, did he think maybe he would lose you to whatever

1435
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:03,577
Oh, did he think maybe he would

1436
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:04,326
lose you to whatever potential success you would

1437
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:05,027
Would lose you to whatever potential success you would have?

1438
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,128
Yeah, and, you know, he's a

1439
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,362
Yeah, and, you know, he's a really, really amazing man.

1440
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:08,184
Yeah, and, you know, he's a really,

1441
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,264
really amazing man. I just--I have to do this.

00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:09,626
Really, really amazing man.

I just--I have to do this. It's in me, you know.

00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:11,100
We know. We get that.

1445
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,268
You have to do it, so...

?With a broom in his hand

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,851
?In some dive across town

1457
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,922
?He'll be wiping the bar

1458
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:35,457
?And mopping the floor ?Counting his tips

1459
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,359
?And mopping the floor ?Counting his tips ?And locking the doors

1460
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,827
?Counting his tips ?And locking the doors ?Wrestling the devil

1461
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:39,596
?And locking the doors

1462
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:41,130
?Wrestling the devil ?That tells him to pour

1463
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,365
?Wrestling the devil ?That tells him to pour ?Another round

00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,866
?That tells him to pour ?Another round ?When the lights

we all find out ?When the lights go down

1478
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:09,524
Hmm.

1479
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,526
?When the lights go down

1480
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:12,228
Nice.

1481
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,662
Good. Nice control.

1482
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,696
I love your voice, baby.

1483
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:15,497
Thank you.

1484
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,265
I love that you sang that

1485
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,566
I love that you sang that song.

1486
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:18,633
Good control.

1487
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:20,970
I also love that you sang it

1488
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:22,904
I also love that you sang it very subdued, you know.

1489
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:23,560
I also love that you sang it very subdued,

1490
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,106
you know. You just kinda stayed--it

1491
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:24,839
Very subdued, you know. You just kinda stayed--it was good.

1492
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,607
Thank you.

1493
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:26,174
That was a good thing to do

1494
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:26,976
That was a good thing to do for me for that song.

1495
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:27,642
That takes a lot of

1496
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:28,310
That takes a lot of confidence.

1497
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:28,978
That takes a lot of confidence. I like that you had a lot of

1498
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,879
Confidence. I like that you had a lot of control there too.

1499
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:30,422
I like that you had a lot of control there too.

1500
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:30,779
It's hard to control your voice

1501
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:31,511
Control there too. It's hard to

1502
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:32,714
control your voice when you're singing that softly.

1503
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:33,391
It's hard to control your voice when

1504
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,516
you're singing that softly. So it was really, really pretty.

1505
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,185
Thank you.

1506
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,019
Yeah, I loved it.

1507
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,487
Yeah, I did too.

1508
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,189
Yeah, I did too. You know, what really spoke to

1509
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,080
Yeah, I did too. You know,

1510
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,791
what really spoke to me was you seem like a gentle

1511
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:43,495
You know, what really spoke to me

1512
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:44,559
was you seem like a gentle person who's found some

1513
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:45,227
Me was you seem like a gentle person who's found some happiness.

1514
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:45,761
Oh, thank you.

1515
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:46,561
And it was nice to couple

1516
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:47,529
And it was nice to couple that with the sound of your

1517
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,230
And it was nice to couple that with the sound of your voice.

1518
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:49,331
Thank you so much.

1519
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:49,999
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1520
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:50,665
Wow.

00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,366
And you feel good about all

1522
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,034
And you feel good about all this right now?

00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:52,701
I do.

1524
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:53,368
Yeah.

1525
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,036
And you would think--

1526
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:54,836
'cause she's still new, a

00:31:54,838 --> 00:31:55,670

both: YEAH.

1529
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,006
both: FRAGILE.

1530
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:57,672
Thank you.

1531
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:58,373
Raw.

1532
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,208
Raw. Raw is a good place to be for an

1533
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,874
Raw. Raw is a good place to be for an artist.

Yeah.

00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,276
It really is where the truth

1536
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:01,944
It really is where the truth comes out.

1537
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:02,711
Yeah. For real.

1538
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,679

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,219
Oh, my god! You guys. Thank you.

Well, you can't leave without

Okay, hold on.

Be up here. And what are you gonna sing?

1743
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:00,198
I'm gonna sing soulshine by

And what are you gonna sing?

1745
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,132
I'm gonna sing soulshine by the allman brothers.

1746
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,113
I'm gonna sing soulshine by the allman brothers.

1747
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:02,767
I want to dedicate it to my dad.

1748
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,502
Hit it.

1749
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:07,138
Hit it. ?

1750
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,873
?When you can't find

1751
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,008
?The light that guides you

1752
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,179
?Through a cloudy day

1753
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:19,250
?When the stars ain't shining ?Bright ?And it feels like you lost

1754
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:22,087
?Bright ?And it feels like you lost ?Your way

1755
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,954
?And it feels like you lost ?Your way ?When the candlelights

1756
00:37:23,956 --> 00:37:25,856
?Your way ?When the candlelights ?From home

1757
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:29,860
?When the candlelights ?From home ?Burn so very far away

1758
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:30,695
?From home ?Burn so very far away ?Yeah, sometimes

1759
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:33,364
?Burn so very far away ?Yeah, sometimes ?I get a cool wind

1760
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:34,199
?Yeah, sometimes ?I get a cool wind ?Burning through

1761
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,267
?I get a cool wind ?Burning through ?My aching bones

1762
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:37,768
?Burning through ?My aching bones ?I think back to what

1763
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,470
?My aching bones ?I think back to what ?My daddy said

1764
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:41,672
?I think back to what ?My daddy said ?He said, boy, in this life

1765
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:43,274
?My daddy said ?He said, boy, in this life ?Before the dawn

1766
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:45,443
?He said, boy, in this life ?Before the dawn ?Let your soul shine

1767
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:46,111
Hmm.

1768
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:49,680
?It's better than sunshine

1769
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:52,283
?It's better than sunshine ?It's better than moonshine

1770
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:53,602
?It's better than sunshine ?It's

1771
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,620
better than moonshine ?Damn sure better than rain

1772
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:56,187
Yeah, yeah.

1773
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:57,255
Yeah, yeah. Cool, man.

1774
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:58,156
Yeah, yeah. Cool, man. Beautiful.

1775
00:37:58,158 --> 00:37:58,889
Thank you, guys.

1776
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:00,558
You know, it wasn't perfect.

1777
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,226
You know, it wasn't perfect. It wasn't like--

1778
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:02,527
He sang it right to you.

1779
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,328
But I really liked it.

1780
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,129
Thank you.

1781
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:04,795
I like you.

1782
00:38:04,797 --> 00:38:05,397
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1783
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,197
I like that voice coming out

1784
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,698
I like that voice coming out of you.

1785
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,566
Thank you.

1786
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:09,334
And watching what you do.

1787
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:10,268
And watching what you do. And I don't know.

1788
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,915
And watching what you do. And I don't know.

1789
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:11,336
There was things that you do

1790
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:12,009
And I don't know.

1791
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,905
There was things that you do consistently wrong.

1792
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:14,705
I understand completely.

1793
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:15,773
But we could fix that.

1794
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:16,641
But we could fix that. I liked it.

1795
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:17,308
But we could fix that. I liked it. I liked it a lot.

1796
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,008
Yeah, I--

1797
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,709
I like you.

1798
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:19,744
Jennifer took the words out

1799
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:20,711
Jennifer took the words out of my mouth.

1800
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:21,182
Jennifer took the words out of my mouth.

1801
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:21,546
I think there's probably better

1802
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:21,976
Of my mouth. I think there's

1803
00:38:21,977 --> 00:38:22,680
probably better guitar players around, there's

1804
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:23,281
I think there's probably better guitar players around,

1805
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:23,714
there's probably better singers around.

1806
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:24,349
True.

1807
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,183
But there's something about

1808
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,218
But there's something about the entirety of what you are.

1809
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,627
But there's something about the

1810
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:28,286
entirety of what you are. It's really a--kind of a

1811
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:28,738
The entirety of what you are.

1812
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:29,454
It's really a--kind of a vibe that you have...

1813
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:30,188
Yes, sir.

1814
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,056
That was very pleasant.

1815
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,390
That was very pleasant. I mean, you had my attention

1816
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:32,949
That was very pleasant. I mean,

1817
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,758
you had my attention through the entire tune.

1818
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,160
How you doing?

1819
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:35,893
Anxious.

1820
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:36,594
Are you a little nervous, a

1821
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:37,428
Little anxious?

1822
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,329
Not nervous. Anxious.

1823
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:38,996
Anxious.

1824
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:39,697
Yeah.

1825
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,699
Yep.

1826
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:42,300
Yep. He deserves it more than anybody

1827
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:43,168
Yep. He deserves it more than anybody does.

1828
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,968
You know what it was for me?

1829
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,835
You know what it was for me? It's like you sing 'cause you

1830
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:45,194
You know what it was for me?

1831
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:45,936
It's like you sing 'cause you have to sing, not 'cause you

1832
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:46,421
It's like you sing 'cause you have to sing,

1833
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:46,737
not 'cause you want to sing.

1834
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:47,405
Mm.

1835
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:48,073
And I mean that in the

1836
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:48,739
And I mean that in the deepest way.

1837
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:49,740
You're right.

1838
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:50,508
And that's why it's so

1839
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,443
And that's why it's so believable and real.

1840
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:52,845
And that's why it's so believable and real.

1841
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:53,144
And it's greater than the sum of

1842
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:53,648
Believable and real. And it's

1843
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:54,412
greater than the sum of the parts, you know.

1844
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:55,480
Yep. I agree.

1845
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:56,247
It's just--I just believed

1846
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:57,015
It's just--I just believed it, and I felt it.

1847
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:57,715
Thanks, man.

1848
00:38:57,717 --> 00:38:58,516

All right.

1867

Nice touch on the guitar,

1868
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:21,039
Nice touch on the guitar, bro.

1869
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:21,839
Thanks, man.

1870
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:22,507
Yeah, man.

1871
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:23,208
I just gotta say when some

1872
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,175
I just gotta say when some people play, it feels like

1873
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:24,731
I just gotta say when some people play,

1874
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:25,343
it feels like there's more notes coming out

1875
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:26,017
People play, it feels like there's

1876
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,045
more notes coming out than when certain people play.

1877
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:27,812
Yeah, I know.

1878
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:28,380
It's like, "Wow!"

1879
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:29,247
Yeah, no, he's--he had a

1880
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:30,215
Yeah, no, he's--he had a nice rhythmic touch.

1881
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:31,016
That's a really good point to

1882
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:31,816
That's a really good point to make.

1883
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:32,355
That's a really good point to make.

1884
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:32,817
He sounds like he has to sing.

1885
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:33,584
Mm-hmm.

1886
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:34,319
Mm-hmm. It's a great--

1887
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:35,053
What about how he cried

1888
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,387
What about how he cried instantly?

1889
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:37,055
Oh, don't.

1890
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:38,623
He was, like, breaking my

1891
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,658
He was, like, breaking my heart.

1892
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:49,767
Oh, my goodness.

1893
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:59,610
Congratulations, man.

Congratulations, man. You did it. You got it.

I'm so happy, man. Words can't even explain.

This is for my family and

all the people who believed in me from day one.

1906

The people who believed in me from day one. Thank you.

2244
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:55,827
I chose to make it a belt.

2245
00:46:55,828 --> 00:46:57,315
They didn't like it, apparently. Oh, my god.

2246

What'd they say?

They loved my voice, and they

2262
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:53,204
They loved my voice, and they just said I'm not ready.

2263
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,472
She's almost there.

2264
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:55,874
Yeah, she's not ready.

2265
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,209
Yeah, she's not ready. The 90% of what it takes to be

2266
00:47:58,211 --> 00:47:59,311
Yeah, she's not ready. The 90%

2267
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:01,145
of what it takes to be a superstar is really a lot

2268
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:01,926
The 90% of what it takes to be a

2269
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:03,314
superstar is really a lot more than how talented you are.

2270
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:03,982
You okay?

2271
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:04,648
Mm-hmm.

It's getting up at 4:00 in

Interviews before you go to a photo shoot,

2279
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:10,989
before you go to a sound check, and then go on

2280
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,017
Photo shoot, before you

go to a sound check, and then go on stage.

2282
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:14,592
It's a no for me.

00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:15,393
Me too.

2284
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:16,427
I'm sorry, sweetie.

Fatigue, mental fatigue, missing family and friends,

and...it's a lot of mental energy as well,

2291
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:26,253
Family and friends, and...it's a

2292
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:27,771
lot of mental energy as well, and emotional maturity.

2293
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:28,125
A lot of mental energy as well,

2294
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:28,739
and emotional maturity. So I don't know how on earth I

2295
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:31,543
And emotional maturity. So I don't know how on earth I made it.

2296
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:32,876
Hello.

2297
00:48:32,878 --> 00:48:33,878

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,653
?She'll come in time

2302
00:48:42,655 --> 00:48:44,997

2306
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:53,932
?And without ?Your witty sarcasm ?This world would fall flat

2307
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:56,167
Thank you.

2308
00:48:56,169 --> 00:48:57,868
Thank you. It's a no from me.

2309
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,603
Thank you. It's a no from me. You're not quite ready.

2310
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,005
I disagree.

2311
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:05,844
I disagree. I'm gonna say yes.

2312
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:10,414
No, guys. Sorry.

2313
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,116
No, guys. Sorry. But it was a cool experience,

2314
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:12,853
No, guys. Sorry. But it was a cool experience,

2315
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:13,317
and it was fun meeting all of

2316
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,253
But it was a cool experience, and it was fun meeting all of them.

2317
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,588
You guys are crazy. Crazy.

2318
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,923
We let the big one slip away?

2319
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:20,324
I think you let a good one

2320
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:23,094
I think you let a good one slip away.

2321
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:24,795
When I started out, there was

2322
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:26,998
A tv talent show...

2323
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,699
I would like now to introduce

2324
00:49:28,701 --> 00:49:31,135
Keith urban, 16 years of age, a

2325
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:32,770
New face.

2326
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:37,909
I sang a song. ?I'm all out of love ?What am I without you

2327
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:38,362
?I'm all out of love ?What

2328
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:39,143
am I without you one of the judges was giving

2329
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:39,801
?What am I without you one of

2330
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:40,912
the judges was giving some constructive feedback.

2331
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:42,380
Keith, what actually showing

2332
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:43,381
Keith, what actually showing up in your voice is just some

2333
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:43,777
Keith, what actually showing up

2334
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:44,415
in your voice is just some immaturity, that's all.

2335
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:45,984
But it didn't faze me 'cause

2336
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:47,251
But it didn't faze me 'cause everyone's got an opinion, you

2337
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:48,086
But it didn't faze me 'cause everyone's got an opinion, you know.

2338
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,454
You have to do exercises.

2339
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:50,922
You have to do exercises. Now, either you get to a teacher

2340
00:49:50,924 --> 00:49:51,464
You have to do exercises. Now,

2341
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:52,490
either you get to a teacher or somebody like that who can

2342
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:53,061
Now, either you get to a teacher or

2343
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:53,925
somebody like that who can give you these intervals--

2344
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,259
You got to know what to

2345
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:57,228
You got to know what to discard 'cause we're just giving

2346
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:57,674
You got to know what to discard

2347
00:49:57,675 --> 00:49:58,462
'cause we're just giving our opinion, and I always say,

2348
00:49:58,464 --> 00:49:59,399
Discard 'cause we're just giving our opinion,

2349
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,231
and I always say, "It's just my opinion.

2350
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:00,610
Our opinion, and I always say,

2351
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:01,266
"It's just my opinion. I mean, what I say you should

2352
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:01,975
"It's just my opinion. I mean,

2353
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:03,201
what I say you should change, harry may say, 'that's

2354
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:03,623
I mean, what I say you should change,

2355
00:50:03,624 --> 00:50:04,202
harry may say, 'that's what I love about you, don't

2356
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:04,542
Change, harry may say,

2357
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,436
'that's what I love about you, don't change that at all.'"

2358
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:06,734
What I love about you, don't change that at all.'"

2359
00:50:06,735 --> 00:50:07,538
That can start helping you come

2360
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,180
Change that at all.'" That

2361
00:50:09,181 --> 00:50:12,210
can start helping you come to life as an artist.

2362
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:13,277
Would I have auditioned?

2363
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,513
Maybe.

2364
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:17,815
Maybe if it was around when I

2365
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:20,351
Was comin' up, but I don't know.

2366
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:21,519
From boogie-down bronx,

2367
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:25,056
Jennifer lopez.

2368
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,403
I don't know if I would have,

2369
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:28,492
you know--if that would have been my journey.

2370
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:29,481
You know--if that would have been my journey.

2371
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:30,161
I think my journey was meant to

2372
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:30,941
Been my journey. I think my

2373
00:50:30,942 --> 00:50:32,296
journey was meant to be in the way that it was.

2374
00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:35,399
?

2375
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:36,767
? I'm glad there was no american

2376
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:37,868
? I'm glad there was no american idol when I started out

2377
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:38,194
I'm glad there was no american

2378
00:50:38,195 --> 00:50:38,703
idol when I started out because I promise you I

2379
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:39,896
Idol when I started out

2380
00:50:39,897 --> 00:50:42,073
because I promise you I wouldn't have won.

2381
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,274
I don't think I would have

2382
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:44,609
Auditioned because of that.

2383
00:50:44,611 --> 00:50:49,213
There is no doubt that this fifth-grade student has a

2384
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,572
There is no doubt that this

2385
00:50:49,573 --> 00:50:50,314
fifth-grade student has a bright musical career ahead of

2386
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:51,082
Fifth-grade student has a bright musical career ahead of him.

2387
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:52,016
Which is why it's amazing to

Which is why it's amazing to me when I see these contestants

2389
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:53,882
Which is why it's amazing to me

2390

when I see these contestants come in and they audition.

Me when I see these

2392
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,653
contestants come in and they audition. It's hard.

2393
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:56,387
Do you think you'll be a

2394
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,856
Do you think you'll be a professional musician?

2395
00:50:57,858 --> 00:50:59,323
If I practice hard enough.

2396
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:02,260
If I practice hard enough. But now we need american idol.

I've been dreaming about being on american idol ever since I

Huh.

2586
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:55,459
Listen to a lot of blues

2587
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:56,127
Listen to a lot of blues stuff.

2588
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:56,961
Listen to a lot of blues stuff. I listen to all kinds of music.

00:54:57,863 --> 00:54:58,662
I like the mix of all those

2591
00:54:58,664 --> 00:54:59,330
I like the mix of all those things in your voice.

2592
00:54:59,332 --> 00:54:59,864
Thank you.

00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:00,664

2594
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:01,332
I can hear the blues influence...

2595
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:02,000
Thank you.

2596
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:02,700

And the bluegrass, country, all of it in there.

2598
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,035
Thank you.

2599
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:04,702
I loved when you were

2600
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:05,369
I loved when you were playing, I was like, wait a

2601
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:06,004
I loved when you were playing, I was like, wait a minute.

2602
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:06,837
Playing, I was like, wait a minute. It's kinda like doin' this

2603
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:07,505
Minute. It's kinda like doin' this thing the way he was playing

2604
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:07,778
It's kinda like doin' this

2605
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:08,206
thing the way he was playing and singing.

2606
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:09,207
Thing the way he was playing and singing. You know what I mean?

2607
00:55:09,209 --> 00:55:10,108
And singing. You know what I mean? There was something about it

2608
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,509
You know what I mean? There was

2609
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,142
something about it that was off the rhythm to me.

2610
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:11,489
There was something about it that was

2611
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:11,976
off the rhythm to me. I was almost gonna look at you

2612
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:12,329
That was off the rhythm to me. I

2613
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:12,911
was almost gonna look at you and say--'cause I didn't

2614
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:13,195
I was almost gonna look at you

2615
00:55:13,196 --> 00:55:13,677
and say--'cause I didn't know the song--I was like,

2616
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:14,115
And say--'cause I didn't know

2617
00:55:14,116 --> 00:55:14,778
the song--I was like, "Is he off the rhythm?

2618
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,330
Know the song--I was like, "Is he off the rhythm?

2619
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:15,679
Or is he just playing, and it's

2620
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:16,074
"Is he off the rhythm? Or is he just playing,

2621
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:16,380
and it's really amazing right now?"

2622
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:17,081
He was just groovin'.

2623
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:17,748
Yeah.

2624
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,416
Thank you.

2625
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:19,150
By the way, I did think that

2626
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:20,952
By the way, I did think that too.

2627
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:21,752
By the way, I did think that too. But that's what it felt like to

2628
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:22,453
Too. But that's what it felt like to me.

2629
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:23,922
But that's what it felt like to me. It was really impressive.

2630
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:24,822
Thank you.

2631
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:26,057
You just seem like the kinda

2632
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,126
You just seem like the kinda guy who sings to get through the

2633
00:55:28,128 --> 00:55:28,567
You just seem like the

2634
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:29,427
kinda guy who sings to get through the day.

2635
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:29,972
Guy who sings to get through the day.

2636
00:55:29,973 --> 00:55:30,428
And you happen to sing well and

2637
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,095
Day. And you happen to sing well and play well.

2638
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:31,762
Thank you.

2639
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:32,730
And I love the idea of that.

2640
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:33,397
Thank you.

2641
00:55:33,399 --> 00:55:34,098
I just think it's--you

2642
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,266
I just think it's--you know, it sounds very authentic

2643
00:55:35,268 --> 00:55:36,067
I just think it's--you know, it sounds very authentic to me.

2644
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:37,268
I'm gonna say yes.

2645
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,069
Yes!

2646
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:38,736
I'm gonna say yes too.

2647
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:39,304
Thank you!

2648
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:40,104
Yes for me too.

2649
00:55:40,106 --> 00:55:40,738
Yeah!

2650
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,439
All right.

2651
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:42,106
Thank you.

2652
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:44,475
Dexter!

2653
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:45,609
Good to meet you, man.

2654
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:46,610
Yeah, dex.

2655
00:55:46,612 --> 00:55:47,578
Thank you. Thank you.

2656
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,312
Yeah, man, nice to meet you.

2657
00:55:48,314 --> 00:55:51,649
Thank you.

2658
00:55:51,651 --> 00:55:52,616
I see somethin'.

2659
00:55:52,618 --> 00:55:53,251
To hollywood, boys!

2660
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:53,952
I see somethin'.

2661
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:54,618
Yes!

2662
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,286
Congratulations, man.

2663
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:55,954
Thank you. Thank you.

2664
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:57,121
Good job in there.

2665
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:58,056
I guess 'cause I don't play,

2666
00:55:58,058 --> 00:55:59,590
I guess 'cause I don't play, it seems like a miracle to me.

2667
00:55:59,592 --> 00:55:59,828
I guess 'cause I don't play, it

2668
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:00,225
seems like a miracle to me. Do you know what I mean?

2669
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:00,555
It seems like a miracle to me. Do

2670
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:01,092
you know what I mean? When you can play on one beat...

2671
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:01,893
It is--it's cool.

2672
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:03,061
And sing on the other beat.

2673
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:04,062
Harry's good at that.

2674
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:04,896
Keith's pretty darn good at

2675
00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:05,563
Keith's pretty darn good at it too.

2676
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:06,330
I guess it's like dancing a

2677
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:07,165
I guess it's like dancing a little bit, when you're dancing,

2678
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,461
I guess it's like dancing a little bit,

2679
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:07,831
when you're dancing, doing one thing and singing.

2680
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:08,766
It's exactly like that.

2681
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:09,533
Why do you think they put you

2682
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:10,634
Why do you think they put you through?

2683
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:13,171
Because I've worked hard, and

2684
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:14,072
Because I've worked hard, and I've paid my dues, and I think

2685
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:15,947
Because I've worked hard, and I've paid my dues,

2686
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:17,041
and I think this is my shot.

2687
00:56:21,592 --> 00:56:24,924
When you have a completely open mind

2688
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:27,180
and a performer comes in and pours their heart out...

2689
00:56:27,181 --> 00:56:29,481
?At last

2690
00:56:29,483 --> 00:56:30,916
?Mm

2691
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,410
?Since my love

2692
00:56:33,412 --> 00:56:42,253
And each moment is treated individually.

2693
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:47,157
?Life is like a song

2694
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:48,892
?Life is like a song ?Oh yeah

2695
00:56:48,894 --> 00:56:50,327
I like your voice.

2696
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:51,262
Thank you.

2697
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:52,663
I feel like, gosh, you just

2698
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:54,265
I feel like, gosh, you just need a little more time, baby.

2699
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:54,965
Can I sing another song for

2700
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:55,632
Can I sing another song for you?

2701
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:56,900
No, I don't think so.

2702
00:56:56,902 --> 00:56:57,634
No, I don't think so. I disagree with keith.

2703
00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:58,302
Do you?

2704
00:56:58,304 --> 00:56:59,069
I think you could do really

2705
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:00,271
I think you could do really great.

2706
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:01,638
I like the whole concept of

2707
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,539
I like the whole concept of diamond in the rough.

2708
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:03,940
Yeah.

2709
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:05,909
But there was too much rough.

2710
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:07,378
Okay.

2711
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,545
I think you need a little bit

2712
00:57:08,547 --> 00:57:09,880
I think you need a little bit more time.

2713
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:11,948
I don't think so.

2714
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,783
I don't think so. Okay.

2715
00:57:12,785 --> 00:57:13,717
I don't think so. Okay. I think we should vote.

2716
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:14,651
It's a no for me.

2717
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:15,286
Okay.

2718
00:57:15,288 --> 00:57:16,086
I'm gonna say yes.

2719
00:57:16,088 --> 00:57:16,886
And it's a no for me.

2720
00:57:16,888 --> 00:57:17,588
And it's a no for me. I'm sorry.

2721
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,289
Oh...

2722
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,856
Thank you, guys.

2723
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:20,857
Baby, come back again, huh?

2724
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:21,825
Okay. Thanks.

2725
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:23,294
Yeah, you bet, ally.

2726
00:57:23,296 --> 00:57:24,227
Hopefully, our next

2727
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:25,496
Hopefully, our next contestant can catch the judges'

2728
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:26,563
Hopefully, our next contestant can catch the judges' attention.

My name is briston maroney.

Sit. Sit. Music in my family is really number one priority.

Music in my family is really

2736
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:38,008
number one priority. Music is family for us.

2737
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:38,853
Number one priority. Music is family for us.

2738
00:57:38,854 --> 00:57:39,410
It started off with my great,

Recording artist in nashville.

The guitar that I play was his, and it's been passed down

2747
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:46,879
The guitar that I play was his,

2748

and it's been passed down through each generation in my

Everybody.

They walk in, I know."

3097
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,143
When eddie vedder sings, I-- that

3098
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:02,709
really is eddie vedder. I just don't believe that's your

3099
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:03,100
That really is eddie vedder.

3100
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:03,643
I just don't believe that's your voice.

3101
01:05:03,645 --> 01:05:04,577
I just don't believe that's your voice. I think you're highly

3102
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:05,378
Voice. I think you're highly impressionable because of your

3103
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,419
I think you're highly impressionable

3104
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,747
because of your age, which is--you have to be.

3105
01:05:07,749 --> 01:05:08,043
Impressionable because of your age,

3106
01:05:08,044 --> 01:05:08,515
which is--you have to be. I think you're doing the right

3107
01:05:08,517 --> 01:05:08,814
Age, which is--you have to be.

3108
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:09,182
I think you're doing the right thing.

3109
01:05:09,184 --> 01:05:09,949
I think you're doing the right thing.

3110
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:10,550
You're emulating your heroes.

3111
01:05:10,552 --> 01:05:11,584
Thing. You're emulating your heroes. But I think you're--it's a

3112
01:05:11,586 --> 01:05:12,024
You're emulating your heroes.

3113
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:12,885
But I think you're--it's a little premature for you to be

3114
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:13,502
But I think you're--it's a little

3115
01:05:13,503 --> 01:05:14,454
premature for you to be in american idol right now.

3116
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:14,870
Little premature for you to

3117
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:15,622
be in american idol yeah, I think the same thing,

3118
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:16,489
In american idol yeah, I think the same thing, johnny.

3119
01:05:16,491 --> 01:05:17,557
Yeah, I think the same thing, johnny. My advice always is, like,

3120
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:18,046
Johnny. My advice always is,

3121
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:18,691
like, perhaps sometimes you listen to

3122
01:05:18,693 --> 01:05:19,126
My advice always is, like,

3123
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:20,160
perhaps sometimes you listen to a lot of different people, and

3124
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:20,630
Perhaps sometimes you listen to a lot

3125
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:21,328
of different people, and you start bringing in elements

3126
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:21,869
A lot of different people, and you

3127
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:22,695
start bringing in elements to create your own thing.

3128
01:05:22,697 --> 01:05:23,055
You start bringing in elements

3129
01:05:23,056 --> 01:05:23,630
to create your own thing. I mean, that can work.

3130
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:24,003
To create your own thing. I mean,

3131
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:24,464
that can work. I'm just saying otherwise,

3132
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:25,090
I mean, that can work. I'm just saying otherwise,

3133
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:25,498
you're gonna end up sounding too

3134
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,901
I'm just saying otherwise,

3135
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:26,766
you're gonna end up sounding too derivative of somebody.

3136
01:05:26,768 --> 01:05:27,434
Yeah.

3137
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:28,801
Yeah. No, I think it's impressive that

3138
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:29,937
Yeah. No, I think it's impressive that you sing like that.

3139
01:05:29,939 --> 01:05:30,419
No, I think it's impressive that

3140
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,171
you sing like that. I think what I was waiting for

3141
01:05:31,173 --> 01:05:31,675
You sing like that. I think

3142
01:05:31,676 --> 01:05:32,605
what I was waiting for was to see more of a range.

3143
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:33,840
Could I try one more?

3144
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:34,674
Could I try one more? I think I could change your

3145
01:05:34,676 --> 01:05:35,342
Could I try one more? I think I could change your mind.

3146
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:37,777
Change my mind. Go ahead.

3147
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:41,048
?

3148
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,382
? ?Never would have hitchhiked

3149
01:05:42,384 --> 01:05:43,817
? ?Never would have hitchhiked ?To birmingham

3150
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:45,385
?Never would have hitchhiked ?To birmingham ?If it hadn't been

3151
01:05:45,387 --> 01:05:47,287
?To birmingham ?If it hadn't been ?For love

3152
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:48,621
?If it hadn't been ?For love ?Never would have run

3153
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:50,157
?For love ?Never would have run ?Through the blinding rain

3154
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:50,702
?Never would have run

3155
01:05:50,703 --> 01:05:51,892
?Through the blinding rain ?Without one dollar

3156
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:53,193
?Through the blinding rain ?Without one dollar ?To my name

3157
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:54,594
?Without one dollar ?To my name ?If it hadn't been

3158
01:05:54,596 --> 01:05:55,996
?To my name ?If it hadn't been ?If it hadn't been

3159
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:59,366
?If it hadn't been ?If it hadn't been ?For love

3160
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:01,902
?If it hadn't been ?For love ?Four cold walls

3161
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:05,005
?For love ?Four cold walls ?Without parole

3162
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,172
I think he's too good to say

3163
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:06,907
I think he's too good to say no to.

3164
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:08,108
?Oh, lord, have mercy

3165
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,509
He's too good at it to say no

3166
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:10,277
He's too good at it to say no to.

3167
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:12,312
You know what?

3168
01:06:12,314 --> 01:06:12,980
You know what? You did change my mind.

3169
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:13,646
What?

3170
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:14,447
Because you're too good at

3171
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:15,782
Because you're too good at what you're doing to say no to.

3172
01:06:15,784 --> 01:06:16,739
Because you're too good at what

3173
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,218
you're doing to say no to. So it's a yes for me.

3174
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,319
I think you look really

3175
01:06:19,321 --> 01:06:20,553
I think you look really scared, and it's more than

3176
01:06:20,555 --> 01:06:21,187
I think you look really scared, and it's more than nerves.

3177
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:22,089
Scared, and it's more than nerves. I just don't think you've had

3178
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:23,991
Nerves. I just don't think you've had enough experience playing.

3179
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:24,307
I just don't think you've had

3180
01:06:24,308 --> 01:06:24,892
enough experience playing. And I still stick to what I

3181
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:25,692
Enough experience playing. And I still stick to what I said.

3182
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:26,526
And I still stick to what I said. I think it's derivative, which

3183
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:27,827
Said. I think it's derivative, which is fine, but I don't think

3184
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:28,291
I think it's derivative, which is fine,

3185
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:28,861
but I don't think you're ready yet, so it's a no

3186
01:06:28,863 --> 01:06:31,498
Is fine, but I don't think you're ready yet, so it's a no for me.

3187
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,332
It's up to you, keith.

3188
01:06:32,334 --> 01:06:33,000
Aw!

3189
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:34,201
To crush this kid's dreams.

3190
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:35,501
Man! What?

3191
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:36,669
Or to let him through.

3192
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,570
Or to let him through. It's up to you.

3193
01:06:37,572 --> 01:06:38,238
You know what?

3194
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,039
You know what? If you have a real dream, it's

3195
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:39,706
You know what? If you have a real dream, it's un-crushable.

3196
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,155
If you have a real dream, it's un-crushable.

3197
01:06:40,156 --> 01:06:40,440
I just want everyone to hear

3198
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:41,441
Un-crushable. I just want everyone to hear that clearly.

3199
01:06:41,443 --> 01:06:44,611
I just want everyone to hear that clearly. Um...

3200
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:48,281
One more shot.

3201
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:49,516
It's a yes for me, johnny.

3202
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:50,483
Yay!

3203
01:06:50,485 --> 01:06:51,151
Thank you so much.

3204
01:06:51,153 --> 01:06:51,851
Bring it in hollywood, man!

3205
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:52,552
Hollywood!

3206
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:53,686
You've got to bring it.

3207
01:06:53,688 --> 01:06:54,354
Got to loosen up.

3208
01:06:54,356 --> 01:06:55,188
Can I shake y'all's hands?

3209
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:55,855
Absolutely.

3210
01:06:55,857 --> 01:06:56,589
You got to loosen up, because

3211
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:57,958
You got to loosen up, because all we have--the music is

3212
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,794
You got to loosen up, because all

3213
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:00,060
we have--the music is there, the lyrics are there.

3214
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:00,556
All we have--the music is there,

3215
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:01,361
the lyrics are there. All we bring to it is feeling,

3216
01:07:01,363 --> 01:07:01,704
There, the lyrics are there.

3217
01:07:01,705 --> 01:07:02,229
All we bring to it is feeling, as a singer.

3218
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:02,930
Thank you so much.

3219
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:03,630
You're welcome.

3220
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:04,497
You're welcome. If you don't have that, you have

3221
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:05,565
You're welcome. If you don't have that, you have nothing.

3222
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,667
He's comin'.

3223
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:09,369
He's comin'. You ready?

3224
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:10,570
Yeah, baby!

3225
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,172
Yeah, baby! It's a celebration!

3226
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:14,274
Yes, it is.

3227
01:07:14,276 --> 01:07:15,075
Yes, it is. You did it.

3228
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:16,109
I almost didn't get through,

3229
01:07:16,111 --> 01:07:16,977
I almost didn't get through, but--

3230
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:18,611
But you did.

3231
01:07:18,613 --> 01:07:20,080
You got to get it together,

3232
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:22,215
You got to get it together, whatever they told you, man.

3233
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:23,316
Next.

3234
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:24,351
I would eat a box of oreos...

3235
01:07:24,353 --> 01:07:25,518
You sound like a dentist.

3236
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,753
Just to go to the dentist and

3237
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:27,587
Just to go to the dentist and have you clean my teeth.

3238
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:28,255
It's business.

3239
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:28,989
If that's what my dentist

3240
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:29,789
If that's what my dentist looked like, I'd eat a box of

3241
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:30,660
If that's what my dentist looked like,

3242
01:07:30,661 --> 01:07:31,758
I'd eat a box of oreos just to go to the dentist

3243
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,087
Looked like, I'd eat a box of oreos

3244
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:32,592
just to go to the dentist and have you clean my teeth.

3245
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:33,260
Absolutely.

3246
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:34,027
If that's what my dentist

3247
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:34,694
If that's what my dentist looked like.

3248
01:07:34,696 --> 01:07:35,362
Every time.

3249
01:07:35,364 --> 01:07:36,163
I'd eat a box of oreos.

3250
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:37,130
You'd rip them out, actually.

3251
01:07:37,132 --> 01:07:37,797
Yes. Absolutely.

3252
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:38,565
You'd be pulling your own

3253
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:39,232
You'd be pulling your own teeth.

3254
01:07:39,234 --> 01:07:40,200
Hello, sweet pea.

3255
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:40,868
Hello.

3256
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:41,534
Hi, baby.

3257
01:07:41,536 --> 01:07:42,202
Hi.

3258
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:43,536
Hi. I'm kimberly toste.

3259
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:45,638
So have you performed before?

3260
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,806
I trained in opera.

3261
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:47,607
Okay.

3262
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:48,275
For many years.

3263
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,142
Okay.

3264
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:50,077
What are you gonna sing?

3265
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,278
I'm gonna sing barracuda by

3266
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,945

?From the pain you drove ?In the heart of me ?The love we share

3435
01:11:01,937 --> 01:11:05,005
?In the heart of me ?The love we share ?Seems to go nowhere

3436
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:08,075
?The love we share ?Seems to go nowhere ?And I've lost my life

3437
01:11:08,077 --> 01:11:09,742
?Seems to go nowhere ?And I've lost my life ?For I toss and turn

3438
01:11:09,744 --> 01:11:10,388
?And I've lost my life

3439
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:11,678
?For I toss and turn ?I can't sleep at night

3440
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,579
Thank you. Thank you.

3441
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:13,746
Mm.

3442
01:11:13,748 --> 01:11:15,248
Boy, I wish I could make

3443
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,249
Boy, I wish I could make people be quiet in my house when

3444
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:16,711
Boy, I wish I could make people

3445
01:11:16,712 --> 01:11:17,484
be quiet in my house when I raise my hand like that.

3446
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:17,777
People be quiet in my house

3447
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:18,285
when I raise my hand like that. It never works.

3448
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:19,186
I raise my hand like that. It never works. I try all the time.

3449
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:19,920
It never works. I try all the time. That was amazing.

3450
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,088
I try all the time. That was amazing. I felt very powerful.

3451
01:11:21,957 --> 01:11:23,123
Here's what I think.

3452
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,457
Here's what I think. I think you're a talented young

3453
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:25,358
Here's what I think. I think

3454
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:27,094
you're a talented young woman, but your vocals I don't

3455
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:27,797
I think you're a talented young woman,

3456
01:11:27,798 --> 01:11:28,795
but your vocals I don't think are strong enough to get

3457
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:29,231
Woman, but your vocals I don't

3458
01:11:29,232 --> 01:11:29,897
think are strong enough to get you to the end.

3459
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:30,906
Think are strong enough to get you to the end.

3460
01:11:30,907 --> 01:11:31,498
So while keith and jennifer

3461
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,267
You to the end. So while keith

3462
01:11:32,268 --> 01:11:33,367
and jennifer comment, I'm gonna think about

3463
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:34,501
So while keith and jennifer comment, I'm gonna think about it.

3464
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:35,335
Yeah.

3465
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:36,603
Yeah. You have a god-given voice.

3466
01:11:36,605 --> 01:11:38,371
Yeah. You have a god-given voice. It just was very inconsistent.

3467
01:11:38,373 --> 01:11:39,028
You have a god-given voice. It just

3468
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:40,040
was very inconsistent. So it's gonna be hard to say no

3469
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:40,545
It just was very inconsistent. So it's

3470
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,274
gonna be hard to say no to you, but also, you're making

3471
01:11:41,276 --> 01:11:42,372
So it's gonna be hard to say no to you,

3472
01:11:42,373 --> 01:11:43,610
but also, you're making it tough to say yes.

3473
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:44,611
Here's the thing for me.

3474
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:45,913
Here's the thing for me. It's like I felt like something

3475
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:46,893
Here's the thing for me. It's like

3476
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:48,448
I felt like something was disconnecting this beautiful

3477
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:49,385
It's like I felt like something was

3478
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:50,883
disconnecting this beautiful voice of yours with your...

3479
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:52,019
Delivery.

3480
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:53,120
Your being.

3481
01:11:53,122 --> 01:11:54,654
Your being. You've got real talent, and I

3482
01:11:54,656 --> 01:11:55,174
Your being. You've got real talent,

3483
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:55,722
and I just think you need to get your

3484
01:11:55,724 --> 01:11:56,225
You've got real talent, and I just think

3485
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:56,889
you need to get your confidence back, and I'd love to

3486
01:11:56,891 --> 01:11:57,362
Just think you need to get your confidence back,

3487
01:11:57,363 --> 01:11:57,657
and I'd love to give you that.

3488
01:11:57,659 --> 01:11:58,472
Confidence back, and I'd love to give you that.

3489
01:11:58,473 --> 01:11:58,992
So for me, it's a yes tonight.

3490
01:11:58,994 --> 01:11:59,892
It's a yes for me too.

It's a yes for me too.

It's a yes for me too. I really feel you need to

3493
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:03,763
It's a yes for me too. I really feel you need to practice.

3494
01:12:03,765 --> 01:12:04,464
Please go get your dad.

3495

Can I meet your dad?

3496
01:12:05,567 --> 01:12:06,633

01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:46,078
?Or should I just ?Keep chasing pavements

01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:47,367
?Even if it leads nowhere

?Keep chasing pavements ?Even

3577

if it leads nowhere ?Or would it be a waste

3578
01:13:49,571 --> 01:13:50,577
?Even if it leads nowhere ?Or

01:13:50,578 --> 01:13:52,105
would it be a waste ?Even if I knew my place

01:13:52,107 --> 01:13:53,275
?Or would it be a waste ?Even

3581
01:13:53,276 --> 01:13:55,008
if I knew my place ?Should I leave it there

01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:55,603
?Even if I knew my place

?Keep chasing pavements ?Even if it ?Leads nowhere

3588
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:06,719
Ooh.

3589
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:07,587
Frankly, I don't think you're

3590
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:09,422
Frankly, I don't think you're ready.

3591
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:10,248
Frankly, I don't think you're ready.

3592
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:10,958
I thought it was all right, but

3593
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,464
Ready. I thought it was all right,

3594
01:14:11,465 --> 01:14:11,925
but if you're gonna sing all of

3595
01:14:11,927 --> 01:14:12,736
I thought it was all right, but if

3596
01:14:12,737 --> 01:14:14,094
you're gonna sing all of those runs, there are people who

3597
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:14,967
If you're gonna sing all of those runs,

3598
01:14:14,968 --> 01:14:16,063
there are people who are better than you at that.

3599
01:14:16,065 --> 01:14:18,031
And you missed too many of 'em

3600
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,699
For me.

3601
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:22,169
Yeah, I just thought I'd add

3602
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:23,537
Yeah, I just thought I'd add a different taste to it.

3603
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:24,404
I got you.

3604
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:25,205
Yeah.

3605
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:26,406

All right. Like halfway

3865
01:20:01,805 --> 01:20:02,744
through that you got frustrated with something.

3866
01:20:02,746 --> 01:20:03,068
Like halfway through that you got

3867
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:03,645
frustrated with something. And then I thought you channeled

3868
01:20:03,647 --> 01:20:03,999
Got frustrated with something.

3869
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,611
And then I thought you channeled it into your voice.

3870
01:20:04,613 --> 01:20:05,146
And then I thought you channeled

3871
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:05,880
it into your voice. It was really appealing.

3872
01:20:05,882 --> 01:20:07,348
It into your voice. It was really appealing. I was feeling it.

3873
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,958
It was really appealing. I was feeling it.

3874
01:20:07,959 --> 01:20:08,349
I just can't help but think

3875
01:20:08,351 --> 01:20:09,066
I was feeling it. I just can't

3876
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:10,117
help but think about my children and my life

3877
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:10,486
I just can't help but think

3878
01:20:10,487 --> 01:20:11,085
about my children and my life and my family.

3879
01:20:11,087 --> 01:20:12,586
About my children and my life and my family. Yeah, I get it, man.

3880
01:20:12,588 --> 01:20:13,454
And my family. Yeah, I get it, man. What'd you think, jen?

01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:16,858
What'd you think, jen? I love you. Everything wasn't 100% perfect

3883
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,230
I love you. Everything wasn't

3884
01:20:17,231 --> 01:20:17,792
100% perfect throughout the whole thing, but

3885
01:20:17,794 --> 01:20:18,252
Everything wasn't 100% perfect

3886
01:20:18,253 --> 01:20:19,093
throughout the whole thing, but it had so much feeling.

3887
01:20:19,095 --> 01:20:19,792
Throughout the whole thing, but

3888
01:20:19,793 --> 01:20:20,962
it had so much feeling. There is a real voice there.

3889
01:20:20,964 --> 01:20:21,726
It had so much feeling. There is a real voice there.

3890
01:20:21,727 --> 01:20:22,196
I believed what you were saying.

3891
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:22,500
There is a real voice there.

01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:23,030
I believed what you were saying. I just loved it.

3893
01:20:23,032 --> 01:20:23,931
I believed what you were saying. I just loved it. I really did.

01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:26,400
really felt like I was watching a performance, and I

3897
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:26,750
I really, really felt like

3898
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:27,368
I was watching a performance, and I was in it.

3899
