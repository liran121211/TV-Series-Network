00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:35,078
That sounded beautiful.

526
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,914
I'll try to keep my
twang out of the song.

527
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:40,584
The chemistry appeared to be
working, but not for everyone.

528
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,286
♪ Get ready ♪

529
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,021
Can you project it a little more?

530
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:48,592
After moving to the convention center,
the group made a shocking decision.

531
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,461
We just had to kick one
of our group members out.

532
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:55,032
Like, I'm a stickler for, like,
people holding their notes.

533
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,333
I'm so sorry.

534
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,034
Mm-hmm.

535
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:58,268
I'm... I'm so sorry.

536
00:20:58,336 --> 00:20:59,937
It's okay.

537
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,206
Y'all have fun, okay?

538
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:02,873
I'm sorry.

539
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,074
It's okay, it's okay.

540
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:05,609
I want you.

541
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:08,712
I think, like, adding jacee
might be the wrong thing to do

542
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,180
as far as, like, choreography.

543
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:10,981
I liked him.

544
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:11,782
Yeah.

545
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:12,449
He's a good singer.

546
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:14,952
He's a good singer, don't get me
wrong, but... I liked him a lot.

547
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:17,154
[Laughs]

548
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:21,892
Now, as 1:00 A.M. approaches,
jacee must find another ensemble.

549
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,627
I mean... yeah.

550
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:24,361
Why?

551
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:24,995
I don't know.

552
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,064
Just, like, what
are y'all singing?

553
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,967
We were ready to just get
working but, um, they decided

554
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:33,837
that they don't want me in
it anymore, so I don't know.

555
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,138
[Sniffles]

556
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:38,442
And the 15-year-old finds
solace in his parents.

557
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,210
Above all, have fun.

558
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:40,911
Yeah.

559
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:43,013
I was trying, but
they kicked me out.

560
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:43,880
It's okay, baby.

561
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:44,715
You know what?

562
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:48,118
It just wasn't meant to be.

563
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:51,989
While jacee searches for a new
home, another group is on

564
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:55,892
the verge of collapse, as Jordan
dorsey begins to question

565
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,127
the group's song choice.

566
00:21:57,195 --> 00:22:00,864
My group, uh, went with a
song that's extremely fast,

567
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,867
and right now, I have
to back up five people.

568
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,803
But earlier in the evening, when
Jordan's group was forming,

569
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,405
he had high standards.

570
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:09,106
Just sing a song.

571
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:09,973
♪ Baby, lock them doors ♪

572
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:10,674
♪ and turn the light... ♪

573
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:11,341

No, no, no.

577
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:17,648
And eventually found
what he was looking for.

578
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,116
♪ Everything I've learned ♪

579
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:20,050
I love him.

580
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:23,487
Now, deep into the evening's
rehearsal, Jordan is thinking of

581
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:26,456
leaving his group, and fellow
New Orleans contestant Lauren

582
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:27,991
Turner is not happy.

583
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,127
He's gonna put us out
there like that?

584
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:32,596
I don't care anymore.

585
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:34,865
I'm moving on with
my... what I have to learn.

586
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:38,001
I'm moving on with what I have to
learn and what we have to learn.

587
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:38,869
I'm playing the field.

588
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:40,137
Definitely playing the field.

589
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:42,873
But I'm coming to some
kind of conclusion.

590
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,279
It's hard to be in a group when you have
to rely on other people for our dream.

591
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:53,116
Wanting a final decision,
Lauren confronts Jordan.

592
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,451
That's what I need to know.

593
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,118
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:56,553
Okay.

595
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:59,890
So Jordan leaves his original
group and becomes a member for

596
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:02,793
the newly-renamed four plus one.

597
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,262
I'm officially in the group now.

598
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,396
Yeah!

599
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:07,864
[Laughs]

600
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,966
We've got to tell the judges,
well, hey, last minute, you

601
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:12,636
know, yesterday we lost somebody,
so... Lauren doesn't matter anymore.

602
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:14,204
Lauren did not matter anyway.

603
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:17,774
When it come head to head,
we're coming for 'em.

604
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:21,778
I feel like I made the best
choice I could ever make on

605
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,547
American Idol with
changing groups.

606
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:27,718
But only time will tell if his
decision was the right one.

607
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:31,688
It's 2:30 A.M.
and Ashley has finally made a decision.

608
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:35,592
After talking to my boyfriend, I just
felt like giving up wouldn't be fair to

609
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,194
people who gave me the
opportunity, you know?

610
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:38,562
She's going to stay.

611
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:42,532
But the hits have been successfully
rehearsing for hours without her.

612
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:49,539
After so much drama, will
they want Ashley back?

613
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:50,207
Okay.

614
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:50,874
Yay!

615
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:52,409
Make sure you don't
change your mind.

616
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:53,243
No, no, no.

617
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:54,845
So Ashley is back.

618
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:55,746
All right, let's go.

619
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:56,913
You scared us.

620
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:57,848
All right, we're good.

621
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:01,017
But as one disaster has been
averted, another has been

622
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:04,287
brewing in the dining room, as
Brett loewenstern's group, sugar

623
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,324
mamas and the baby have yet
to find another group member.

624
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:10,260
We're breaking apart because
we have to join other groups,

625
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:11,528
because that's the rules.

626
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,029
You have to have a day two person.

627
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:15,499
We can't find one, so
we have to do this.

628
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:18,201
Their problems started
back in the theater.

629
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:19,803
Day two boy!

630
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:22,272
Twice, they found someone.

631
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
Twice, they were ditched.

632
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:24,274
Whoo-hoo!

633
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,709
He left us?

634
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:29,045
And though they continue to
rehearse, they know it's either

635
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:33,283
find that fifth member or
go their separate ways.

636
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,420
Desperately wanting to keep
their group together, Brett

637
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,722
tries one more time
to find a contestant.

638
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,157
You're try... you want
to be in our group?

639
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:40,924
What are you guys gonna do?

640
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:41,992
Mercy.

641
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,093
I don't know that song.

642
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:44,060
You can learn it.

643
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:45,328
We need a day two person.

644
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,730
Here, let me take my glasses off.

645
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:48,765
We're... we could really
use a day two person.

646
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:53,570
Although jacee is unfamiliar with the
song mercy, his options are limited.

647
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,638
Hi.

648
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:55,305
Hi.

649
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:56,506
She's in our group too.

650
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:57,340
It's really nice to meet you.

651
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,008
Nice to meet you too.

652
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,476
We're really happy to have you.

653
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,777
Thank you.

654
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,379
No, thank you.

655
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:03,246
We're good.

656
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:04,281
Yeah?

657
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:06,249
Oh, I am very grateful
to God, 'cause I prayed.

658
00:25:06,317 --> 00:25:08,418
I'm like, God, please,
do something.

659
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:09,085
Help us out.

660
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,253
And then he just popped up.

661
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,054
Thank you so much.

662
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:11,721
I'm glad.

663
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,790
I'm glad I found a group,
'cause, you know, I'd been lost

664
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:14,724
if I didn't have a group.

665
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:15,826
Well, you have one now.

666
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,160
Yep, so... yeah.

667
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:17,828
Good.

668
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:20,530
Now I get to work with my new group and
hopefully just get through the night.

669
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:25,001
So the search is over for
jacee and the sugar mamas.

670
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,940
And as 3:00 A.M. approaches, groups begin
to leave for some much-needed sleep.

671
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,141
Out.

672
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,578
The duo of Tiffany rios and
Jessica yance are finished with

673
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:37,280
what they feel like has been
a very successful night.

674
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:38,748
I think we're gonna
do really good.

675
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,486
We're gonna show everybody that, um,
you know... they made a big mistake.

676
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:44,287
Big, huge.

677
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:47,858
But rehearsals carry on for
three's company, who are still

678
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,426
unable to work out the kinks.

679
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:50,327

00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:53,730

681
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:57,200

You've got to learn this song.

684

Can't get around it.

687
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:05,308
Just do the song.

688
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:07,811
This song is so [Bleep] Easy.

689
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,679
