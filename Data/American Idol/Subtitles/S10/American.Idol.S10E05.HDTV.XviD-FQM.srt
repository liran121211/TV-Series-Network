<i>Heck yeah.</i>

179
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:28,450
<i>>>Eck yeah.</i>

180
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,585
<i>Heck yeah.</i>

181
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:30,419
<i>Heck yeah.</i>

182
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,620
<i>They're saying "heck yeah."</i>

183
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:34,623
<i>I'm gonna say "heck yeah" too.</i>

184
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,625
<i>I'm gonna say "y'all heck yeah."</i>

185
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,427
<i>All right, dog, yeah.</i>

186
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,095
<i>That's four.</i>

187
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,163
<i>Welcome to Hollywood!</i>

188
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:44,566
<i>I was told that I
had to say this.</i>

189
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:47,102
<i>My whole life, I've been told
that I have a j.Lo booty.</i>

190
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,103
<i>Heck yeah.</i>

191
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:52,007
<i>Well, uh... close-up of that?</i>

192
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,509
<i>Yes, I had to say it.</i>

193
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:56,311
<i>Little bit of swag going
back and forth there.</i>

194
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:56,979
<i>Wow.</i>

195
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,013
<i>Well, congratulations.</i>

196
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:58,981
<i>You're going to Hollywood.</i>

197
00:06:59,048 --> 00:06:59,982
<i>We'll see you there.</i>

198
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:01,416
<i>See you later.</i>

199
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,118
<i>It was nice to meet y'all.</i>

200
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:03,952
<i>It's so funny.</i>

201
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,854
<i>Everybody uses the
term, "give it up.</i>

202
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:06,522
<i>Give it up."</i>

203
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,357
<i>But no one... people rarely do.</i>

204
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:09,892
<i>They just... that was great.</i>

205
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,829
<i>With his sister's support,
Cory is off to Hollywood.</i>

206
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,365
<i>Going to Hollywood, baby!</i>

207
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:19,968
<i>But the next contestant would
have to go it alone, and that</i>

208
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:20,636
<i>can be tough.</i>

209
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:21,303
<i>Hey.</i>

210
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:21,970
<i>Hello.</i>

211
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:22,638
<i>Hi.</i>

00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:23,305
<i>Hi. What's your name?</i>

213
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:23,972
<i>Holly.</i>

214
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,374

218
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:30,179
<i>I'm 17.</i>

219
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:31,113
<i>And what do you like to sing?</i>

220
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:32,614
<i>What are you gonna
sing us tonight?</i>

221
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:34,149
<i>I'm gonna sing at
last by</i> etta James.

222
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,117
All right, well, let it fly.

Thank you.

232
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:06,648
Well, I heard the lyrics, but you
were all over the place with melody.

233
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,851
Yeah, you switched keys
about five times there.

234
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,786
Tough song to sing.

235
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:14,523
Yeah, I feel like if you let it out,
we could get a little bit more of you.

236
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,825
And it's the kind of thing where
maybe you need to just get

237
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,094
a little bit more
comfortable on stage.

238
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,163
Mm-hmm.

239
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:24,466
Randy?

240
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,468
Sorry.

241
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:30,939
It's okay.

242
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,474
Yeah, you're not quite
ready yet, love.

243
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,042
I'm gonna say no.

244
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,916
Was your daughter excited
about this today?

245
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:41,583
Yeah.

246
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:42,251
Yeah.

247
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:42,918
Very.

248
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,954
To the extent that she's really
nervous now, so... yeah.

249
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:46,622
Yeah.

250
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,890
The nervousness actually can
help sometimes, can't it?

251
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,195
I hope so.

252
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:54,196
Can you do my a favor?

253
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:59,401
You think you can collect yourself to
sing one more song, one more chance?

254
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:12,614
After the break, find out if
holly survives the first cut.

255
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:17,219
Hate to say no to you, but...
Plus, the auditions get a visit from a legend.

256
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:18,320
This is John Wayne.

257
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:20,055
My name is John Wayne schulz.

258
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:21,523
John Wayne. Come on.

259
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:23,959
As Austin shows us
the cowboy way.

260
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:26,628
♪ Leave me if you need to ♪

261
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,598
It's not going good in Austin.

262
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,259
Welcome back to Austin.

263
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:43,264
Before the break, holly's
nerves got the best of her.

264
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,300
You okay?

265
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,702
She's really nervous now, so...
Yeah.

266
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,370
Yeah.

267
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,171
The nervousness actually can
help sometimes, can't it?

268
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,139
I hope so.

269
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:56,111
And now the judges are giving her a
second chance to make a first impression.

270
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,045
Can you do me a favor?

271
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:01,716

00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:11,786
Really good.

299
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:12,454

300
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,155
I'm gonna say yes.

301
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,623
Thank you.

302
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,826
Steven?

303
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:18,726
I'm gonna say yes too.

304
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:19,394
Thank you.

305
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,395
And guess what.

306
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,997
I'm gonna completely

00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,569
Yo.

310
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:28,236
You nailed it.

311
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:29,571
That was really great.

312
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,339
Steven, where's this
young girl going?

313
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:35,110
You're going to Hollywood!

314
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,946
Yes.

315
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:42,150
Holly successfully makes the <i>climb
to keep her idol dreams</i> alive.

316
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:42,817
She made it.

317
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,486
She made it.

318
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:47,388
She made it.

319
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,623
Yes!

320
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,290
High five.

321
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,226
Good one, team.

322
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,528
♪ I believe she believed ♪

323
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:57,465
It's an emotional roller
coaster for holly, but now she

324
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,968
can shed some tears of joy.

325
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:00,768
I'm going to Hollywood!

326
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,104
Whoo!

327
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,878
But as the day pushes on, the tears
begin to come in the form of heartache.

328
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,679
Know you're trying to make it
your own, but I think you need

329
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:12,347
a little bit more time.

330
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:13,014
I'm gonna say no.

331
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:14,149
Sorry.

332
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:18,753
As the pain of rejection sinks in...
I've failed everybody.

333
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,357
And the contestants leave their
big dreams behind in Texas.

334
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:26,327
The voice is just
not strong enough.

335
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,897
I didn't hear the "it" that
we're looking for here.

336
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,632
We love you, son.

337
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:31,666
We love you.

338
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:36,404
I'm just not what
they're looking for.

339
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:41,576
After that rough patch, the judges
are eager to see some real talent.

340
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:42,644
Waiting.

341
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:47,048
Waiting for the next American
idol to walk through the door.

00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:47,715

<i>Yeah, this is not going the way

<i>This is not... it's just not good.</i>

00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:29,490
<i>Yeah.</i>

357
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,427

358
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:33,962
