00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,794
Very high.

3
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:09,229
What's... hit me a
high one right now.

4
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:12,199

For the just the second time in
our ten seasons, idol's tour

9
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:23,098
of America has brought us deep into
the land of hopes and dreams...

10
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,367
Nashville, Tennessee.

11
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:31,540
We've had a report of 10,000 people
waiting in front of bridgestone arena.

12
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:35,843
But in fact, we were
taking over the streets...

13
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,380
As the crowd soon swelled
to a staggering 17,000.

14
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,749
Yeah!

The judges are ready to find the talent...
Hey. Good morning.

17
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:50,491
And across the street, the
contestants are ready to deliver

18
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:53,593
the goods, each one of them
hoping to garner the success

of country's biggest star...
Carrie Underwood, who recently

20
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:03,136
added "grand ole opry" member to
her already-impressive resume.

21
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,672
So we thought it was appropriate
to hold our auditions in the

22
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,141
opry's most famous home...
the ryman auditorium.

23
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:14,814

17,000 legends in the making.

Probably not this girl.

28
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,858
I'm Christine McCaffrey, and
I'm 27 years old, and I'm

And what do you do in
west palm beach, Florida?

32
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:33,832
I'm a dental assistant.

33
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:34,733

have the gift that will make

You're not serious, are you?

101
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,008
I'm very serious about going
on in American idol, 'cause I

102
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:37,247
have the ability to write lyrics, and
I have the ability to sing them.

106
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,056
No. You can't read minds.

107
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:47,090
That's for sure!

108
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,091

00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,360
I'll sing anything.

128
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,486
I did.

129
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:18,487
Who said yes?

130
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:19,488
Uh, Steven Tyler.

131
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:20,554
He did?

132
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:21,422
Yes to what?

133
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,191
Uh, he said I have a good
voice for American idol.

134
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,325
He did?

135
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:25,993
I'm gonna say no.

136
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,027
Awesome.

137
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:27,961
He did.

138
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,029
Okay.

139
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,898
I missed that scene.

140
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:34,034
So a small misunderstanding
there, but that's nothing

141
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:36,603
compared to the disconnect
between these two.

142
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,204
So how you guys feeling today?

143
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,106
A little nervous.

144
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,274
Excited.

145
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,509

146
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,576
My name is chelsee oaks.

147

Nashville, Tennessee.

And...We're exes.

150
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,756
The first day that rob and I met, he
asked me up onstage to sing with him.

151
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,627
So we've been singing together
literally since the day that we met.

152
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,495
We just sort of...Clicked.

153
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,564
You guys...You were together
and you broke up, and you

154
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,466
auditioned for idol at the same
time, knowing that you were

155
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,400
gonna see each other possibly
if you made it and also compete

156
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,235
in the same competition if
you made it to Hollywood?

157
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,304
We still lived together
after we broke up.

158
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,472
That's not a good idea.

159
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,742
Did you date other people
while he was living with you?

160
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,243
Yeah.

161
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,312

talking and getting back on good

terms and, uh...
It's turned opposite now and gone sour.

something together, but we

178
00:06:56,846 --> 00:07:00,114
tried and we tried and we tried,
and it just didn't work out.

179

Little bit different, but...
How do you feel, rob?

184
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:10,091
It sucks.

185
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:12,626
Wouldn't be doing my job if I
didn't ask how this all went

186
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:14,962
down, how this all happened.

187
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:16,029
What's that?

188
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:19,065
I mean... were you the
reason for the breakup?

189
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,767
No, I was not the
reason for the breakup.

190
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:21,702
They broke up, you know, we met.

191
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:22,603
You know, I didn't rob before.

192
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,206

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,295
It's 10:00 A.M., and American
idol has taken over Nashville's

292
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:08,899
main drag, Broadway...
Where more than 17,000 have packed the

293
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,467
streets to audition.

294
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:13,136
And back inside the ryman,
things are starting to get

295
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:15,506
interesting, to say the least.

you're a pop singer.

319
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:56,410
You know it.

320
00:11:56,478 --> 00:11:58,912

322
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:04,885
Yeah, you're good, but you're
never gonna do nothin' with it.

323
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,119
But you know what, man?

324
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:07,487
You continue to try.

325
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:10,189
We fight in this life for
everything that we got.

326
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:12,759
We're warriors, man.

327
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:15,395
So did someone tell
you you could sing?

328
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:17,397
I mean, I been hearing this my
whole life... "hey, man, go try

329
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:19,999

man, ain't that all pop and

00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,701
stuff... nothin' against you.

331
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:22,901
Nothing against you.

332
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:25,203
Everyone's got their own

That's right.

334
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,342
So, you know, mine's vanilla, I
guess, and yours may be chocolate.

You know, but...

I mean, like I said, my point of view...
Love criticism.

364
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:45,612
Because if you tell me, "no, I'm
not feeling you," so that's just

365
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,816
gonna make me go home and
practice... work harder.

366
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,818
Ten times harder
than what I was.

367
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:51,852
That's good.

368
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,887
You know, the greatest
musicians of all time have

369
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,657
failed their auditions
once or twice in life.

370
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:58,425
All of us have.

371
00:13:58,492 --> 00:13:59,358
That happens.

372
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,526
Good stuff.

373
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:03,228
Yeah. There's a reason for
everything in this life.

374
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:04,797
Oh, yeah, 100%!

375
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:05,731
100%.

376
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,699
100%.

377
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:07,533
All right.

378
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:08,334
Good luck to you.

379
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,168
Thank you very much.

380
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:10,002
You guys have a good day.

381
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,003
We enjoyed you, man.

382
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,141
He came in here, the toughest
guy in the world, and then he

383
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:19,144
left here like...Philosophizing.

384
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:20,412
Like he's so humble.

385
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,285
So you're saying we took an untamed tiger...
And turned it into a baby.

386
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:27,319
Yes.

387
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:28,420
Oh, okay.

388
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,321
Good luck.

389
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:30,822
I hope everything
works out for you.

390
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,622
Yep.

391
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,423
See you.

392
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:33,624
Nice to meet you.

393
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:37,595
So the judges have tamed the beast...
But are they ready for this beauty?

394
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,097
My name is stormi henley.

395
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:42,333
I am 19 years old, and I am
from crossville, Tennessee.

396
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:44,435
I was miss teen usa 2009.

397
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:45,970
My boss was Donald trump.

398
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:49,473
It was really nerve-racking
being on the stage.

399
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,542
And I think after knowing that I
could win that competition and

400
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,145
perform in front of so many
people, it's really given me the

401
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,613
confidence to come here.

402
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,384
I really want to see how far
I can make it on my talent.

403
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,584
Uh-oh!

404
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,153
Uh-oh!

405
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,354

406
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:06,588
Wow!

407
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,256
Hi.

408
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,290
Hello.

409
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:09,225
What's your name?

410
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,425
Stormi.

411
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,359
No!

412
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:12,260
It's weird, isn't it?

413
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,094
What?

414
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:13,895
That's your real name?

415
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,363
Yes.
It's on my birth certificate.

416
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:16,131
Wow. I like that.

417
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:16,998
It's beautiful.

418
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,900
You look like you could
be miss something.

419
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,035
I was miss teen usa.

420
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,069
You're reading that!

421
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,370
I'm reading it.

422
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:23,271
You're cute.

423
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,272
What are you gonna sing?

424
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,440
Father, can you hear me?

425
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,740

You got a beautiful...
Little tight squeaky little voice, you know?

435
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,068
You ever throw it out a
little harder than that?

436
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,968
I don't.

437
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:56,769
I never have.

438
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:57,603
You never let loose?

439
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:58,336
Mm-mm.

440
00:15:58,404 --> 00:15:59,337
Well, all right.

441
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:02,640
Is there singing in this competitive
thing with miss teen usa?

442
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,309
There's not a talent division.

443
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:05,177
There's no talent portion.

444
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:07,011
We're talented...
But there's not a talent division.

445
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,046
Whoo! All right, baby!

446
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,081
All right!

447
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,515
I feel you.

448
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,416
Okay.

449
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,417
Let's take a vote.

450
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:13,218
Let's do it.

451
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,086
I think with a little work
you can belt that out.

452
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:16,653
So I'm gonna say yes.

453
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:20,657
I think you're gorgeous, but the
voice is not strong enough for me.

454
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:23,060
I'm gonna say no.

455
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,396
It's up to Randy, but...
It's up to me?

456
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:26,363
Yes, baby.

457
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,332
Really?

458
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,266
It was just okay.

459
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:32,835
I don't know...
Okay, Randy, come on.

460
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,482
Wow.

461
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:46,381
Yeah!

462
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,549
Seriously, you two?

463
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:48,584
Seriously?

464
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,585
Seriously?

465
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:50,552
Okay, okay, okay.

466
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,220
Rub it in.

467
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,256
That might be the smallest
voice we've ever heard.

468
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:55,090
That may be.

469
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,158
In five cities!

470
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:57,526
But it was powerful.

471
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:58,994
I mean, she was beautiful.

472
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,196
America, I'm going to Hollywood!

473
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,867
So stormi continues
her reign as queen.

474
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:10,704
But later, someone gives
her a run for her money.

475
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,573
Younique.

476
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,908
And the emotions run high.

477
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,914
It's 4:00 P.M. in Nashville.

478
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,718
And as stormi celebrates with
gold, unfortunately, her name

479
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,387
describes the mood
in the judging room.

480
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,855
I'm gonna say not yet, no.

481
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:38,659
I'm gonna have to say
no this time too.

482
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,561
Definitely a no.

483
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:41,828
Definitely.

484
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:44,398
Where did it go wrong?

485
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:47,568
Everything.

486
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:52,438
But our next contestant knows that
every cloud has a silver lining.

487
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,406
My name is adrienne beasley.

488
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,243
I'm 22 years old, and I'm
from wickliffe, Kentucky.

489
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,178
I live on a farm.

490
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,646
It's a lot of hard work.

491
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:01,880
It really is.

492
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,316
Whoa!

493
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,050
My name is Freddy Simmons.

494
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,851
My name is carolyn Simmons.

495
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,053
And we are adrienne's parents.

496
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,056
When I was two years
old, I was adopted.

497
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,125
My parents, they are white.

498
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,661

Wow, yeah!

529
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,537
I hear something so special in your voice...
And I can't put my

530
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,173
finger on it right now, but
it's something special.

531
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,107
Thank you.

532
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,775
Yeah. Nothin' was put on.

533
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:44,610
You nailed the chorus.

534
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:45,811
You almost made me cry.

535
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,513
I mean, I wasn't sure why.

536
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,048
There was something in your
voice that's so special.

537
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:52,951
You hold that real... hold
that close to you.

538
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,554
You really surprised me
there in the middle.

539
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:56,822
I really felt that.

540
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,023
And it sounded so good in this
ryman audororium, and this

541
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,591
room was built for that.

542
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,559
Sounded good.

543
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:02,727
I was like, yeah, all right!

544
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:04,429
Use that room, girl, go for it!

545
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,163
Thank you very much.

546
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:08,766
I'm gonna say yes.

547
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,402
I'm gonna say yes.

548
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,437
I guess you're going
to Hollywood.

549
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,404
Oh!

550
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,339
Yeah!

551
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,140
Hollywood!

552
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,475
Hollywood.

553
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,976
Thank you guys so much.

554
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:22,178
Oh, my gosh, I
wanted this so bad.

555
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,380
I can't believe it.

556
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:24,280
Congratulations.

557
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,215
You did it.

558
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:26,015
You did it.

559
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:26,817
Welcome to Hollywood.

560
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:27,884
All right, thank you.

561
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,885
That's so great... there it is!

562
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,929
You didn't exist, and we didn't... when
she was singing... that's great.

563
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:50,905
Hello?

564
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:54,843
Dad, I'm going to Hollywood.

565
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,478
I'm going to Hollywood.

566
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:02,683
I don't know who's gonna pay my
way, but I'm goin' to Hollywood!

567
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:06,253
My world could definitely
change, but no matter what,

568
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,388
the farm's always been my home.

569
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:16,396
Coming up... with day one of Nashville
in the rearview mirror, can day two

570
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:17,196
stay the course?

571
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:18,464
Wo-how!

572
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:20,032
That's what 're e okoking for.

573
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,369
Or is another collision waiting
for us just over the rise?

574
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:27,372
Nashville has a lot
of highs and lows.

575
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,507
It's just an auditionbubuddy.

576
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:41,217
It's early morning in Tennessee, and the
town of Nashville is already bustling.

577
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:47,823
As people go about their everyday business,
all signs point to idol auditions.

578
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:55,230
And today the judges arrive
with huge expectations.

579
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,565
If Nashville brings it today
like they did yesterday, we'll

580
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,867
have all the winners
from this one town.

581
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:06,274
Perhaps we'll find a shining star
in 28-year-old Camille emerics.

582
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:09,810
Singing is something I've
done ever since I was small.

583
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:13,547
I ended up being our junior
regional soloist for our

584
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:18,252
hometown, and people are very
surprised when they hear me sing.

585
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,122
I have a huge voice, and I'm
like 5'2", and everybody's

586
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,159
looking at me like, "where
did that come from?"

587
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:27,226
What are you gonna
sing for us today?

588
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:32,365
Um, I'm gonna sing some sweet
thing for you from chaka Khan.

589
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,299
Chaka Khan.

590
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:34,367

You know what?

615
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,076
You gotta go back home and
practice and get good.

616
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:20,276
No.

617
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:21,244
Yes.

618
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,178
Don't sing... just don't do it.

619
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:22,879
Oh, come on.

620
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:23,714
Just don't do it.

621
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:24,514
Don't do it.

622
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:25,448
Honestly, just don't do it.

623
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:27,751
Baby, that was horrible.

624
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,987
Loud...lt hurt.

625
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:31,854
No. I'm sure you're a nice girl.

626
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:33,923
There's many talents you have.

627
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,291
So is it a no for you?

628
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,792
Um...Let me see.

629
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,428
Uh...Yeah, it's a no for me.

630
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,062

Go practice.

00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:47,503
What a waste of time,
you know what I mean?

634
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,404
Four hours.

635
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:50,805
Oh...

636
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:55,410
It was terrible.

637
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:57,212
I'm just trying to be honest.

638
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,915
And for the next hour, that
honesty was downright brutal

639
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:04,752

You know, you really don't

662

It's a no for me.

663
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:54,031
Nashville has a lot
of highs and lows.

664
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,801
But outside, it was mostly lows.

665
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:57,968
Any luck, man?

666
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:58,969
No.

667
00:24:59,037 --> 00:24:59,870
I'm sorry about that, buddy.

Come here.

669
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:03,441
Come here, man.

670
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:13,417
It's just an audition, buddy.

671
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:14,484
Nice to meet you.

672
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:16,620
Thanks, buddy.

673
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:25,027
As I usher out the heartbroken, the
contestants waiting are certainly feeling

674
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:28,197
the pressure... no one more
so than Jackie Wilson.

675
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,700
I am like...Whew.

676
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,135
I got... I got the jitters.

677
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:34,537

678
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:36,872

What I do like, though, is I come in
here, you're like the country boy.

920
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:26,781
You got the hat on...
And you sing Josh groban.

921
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,451
And it sounds like you're from
a whole 'nother kind of thing.

922
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:32,620
I was like... I can pretty
up too, if you want me to.

923
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:34,956
I can pretty up!

924
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:37,024
I'm not trying to suck up or
anything, but I mean, Jennifer

925
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:39,526
Lopez, I'm sitting here, and
that's a little bit hard to sing

926
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:43,697
in front of...
My favorite actress and my favorite judge

927
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:45,932
and my favorite rocker.

928
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,636
I mean... Steven, what do
you think, man, of Matt?

929
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:50,871
I'm on the fence.

930
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:52,840
He has a very,
very pretty voice.

931
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,708
Randy, what do you think, man?

932
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,909
I'm gonna give a very small yes.

933
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:59,512
I just hope that you
don't get swallowed up.

934
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,546
He's saying yes.

935
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:01,681
I'm saying no.

936
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,883
I think that you need to
have a better audition.

937
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,454
Steven...Yes or no?

938
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:13,458
Whoo!

939
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:20,399
Yes!

940
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:22,601
Going from the
country to the hood.

941
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:24,469

942
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:25,970

Coming up, the unanimous choice

Yes!

You don't want to miss the first
step of her idol journey.

946
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:45,373
Welcome back to the ryman
auditorium here in Nashville,

947
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:49,144
Tennessee where there have been so
many great country music moments here.

948
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:51,646
We're trying to keep
that legacy alive.

949
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:54,381
And over the past two days,
we may have done just that.

951

952
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:04,425
But the stadium which once held
17,000 dreamers...Has only

953
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:06,393
one more who remains.

954
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:08,262
My name is Lauren alaina.

955
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,032
I'm 15 years old, and I'm
from rossville, Georgia.

956
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:12,899
It's fun living here.

957
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,802
I like it because it's kinda
simple and laid back.

958
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,639
I would say I'm a typical
15-year-old girl.

959
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:21,474
Ta da!

960
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:22,608
I'm always singing.

961
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:25,778
It's what I love to do, and
my family's super-supportive.

962
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:27,913
Especially my cousin holly.

963
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:30,549
She's really the reason
that I started singing.

964
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:34,987
She's like a sister to me more than a
cousin, 'cause I was raised with her.

965
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:37,356
I really looked up to holly
growing up, 'cause she's so

966
00:36:37,423 --> 00:36:40,459
beautiful and it was like
my goal to be like holly.

967
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:41,360
I love you.

968
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:42,927
I love you too.

969
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,030
Three years ago, holly was
diagnosed with a brain tumor,

970
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:48,032
and they told her that she was
gonna have to take chemo and

971
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,469
radiation and that she would
lose all of her hair.

972
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:55,039
I didn't know whether or
not she was gonna live.

973
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:58,041
And I don't know what I'd do
without holly, 'cause she's my...

974
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:02,980
she's like my big sister and...

975
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:07,217
So I just tried to do as much as
I could, and I stayed with her.

976
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:09,853
I did a fundraiser.

977
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:13,290
I sang, and all the money I
got I saved up for holly.

978
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,157
Are you ready for the audition?

979
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:16,125
Oh, yeah, I'm ready.

980
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,226
I've been here all day.

981
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:18,027
I know.

982
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:18,961
You're the last one.

983
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:19,962
Get in there and good luck.

984
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,796
We'll be waiting for you.

985
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:21,630

And who inspired you
to come and audition?

995
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,078
Um, my cousin holly, actually.

996
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,314
Well, she's the reason I
ever started singing.

997
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,883
I would go over to her house and
we would go to her room and

998
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,319
listen to music and just sing
all the time, and she urged me

999
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,953
to try out, so here I am.

1000
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:47,888
Right.
Do you wanna bring her in?

1001
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:50,357

1002
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,992

00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:12,379
As we close up shop and the judges head out...
Yeah, yeah!

I think we found the one today.

00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:28,194
It's not our first time at this
rodeo, but when we hit Austin,

we're welcomed with an unlikely
kind of Southern hospitality.

1116
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,866
Unh!

00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,668

1119
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,939
No matter what may transpire...
People are bringing the pain and the fire.

1120
00:41:41,007 --> 00:41:42,141
You're going to Hollywood.

00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,342
One thing is for sure.

00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:44,109
Whoo!

1123
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:46,778
The Texas-sized talent...
I think you're awesome.

1124
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:48,647
You might be one of the
best people we've seen.
