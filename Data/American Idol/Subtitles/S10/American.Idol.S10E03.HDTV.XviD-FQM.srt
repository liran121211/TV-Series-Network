Dog's gonna turn into
a pussycat right now.

549
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,033
Come on, dog.

550
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,034
Come on.

551
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:07,769
Come on, dog.

552
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,037
I mean, if you didn't hear
something there, I mean...

553
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:21,849
I-I am gonna work so hard.

554
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:22,817
Guess what.

555
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,552
You got another shot.

556
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,219
Yes!

557
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:25,887
Thank you!

558
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:26,621

Yes, yes, yes, yes!

Thank you, thank you!

562
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:29,957
You get one more shot.

563
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:30,691
Don't disappoint us.

564
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,392
No.

565
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,093
And you know what?

566
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,461
On the ride home... yeah?

567
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,296
Try... belt it out a
little bit more.

568
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:35,963

'Cause it was just...

You were pushing them.

Yes!

581
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,423
Your... your first
instinct was right.

582
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,025
She's gonna get eaten
up in this competition.

583
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,961
My thing was... you have your learner's
permit and a ticket to Hollywood.

584
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,628
Yes!

585
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:08,329
Good.

586
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,030
I'm set.

587
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:09,697
You're set.

588
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,531
Congratulations.

589
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,232
We'll see you there.

590
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,969
And we'll see you
right after this.

591
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:18,873
Coming up, emotions run
high in Milwaukee.

592
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:22,810
People ask a lot of time,
like, "why are you crying?

593
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:23,644
Why are you crying?"

594
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,079
'Cause it means a lot.

595
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:27,448
But the talent level
is even higher.

596
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:28,249
She's so good.

597
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,351
I love this girl,
I love this girl.

598
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,687
Voice-wise, one of
the best we've seen.

599
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,988
Outstanding.

600
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:37,992
As the midwest heats up, everybody
is ready for their shot.

601
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,227
Let's just talk!

602
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,895
Don't try me, man!

603
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,965
Aaah!

604
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,903
Welcome back to Wisconsin...

605
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:02,407
Where so far today, we've discovered
some fantastic new talent.

606
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:05,743
Waiting outside in the holding
room are several others ready to

607
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,245
get in on the action.

608
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:10,715
Each one of them realizes that
their shot at Hollywood is just

609
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:13,217
a few short steps away.

610
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,485

00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,660
Kind of a little bluesy.

616
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,361
Mmm!

617
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:24,862

That was terrible.

642
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,280
Frank Sinatra, huh?

643
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,083
Where was Frank in that?

644
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,752
Maybe that was a bad comparison.

645
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:22,754
Dude, it was terrible.

646
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,222
What was terrible?

647
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,694
Pitch, tone, sound,
everything about singing.

648
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:30,561
I gotta pass. No.

649
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:31,229
Oh.

650
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:32,663
It's just not gonna happen today.

651
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:33,331
Okay.

652
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:33,998
No.

653
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:34,665
Really?

654
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:35,600
Never.

655
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:39,037
If gaga were here, she'd run out of the
room screaming, "what have I done?

656
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,571
Aah!"

657
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,974
Thanks.

658
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,242
He didn't like that.

659
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:44,976
Can I give you a hug?

660
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:45,643
You better.

661
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:46,310
Okay.

662
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,212
Dude.

663
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,716
Can I have a sip of your coke?

664
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:52,383
Uh, no.

665
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:53,084
Okay.

666
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:55,553
Just... I... it's coke zero.

667
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:56,888
I mean, you can get
some out there, yeah.

668
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:58,322
All right, well,
thank you very much.

669
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,725
Okay.

670
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:01,492
Look at him.

671
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,427
Wow.

672
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:05,830
As the afternoon grows on,
finding talent here is quickly

673
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:08,900
turning into a losing battle,
which is surprising, 'cause

674
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:13,688
Milwaukee is home to the biggest music
festival in the world...

675
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:14,806
Summerfest.

676
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:19,243
The event has even hosted some
of our own idol stars along the

677
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:23,114
way, so it's no surprise that
one of this year's contestants,

678
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:27,251
naema aridapo, also has a
connection to this place, but

679
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,387
not in the way you might think.

680
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:34,559
Life is kind of crazy for me
because I am an artist, but I

681
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:38,096
work a 9:00 to 5:00 with
summerfest, and basically, it's

682
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:42,066
like grounds cleanup, you
know, janitorial stuff.

683
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:44,936
I'm, like, cleaning
this huge amphiTheatre.

684
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:46,370
It's, like, thousands of people.

685
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:51,175
And I'm looking at the stage,
and I'm like, "that should be

686
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:55,213
me," but instead I'm behind the
stage, cleaning the toilets and

687
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,782
making sure everything is tidy.

688
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,421
I decided to audition this year
because really, honestly, I feel

689
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:08,459
like it would change my life.

690
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:13,664
If I could provide for my family
and give to my daughters what I

691
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:19,737
didn't have, it would be a
great change for us, and so...

692
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:27,411
It's real.

693
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:32,183
People ask... I'm sorry, I'm
gonna start to cry, baby.

694
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:39,857
But, um, peoplask a lot of time,
like, "why are you crying?

695
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:40,591
Why are you crying?"

696
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,993
'Cause it means a lot.

697
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:49,267
But, you know, I just pray
that it goes, um, well.

698
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:56,207
And I feel like it will, so...
Hello, hello.

699
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:56,874
Hi.

700
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:57,542
Hi.

701
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:58,209
How are you?

702
00:23:58,277 --> 00:23:58,943
Hi.

703
00:23:59,011 --> 00:23:59,710
Nice colors, man.

704
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:00,411
Thank you.

705
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,279
Yeah, you know, I need it.

706
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,079
What's your name?

707
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:04,482
Naema, naema aridapo.

708
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,349
What do you like to sing?

709
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,717
Who's your favorite artist?

710
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:09,220
What I was gonna sing for you
today is, um, a Donny hathaway

711
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:12,256
song, for all we know.

712
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:13,124
Mmm!

713
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:13,791
Okay.

714
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:14,492
Do it.

715
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,426

I like her.

732
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:04,842
I like her a lot.

733
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,576
Me too.

734
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:06,277
Thank you.

735
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:06,944
Ditto.

736
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:08,012
I think you're all that.

737
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,879
Yeah?

738
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:09,614
Yeah.

739
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,581
Thank you.

740
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:11,649
You're all that too.

741
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:12,450
Yeah.

742
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,718
I got no love, I got no love?

743
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:14,452
I get no love over here?

744
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,686
Hey, say it to Jennifer.

745
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:16,420
No love, right?

746
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:17,154
No.

747
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,155
I get a vote too.

748
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:20,691
Steve, you want to go first?

749
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:21,859
Steven.

750
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:22,727
Stevie?

751
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:25,096
Whoa, whoa.

752
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,797
Naema, that was great.

753
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:27,565
Thank you.

754
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,233
I say yes.

755
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,601
Randy?

756
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:32,036
Randy Jackson.

757
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:33,070
What the hell?

758
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:34,105
Why'd he say that?

759
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:34,839
He's Steve.

760
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:35,840
He said, "Steven."

761
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:36,807
Okay, yeah.

762
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,010
Uh, yes, 100% yes.

763
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:39,710
I love this girl.

764
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:40,845
I love this girl.

765
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:41,679
It's a yes.

766
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:42,380
You're going to Hollywood.

767
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:43,314
Welcome to Hollywood!

768
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:44,415
Whoa, baby!

769
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:45,082
Whoa!

770
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,183
Welcome to Hollywood!

771
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,785
Yes.

772
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:50,721
Wow.

773
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,623
I keep calling you Steve
and it's Steven, right?

774
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:55,293
You could call me late for
dinner, and I'd still love you.

775
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:01,132
But not lunch.

776
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,667
Don't call me late
for no... not us.

777
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,168
Mm-mm, not the kid, mm-mm.

778
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:05,569
Hey, now, Randy Jackson.

779
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:08,839
Mr. Jackson, if you're nasty...
Randy dean... no, Randy dean

780
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:10,341
Jackson, my whole name.

781
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:12,009
Don't call me at all, both of you.

782
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:12,677
Wow.

783
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:14,945
Wow.

784
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:17,915
But don't refer to
me as "hey, you."

785
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:19,050
We'll be back after this.

786
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:20,818
Stay with us.

787
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:24,789
After the break, you will not
believe the talent in Milwaukee.

788
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:26,290
All the isms are jumping off.

789
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:27,358
None of the wasums.

790
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:28,159
Beautiful.

791
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:32,963
Including our youngest
contestants ever.

792
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:37,268
And everyone wants to get in on
the party, including Randy, who

793
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:39,503
comes fist to face
with a contestant.

794
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:50,060
Oh, hi, welcome to American idol.

795
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:50,961
Jennifer Lopez.

796
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:52,329
We don't speak on the set.

797
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:53,030
No?

798
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:54,031
We don't speak.

799
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,933
By the way, you and
your ways, all right?

800
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,101
You and your ways.

801

He's such a diva and
I can't take it.

803
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,575
It's 2:00 P.M. in Milwaukee,
and we're back from break, but

804
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:08,211
in the holding room, the
party hasn't stopped.

805
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:09,579
Here we go, here
we go, here we go!

806

Oh, yeah!

807
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:15,319
It's all fun and games
until someone gets hurt.

808
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:19,890
Are you all right?

00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:16,933
We should just vote right away.

920
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,935
I'm gonna say yes.

921
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:19,603
Yes.

922
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,337
Yes.

923
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,238
Yes.

924
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:22,706

Whoo!

926
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:24,908
Yes, that's the way to do it.

927
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:25,609
Wow.

928
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:27,010
We look forward to
seeing you over there.

929
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:28,545
That's the way to come
in and nail an audition.

930
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:29,212
Thank you.

931
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,013

What was... what was his name?

943
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,103
Jerome bell.

944
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,004

Remember that name.

947
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,943
We'll see if Jerome has what
it takes to make it to our big

948
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:03,547
stage, a place that has
showcased some of the biggest

So it got us thinking.

957
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:26,703
Because of his staggering
success at such a young age,

958
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:29,205
perhaps we should lower the age
limit for our contestants.

Wow! Wow!

966
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,286
Well, maybe not that low.

967
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:47,090
But we did lower the age limit
to 15, and they've certainly

968
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:51,628
delivered so far on the road.

969
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,830
But they're going to have some
serious competition to contend

970
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:56,566
with here in Milwaukee.

971
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,101
My name is Thea magea.

972
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,937
I am 15 years old, and I'm from
mountain house, California, and

973
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,472
I'm a high school student.

974
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,109
I originally planned on
auditioning next year for season

975
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:10,747
11, but when I heard about
the age reduction, I just

976
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:15,919
immediately booked flights and a hotel
and we just flew straight to Wisconsin.

977
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:19,923
Um, I knew that there was gonna
be auditions in California, but

978
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,992
I just couldn't summon
the patience to wait.

979
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:22,892
Thea magea.

980
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,560
It kind of rhymes.

981
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:24,327
I like that.

982
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:25,095
Is that your real name?

983
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:25,795
Yeah.

984
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:26,663
Okay, just checking.

985
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:28,398
That's a... that's a
movie star name.

986
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:29,099
It sure is.

987
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:29,866
Thank you.

988
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:30,667
How old are you?

989
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:31,868
I'm 15 years old.

990
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:32,902
So you're here auditioning.

991
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,903
What's the... what's the story?

992
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:34,604
What's the dream?

993
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:37,140
You've been wanting to do this all
your life, even though you're only 15?

994
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,609
Yeah, I mean, I've been
watching this show since season

995
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:42,312
one, and I just can't
believe I'm here right now.

996
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,648
I'm actually really
star-struck to see you guys.

997
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:47,617
I mean, Randy, I've been seeing
you on television even before I

998
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:50,220
could even start reading, so...
Whoa.

999
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:50,954
I'm here now.

1000
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:52,555
But I'm still mad
young, though, right?

1001
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:54,624
You look exactly the same.

1002
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:55,725
Exactly, exactly.

1003
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:57,761
Doesn't he look exactly the
same as in season one?

1004
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:58,928
You look even younger.

1005
00:32:58,996 --> 00:32:59,763
Younger.

1006
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,463
Even younger.

1007
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,264
I love this girl.

1008
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:03,099
This girl knows what's going on.

1009
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,502
Okay, so, uh, what are
you singing today?

1010
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,671
Uh, chasing pavements by Adele.

1011
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:08,338
Great song.

All right, thanks, Thea.

1028
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:48,845
Let's see what the
panel thinks, man.

1029
00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:49,579
What do you think, Jennifer?

1030
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:50,246
I love you.

1031
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:51,681
I think you're the total package.

1032
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:52,348
Mmm.

1033
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,017
And you're very
comfortable up there.

1034
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:54,884
Thank you.

1035
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:55,585
Steven?

1036
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:56,686
I loved your voice.

1037
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:57,454
Thank you.

1038
00:33:57,521 --> 00:34:00,123
I thought it had a lot of
character and all of that muster

1039
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:03,193
and smoke and heat,
you know, down there.

1040
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:08,198
You know, it would have been a place
that, you know... Steven Tyler.

1041
00:34:08,265 --> 00:34:09,365
I'm just saying.

1042
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:10,333
Legend.

1043
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:12,102
I-I like you a lot.

1044
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:13,136
Let's take a vote here.

1045
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:14,003
Steven?

1046
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:15,638
Thea, I say yes.

1047
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:16,473

1052
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:22,412

1053
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:25,448
But it wasn't just Thea.

1054

By 4:00, it was clear our
decision had paid off.

1055

1068
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:53,910
15 and she could do that?

1069
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:54,811
Wow.

1070
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:01,551
See, this is why the winners
come from these places.

1071
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,354
I mean, it's like, one
person after the other.

1072
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,123
And it was smooth
sailing in Milwaukee.

1073
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:10,093
It feels so good to have
some people that can sing.

1074
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,995

1075
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:14,330

1076

What do you think?

1079
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:18,668
Excuse me.

1080
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:19,335
No.

1081
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:20,036
Get out of my face.

1082
00:35:20,104 --> 00:35:21,304
Kiss my ass!

1083
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:23,173
Shut up, breanna.

1084
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:36,160
Welcome back to Milwaukee.

1085
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,861
My name is Nathaniel Jones.

1086
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,596
I'm from mount zion, Wisconsin.

1087
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:42,466
I'm 22 years old, and I'm
a civil war re-enactor.

1088
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:44,501
Aah!

1089
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:49,506
So basically, civil war
reenacting is, you dress up, go

1090
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:54,278
out onto a field somewhere, and
you just recreate a battle that

1091
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,679
actually took place.

1092
00:35:55,747 --> 00:35:57,347
Aah!

1093
00:36:01,252 --> 00:36:03,087
Put the gun down.

1094
00:36:03,154 --> 00:36:04,989
He actually is gonna
point the gun at me.

1095
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,024
I actually think
he's gonna shoot me.

1096
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:08,359
We can just talk about it.

1097
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:09,360
Don't try me.

1098
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:10,661
Let's just talk.

1099
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,162

1100
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,898
But this soldier isn't

1101
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:20,104
Today he's brought along his father, a
man he's just a little passionate about.

1102
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:23,841
People would come up to me and
ask me, "is your dad a hippie?

Your dad looks like a hippie.

1104

He looks like a hippie.

1107
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,117
No, he's not a hippie.

1108

00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:15,359
I mean... I do civil war reenacting
as a hobby, and I got the uniform

Awesome.

like that, well, I knew, I knew

1277
00:43:39,544 --> 00:43:41,211
you were gonna go
somewhere with that.

1278
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:42,212
I think you're terrific.

1279
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:42,879
I think that's great.

1280
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:43,580
Thank you.

1281
00:43:43,648 --> 00:43:45,081
Just... I liked it too.

1282
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:47,484
I was impressed at how low you
started too, and it sounded

1283
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:50,821
really rich down there, which
is a tough thing, and tough to

1284
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:53,557
control when you're nervous, which I
can tell a little bit that you are.

1285
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:54,291
No, really?

1286
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm just a little puzzled,
because, I mean, you're a really

1287
00:43:56,828 --> 00:43:58,762
good singer, so where
have you been?

1288
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,664
What's been going on?

1289
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:01,565
She's been at Harvard.

1290
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:02,265
I've been at Harvard.

1291
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:02,966
She's been at Harvard.

1292
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:03,900
She's only 22.

1293
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:04,634
She just graduated.

1294
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:05,769
That's what I've been doing.

1295
00:44:05,837 --> 00:44:06,736
Voting, voting.

1296
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:08,004
Let's vote.

1297
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:09,739

1298
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:11,241
Yes.

1299
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:13,243

1302
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,448
Yes, and you're
going to Hollywood!

1303
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:19,749
Yeah, baby!

1304
00:44:19,817 --> 00:44:21,151
Thank you so much, you guys.

1305
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:23,119
That's how you do it
from the white house.

1306
00:44:23,187 --> 00:44:23,787
Wow.

1307
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:25,121
From the white house to Hollywood.

1308
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:26,790
Gotta represent the
administration.

1309
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:27,657
Come on, right?

1310
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:28,492

Good job!

1315
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,868
Oh, thanks for being
my stand-in family.

Milwaukee is crazy, man.

There's some good finds here.

1319
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:44,374
What is going on?

1320
00:44:44,442 --> 00:44:47,277
I figure we should just call
the white house and tell them.

1321
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:48,044
Yeah, yeah.

1322
00:44:48,112 --> 00:44:49,112
I can get them on a press call.

1323
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,248
Call Barack and
tell him you're in.

1324
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:53,149
That was... wow, wow, wow.

1325
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:54,217
That was an amazing day.

1326
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:54,885
Yeah.

00:48:57,747 --> 00:49:00,549
You always had the potential, I
think, even when we saw you before.

1457
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:02,117
It's just the control, 'cause
if you gonna sing all those

1458
00:49:02,185 --> 00:49:04,386
runs, you gotta really be able
to sing 'em and close 'em and

1459
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:05,487
loop 'em and the whole thing.

1460
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:06,221
Mmm!

1461
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:07,022
Let's take a vote.

1462
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,324
Yes!

Different.

1636
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:15,641
Yeah. Really different.

1637
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:17,043

song, like, with no problem.

1711
00:57:34,414 --> 00:57:36,849
I'm not sure if you're ready
for American idol right now.

1712
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:37,516
Really? You think so?

1713
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:41,654
Yeah. Well...
That's what it appears to me.

1714
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:45,024
Half of these people cannot
sing better than me.

1715
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:46,525
Like, seriously.

1716
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:47,560
No.

00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:50,096

1718
00:57:50,163 --> 00:57:50,763

1719
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:51,430
Good.

1720
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:52,431
Yeah.

1721
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:54,734
We're just trying to
be honest with you.

1722
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:57,203
'Cause hopefully that will help you
if you're trying to be a singer.

1723
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,006
No, seriously, is it because I'm not
skinny like half of these females in here?

1724
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:00,673
Oh, no.

1725
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:01,741
No, I think it is.

1726
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:03,743
No, that has nothing
to do with it.

1727
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,144
Baby, tell me about this guy here.

1728
00:58:05,212 --> 00:58:05,911
That's a man.

1729
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:07,413
I'm talking about female.

1730
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,514
This girl's not skinny.

1731
00:58:08,582 --> 00:58:09,682
I'm bigger than her.

1732
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,285
That first winner wasn't... this
is not about size or look.

1733
00:58:13,353 --> 00:58:13,953

00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:19,792

Mm.

1736
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:23,963
I guess that's a no.

1737
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:26,165
I guess she gave herself a no.

1738
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:27,867
She said no to Hollywood.

1739
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:28,901
She said no.

1740
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:30,770
We didn't even have to say no.

1741
00:58:30,837 --> 00:58:31,704

1783
01:00:19,017 --> 01:00:25,923
I have come to Milwaukee because
I want the American people to

1792
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,678
So what is your name, sir?

1793
01:00:47,746 --> 01:00:50,080
My name is Albert Rogers III.

1794
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:50,948
And how old are you, Albert?

1795
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:51,982
I am 24.

1796
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:52,983
Really?

1797
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:53,884
Yeah.

1798
01:00:53,952 --> 01:00:55,686
Do I look younger, Randy?

1799
01:00:55,754 --> 01:00:58,122
I wouldn't quite say that.

1800
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:01,959
Oh, I look older.

1801
01:01:02,027 --> 01:01:03,794
No, he didn't say that.

1802
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:05,062
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

1803
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,031
Who do people say you
sound like when you sing?

1804
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:08,799
I've gotten ruben studdard.

1805
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:10,200
Of course.

1806
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:13,237
So if you've got ruben, you must have
gotten Luther probably, 'cause it's all...

1807
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:14,371
I've gotten Luther, yes.

1808
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:18,542
So, um, and a little Usher, but...
Wow.

1809
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:19,310
Maybe not so much.

1810
01:01:19,377 --> 01:01:21,245
Luther and Usher,
that's a wide gap.

1811
01:01:21,313 --> 01:01:24,415
I'm putting it out...
That's a lot of great singers right there.

1812
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:26,884
Well, you got to Usher yoself

All right, all right, so...
I never heard anybody squeeze

1829
01:02:13,665 --> 01:02:14,798
the flavor of that song.

1830
01:02:14,866 --> 01:02:17,034
You squeezed it out so slow,
it was like, you know, vanilla

1831
01:02:17,102 --> 01:02:18,535
Fudge and Eleanor rigby.

1832
01:02:20,372 --> 01:02:21,405
I liked it.

1833
01:02:21,473 --> 01:02:22,172
Huh?

1834
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,175
I'm not sure... I'm not sure
if it's American idol stuff.

1835
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,144
You think?

1836
01:02:27,212 --> 01:02:30,280
But I liked it.

1837
01:02:30,348 --> 01:02:32,883
Uh, I thought it was
terrible and a joke.

1838
01:02:32,951 --> 01:02:33,917
Hey.

1839
01:02:33,985 --> 01:02:34,785
It's just not serious.

1840
01:02:34,853 --> 01:02:36,286
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1841
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:40,524
I didn't... let's wrap... what...
do we even need to vote?

1842
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:43,027
Yes, we do.

1843
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:44,061
I say no.

1844
01:02:44,129 --> 01:02:45,429
I say no this time too.

1845
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:47,097
You're not up for this.

1846
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:48,432
But thanks for coming out, Albert.

1847
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,199
Thank you.

1848
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,200
Good looking out, baby.

1849
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:51,201
Thank you, guys.

1850
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:53,137
Okay.

1851
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:53,837
Wow.

1852
01:02:53,905 --> 01:02:56,273
Poor baby.

1853
01:02:56,341 --> 01:03:02,246
Even though Albert did not make it today,
he will be something big someday.

1854
01:03:02,313 --> 01:03:06,950
So I want you to stay tuned, America,
because things are about to shake up.

1855
01:03:07,018 --> 01:03:09,720
What a surprise that was.

1856
01:03:09,788 --> 01:03:11,221
Next.

1857
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:13,223
But something tells me the
judges will be even more

1858
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,293
surprised by student
teacher Scott dangerfield.

1859
01:03:16,361 --> 01:03:18,562
You know, I'm colorblind,
but, unless you borrowed my

1860
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,698
lipstick, is that your real lips?

1861
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:22,900
This is my real lip.

1862
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,335
If it is, then... I was kissing one
of the girls backstage before.

1863
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:26,070
I knew it.

1864
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,604
Nice.

1865
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:28,405
Did it rub off?

1866
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:29,106
I'm sorry.

1867
01:03:29,174 --> 01:03:31,175

This is the unassuming season.

1922
01:04:49,788 --> 01:04:52,156
Never judge a book by its cover.

1923
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,157
Dude, you were hot.

1924
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:53,857
Keep the hair.

We've been waiting

01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:03,734
Wow.

1933
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,042

01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:12,910
Wow.

1935
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:15,412
Jennifer Lopez said I was

1936
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:18,315
About your singing?

1937
01:05:18,383 --> 01:05:20,818
I almost fainted at that
point, but I caught myself.

1938
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:22,319
You know, I blacked out a little.

1939
01:05:22,387 --> 01:05:23,954
Did you give... did you
give her my number?

1940
01:05:33,565 --> 01:05:36,667
Coming up...
Someone gets Steven's attention.

1941
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:39,903
Why, you look like you could
be one of my [bleep].

1942
01:05:39,971 --> 01:05:40,904
Nope.

1943
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:43,373
You guys might want to get a room.

1944
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:47,911
Plus, he's triumphed
over incredible tragedy.

1945
01:05:47,979 --> 01:05:48,846
But can he win the judges'

1946
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:50,514
approval?

1947
01:05:50,582 --> 01:05:57,087
Stay tuned to find out.

1948
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:05,453
Welcome back to our
Milwaukee auditions.

1949
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,089
The people of Wisconsin
are a proud bunch.

1950
01:06:08,156 --> 01:06:09,590
Hey.

1951
01:06:09,658 --> 01:06:12,727
This state is home to some of
the most loyal and dedicated

1952
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:15,362
sports fans in the entire country.

1953
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,897
Well, green bay is the
home of the packers.

1954
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:18,399
The packers.

1955
01:06:18,467 --> 01:06:19,900
We love the packers.

1956
01:06:19,968 --> 01:06:22,636
The Milwaukee braves.

1957
01:06:22,704 --> 01:06:23,370
Oh, wait a minute.

1958
01:06:23,371 --> 01:06:25,873
They moved, didn't they?

1959
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:30,077
Somewhere down this line might be the
most colorful fan we've seen yet.

1960
01:06:30,145 --> 01:06:33,581
Whoo!

1961
01:06:33,648 --> 01:06:35,883
My passion is the
green bay packers.

1962
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,952
Go, pack, go!

1963
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:39,619

1965
01:06:48,163 --> 01:06:49,964
Whoo!

1966
01:06:50,031 --> 01:06:53,634
I became a huge packer
fan because of my dad.

1967
01:06:53,702 --> 01:06:54,969
It's unforgiven-able.

1968
01:06:55,036 --> 01:06:58,239
It's one of those sins you
cannot do is not be a green bay

1969
01:06:58,306 --> 01:06:59,640
packer fan in our home.

1970
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:07,681
Game day Sundays at my household...
Whoo!

1971
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:09,683
Oh, it's... it's an
intense environment.

1972
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:11,519
Go, pack, go!

1973
01:07:11,586 --> 01:07:15,990
- I've been known to get up, be disgusted...
- Go, pack, go!

1974
01:07:16,057 --> 01:07:17,658
Yelling, throw things.

1975
01:07:17,726 --> 01:07:20,261
Love the green and gold.

1976
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:24,598

Got to love the pack.

2000
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:53,360

01:07:53,428 --> 01:07:55,229

01:07:55,297 --> 01:07:56,297

That was beautiful.

2015
01:08:27,629 --> 01:08:29,230
Okay, look, I had enough.

2016
01:08:29,297 --> 01:08:30,698

Yeah, okay.

2021
01:08:37,873 --> 01:08:39,840
You want this to
take this by storm.

2022
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,809
Like, I mean you've had... storm.

2023
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:43,811
But you've had your country
singers and your beat-boxers.

2024
01:08:43,879 --> 01:08:44,912
It's time for some opera.

2025
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,647
Like, look at this.

2026
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:49,283
Self-imposed opera of
a Justin bieber song.

2027
01:08:49,351 --> 01:08:49,950
You're right.

2028
01:08:50,018 --> 01:08:51,485
That's what I've been
looking for all my life.

2029
01:08:51,553 --> 01:08:52,887
I know. Who hasn't?

2030
01:08:52,954 --> 01:08:54,588
Who hasn't?

2031
01:08:54,656 --> 01:08:55,623
Should we just vote?

2032
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:56,290
Yeah.

2033
01:08:56,358 --> 01:08:57,057
Yes.

2034
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:57,958
Well, that was fun.

2035
01:08:58,026 --> 01:09:00,527
Should we do it... should
we vote together?

2036
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:04,632
I know it's gonna be a
rounding... one, two, three.

2037
01:09:04,699 --> 01:09:05,299
Yes!

2038
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:06,634
No.

2039
01:09:06,701 --> 01:09:07,902
It's all right. Thanks.

2040
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:10,371
Well, you gave it the
old... it was fun.

2041
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,038
You should do stand-up.

2042
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,306
The old college team try.

2043
01:09:12,374 --> 01:09:13,874
Yes, thank you, sweetie.

2044
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,075
Thanks. Have a good one.

2045
01:09:15,143 --> 01:09:16,143
Nice meeting you all.

2046
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:16,810
Nice meeting you too.

2047
01:09:16,878 --> 01:09:18,012
Good luck to the packers.

2048
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:19,280
Thanks. Super bowl winners.

2049
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:22,182
I don't know about that.

2050
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,584
No?

2051
01:09:23,652 --> 01:09:24,818
It's a no.

2052
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,387
Ahh.

2053
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,757
So it looks like Megan's not
gonna be your idol this year.

2054
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:34,328
But Allie jados has been waiting
her whole life to meet hers.

2055
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:35,963
Are you excited today?

2056
01:09:36,031 --> 01:09:37,398
I am really excited.

2057
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:38,832
Tell me about that excitement.

2058
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,901
Steven Tyler's, like,
one of my idols.

2059
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,503
Like, when I saw him
walk out, I cried.

2060
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:52,079
You cried.

2061
01:09:52,147 --> 01:09:53,647
I was, like, pouring tears.

2062
01:09:53,715 --> 01:09:54,982
It's surreal, seriously.

2063
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:59,753
I auditioned because I want to
bring an edge, I want to bring

2064
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,190
more rock and roll
to American idol.

2065
01:10:03,258 --> 01:10:03,924
Good luck, Allie.

2066
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:04,692
Nice to chat with you.

2067
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:05,426
It was nice to meet you too.

2068
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:06,160
We're gonna send you in.

2069
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:07,394
Oh. Okay.

2070
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:12,366
I would freak out if Steven Tyler
told me I was going to Hollywood.

2071
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:16,370
I would freak out.

2072
01:10:16,438 --> 01:10:17,204
Hello.

2073
01:10:17,272 --> 01:10:17,905
Hi.

2074
01:10:17,973 --> 01:10:19,073
Hi.

2075
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:19,974
Hi.

2076
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:20,841
Wow.

2077
01:10:20,909 --> 01:10:22,476
What's your name?

2078
01:10:22,544 --> 01:10:23,711
Allie.

2079
01:10:23,778 --> 01:10:24,378
Allie?

2080
01:10:24,446 --> 01:10:25,079
Yeah.

2081
01:10:25,146 --> 01:10:28,916
Why, you look like you
could be one of my...Nope.

2082
01:10:28,984 --> 01:10:30,985
Friends. One of your friends.

2083
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:31,652
One of my friends.

2084
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,786
That's it.

2085
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,422
Hi. What's it all about?

2086
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,257
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

2087
01:10:37,325 --> 01:10:38,592
I'm sorry.

2088
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,259
I know. It's funny.

2089
01:10:39,327 --> 01:10:42,096
Jennifer, there's a thing with
these two, like, she can't speak.

2090
01:10:42,163 --> 01:10:43,931
Steven's lost for words.

2091
01:10:43,999 --> 01:10:45,466
Very rare.

2092
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,634
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

2093
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,036
Um, I love you.

2094
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:52,506
Obviously, we can kind
of tell something.

2095
01:10:52,574 --> 01:10:54,508
I'm thinking maybe a
hug is in line here.

2096
01:10:54,576 --> 01:10:55,175
Oh, my God.

2097
01:10:55,243 --> 01:10:56,143
Yes, please.

2098
01:10:58,279 --> 01:10:59,880
Oh, my God, this is too cool.

2099
01:10:59,948 --> 01:11:01,215
This is too cool.

2100
01:11:01,282 --> 01:11:02,216
It gets better.

2101
01:11:02,283 --> 01:11:03,617
It gets better. Watch.

2102
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:04,284
Okay.

2103
01:11:04,352 --> 01:11:05,052
Okay.

2104
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,921
I don't know about you,
Jennifer, but when you guys

2105
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:11,625
hugged, I could hear some
bells in the background.

2106
01:11:11,693 --> 01:11:12,793
Birds chirping.

2107
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:14,194
Birds and bells.

2108
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:16,030
Oh, my God.

2109
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:16,830
What are you into?

2110
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,265
Who do you like to sing?

2111
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:21,101
Um, I love the Beatles.

2112
01:11:21,169 --> 01:11:23,370
I love rock and roll.

2113
01:11:23,438 --> 01:11:24,438
Aerosmith.

2114
01:11:24,506 --> 01:11:26,573
Aerosmith. I love aerosmith.

2115
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:29,276
Seen you guys
probably seven times.

2116
01:11:29,344 --> 01:11:30,244
Nice.

2117
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:30,911
So far.

2118
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:32,246
What are you gonna sing tonight?

2119
01:11:32,313 --> 01:11:34,314
I'm gonna sing come
together by the Beatles.

2120
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:38,886

Yes.

2135

Which one?

2138
01:12:18,893 --> 01:12:20,294
Why don't you sing a
little bit of something?

2139
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:20,994
I could do dream on.

2140
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:23,697
I can't do the end, like the...
Oh, you got to have the end.

2141
01:12:23,765 --> 01:12:24,465
I can't.

2142
01:12:24,532 --> 01:12:26,867
You sing it, let Steven
do the end part.

2143
01:12:26,935 --> 01:12:27,668
Here we go.

2144
01:12:27,735 --> 01:12:28,435

I can't get there.

2157
01:12:52,894 --> 01:12:56,029
It's hard for her to sing her
idol's song in front of her idol.

2158
01:12:56,097 --> 01:12:56,730
I know it's tough.

2159
01:12:56,798 --> 01:12:59,333
Oh, you will have your
turn in the barrel.

2160
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,235
Whoa, yes, I love that.

2161
01:13:01,302 --> 01:13:02,970
That's not easy to do.

2162
01:13:03,037 --> 01:13:04,238
That was fun, though.

2163
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:05,873
That was really fun, yeah.

2164
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,508
I'm sorry I screwed it up.

2165
01:13:07,575 --> 01:13:12,012
It's hard for me because I so appreciate
you sang, you know, my song there.

2166
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,583
Um, very pitchy.

2167
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:21,121
You know, you know, you jump all
over the place with your notes.

2168
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:25,826
That kind of scares me.

2169
01:13:25,894 --> 01:13:26,527
I know I can do it.

2170
01:13:26,594 --> 01:13:28,662
I know I can do it.

2171
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,930
I want this so bad.

2172
01:13:29,998 --> 01:13:31,298
Oh.

2173
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,034
I think you have a great
quality in your voice.

2174
01:13:34,102 --> 01:13:36,170
And I think you have some really
good performance quality,

2175
01:13:36,237 --> 01:13:38,272
