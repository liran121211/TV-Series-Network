1
00:00:01,573 --> 00:00:06,691
Texas, a place American Idol has come to no end love.

2
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:11,810
We visited the lone star state six times over the years.

3
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,945
And we've never been disappointed.

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,548
# rest of my life #

5
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:17,782
What was that?

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,217
Well, maybe a little.

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,820
Get ready to do it all...

8
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:25,190
Over...

9
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,825
I wouldn't have chosen that song.

10
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,326
I wouldn't have chosen any song.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,427
Again.

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,466
This is Dallas.

13
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:38,903
And this is American Idol.

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,737
This week, American Idol sets

15
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,539
up in Dallas, Texas.

16
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,807
The Texans do it big, baby.

17
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,841
It's going down.

18
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,275
It's the second-biggest state in the U.S.,

19
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,146
but its pride is second to none.

20
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:22,814
Dallas is the best place to be.

21
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,549
I'm never leaving Texas, period.

22
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,251
# god bless Texas #

23
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:28,920
# with his own hand #

24
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:32,924
This is the third time we've two-stepped our way into the Big D.

25
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,309
And as a herd of 11,000 hopefuls migrate

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,061
to the new cowboys stadium...

27
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:37,896
Welcome back!

28
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:38,863
Welcome back!

29
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,366
Welcome back to Dallas!

30
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,068
We're loving the Dallas cheer.

31
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:46,638
# mm, god bless Texas #

32
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:49,774
And no one is happier to be back than me.

33
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,743
This is my favorite day ever at work.

34
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,012
Who's the guest judge today?

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,280
Richard Simmons.

36
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,315
Richard Simmons should come.

37
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,050
Clint Eastwood would be perfect.

38
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,218
Number one on my list.

39
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,753
He'll talk like this.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,288
Yeah. I hate you.

41
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:06,558
Sadly, Richard and Clint weren't available, so...

42
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,959
So here we are with Neil Patrick Harris.

43
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,227
All right. Thanks.

44
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:14,799
All joking aside, this guy is no show biz newcomer.

45
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:18,503
He's been in this business since he was 11, 12 years old.

46
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,038
He's a song-and-dance man.

47
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,874
# put down the remote #

48
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,676
A star of stage and screen.

49
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,755
And we know Neil will have a lot of

50
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,047
encouraging advice for our contestants.

51
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:32,483
My goal today, Kara, is to shatter the dreams of thousands.

52
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,807
If I can make two, three dozen people cry,

53
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,156
I feel like I've done my job.

54
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,273
While crushing some big Texas dreams,

55
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:43,930
hopefully Neil and the rest of our judges will also strike gold,

56
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,365
just like we did when we first visited Dallas in Season One.

57
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,866
Kelly Clarkson.

58
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,571
But she's not all we found that year in Dallas.

59
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,973
# gitchie-gitchie-ya-da #

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,407
# da-da #

61
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:57,442
# hey #

62
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,943
# gitchie-gitchie-ya-ya #

63
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,645
# yoo-oo #

64
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,579
'Kay.

65
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,949
Eight seasons later, she's ready to get some more exposure.

66
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,253
My name is Julie Kevelighan.

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,755
I am a college student.

68
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,125
But I could be the next American Idol.

69
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,860
I don't believe in giving up.

70
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,895
I'm that... You know, I got that personality.

71
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:18,997
I'm a leo, you know.

72
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,331
You remember me?

73
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,766
Yes, you did lady Marmalade.

74
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,667
Yup.

75
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,402
And they weren't so thrilled with you.

76
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,737
Are you taking singing lessons?

77
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,605
There was this lady up in Montana.

78
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,707
Get a lawyer and sue her.

79
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:30,507
No.

80
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,411
I'm gonna still try, you know.

81
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,013
The way I prepared for today...

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,913
Oh, sorry.

83
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,850
Taking choir and acting classes.

84
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,285
Well, hopefully this is your year.

85
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:41,771
And hopefully they have a smile on their face

86
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:42,820
when they hear you do your song.

87
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:43,488
Okay.

88
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,155
Good to see you.

89
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:44,889
Good to see you again, Ryan.

90
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,892
Thank you. Buh-bye.

91
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,360
- Oh, my. - Wow.

92
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,295
Hi.

93
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:50,962
- Hi. - Hello.

94
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,063
Welcome.

95
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,298
Sparkle.

96
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,532
What's your sign say?

97
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,967
"This is my year"

98
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,268
You wrote the sign?

99
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:57,935
Yes.

100
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,604
Okay, good, what are you gonna sing?

101
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,139
I'm gonna do "Black velvet".

102
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:01,839
Great.

103
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,107
By Alannah Myles.

104
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,009
I'm gonna set this sign down.

105
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,411
I think that's probably a good idea.

106
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:07,111
Okay.

107
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,781
Just...

108
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,150
# up in #

109
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:15,186
# music's like a heat wave #

110
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,622
# white lightning bound #

111
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,991
# to drive you wild #

112
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,660
# mama's baby's in the heart #

113
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,529
# of every school girl #

114
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:26,597
# love me tender #

115
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,599
# leaves 'em crying #

116
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,367
# in the aisles #

117
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,401
Ooh.

118
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,170
Okay. All right.

119
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:33,805
Um, Neil, what did you think of Julie, man?

120
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,507
Well, my first problem was the bottom line of your sign.

121
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,509
The letters just get real small at the end.

122
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,778
It seemed like you might have wanted to start over.

123
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,813
But vocally...

124
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,481
Oh, no.

125
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,782
Yeah, it wasn't a strong...

126
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,783
That was not good.

127
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,218
- Not good. - Can I do another song?

128
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,686
- I don't think so. - No, no, no, just one.

129
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:49,687
Simon?

130
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:52,523
Yes, I think you missed off the word "not."

131
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,526
Oh god.

132
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,162
Um, Julie, I mean, I'm being honest.

133
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,398
The whole thing, from the outfit, the makeup, the singing,

134
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,766
everything was wrong.

135
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,800
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

136
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,902
# somewhere #

137
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,570
God.

138
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:06,337
No.

139
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,206
# over the rainbow #

140
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,807
Julie, you're making it worse.

141
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,508
No.

142
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,477
# bluebirds fly #

143
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:13,211
Julie...

144
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:15,346
You changed keys in the middle there, sweet pea.

145
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:16,514
It's also getting weird.

146
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,383
The voice is not good enough.

147
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,550
Randy, yes or no?

148
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:20,351
No, no.

149
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,018
Neil?

150
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:22,153
No, no, no, no, no.

151
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,020
Kara?

152
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:23,821
I'm sorry, honey.

153
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,289
Sorry, sweetheart.

154
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:25,957
Thank you.

155
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,191
# let's give them something #

156
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,959
# to talk about #

157
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,794
You've done that, baby.

158
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,895
You've done that.

159
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,733
Charles, help Julie out with her sign.

160
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,567
No, honey.

161
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,602
# love #

162
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:38,803
Keep singing in the elevator.

163
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,304
Do you think that's gonna help?

164
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:41,205
That was weird.

165
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,173
You know what I mean?

166
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,343
That's just annoying.

167
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,210
Hey, Julie, how'd it go?

168
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,078
No.

169
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:47,779
No?

170
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,313
- No. - Why not this time?

171
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,349
I felt if I just would have paid attention to my breathing...

172
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,150
Breath control.

173
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,418
You know...

174
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,287
You know, maybe I can just do a song real quick right now...

175
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,489
No, no, their decision is final.

176
00:05:58,557 --> 00:05:59,390
It's not gonna help.

177
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,993
I just feel like I blew it, that's all.

178
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,561
Breath control.

179
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,429
Yeah.

180
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:07,265
Okay, well, c'est la vie, right?

181
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,699
Good luck to you. Thank you.

182
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,203
So far, Kelly Clarkson remains Season One's greatest find.

183
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,971
# black velvet #

184
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:18,115
I should have took a deep breath, what I should have done...

185
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,010
before I sung.

186
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,380
Which I think I did, but...

187
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,148
# black velvet #

188
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:27,151
# with that little boy's smile #

189
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,054
And the judges gave Julie a lot to think about.

190
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,557
And while she ponders her breathing techniques,

191
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,559
We're gonna head to a break.

192
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:38,596
In this hour, the search continues for some Texas-sized talent.

193
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,698
- Yes. - Billion percent yes.

194
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,834
My favorite audition of the day.

195
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,404
Have we found the next American Idol?

196
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,104
Look no further, baby,

197
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:52,109
Because I am the next America's Idol.

198
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,679
Plus, Simon messes with Texas.

199
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,814
It was absolutely atrocious.

200
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:59,050
As our guest judge messes with Simon.

201
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,251
Don't I get to say something?

202
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,820
Jeez Louise, you invite a guest judge on and...

203
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,188
Do we have a mutiny on the panel here?

204
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,723
This and more...

205
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,492
Get out of here, Simon. You better leave right now.

206
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,360
After the break.

207
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,714
Back with you in the Big D.

208
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:22,532
It's 11:00 a.m. in Texas,

209
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,427
and even though we didn't start out strong

210
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,255
in the past hour, Dallas has delivered for the ladies.

211
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:34,678
And if it's Texas-sized talent that we want,

212
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,830
our next guy already has a leg up.

213
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:42,569
I like to think I can robot just a li... Oh, pick it back up.

214
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:45,272
My name is Lloyd " big succsexy " Thomas.

215
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,740
Succsexy.

216
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:47,708
I'm from Dallas, Texas.

217
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,042
I'm 29 years old.

218
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,776
What do you do for a living?

219
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,513
Uh, actually, I'm a dock worker right now for an airline.

220
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,116
It's picking up boxes, pushing boxes.

221
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,952
The worst part about my job that I have...

222
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,920
Did you wash your hands?

223
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:03,290
is probably my job that I have.

224
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,092
These are my two lovely daughters.

225
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,027
Wait a minute, let me put my wallet away.

226
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:10,163
These are my lovely daughters right there.

227
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:11,598
If you can just zoom up.

228
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,367
Oh, if you could just...

229
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,969
We gonna edit that part, right?

230
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,014
I'm born and raised in Dallas, and, you know,

231
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:22,798
Just a homegrown homeboy, growing up in the projects with,

232
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,812
You know, drugs everywhere, guns everywhere.

233
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,248
And now I've got a family of my own.

234
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:31,111
This day is so important because I don't want them

235
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,906
to have to ever know what it was like to experience

236
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:36,056
some of the things that I experienced.

237
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,292
I don't want them to know that

238
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,970
when daddy says, " yeah, you can do anything, baby, "

239
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,763
they'll know we can do anything.

240
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,331
'Cause daddy did it.

241
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,132
Yeah.

242
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,100
There it is. There it is.

243
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,435
And what are you gonna sing?

244
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:51,104
I'm gonna sing " Overjoyed " by Stevie Wonder.

245
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,472
Good.

246
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,909
# over dreams #

247
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:59,680
# I've envisioned the perfect #

248
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,950
# come true #

249
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:07,955
# though you never knew it #

250
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,222
# was of you #

251
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,895
# I've been dreaming #

252
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,263
# and though you don't believe #

253
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:18,665
# that they do #

254
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:22,002
# dreams do come true #

255
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,669
Thank you.

256
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,571
That's what's up.

257
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,100
You know, what I love about this show, Lloyd, is that here you are,

258
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,544
you're a dock worker, and you have that voice.

259
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,547
I mean, come on, this guy's working the docks with that voice.

260
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,514
This guy's working the...

261
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:35,582
That's what I'm saying.

262
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,017
And I love that the show...

263
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,620
I love that the show lets you come here and do that.

264
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:43,481
I think you have a wonderful voice, but I need to see you really be

265
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,993
as flashy as you are right now as a person.

266
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,660
We can do that.

267
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:47,694
I like your vibe too.

268
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:49,730
You got all your positivity jumping off.

269
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,697
That's what it's all about.

270
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:53,000
Uh, for me, it was my favorite audition of the day.

271
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,034
Get out of here, Simon.

272
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:55,535
You better leave right now.

273
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:57,371
He'd love to.

274
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:58,205
No. Have him stay.

275
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,840
We've got more people...

276
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:00,641
No, I mean it.

277
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,209
I really, really like you.

278
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,244
I think you're a great singer.

279
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:04,911
Well done.

280
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,779
Randy, yes or no?

281
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,048
Uh, billion percent yes to Lloyd.

282
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:08,715
A billion?

283
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:09,383
Neil?

284
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,050
I give you a yes.

285
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:10,717
Yeah.

286
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:11,385
Kara?
Kara?

287
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:12,753
100% yes.

288
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,654
Lloyd, you've got four yeses.

289
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:14,321
Well done.

290
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,092
Welcome to Hollywood, Lloyd.

291
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,893
Thank you. Love you.

292
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:20,560
Love you.

293
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:21,895
Keep it real.

294
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:22,863
Take care.

295
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,897
Yeah!

296
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,870
Oh, my god!

297
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:32,172
Oh, my goodness, Lord Jesus.

298
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,974
Oh, my Lord Jesus., goodness.

299
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:34,841
It's tangible.

300
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,777
I wish you could taste what I taste right now.

301
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,878
It's touchable.

302
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:39,046
It's the taste...

303
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:40,914
It's readable, and it's reachable.

304
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:43,250
of victory.

305
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:47,654
That's what this is.

306
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:48,755
Delicious.

307
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:51,404
The only guy to grab the golden ticket so far,

308
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:54,695
Lloyd Thomas is shining like the lone star of Texas.

309
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,513
And as morning turns to high noon,

310
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:58,832
it looks like there's gonna be a showdown.

311
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,500
I thought you were just great.

312
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:03,003
Got absolutely nothing out of that audition, I'm afraid.

313
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:03,737
I say yes.

314
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:04,538
Definitely not.

315
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,006
I found it really boring.

316
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:07,040
A bit rude.

317
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,008
I'm gonna say no.

318
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:09,376
I'm gonna give you another shot.

319
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:10,310
Oh, my god.

320
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,078
Simon, yes or no?

321
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,045
I'm gonna say no.

322
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:12,713
I'm gonna say yes.

323
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,380
I like it.

324
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,415
I love you, Neil Patrick Harris, oh, my god.

325
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,384
I'm scared to disagree with you.

326
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:18,351
Randy, yes or no?

327
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,086
Nah.

328
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,787
Well, don't I get to say something?

329
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:22,823
Jeez louise, you invite a guest judge on and bully him around.

330
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,526
Whoa.

331
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,662
Well, it looks like we have a standoff.

332
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,100
Can our next contestant Kimberly Carver keep out of the crossfire?

333
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:33,867
Hello.

334
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:34,401
Hi.

335
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,102
Hi, guys.

336
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:37,337
What a pleasure to be in front of you.

337
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,705
I've dreamed about this forever.

338
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,107
Cool. What are you singing for us today?

339
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,409
Um, I'm actually gonna sing an original if that's okay with you guys.

340
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,076
Wow.

341
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,411
Okay.

342
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:47,581
# your eyes give you away #

343
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:49,149
# I know #

344
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,551
# you wanna be my friend #

345
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,420
# I can tell #

346
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:55,222
# you've been around #

347
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,389
# well, I've heard #

348
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,224
# you've been flirting #

349
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,059
# with the town #

350
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:00,894
# my poor mother said #

351
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,562
# if you can #

352
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,598
# remember every good woman #

353
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:05,966
# needs to find herself #

354
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,467
# a real good man #

355
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:08,435
Thank you.

356
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:09,102
Wow.

357
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,570
Excellent. Brilliant voice.

358
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:13,240
Doesn't matter the song original, whatever, whatever.

359
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:13,974
You can blow, man.

360
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,442
That was really, really good.

361
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,209
Thank you.

362
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:16,977
Thank you very much.

363
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:17,978
Really excellent.

364
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:21,126
I don't see anything current, anything interesting,

365
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:24,918
Anything which would make me interested in you as a performer.

366
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,019
So that's why I have an issue.

367
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,587
I disagree with you, Simon.

368
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,560
I thought it was really quite great.

369
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,594
I disagree with Simon too.

370
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:36,029
Do we have a mutiny on the panel here?

371
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:36,763
Yeah.

372
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:39,933
I was just saying, under normal circumstances,

373
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,347
you wouldn't be interested.

374
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,339
No, I would be.

375
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,342
I would be too because the voice would draw me in,

376
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:49,709
and this is a singing competition.

377
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,645
If it was Jazz TV, yes.

378
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,015
No, because there's a lot of jazz in today's music.

379
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:55,982
You have a great vibe.

380
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,917
Let's take a vote.

381
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,818
Randy, what do you think?

382
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,519
I say a million percent yes.

383
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:00,554
You got great vocals.

384
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:01,488
This is a singing show.

385
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:02,155
Thank you.

386
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,490
Kara?

387
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:04,157
Thank you so much.

388
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:05,325
I'm gonna say yes.

389
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:06,059
Simon?

390
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:07,761
I'm gonna say no.

391
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,696
Well, I am gonna say a big yes.

392
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:10,797
I think you have a great vibe.

393
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:11,565
Congratulations.

394
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:12,365
Welcome to Hollywood.

395
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:17,337
Prove that man on the end that he should be watching you all the time.

396
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,405
I'm gonna impress you next time, you watch.

397
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:26,472
Welcome to Jazz TV.

398
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:27,480
# Bum bum bum bum #

399
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:29,216
Jazz TV... You're so bad.

400
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:30,884
# Bum bum bum bum #

401
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:31,985
Simon hated me.

402
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:36,756
But they totally overrode him, and thank god for Neil Patrick Harris.

403
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:38,925
I'm gonna have to go back and watch Doogie Howser again.

404
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:42,062
Thanks to Dr. Howser,

405
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,698
Kimberly leaves with a prescription for Hollywood.

406
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,267
I'm going to Hollywood, baby!

407
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,368
You better follow me there.

408
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,070
Yeah!

409
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,906
Coming up, can the guys play nice?

410
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,774
It's an absolute unanimous no.

411
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:55,809
What?

412
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:56,576
Come on.

413
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:58,745
Or will they have to be whipped into submission?

414
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:00,080
Who do you want to whip first?

415
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:01,514
Well, it depends on how this goes.

416
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,182
Oh.

417
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,851
Stay with us as things get wild...

418
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,453
and Texas strikes gold.

419
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,789
I think you're one of the best I've seen for season nine.

420
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,791
Yay!

421
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,405
Welcome back to Dallas.

422
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:22,642
One thing's for sure, whenever American Idol comes to town,

423
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,000
it's always a big deal.

424
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,604
Thousands of people from all over the country come to us

425
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,006
to help make their dreams come true.

426
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:34,777
And the media is always on hand to help spread the news.

427
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,146
Big crowds out at Cowboy Stadium in Arlington.

428
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,947
A lot of excitement, a lot of anticipation.

429
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,349
Now let's talk to a couple of folks

430
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,950
that are here to audition this morning.

431
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,571
They are just as eager to find the next American Idol as we are.

432
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:46,924
And earlier this morning,

433
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,457
they may have done just that.

434
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,530
The show is over because I am the next America's Idol.

435
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,151
My name is Dexter Warren and, you know,

436
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:59,902
you guys are looking for your next idol.

437
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,303
Well, look no further, baby.

438
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:01,970
I'm here.

439
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:03,105
I'm just being honest.

440
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:04,873
The show is over.

441
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,408
I am very, very, very, very,

442
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:08,377
very, very, very, very, very,

443
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,052
very sure, when I come through that door,

444
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:12,915
I will have a golden ticket.

445
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:18,187
So without further ado, let the games begin.

446
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:29,498
All right.

447
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:30,332
- Oh, yeah. - Work it.

448
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Work it.

449
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:32,901
Work it.

450
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:33,669
How are you?

451
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:34,636
Fine. And you?

452
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:35,471
I'm good.

453
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:36,405
What's your name?

454
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:37,272
Dexter Warren.

455
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,941
So what are you gonna sing for us today?

456
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,676
Um, "If I ever fall in love again" by Shai.

457
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:42,745
Whenever you're ready.

458
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,148
# the very first time #

459
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,550
# that I saw your brown eyes #

460
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:50,252
# your lips said hello #

461
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,820
# and I said hi #

462
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,422
# I knew right then #

463
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,992
# you were the one #

464
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,560
# but I was caught up #

465
00:15:58,628 --> 00:15:59,294
# caught up #

466
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:01,396
# in physical attraction #

467
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:04,600
# but to my satisfaction #

468
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,235
# baby, you're more #

469
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:08,871
# than just a friend #

470
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:12,608
# and if I ever fall in love #

471
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:15,177
# so true #

472
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,945
# I will be sure #

473
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:18,480
# that the lady's #

474
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:22,484
# just like you #

475
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:23,519
Nice.

476
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:24,686
Oh. Oh, Dexter.

477
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:25,454
Kara?

478
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,055
Dexter, man, I don't...

479
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:30,759
I don't... Randy, help.

480
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:31,627
Help, Randy.

481
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,529
No, dude, look, I mean, really, right?

482
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,063
That looked like it hurt.

483
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,498
Can I say something, please?

484
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:37,399
It's just the nerves.

485
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,500
It's just the song or whatever.

486
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,569
I have another song that I've been trying to...

487
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:41,303
Dawg...

488
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:42,004
I can do it much better.

489
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:42,365
Dexter, by you saying you've got something else

490
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,250
- to sing is not gonna help you. -Yeah, that was...

491
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,730
That was not the best audition, dude.

492
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Singing's not your thing, though, dawg.

493
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm telling you, man.

494
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,040
Trust me, man. Trust.

495
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,140
All right, Kara, yes or no?

496
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,870
I mean, it's just not gonna work, honey.

497
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,640
I'm sorry.

498
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,380
Simon?

499
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,510
It's no. Sorry, Dexter.

500
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,180
Yeah, sorry, man.

501
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,840
Maybe next time.

502
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,510
Nice to meet you.

503
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,850
But thanks for liking the show.

504
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,510
Thank you.

505
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,880
But you've got a good attitude, good smile.

506
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,220
I like you, Dexter.

507
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,020
That smile will take you far in life, I promise you.

508
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,660
It will.

509
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,730
It turns out Dexter's smile barely made it outside the judging room.

510
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,760
And as the day one auditions continued...

511
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,860
That's a no, sweetheart.

512
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,560
Sorry.

513
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,060
I don't think the voice is strong enough.

514
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,730
I'm gonna say no.

515
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,400
Sorry.

516
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,140
Many of the big dreams of the Dallas hopefuls suddenly came to an end.

517
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,440
It's not worth my tears.

518
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,870
I don't know why I'm crying.

519
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,480
Making it difficult to take it all in.

520
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,480
# and I can't breathe #

521
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,280
# without you #

522
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,250
# but I have to #

523
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,220
All right, everybody,

524
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,220
group hug.

525
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,990
# breathe #

526
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,560
# without you #

527
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,090
# but I have to #

528
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,330
Back inside, the judges are also in need of a sigh of relief.

529
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,070
So while they take a break,

530
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,770
I get an update from guest judge Neil Patrick Harris.

531
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
What have you thought about this group of contestants so far today?

532
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,980
I've been surprised by the talent.

533
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,115
I thought it would be a lot of nos and a few yeses,

534
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,580
but we've sent a lot... A fair amount of people through.

535
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,920
Do you find it tough to be honest with them, or not?

536
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,140
People get reamed out every single week on this show,

537
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,120
week after week, multiple songs.

538
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,720
You know more than anyone.

539
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,400
So it's like, if they can't handle this heat,

540
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,200
that kitchen is the broiler.

541
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,780
Looking to take full advantage of a refreshed group of judges,

542
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:28,300
our next contestant plans on leaving a striking impression.

543
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,570
My name is Erica Rhodes.

544
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,170
I'm 23, and I'm from Irving, Texas.

545
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,910
What do you do in Irving?

546
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,140
Well, right now, I'm a grad student, but I also act.

547
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,150
I've been acting since I was little.

548
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,080
The first major thing that I was on was Barney & Friends.

549
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,580
Really?

550
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,550
I started off as a Barney kid.

551
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,920
# Barney is a dinosaur #

552
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,220
This panda has always been special to me.

553
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,590
I was innocent, sweet, child-like.

554
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,330
I do feel the need to show people that I've grown up from Barney.

555
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,500
Is this part of your...

556
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,330
Yes, it is.

557
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Performance?

558
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,770
Yes, it is.

559
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,430
Don't tell nobody.

560
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,200
All right, I won't say anything about your gloves.

561
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,100
Today for my audition,

562
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,770
I think I'm going to take a different approach.

563
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,410
Wow. With a whip.

564
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,380
Come on in, Barney.

565
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,910
So who do you want to whip first?

566
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,720
Okay, it says here that you used to be a dinosaur or something.

567
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,250
I used to be on barney & friends.

568
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,920
What?

569
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,560
I knew I recognized you.

570
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,220
What is that?

571
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,030
Do a little bit of the Barney song in this outfit, though.

572
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,990
Sing a little bit of it.

573
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,730
Okay.

574
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,100
# I love you #

575
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,300
# you love me #

576
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,100
# we're a happy family #

577
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:33,830
Oh, my god.

578
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,600
Oh, I'm getting the creeps.

579
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,870
# with a great, big hug #

580
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,170
# and a kiss from me to you #

581
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,680
# won't you say #

582
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,940
# you love me too #

583
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,710
Oh.

584
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Barney would be so proud.

585
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,550
And then I whip all my friends.

586
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,820
And then I spank them 'cause they're naughty.

587
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,090
That's what I do.

588
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,690
Okay, Erica, what are you gonna sing today?

589
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm going to sing " Free your mind " by En vogue.

590
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,560
Great.

591
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,430
Okay.

592
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,390
# I wear tight clothing #

593
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,300
# high-heeled shoes #

594
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,170
# but that don't mean #

595
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,230
# that I'm a prostitute #

596
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,640
# no, no #

597
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,040
# I might date another #

598
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,170
# race or color #

599
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
# it doesn't mean I don't like #

600
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,410
# my strong black brother #

601
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,050
# ooh la la la la #

602
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,050
# la la la la #

603
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,650
# free your mind #

604
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,590
# and the rest will follow #

605
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,350
Ok. We got it.

606
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,090
We got it. Thank you, Erica.

607
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,390
Okay, well, look, you definitely made an impression here, Erica.

608
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,790
That was cool.

609
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,230
Um, what's the big dream here?

610
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,000
The big dream is...

611
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,870
I know what mine is.

612
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,540
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

613
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,180
I want people to know that Barney kids grow up.

614
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,840
To be dirty little girls.

615
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,610
Well, I'm not dirty.

616
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,750
I mean, my role model is Janet Jackson.

617
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,950
What do you expect?

618
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,990
I do like people who make an effort.

619
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,550
You've gone from the kids thing to this.

620
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,390
It takes guts.

621
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,690
It's really rare that someone comes in here

622
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,032
and they're like, you know,

623
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,340
"I'm just gonna do my thing,

624
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,135
This is who I am,

625
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,640
and here it comes," you know.

626
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,170
And I really like that about you.

627
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,940
- Great presence. - Okay, Randy, yes or no?

628
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,410
I like her. I'm gonna say yes.

629
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,440
- Neil? - I think you might actually do really well.

630
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,255
I say yes.

631
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,710
- Kara? - Definitely.

632
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,280
Erica, you're through.

633
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,150
Welcome to Hollywood. You made it.

634
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,620
Thank you so much.

635
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,520
Trip down memory lane and four yeses later...

636
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:26,980
Contestants are still crying in Dallas.

637
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,140
Who cries as a dominatrix?

638
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,410
Barney dominatrixes.

639
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,010
But at least these are tears of joy.

640
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,480
I think we're gonna let them catch their breath.

641
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,600
We'll come back with more auditions right here on American Idol.

642
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,950
Yes! Ha ha ha ha!

643
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,320
You think I'm crazy, don't ya?

644
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,390
No.

645
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,660
Yeah! We made it!

646
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,030
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

647
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,430
And, remember, I love you.

648
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,470
When we come back, will the gold rush continue?

649
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,870
It was terrible.

650
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,200
Are you sending me to Hollywood?

651
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,940
- Oh, God. - Plus, they've beaten the odds...

652
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,670
The first thing that went through my mind was

653
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:04,740
that I was gonna lose her.

654
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,280
Call it a miracle.

655
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,710
You know, I don't know what it is.

656
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,440
But will they need a miracle

657
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,280
to make it to Hollywood?

658
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,540
Voice-wise, I'm not jumping out of my chair.

659
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,240
Welcome back to American Idol.

660
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,470
We started the day with 11,000 strong.

661
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,640
And now the Day One auditions

662
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,740
are starting to wind down.

663
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,280
Throughout the day, several contestants

664
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,750
have played the odds and cashed in big.

665
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm not letting this go.

666
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,390
Now the final contestant of the day

667
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,250
will try to do the same.

668
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,020
Only, life has dealt him a hand in which

669
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,860
the odds are stacked against him.

670
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,190
My name's Dave Pittman,

671
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,985
and I'm 27 years old,

672
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,720
and I'm from Gassville, Arkansas.

673
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,755
I was first diagnosed with

674
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,675
Tourette's Syndrome when...

675
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,270
when I was... I was nine years old.

676
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,660
Tourette's syndrome is a neurological disorder,

677
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:05,280
and it affects the nervous system.

678
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,730
The symptoms that go along with Tourette's is,

679
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:10,120
You know, maybe blinking of the eyes, you know,

680
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,620
shaking the head sometimes, clearing of the throat.

681
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,120
Sometimes, you know,

682
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,920
when Tourette's has been bothering me or something,

683
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,210
You know, Dad and I, we'll go out and, you know,

684
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,340
we'll spend some time together in the woods fishing.

685
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,475
The crazy thing is that it doesn't...

686
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,300
It doesn't affect me at all when I'm singing.

687
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,430
Call it a miracle.

688
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,400
I don't know what it is.

689
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,790
I used to see Tourette's as a curse,

690
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:35,110
you know, but I consider it a blessing.

691
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,910
It's taught me a lot about myself.

692
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,180
It's made me who I am.

693
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,950
- So you are Dave Pittman? - Yes, I am.

694
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,135
It says that you're 27,

695
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,520
- from mountain home, Arkansas. - Yes.

696
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,690
So you think you're the next American Idol, dog?

697
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,020
Oh, yeah. I'm ready for this.

698
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,820
This has been my dream since I've been a kid.

699
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,860
What you gonna sing?

700
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,190
I'm gonna sing " Bring it on home to me " by Sam Cooke.

701
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,900
Do it.

702
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,330
# if you ever #

703
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,330
# change your mind #

704
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,670
# about leaving #

705
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,570
# leaving me behind #

706
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,410
# oh #

707
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,210
# bring it to me #

708
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,910
# bring your sweet loving #

709
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,350
# bring it on home #

710
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,950
# to me, yeah #

711
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,920
# Oh, yeah #

712
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,920
# you know, i've tried #

713
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,160
# to treat you right #

714
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,890
- Thank you, David. - What do you think, Neil?

715
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,990
- What do you think, Man? - I really liked your voice.

716
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,990
- I appreciate that. - Weird elephant in the room.

717
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,220
Do you have... Do you have, like,

718
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,190
Tourette's syndrome or something?

719
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,770
Yes, I do. I have Tourette's Syndrome.

720
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,415
But you don't...

721
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,100
That doesn't happen when you're singing.

722
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,700
How crazy is that?

723
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,670
- That's wild. - I didn't see it.

724
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,410
But your voice is just great.

725
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,880
I mean, you have a really cool look and...

726
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,840
Appreciate that.

727
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,240
Yeah, I liked your voice too, Man.

728
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,750
I thought you were a really good singer.

729
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,750
It's a tough song to sing.

730
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,720
You did it very nicely. Let's take a vote.

731
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,480
Simon, yes or no?

732
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,380
I think people are gonna like you.

733
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,820
Yeah, and I thought you were terrific.

734
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,120
Kara?

735
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,560
I want to give you another shot.

736
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,020
- Yes. - Neil?

737
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,860
I think you're crazy brave.

738
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,060
And good for you.

739
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,860
Really good voice. I say yes.

740
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,200
Dude, I'm gonna say yes too.

741
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,160
Welcome to Hollywood. Yeah!

742
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,440
Thank you, guys, so much.

743
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,250
Yeah!

744
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,440
This is, like, just one step closer to my dream.

745
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,430
I can't even hardly talk.

746
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,580
It's amazing. Whoo!

747
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,370
You're going to Hollywood!

748
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,470
As day one comes to a close,

749
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,800
Dave lassoed

750
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,900
the last golden tickets in Dallas.

751
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,950
Hollywood, baby.

752
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,850
Hollywood.

753
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,860
Proving dreams still do come true.

754
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,660
And he, along with 14 others that made it to Hollywood,

755
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,730
couldn't think of a better way to celebrate...

756
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,410
- I'm gonna say yes. - Super-big yes for me.

757
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,610
I'll give you another shot.

758
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,180
You got four yeses, darling.

759
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,950
Than to have a party.

760
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,920
Welcome to Hollywood.

761
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,800
# here I am #

762
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,990
# for the first time #

763
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,620
# look to my right #

764
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,300
- Yes. - Thank you.

765
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,500
# this is all so crazy #

766
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,250
# I'm nodding my head #

767
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,390
# like yeah #

768
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,000
It's a yes.

769
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,390
# moving my hips like yeah #

770
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,120
# it's a party in the USA #

771
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,200
I'm gonna whip it in Hollywood.

772
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,250
It's the golden ticket!

773
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,350
Ticket!

774
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,370
Coming up...

775
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,800
Tomorrow, a Jonas brother.

776
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,260
Girls screaming everywhere.

777
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,410
Day two, can we wrangle up any more talent?

778
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,050
That was excellent.

779
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,460
- My favorite of the day. - After this.

780
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,230
Welcome to the second day of

781
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,360
the roundup here in Dallas.

782
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,690
Welcome back to the Big D.

783
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,510
Whoo!

784
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,480
The crowd is all saddled up and ready to go.

785
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,950
All we need now are the judges.

786
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,620
Hi. Big D in the house.

787
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,950
And our guest judge for today

788
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,350
is none other than Joe Jonas.

789
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I hear there was a little confusion

790
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,820
about who Joe Jonas is.

791
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,760
He's 1/3 of the world's busiest brothers.

792
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,405
And wherever he goes,

793
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,980
one word describes him...

794
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,680
Heartthrob.

795
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,630
This is actually our hometown.

796
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,640
So to see future stars hopefully coming out

797
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,440
of Dallas is always exciting for us.

798
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,940
All right, let's do this.

799
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,240
But Joe isn't just another pretty face.

800
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,265
In the past year,

801
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,690
he and his brothers have become so big,

802
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,080
even Randy Jackson wants in on the act.

803
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm now a member of the Jonas brothers.

804
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,450
You're a member of the Jonas brothers?

805
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,120
Unofficially, but,

806
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,600
officially, yeah.

807
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,660
So the contestants are set.

808
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,900
The cameras are rolling.

809
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,360
And there's a slight chill in the room.

810
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,660
Yeah, man, I'm saying, dude.

811
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,300
It's cold in here.

812
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,430
First up is Todrick Hall,

813
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,500
and he has the job of being the warm-up act.

814
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,640
- Welcome to Dallas, you all. - Thank you.

815
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,410
You were with fantasia in the color purple?

816
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,380
Yes, I was.

817
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,390
And now it's time to step into

818
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,730
the spotlight and be the idol?

819
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,200
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try.

820
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,630
All right, well, let's hear it.

821
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,440
This is a special song

822
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,420
that I wrote just for y'all.

823
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,590
# Todrick is my name #

824
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,620
# and I'm here to play #

825
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,920
# a part in your game #

826
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,490
# hopped a plane #

827
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,160
# took a train just to claim #

828
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,530
# my 15 minutes of fame #

829
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,300
# and to see Kara decked #

830
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,300
# and dressed #

831
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,570
# Simon's face looking #

832
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,670
# so unimpressed #

833
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,400
# sitting there like a bump #

834
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,240
# on a log #

835
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,700
# Randy, what I got to do #

836
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,540
# to be your dawg #

837
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,240
# tell me, do I have #

838
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,580
# to dress up like I'm from #

839
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,580
# a crazy house #

840
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,410
# or sing like William hung #

841
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,950
# for you to see #

842
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,210
# there's some potential #

843
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,750
# in little, ol' me #

844
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,480
# and tell me, do I have #

845
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,750
# to get down on my knees #

846
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,190
# in my $300 jeans #

847
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,690
# cause I would #

848
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,090
# if it meant to me #

849
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,330
# that maybe you could #

850
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,630
# just send me to Hollywood #

851
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,460
- Thank you. - Whoo! I liked that.

852
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,600
That was awesome.

853
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,500
- That was cute. - That was cool, man.

854
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,170
Very good.

855
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,700
Simon, I can't get a clap or nothing?

856
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,470
That's good.

857
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,670
Thank you.

858
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,610
I'll take one.

859
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,180
I'll take one.

860
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,950
Dude, I think you one of the best

861
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:06,305
I've seen in this audition

862
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,050
for season nine, because, dude,

863
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,750
that was excellent.

864
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,620
- Thank you. - It was awesome, man.

865
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,490
Definitely you have star power, for sure.

866
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,590
Thank you very much.

867
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,610
My feeling is, I think you're a nice guy,

868
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,910
I think you're a good singer,

869
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,230
I think it was a cutesy audition.

870
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,400
Voice-wise, I'm not jumping out of my chair.

871
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,900
I'm jumping out of my chair.

872
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,200
Okay, we're gonna see how high Randy's gonna jump.

873
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,900
- Yes or no? - Yes.

874
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,370
Thank you.

875
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,140
- Joe? - Yeah.

876
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,970
- Kara? - Yes.

877
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,810
Four yeses.

878
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,610
Welcome to Hollywood, Todrick.

879
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,210
I'm going to Hollywood!

880
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,620
I thought he was good.

881
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,580
I made it.

882
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,790
We're gonna take this ticket,

883
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,020
and we're gonna go all the way to the top.

884
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,760
Day two is off to a great start.

885
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,690
And Todrick is head over heels with excitement.

886
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,330
But he wasn't the only one.

887
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,860
# I'm sitting here #

888
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,400
# so lonely #

889
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,540
# so lonesome I could cry #

890
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,100
I'm gonna say yes. I'll give you another shot.

891
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,290
- Joe? - Yeah.

892
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:07,410
Definitely.

893
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,110
You've got four yeses, sweetheart.

894
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,410
- Yay. Thank you. - Yeah.

895
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,980
- Yes. - Thank you so much.

896
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,650
I'm gonna say yes.

897
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,080
Michael, I'm gonna say yes as well.

898
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,350
- Whoo! - You're through to Hollywood.

899
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,820
Whoo!

900
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,820
# I'll meet you halfway #

901
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,920
# my love #

902
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,160
# won't you do the same #

903
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,430
I'm gonna say yes.

904
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,190
# Hollywood #

905
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,590
- I say yeah. - I'm gonna say yes.

906
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,260
It's a yes for me.

907
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,300
Welcome to Hollywood.

908
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,940
Looking to continue Day two's gold rush...

909
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,600
is Megan Wright.

910
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,925
And she's happy not to

911
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,770
face today's audition alone.

912
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,970
My name is Megan Wright.

913
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,210
I'm 20, and I'm from Richardson, Texas.

914
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,340
My parents are divorced.

915
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,350
They got divorced five years ago.

916
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,555
They're both remarried,

917
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,220
And I have my little brother.

918
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,050
It's just me and him.

919
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,080
I'm really glad I have her,

920
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,555
cause, without her,

921
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,560
it would just be boring.

922
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,610
If I make it to Hollywood,

923
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,560
I can't express what it will mean to my brother.

924
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,090
He will be so excited.

925
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,960
I may give her a big,

926
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,760
old hug and never stop.

927
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,670
Party all night! Uh-huh.

928
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,470
I really want her to be the next American Idol.

929
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,810
- You do? - Yes.

930
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,610
- What do you think America will think? - Yes.

931
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,210
- Hello. - Hi, hi, hi.

932
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,080
- Hi, hi, hi. - I'm excited. Hi.

933
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,020
What are you gonna sing?

934
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,280
"To Make You Feel My Love."
"To Make You Feel My Love"

935
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,690
Okay. Go for it.

936
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,590
# when the rain is blowing #

937
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,490
# in your face #

938
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,260
# and the whole world #

939
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,330
# is on your case #

940
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,470
# I could offer you #

941
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,900
# a warm embrace #

942
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,400
# to make you feel my love #

943
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,440
# I'd go hungry #

944
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,440
# I'd go blind for you #

945
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,380
# I'd go crawling #

946
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,120
# down the avenue #

947
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,950
Thank you very much, Megan.

948
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,550
- Thank you, Simon. - Wow.

949
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,190
- I really like you. - Interesting.

950
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,850
Thank you.

951
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,690
I mean, you really confused me.

952
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,265
from walking in with that outfit,

953
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,390
I really thought this was gonna be a joke.

954
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,360
Oh, man.

955
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,460
And then you open your mouth like that,

956
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,030
and you have a great voice.

957
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,600
- Thank you. - I mean, a really beautiful voice.

958
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,170
- Very moving. - Thank you.

959
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,440
Funny enough, I disagree with Kara

960
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:19,470
about what you're wearing.

961
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,640
Gee, imagine.

962
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,080
Because I think that, in a way,

963
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,590
you're not trying too hard like

964
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,980
we see with a lot of other people,

965
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,250
and I like the surprise element from you.

966
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,910
Thank you.

967
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,320
And if that's what makes you comfortable, then fine.

968
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,820
- Randy, yes or no? - I love this girl. Yes!

969
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,490
Thank you.

970
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,820
- Joe? - Yeah.

971
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,820
- Kara? - My favorite of the day. Yes.

972
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,620
Uh, so it's a no from Kara.

973
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,790
It's a yes from me.

974
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,130
- Ah, yes. - Thank you, guys.

975
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,930
Yes.

976
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,970
We're 2,000% positive.

977
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,330
Oh, I'm just one step closer

978
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,910
to being the next American Idol.

979
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,750
Megan's Idol dream is still alive.

980
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,460
And Dawson gets to cheer on his big sister

981
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:09,220
all the way to Hollywood.

982
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,290
Coming up...

983
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,760
She's a survivor.

984
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,410
The first thing that went through my mind

985
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:14,690
was that I was gonna lose her.

986
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,630
But can she make it through her audition?

987
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,270
Plus, everyone wonders why Simon's mood always sour?

988
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,740
If anyone ever asks me in my life

989
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,680
what my nightmares look and sound like,

990
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,640
I'm gonna refer to that.

991
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,180
I have my theory.

992
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,210
And I'll share it after the break.

993
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,405
Dallas, Texas has been our home

994
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,040
for the past couple of days.

995
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,300
And aside from being left on top of a very tall building,

996
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,040
I've had a pretty good time.

997
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,610
Hello, Dallas.

998
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,300
Since I've been here,

999
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,280
I even managed to find a new job.

1000
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,860
Mm.

1001
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,990
But I'm still keeping my old one.

1002
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,390
This is my favorite day ever at work.

1003
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,430
I'm not gonna see any contestants.

1004
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,300
I'm hanging today right here.

1005
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,930
But upstairs, I was missing out on a party.

1006
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,530
My name's Vanessa Johnston.

1007
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm 22 years old.

1008
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,410
I am the next American Idol.

1009
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,840
Yeah!

1010
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,210
Whoo!

1011
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,840
I am super optimistic.

1012
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,710
I just look at the positive things in everything.

1013
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,480
Come on!

1014
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,770
Hopefully that can go through the TV,

1015
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,540
and people will be like,

1016
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,850
"Wow, I need to be happy all the time like her."

1017
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,020
# sign and dance #

1018
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,020
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

1019
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,260
Hi, how are y'all?

1020
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,430
Welcome.

1021
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,830
Dallas, yes, whoo!

1022
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,530
Yay. Dallas!

1023
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
What's your favorite color?

1024
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,730
Pink!

1025
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,200
I didn't get that.

1026
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,670
I really love teal too.

1027
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,700
Okay, so what song?

1028
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,740
I'm singing "At Last" by Etta James.

1029
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,940
- Great song. - Okay.

1030
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,810
# at last #

1031
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
# my love #

1032
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,480
# has come along #

1033
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,520
# my lonely days #

1034
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,750
# are over #

1035
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,060
# and life is like a song #

1036
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,530
# at last #

1037
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,570
# my love has come along #

1038
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,440
# my lonely days are over #

1039
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,010
# life is like a song #

1040
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,340
- Oh. - Sorry.

1041
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,105
Vanessa, Honey,

1042
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,550
You're doing this Britney thing with your head.

1043
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,050
I like it cause you kept moving

1044
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,580
like the notes were over there.

1045
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,920
- Yeah. - Over here.

1046
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,620
Maybe it's back there. I don't know.

1047
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,785
Vanessa, if anyone ever asks me in my life

1048
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,880
what my nightmares look and sound like,

1049
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:46,900
I'm gonna refer to that.

1050
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm sorry.

1051
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,930
That's what keeps me up at night.

1052
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,600
All right, you know what,

1053
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,600
we should just vote on you,

1054
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,430
Vanessa, cause I think we know

1055
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,140
where this is going.

1056
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,870
- Should I sing another one? - What?

1057
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,770
No, Sweetie.

1058
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,110
One is definitely...

1059
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,910
Never.

1060
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,310
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

1061
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1062
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,410
- It's okay. - Here's the positive.

1063
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm definitely gonna remember you, but no.

1064
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,020
That's good. I'm excited.

1065
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,950
Great, here's some even better news.

1066
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,590
- It's four nos. - Yay.

1067
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,420
Nice to meet you.

1068
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,320
Nice... it's so nice to meet y'all, for real.

1069
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,060
You're funny.

1070
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,430
Wow.

1071
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,790
So it's a no.

1072
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,560
Simon said I was his worst nightmare.

1073
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,900
Why are you clapping?

1074
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,830
Vanessa might not be going to Hollywood...

1075
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,355
It's okay if you say I'm your worst nightmare,

1076
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,810
but at least you're dreaming about me, huh?

1077
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,610
A-ha!

1078
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,840
But she still finds a way to see the upside.

1079
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,250
That's the strangest thing

1080
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,400
that's ever happened to me.

1081
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,010
- Really? - Let's do it again.

1082
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,510
But thanks to Simon, what goes up...

1083
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,850
# I want to hold her tight #

1084
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,180
Must come down.

1085
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,620
Cody.

1086
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,720
Cody.

1087
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,950
I think the problem is you.

1088
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,190
Okay, hold on, let's stop the tape.

1089
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,720
We're in our ninth season, and,

1090
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,330
year after year, fans talk about

1091
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,840
how mean Simon can be.

1092
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,760
That was terrible.

1093
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,150
- You're horrible. - So are you.

1094
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,020
It was painful.

1095
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,830
I've heard some brilliant singers in my time.

1096
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,370
You are not one of them.

1097
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,315
But as my friend,

1098
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,190
I feel I need to take this moment

1099
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:03,470
to defend him to you.

1100
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,970
Okay, start the tape.

1101
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,300
You see, in a single audition tour,

1102
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,055
we will visit seven cities,

1103
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,010
each with a stadium full of Idol hopefuls.

1104
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,620
We listen to thousands of voices...

1105
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm sorry. I go so flat there.

1106
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,420
Hear many stories...

1107
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,650
Got a pretty nasty blood blister once.

1108
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,060
And watch America try to dance, beg...

1109
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,830
- I am ready. - No, you're not.

1110
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,490
Yes, I am.

1111
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,520
And talk their way to Hollywood.

1112
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,490
I hate watching movies with fish cause they're always like,

1113
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,150
"what just happened?"

1114
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,070
While we at American Idol spare you from

1115
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,920
having to listen to this...

1116
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,840
and see this...

1117
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,280
Not part of our performance.

1118
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,410
Simon has the job of sitting through it all.

1119
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,420
It's hard being Simon Cowell.

1120
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,420
But he does it all for you,

1121
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,610
America, because,

1122
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,480
every once in a while,

1123
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,320
we find someone special.

1124
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,595
And hoping she fits

1125
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,780
that bill is the last contestant of the Dallas auditions,

1126
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,100
16-year-old Christian Spears.

1127
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,100
I was diagnosed with leukemia on my 4th birthday.

1128
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,810
Being so young, you know,

1129
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,140
you don't really know what's going on

1130
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,860
and why your hair's falling out

1131
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,050
and why you're going into surgery.

1132
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:18,055
When they first told me

1133
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,025
that Christian was diagnosed with cancer,

1134
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,960
the first thing that went through my mind

1135
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,420
was that I was gonna lose her.

1136
00:38:23,455 --> 00:38:25,520
# I promise you #

1137
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,890
For them to say, you know,

1138
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,650
one more day and she wouldn't be here,

1139
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,560
It's just hard.

1140
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,900
# when your heart is filled #

1141
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,300
# with sorrow #

1142
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,635
And when I was eight,

1143
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,170
a blessing came through for me

1144
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,340
because I was in remission.

1145
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,770
So I'm an eight-year cancer survivor now.

1146
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,130
I always told her, you know,

1147
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,480
no matter what you want to do,

1148
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,120
I'll work for the rest of my life,

1149
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,970
I want you to be happy.

1150
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,500
So I tell her all the time,

1151
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,625
it's written for her,

1152
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,450
so she's supposed to be here.

1153
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,120
# you'll find my footprints #

1154
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,850
- Hi. - Hello.

1155
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,190
- How you guys doing? - Good.

1156
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,690
- How are you? - I'm great.

1157
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,920
So what are you gonna sing?

1158
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,620
I'm gonna be singing "All I Could do Is Cry" by Etta James.

1159
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,760
Great.

1160
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,730
# I heard #

1161
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,770
# church bells were ringing #

1162
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,500
# I heard #

1163
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,680
# a choir singing #

1164
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,950
# I saw my love #

1165
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,320
# walk down the aisle #

1166
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,190
# on her finger #

1167
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,120
# I heard them promise #

1168
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,230
# till death do us part #

1169
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,160
# each word #

1170
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,860
# was a pain #

1171
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,330
# in my heart #

1172
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,670
Thank you, sweetheart. Randy?

1173
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,230
Dude, I think you're really good.

1174
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,200
At 16, I'm so, so impressed.

1175
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,540
- I love it. - Thank you.

1176
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,570
- Joe? - You're definitely very confident.

1177
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,670
And a beautiful voice.

1178
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,680
You got a big, natural gift.

1179
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,565
And I think, when you were singing,

1180
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,355
I didn't sense any fear from you,

1181
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,320
and, you know, that is really rare in a 16-year-old.

1182
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,720
I think you're an incredibly brave person.

1183
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,920
And I like you a lot.

1184
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,990
I like you too.

1185
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,790
Randy, yes or no?

1186
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
A billion percent yes.

1187
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,590
- Joe? - Definitely yes.

1188
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,130
- Kara? - Absolutely.

1189
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,730
Christian, you got a full house.

1190
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,630
- Whoo! - Welcome to Hollywood, Christian.

1191
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,090
This golden ticket means that I'm really here,

1192
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,930
that I made it.

1193
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,200
Is there any better feeling?

1194
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,510
No. There's not.

1195
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,950
I have yet to find one.

1196
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,210
This is so amazing.

1197
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,990
We're going to Hollywood!

1198
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,490
A happy ending here in Dallas.

1199
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,930
And Christian is golden ticket number 17

1200
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,160
for the Day two auditions.

1201
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,160
We're going to Hollywood!

1202
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,360
Making it a grand total of 31 winners

1203
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
for the city of Dallas...

1204
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,600
A number that meets the judges' approval.

1205
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,070
It's a wrap.

1206
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,010
We made the trip back to the Lone Star State

1207
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,010
to find the magic we found so many times before.

1208
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,780
Well, whether Dallas can repeat its past or not

1209
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,510
will be determined in time.

1210
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,920
Goodbye, Dallas.

1211
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,030
Hello, Hollywood!

1212
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,560
So for now it's time to "mooove" on out to the next stop

1213
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,920
on the audition tour...

1214
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,090
Yee-haw!

1215
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,790
As our search for the next American Idol continues.

1216
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,380
Make sure y'all come back now, y'hear?

1217
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,730
Next Tuesday on Idol...

1218
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,330
We reach new heights in the Mile High City

1219
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,470
as season nine heads to Denver, Colorado.

1220
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,040
Denver rocks! Whoo!

1221
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,510
And get ready as the altitude brings out the tension.

1222
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,380
Please get that camera out of my face.

1223
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,800
The terrible...

1224
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,500
You just killed every cat in.

1225
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,570
And the unstoppable talent.

1226
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
# I'm the only one #

1227
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,770
Best voice today in Denver.

1228
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,020
And one Denver contestant takes it to the limit.

1229
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,450
You won't believe your eyes.
