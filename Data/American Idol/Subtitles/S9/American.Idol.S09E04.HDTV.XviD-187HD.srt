1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,070
August 28, 2009.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,640
Space Shuttle Challenger blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,850
And hoping to launch themselves into orbit are 10,000 Idol hopefuls.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,180
Will they shine like the stars they're reaching for?

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,450
American Idol, baby!

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,390
Whose dream will become a reality?

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,620
This is Orlando...

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,590
And this is American Idol.

9
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,000
Welcome to Orlando.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,730
They say it's the place where dreams come true.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,330
Cause you always have to have a dream.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,540
I'm gonna be a star.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,551
But for this massive 10,000 hopefuls,

14
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:16,170
their dreams lay in the hands of our four judges...

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,910
who were not there.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,460
While the crowd waited for their shot, Randy, Simon,

17
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,940
and I were approximately 235 miles away in Miami,

18
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,150
Taking a well-earned break, obviously.

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,595
After some R&R, we all needed some serious TLC

20
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:35,090
as we boarded a plane to Orlando.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,690
Oh, my god!

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,917
Here we go.

23
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:39,460
At least Kara...

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,100
Hi, guys.

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,100
And our guest judge Kristin Chenoweth...

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,500
Magic doors... They just open for you.

27
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,540
had arrived.

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,840
And the two seemed to really hit it off.

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,840
I'm already digging this girl.

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,840
Let's go rock it.

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,340
Come on, let's do it.

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:59,220
As the BFFS headed for a touchup, we arrived a touch under the weather.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,820
You don't look as tired as you thought... Don't worry.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,520
Hello.

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,520
He's not tired.

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,520
This is Orlando.

37
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,520
Not at all.

38
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,980
But ever the professionals, as the line filed in,

39
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:11,300
we took some questions from the local press.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
These guest judges... What do you think of these, uh...

41
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,000
Who have we got today?

42
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,000
He doesn't actually know who we have today.

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,200
That's true. She's actually a really big deal.

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,240
She's known as a darling of the American musical stage.

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,910
Now fresh off her stint on the Fox hit Glee...

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,050
Kristin Chenoweth's talents are are taking her from strength to strength.

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,390
This year, she put an Emmy on her mantle... right next to the Tony.

48
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,060
With such a busy schedule, we were lucky to steal her away for a day.

49
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,830
I'm very nervous and excited.

50
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,290
I'm not nervous for myself.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,030
I'm nervous for the kids.

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,600
But nerves were not an issue for Theo Clinton.

53
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,540
Have you ever thought about being a superhero?

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,570
Um... I'm super at whatever I do.

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,440
I am beautiful.

56
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,480
I am all that anyone could be.

57
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,840
# I feel pretty #

58
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,510
# oh, so pretty #

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,620
# I feel pretty and witty #

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
# and bright #

61
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,350
My gift is something that you get only on particular days.

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm just something that you can just get a piece of on Monday

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,430
and then on Tuesday where you put in a microwave and warm

64
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,700
it up... it's still good.

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,800
I am the next American Idol.

66
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,270
And if I'm not the next American Idol, I am gonna be in the bottom three.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,500
Theo, what's up, man?

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,510
Theo!

69
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,740
Whoa!

70
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,705
Oh, my.

71
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,080
Theo, what's going down, man?

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,080
Good evening.

73
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,080
Good evening. Yes.

74
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,680
It is daytime, the sun is out, but good evening.

75
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,925
Assuming, unlikely, that you won,

76
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,220
Where would you see yourself in ten years' time?

77
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,560
In ten years' time I can see myself running a corporate salon.

78
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,560
So you wanna... Hair dressing salons...

79
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,560
Yeah.

80
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,560
And a recording career.

81
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,200
I also want to be a musical artist.

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,960
So you can sort of bob in and out.

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,630
I wanna be a fashion designer... I wanna do it all.

84
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,530
Greedy.

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,770
What you gonna sing, man?

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,040
Pat Benatar, Heartbreaker.

87
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,110
Great.

88
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,670
Go for it.

89
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,670
# your love is like #

90
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,240
# a tidal wave #

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,880
# spinnin' over my head #

92
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,650
# drownin' me in your promises #

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,190
# better left unsaid #

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,290
# you're the right kinda #

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,290
# sinner #

96
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,390
# to release my inner fantasy #

97
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,500
# the invincible winner #

98
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,500
# you know that you were #

99
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,770
# born to be #

100
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,100
# you're a heartbreaker #

101
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,870
Whoo!

102
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,140
# a dream maker #

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,140
# love taker #

104
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,140
# don't you mess around #

105
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,770
# no no no #

106
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,710
Wow!

107
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,180
Wow, you got some power.

108
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,610
You feel good after that, huh?

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,350
Yeah.

110
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,250
Yeah, I could tell.

111
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,980
You released a lot of stuff.

112
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,390
Yeah, I was working hard for this, cause I know how Mr. Simon is...

113
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,360
Mr. Simon thinks you're gonna be on your way to your hairdressing salons, Theo,

114
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,290
- because it won't include singing. - Oh.

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,290
I mean, you screamed the song at us.

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,430
I can do Whitney Houston, I Believe In You And Me.

117
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,230
No.

118
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,270
Nothing else is going to help you, theo, and part from...

119
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,300
Luther Vandross, Dance With My Father.

120
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,270
When you walk in like that, I mentally said no.

121
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,240
# back when I was a child #

122
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,240
And cut.

123
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,240
It's not that you're even pitchy.

124
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,805
It's that the tone of your voice...

125
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,950
It's so over the top and just not good, sweetie.

126
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,950
Well, look at Jennifer Hudson... They had to work with her.

127
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,920
Honey, you're not Jennifer Hudson.

128
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,590
Randy, yes or no?

129
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,090
No, Theo, baby, it didn't work, man... I mean, it all doesn't work, man.

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
- Kristin? - Not for this, but... Not for this.

131
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,230
It's a no.

132
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,230
- But come here, let's say hello. - Okay.

133
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,230
I'm sorry, honey, really.

134
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,970
It's just... It was too over the top, babe, really.

135
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:37,200
You don't need to wear all this.

136
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm fine, I...

137
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah, Theo, you don't need these outfits, man.

138
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,210
- Come on, lose all that, man. - Good luck.

139
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,210
You're better than that, and you smell nice.

140
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,980
Oh, poor guy.

141
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,480
Turn left, turn left, turn left.

142
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,810
No, wrong way, sweetie.

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,810
Wrong way.

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,610
It's...

145
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,450
Honey, back here, through

146
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,950
the... You gotta go through the...

147
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,290
- No, wait. - That way.

148
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,320
- Oh... - No, that way.

149
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,560
Oh, God, I mean it's so... No, no.

150
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,560
- Are you his... - Friend.

151
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,560
We're all friends.

152
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,430
You're buddies.

153
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,530
Um... you could say we're like best friends, cause I'm his assistant.

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Theo.

155
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,970
I didn't make it.

156
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,970
Now, Theo...

157
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,540
Well, come here, Theo.

158
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,440
Theo.

159
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,440
That was so fun.

160
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,440
That was really fun.

161
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,610
Okay...

162
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,410
I still have life, health,

163
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,410
and strength, so I'm not that down.

164
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,510
I still have my birthday's tomorrow.

165
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,450
I'm gonna celebrate my birthday.

166
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,450
Happy birthday... What do you want for your birthday?

167
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,620
Thank you.

168
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,620
I wanted to go to Hollywood, but I guess I'm not gonna make it this year.

169
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,620
You should get down that one or you wanna keep that one on.

170
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,620
I guess I'm not gonna make it this year.

171
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,630
Well, nice to meet you.

172
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,090
Thank you, Mr. Ryan Seacrest.

173
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,090
It was nice to meet you.

174
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,960
Sorry it didn't work out.

175
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,970
I gotta go wash the glitter off my hands.

176
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,230
We'll be right back.

177
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,810
Coming up... Their stories will inspire you.

178
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,810
My son is diagnosed with autism.

179
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,265
My whole life growing up as a kid,

180
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,510
I wasn't able to use that side of my face.

181
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,810
I spent four birthdays behind bars.

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,790
Their voices will amaze you as Orlando delivers some outstanding talent.

183
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,790
Best I've heard this whole audition season.

184
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,590
But not everyone is headed to Hollywood.

185
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,590
You sang as if you sat on a cat.

186
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,090
And they are not pleased.

187
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,445
No, you see me fighting for this show,

188
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,830
and then you're gonna kick me out like that?

189
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,310
Welcome to the sunshine state!

190
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,150
The Orlando auditions were in full swing as 10,000 hopefuls take their shots in front of the judges.

191
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,005
Barring a liberal smattering of pixie dust,

192
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,950
the morning has proven to be far from the fairytale.

193
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,220
It was a no.

194
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,190
Unfortunately not, guys.

195
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,190
Didn't make it.

196
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Aw!

197
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,860
The contestants are starting to grate on Simon Cowell.

198
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,630
Kara and Kristin, on the other hand, are having a ball.

199
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,540
The ladies had made a pact at the top of the day.

200
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,810
I need all the girl power we can have here on this thing.

201
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,610
And all that power wasn't helping the mood of a road weary Simon Cowell.

202
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,380
# blame it on the girls #

203
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,180
# blame it on the boys #

204
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,420
# blame it on the girls #

205
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,420
I'm so happy to be sitting by

206
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,420
Her.

207
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,260
This is so fun.

208
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Whatever they did, they did it together.

209
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,160
Cool!

210
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,290
They had fun together.

211
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,100
I think you're so cute.

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,100
Are we crushed out on him?

213
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,770
He's 21!

214
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,800
They endured the horror together.

215
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,340
# we are #

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,340
# the champions #

217
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,570
Oh, my God, okay, okay, stop, stop.

218
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,210
But most of all, they annoyed the out of Simon Cowell.

219
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,550
Can you hit a note like that?

221
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,550
Yes!

222
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,120
Yes! Yes!

223
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,650
I think we're too loud for Simon.

224
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,620
No!

225
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,890
Simon, are we bugging you?

226
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,030
No, I just have a little headache today.

227
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,500
But it was the contestants who felt the pain as Orlando hit a rough spot.

228
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,300
You walked in with the lights off.

229
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,330
Nope.

230
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,370
I was actually beginning to fall asleep.

231
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,400
Aw!

232
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,740
You walked in like a cocktail stick.

233
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,910
And then sang as if you sat on a cat.

234
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,380
I mean, that was the audition.

235
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,450
# blame it on the boys #

236
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,920
The lack of golden tickets only added to the pressure on

237
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,860
the contestants in the holding room, and for Seth Rollins,

238
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,860
there was already a lot on the line.

239
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,530
I'm married, I have two kids... A son who is almost five.

240
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,560
His name is Samuel.

241
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,560
And a daughter who's nine months old.

242
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,570
Her name is Faith.

243
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,400
My son is diagnosed with autism.

244
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,400
He's a great kid.

245
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,400
He's awesome.

246
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,410
But there are, you know,

247
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,475
difficulties that come with that diagnosis

248
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,940
and just everyday life and things that you don't even notice.

249
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,910
How about that one?

250
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,120
Yay!

251
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,250
For families that have autism it's really tough.

252
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,960
A lot of the marriages end in divorce.

253
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,990
As a man, you know, I wanted to feel like I could fix things.

254
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,100
Um...

255
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,500
but you can't fix things.

256
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,100
There are things that we would like to do for our son...

257
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,060
it's hard to afford right now.

258
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,575
Um, but we'll certainly, you know... that would be such a blessing,

259
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,100
to be able to afford everything and get the best care for him that we need.

260
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,970
Ready?

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,930
Okay.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,040
Go!

263
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,070
To be able to do music full-time is just a dream.

264
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,040
And I'm just so excited to have this opportunity.

265
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,480
I love you.

266
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,250
- This is so cool. - Can we go get presents?

267
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,150
Yeah, we're gonna get presents.

268
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,550
Like a golden ticket.

269
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,080
Can I have a present?

270
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,120
Stay out here.

271
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,120
You stay out here.

272
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,160
No! I wanna go with you.

273
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,190
Wait...

274
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,090
- Is this mom? - I wanna go with you!

275
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,090
You know mom?

276
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,290
No! I wanna go

277
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,290
with daddy!

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,530
Oh, baby, it's okay.

279
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,960
So how old are you?

281
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,970
I'm 28.

282
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,000
So this is your last chance.

283
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,370
My last chance.

284
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,900
Um... Is singing your dream?

285
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,770
Uh, my family is first and foremost, but I love to sing.

286
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,240
I would love to have a career in music, and I am just so excited to be here.

287
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,180
What you singing, man?

288
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,510
Gonna sing Someone To Watch Over Me, Frank Sinatra.

289
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,310
Wow, okay.

290
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,680
# there's a somebody #

291
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,690
# I'm longing to see #

292
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,560
# I hope that she #

293
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,990
# turns out to be #

294
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,900
# someone #

295
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,470
# who'll watch #

296
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,400
# over me #

297
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,170
# yes #

298
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,110
# like a little lamb #

299
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,210
# who's lost in a wood #

300
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,410
# I know I could #

301
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,820
# always be good #

302
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,120
# to one who'll #

303
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,990
# watch #

304
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,030
# over me #

305
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,700
# oh #

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Thank you very much, Seth.

307
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,160
What do you think, Kristin?

308
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,470
Well, I like the fact that you took a Gershwin song from

309
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,500
many, many years ago and made it your own.

310
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,900
I like your voice.

311
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,140
I like everything about you.

312
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,880
I wanna keep hearing you,

313
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,710
And that's really the best compliment I can pay somebody.

314
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,610
Thank you.

315
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,450
Simon?

316
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,720
Good. Yeah, I like the fact you know who you are, Seth.

317
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,250
Good choice of song.

318
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,550
You got a good voice.

319
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,590
- Just need to exert a little bit more... - Okay.

320
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,190
- Exude some more... - Animation.

321
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,160
- Okay. - Vibe, you know, a little bit more energy, a little bit more performance.

322
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,230
Let's take a vote.

323
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,230
Yes.

324
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Yes. Kara?

325
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,400
Million percent yes.

326
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,300
Simon?

327
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,270
That's an easy yes, Seth.

328
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,600
I say yes too. Four yeses.

329
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,640
Welcome to Hollywood!

330
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:41,720
- Yeah, baby. - Yay!

331
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,590
He is great. I loved him.

332
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Beautiful voice too.

333
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,590
Nice tone.

334
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,300
Amazing.

335
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,170
To have four yeses, I think should, you know... for him,

336
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,210
- give him the confidence that he really has something special. - Dad's going to Hollywood!

337
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,210
Yay!

338
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,010
# and I will try #

339
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,610
# to fix you #

340
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,950
What color are daddy's shoes?

341
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,220
White.

342
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,190
What color is Samuel's hair?

343
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,550
When we come back...

344
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,760
The dream turns into a nightmare.

345
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,960
# rollin' on the river #

346
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,960
Oh!

347
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,960
My pants done ripped.

348
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,990
What?

349
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,800
Kara gives a serious wake-up call...

350
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,800
You think you're a great singer?

351
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,370
As our most dramatic episode unfolds.

352
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,300
You see me fighting for this show, then you're gonna kick me out like that?

353
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,740
As we know, millions of people flock to Orlando to reach for the stars.

354
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,470
Our contestants were aiming just

355
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,610
as high as the auditions continued.

356
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
# when you wish #

357
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,510
# upon a star #

358
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,050
American Idol would change everything.

359
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,820
# makes no difference #

360
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,160
# who you are #

361
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,460
What?

362
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,760
# anything #

363
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,300
# your heart desires #

364
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,100
You're great.

365
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,100
Thank you!

366
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,360
You're great.

367
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,690
Please.

368
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,960
- One song, please? - Jordan...

369
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,960
- It's not gonna help. - I'll prove it to you right now... One song.

370
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,890
Jordan, Jordan, it's a no.

371
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,900
I'll be back next thing... You'll see me.

372
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,860
I bet you you'll see me.

373
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,870
I don't think you're quite ready yet.

374
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,070
Oh, come on, please.

375
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,540
# too extreme #

376
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,010
# when you wish #

377
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,340
Thank you, ryan.

378
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,910
# upon a star #

379
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,050
# your dreams #

380
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,720
# come #

381
00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:03,530
# true #

382
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,240
Maybe some magic would come to Germaine Purefoy

383
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:09,030
who's back for a second chance.

384
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,570
I auditioned for American Idol back in season seven.

385
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,100
It was kind of a road trip.

386
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,100
Bunch of guys got together in college.

387
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,110
I didn't make it.

388
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,110
I wasn't surprised.

389
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,540
I kinda deserved it.

390
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,940
And my feeling was it just wasn't meant for me at the time.

391
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,250
So I was thinking that I need to give this another shot.

392
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,250
But it all comes down to this day, and I think that today

393
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,080
potentially my life could change.

394
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,550
Yo, yeah, come on in, man.

395
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,390
I have no force of coming in.

396
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,390
- Don't be scared. - Is it my turn?

397
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,390
- I'm scared. - What are you gonna sing?

398
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,360
Uh, Tony Bennett.

399
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,430
Oh, great! Okay.

400
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,530
# you light up your face #

401
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,230
# with gladness #

402
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,130
# hide every trace of sadness #

403
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,170
# although a tear #

404
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,070
# may be ever so near #

405
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,040
# that's the time #

406
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,010
# you must keep on tryin' #

407
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,010
# smile #

408
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,380
# what's the use of cryin' #

409
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,590
# you'll find that life #

410
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,120
# is still worthwhile #

411
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,590
# if you just smile #

412
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,930
Thank you very much, indeed.

413
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,060
Aw...

414
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,600
Uh, you know, what I really like is how pure of a sound you have.

415
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,600
It's so seamless.

416
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,200
I never worry once when he goes up for anything high.

417
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,670
There's no strain.

418
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,910
I mean, I love you.

419
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,040
I think for me...

420
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,040
the best I've heard this whole audition season,

421
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,110
it's my favorite... dude, I was blown away.

422
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,120
I was really impressed.

423
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,120
Thank yo so much.

424
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,120
You know, and the other thing is, of course you have a great

425
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,220
voice, but you're like... it's honest.

426
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,810
I believe it, and I'm listening to every word,

427
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,590
and I'm hanging on every word.

428
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,790
'Cause I really believe that you mean it.

429
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,800
And you got a nice smile.

430
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, you do.

431
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,100
I thought that was a good choice of song for you.

432
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,200
I think the chicks will like you.

433
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,970
Uh, let's take a vote.

434
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,900
Simon, yes?

435
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,910
- Yes. - So yes.

436
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,910
Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,910
Two bazillion percent yes.

438
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,210
Welcome to Hollywood!

439
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,380
Thank you. Thank you very much.

440
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,780
Germaine, you got something to smile about.

441
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,650
I'm not typically a risk-taker.

442
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,650
I play it safe all the time.

443
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,590
So the fact that, you know, I'm holding this in my hand right

444
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,895
now just lets me know I think that

445
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,630
I should start maybe taking a few more risks, you know.

446
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
It works. It works.

447
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,230
It's 7:00 in the evening,

448
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,100
and our holding room is now an empty shell... leaving just one

449
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,470
contestant alone with her thoughts.

450
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,470
You're the last of the day.

451
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,470
Oh, I am.

452
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,480
You are the last of the day.

453
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,810
Dead last.

454
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,810
My name is Shelby Jessel.

455
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,520
I'm 18 years old from Avon Park, Florida, and I'm a waitress.

456
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,050
When I was born, my seventh cranial nerve was undeveloped.

457
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,860
So my whole life growing up as a kid, I wasn't able to, you know,

458
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,960
smile correctly or use that side of my face, which is the right side.

459
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,130
You've always liked performing in front of people?

460
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,560
A little uncomfortable.

461
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,570
But it looks like you function fine.

462
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,570
Really? Well, thank you.

463
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,570
So... but that's been something that has been an insecurity, I guess.

464
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,570
Yeah, definitely.

465
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,670
It's been hard.

466
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,610
When it comes to chasing your dreams and going after what you

467
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,280
wanna do, you just kind of have to set that to the side and do it.

468
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,475
I'm so nervous, but I'm trying to like calm down,

469
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,980
and I just can't find a good way to calm down, and I don't know.

470
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,130
This whole thing is kind of intimidating to me,

471
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,320
and I'm just kinda like...

472
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,220
- take it easy, you know. - Yo.

473
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,430
I'm your last one.

474
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,160
Hi, Shelby.

475
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,390
Hey.

476
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,360
Why are you here, Darling?

477
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,360
I just graduated high school,

478
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,370
and I really just wanted to do something out there.

479
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,630
And I love singing.

480
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,170
Everyone's persuaded me to do it, and so... here I am.

481
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,270
Okay, and what are you gonna sing?

482
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,410
Turn Me On by Norah Jones.

483
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,180
All right, good luck, Shelby.

484
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,180
Okay.

485
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,580
# like a flower #

486
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,890
# waiting to bloom #

487
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,560
# like a light bulb #

488
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,290
# in a darkened room #

489
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,490
# I'm just sittin' here #

490
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,130
# waitin' for you #

491
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,700
# to come on home #

492
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,130
# and turn me on #

493
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,040
# my poor heart is #

494
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,740
# gettin' so dark #

495
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,550
# since you been gone #

496
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,780
# but... #

497
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,550
Oh, my god. Holy.

498
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,890
I am so sorry.

499
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh, my god.

500
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,535
I love that. That was awesome.

501
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,520
That was the best part of your audition.

502
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,077
That was great!

503
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:31,565
I'm so sorry.

504
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,310
You know what, Shelby, we can judge you on up to that.

505
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:35,620
I like you.

506
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,350
But I wasn't blown away with your voice, no.

507
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,705
I actually kind of liked your voice.

508
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,315
- I thought the voice so cool. - Really?

509
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,180
And I actually liked that you were kind of afraid of us.

510
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,140
We looked like we were kind of afraid of you.

511
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:46,775
Really?

512
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,370
And then you broke open the ice, and we were like, yo!

513
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,640
That's our girl right there!

514
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,650
Now we're friends.

515
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:52,282
Yeah.

516
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:52,880
I guess.

517
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,235
I think you have a good potential.

518
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,340
And you're 18, and you have a lot more growth to do.

519
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,340
But I think you have something there inside.

520
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,307
Oh...

521
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:03,205
Simon?

522
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,510
With a small "y", yes.

523
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,660
I'm gonna say yes.

524
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:10,010
I'm gonna say yes.

525
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,415
Randy?

526
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,420
I'm gonna say with three big letters, yes.

527
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:15,385
Oh!

528
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,090
Welcome to Hollywood! Yeah!

529
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,090
Shelby joins 18 others to make it to Hollywood from day one.

530
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,930
You got four yeses,

531
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:29,600
Sweetheart.

532
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:30,235
Whoo!

533
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,070
I'm going to hollywood!

534
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,870

00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,857

542
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,300
More auditions from Orlando,

543
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:02,135
tomorrow, day two.

544
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,600
Congratulations, darling.

545
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:04,835
Yay!

546
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,140
Coming up... Orlando's talent keeps getting better.

547
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:09,035
Brilliant.

548
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,340
You can really, really sing.

549
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,575
Are you serious?

550
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,180
A unique performance puts the panel...

551
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,275
No.

552
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,245
Come on, Randy.

553
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,180
And Cornelius...

554
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:19,867
Ow!

555
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:20,485
Ow!

556
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,345
Splits his pants.

557
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,320
I would do more moves, but...

558
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:24,385
No, no, no, I don't want

559
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,960
you to move at all right now.

560
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:27,207
Stay right there.

561
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,420
No more moving.

562
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,000
Welcome back to Orlando.

563
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,995
It's day two of auditions...

564
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,565
This is where dreams can come true.

565
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,500
And everyone was hoping for more magic like yesterday.

566
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:46,222
Kristin had been called back

567
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:47,875
to New York, so today there

568
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,095
would be no guest judge on the panel.

569
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,245
It gives us more quality time to bond.

570
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,520
seriously Randy? And that was Kara plan with the contestants.

571
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,045
Just go for it.

572
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,385
If you have fun, we have fun.

573
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,355
And that's basically the way it is.

574
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,720
And that was advice Jay Stone certainly took to heart.

575
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,195
How's it going?

576
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,160
Yo, come on in, man.

577
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,227
Yeah, you ready?

578
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,096
I've been ready.

579
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:09,895
I am so ready.

580
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,015
So you know what it is.

581
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,910
You watch the show.

582
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:12,772
You ready for this?

583
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:13,600
This is the dream.

584
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:14,235
Absolutely.

585
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,095
What you singing, dog?

586
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,700
Come together by the Beatles.

587
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,000
Do it.

588
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,915
# here come old flattop #

589
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,720
# he come groovin' up slowly #

590
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,542
# he got joo-joo eyeball #

591
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:41,330
# he one holy roller #

592
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:43,025
# he got hair #

593
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,430
# down to his knee #

594
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,135
What?

595
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,405
# one thing I can tell you #

596
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,640
# is you got to be free #

597
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:54,107
# come together #

598
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,991
# right now #

599
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,840
# over me #

600
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,815
Oh, god.

601
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,485
All right, nice.

602
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,790
That was like a crazy roller coaster ride.

603
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:10,622
Nice, nice.

604
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,385
You know what?

605
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,525
That was pretty amazing, though.

606
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,630
You know, Jay, I'm actually soaking wet after listening to that.

607
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:18,125
That makes two of us, man.

608
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,930
Seriously, I feel like I've taken a shower.

609
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,465
Oh, my god.

610
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,535
I'm gonna say yes.

611
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,570
That was hilarious.

612
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,305
Hm?

613
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,305
That was amazing.

614
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,270
Do you actually sing?

615
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:29,105
I do, yeah.

616
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,245
# ain't no sunshine #

617
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,315
# when she's gone #

618
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,580
Anywhere, he could be booked.

619
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:35,747
# dee dee dee dee #

620
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,766
# it's not warm #

621
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:39,750
# when she's away #

622
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,640
# ain't no sunshine #

623
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,290
# when she's gone #

624
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,390
# and she's always gone #

625
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,525
# too long #

626
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,700
# anytime she goes away #

627
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,585
# wonder this time #

628
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,270
# where she's gone #

629
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Okay.

630
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,740
Okay, so it's a no.

631
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,792
Boo. No!

632
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:05,775
Yes.

633
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,795
- Yeah, no, - come on.

634
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,740
What are we doing here?

635
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:08,650
Oh, come on, he's a...

636
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:09,285
You know what?

637
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,120
He's a good singer.

638
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:10,920
Skibbety skibbety bop.

639
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:11,545
Come on, yes.

640
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,250
Skibbety skibbety boom.

641
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:12,885
Yes.

642
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,355
All right, well, let's take a vote.

643
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,790
Let's just see how much more you've got.

644
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:17,377
- Sim, yes or no? - No.

645
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,930
- Kara. - I say yes.

646
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:19,555
Why?

647
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,555
I don't know.

648
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,200
I think he was a good beatboxer.

649
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:23,475
He's got a good voice

650
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,630
when he stopped acting like a human drum machine.

651
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,595
Come on, Randy.

652
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,540
You know you want to see that in hollywood week.

653
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:31,265
I do?

654
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,070
I'm bringing something new and different that this

655
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,775
competition has never seen before.

656
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,540
There was a guy a couple years ago who was a neat beatboxer.

657
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:38,227
Blake Lewis.

658
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:38,845
Blake Lewis.

659
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,345
He wasn't doing what I'm doing.

660
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,180
He wasn't singing and beatboxing simultaneously.

661
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,420
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

662
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:45,450
Yes.

663
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,155
Randy.

664
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,385
Come on, Randy.

665
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,890
I think Simon was like a

666
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,375
And Kara was like a...

667
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,260
And now Randy's like a...

668
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,295
Uhh!

669
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,445
Yes, yes.

670
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,560
Drum roll.

671
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,735
I love this.

672
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,795
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

673
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,140
Okay, okay, okay, okay, yeah.

674
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:06,610
Randy apparently is a...

675
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:07,305
Whoo!

676
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,975
# Stand up #

677
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,280
# and break it down #

678
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:09,945
# Come on #

679
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,310
# bring that beatbox back #

680
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,745
# so do you feel it? #

681
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,720
Even though she was outnumbered, Kara stuck to her guns

682
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:20,255
and Jay Stone was off to Hollywood.

683
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,460
There was just time for a quick celebration in the holding room,

684
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:24,662
And the party was on.

685
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:25,963
# Yeah, you know #

686
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:27,195
# that you want it #

687
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,695
# 'cause you can't deny it #

688
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,370
The girls of Orlando were more than happy to get their dance on.

689
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:37,787
But could they sing?

690
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:40,666
# There is a house #

691
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:43,070
# in New Orleans #

692
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:46,412
# that they call #

693
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,848
# the rising sun #

694
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:51,215
# take me on a trip #

695
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,485
# I'd like to go someday #

696
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,970
# Take me to New York #

697
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,347
# I'd love to see L.A. #

698
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:00,506
# they say we're lovers #

699
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,635
# kept under covers #

700
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,700
# I just ignore it #

701
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:06,730
# but they keep saying #

702
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,695
# we laugh #

703
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,870
# just a little too loud #

704
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,835
Okay.

705
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,410
You're cute, and I like that little rasp in your voice.

706
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:15,780
Yeah, I like that too.

707
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:16,575
Good.

708
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,305
Thank you.

709
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,110
There's something infectious about you, you know what I'm saying?

710
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,880
You've got all this bubbly vibe and all of that.

711
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,080
- You're going to Hollywood. - Are you serious?

712
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:26,020
Welcome to Hollywood,

713
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:27,320
Brittany Starr!

714
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,625
It's okay.

715
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,425
I'm proud of you.

716
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,225
So they had the voices and the moves.

717
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,900
But if you want to talk flexibility, talk to Cornelius Edwards.

718
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,535
So where did you learn to dance?

719
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,140
Well, I have friends that are adult entertainers and things of that nature.

720
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:44,765
No.

721
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,235
What kind of entertainment?

722
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,740
Well, they dance, like, uh,

723
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,092
for money, I would say.

724
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:50,218
Like, they're entertainers.

725
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:51,275
Are you saying, Cornelius,

726
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,575
They shed their clothes for money?

727
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,680
Well, if that's what you want to call it, yeah.

728
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:56,415
They dance for money.

729
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,900
What dance did they teach you?

730
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,315
Oh, okay, we've got it, we've

731
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,990
Got it, we've got it, we've got it.

732
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:02,257
What are you singing, man?

733
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,490
Rolling by Tina Turner.

734
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,527
Okay.

735
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:05,495
Do it.

736
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,865
# Big wheel keep on turnin' #

737
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,200
# proud Mary keep on burnin' #

738
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:11,730
# and we're rollin' #

739
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:12,665
# rollin' #

740
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,200
# rollin' on the river #

741
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:14,887
Ow!

742
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:15,561
Ow!

743
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:16,165
Ow!

744
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,050
# doo doo doo doo #

745
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:17,865
# doo doo doo #

746
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,070
My pants done ripped.

747
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,057
What?

748
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:20,975
Ow!

749
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,245
Your pants split?

750
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,445
I felt that. God!

751
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,005
Oh, oh, I can't look at that.

752
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,650
My problem is I need to go to Hollywood.

753
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,245
I'll tell you what.

754
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm gonna have to say yes after that.

755
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:31,615
Thank you.

756
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,315
I mean, seriously.

757
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,985
That's the best thing I've ever seen.

758
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,560
I'd be more worried about the trousers when you go.

759
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:38,802
I mean that is sacrifice.

760
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:41,010
I would do more moves, but...

761
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:42,427
No, no, no, no, no, no.

762
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:43,775
Yeah, no more splitting.

763
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,320
No, I don't want you to move at all right now.

764
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:47,620
Yeah, yeah, stay right there.

765
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:48,280
No more moving.

766
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:49,290
I can't...

767
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:49,987
Yes?

768
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:50,671
I can't.

769
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:51,448
Yes for me.

770
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:52,190
Yes or no?

771
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:53,325
Yes.

772
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,025
Three yeses.

773
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,995
Welcome to Hollywood.

774
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,095
Get some new pants.

775
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,160
Go get some new pants.

776
00:27:57,195 --> 00:27:57,825
No, no, no.

777
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,610
Just get some new pants and leave.

778
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,360
Get a towel so you can wear it out.

779
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,647
What happened, buddy?

780
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,991
I'm going to Hollywood.

781
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,300
You're going to Hollywood!

782
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,270
Whoo!

783
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,805
Congratulations.

784
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,175
Come on, that was hilarious.

785
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,510
I've never seen that before.

786
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:17,427
The pants splitter.

787
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,275
That was hilarious.

788
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,185
Go on and get my jacket, please.

789
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,390
Megan, Megan, he's not gonna show his split.

790
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:23,355
His pants have ripped.

791
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,075
We're gonna go to a commercial break and

792
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,760
let the kids continue to watch this program.

793
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:28,625
Disgusting, these producers.

794
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,930
Coming up, some of the best talent yet.

795
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,630
Welcome to Hollywood!

796
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:33,495
Yes!

797
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,800
Will these two sisters be torn apart by Hollywood?

798
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,587
Sister in blue, yes.

799
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:40,305
Sister in yellow, no.

800
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,170
And the audition that ends in disaster.

801
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,940
You can't sing, Dude.

802
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,340
Are you serious?

803
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,795
How are you?

804
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,775
Hi, Handsome.

805
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,320
Welcome back to Orlando.

806
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:01,102
How do you do?

807
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:01,828
I do fine.

808
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:02,485
How do you do?

809
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,490
I'm good. I'm excited.

810
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:04,115
Yeah?

811
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,820
I'm so excited.

812
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:05,455
I'm excited.

813
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm Bernadette Disimone.

814
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,085
I'm 27.

815
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,230
I'm Amanda Disimone.

816
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,225
I'm 23.

817
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,865
And we're sisters from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

818
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,830
We live in the same house with our mom, and in the house,

819
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:18,065
there's a salon.

820
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,365
We're down here a lot.

821
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,070
We make people look beautiful and we have a lot of fun here too.

822
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,170
A little bit.

823
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:25,075
No!

824
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,975
Come on.

825
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,805
It'll grow.

826
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,610
From when we wake up in the morning, it's a performanc that's going on.

827
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,210
There's always a performance.

828
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:33,045
# we're sisters #

829
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,075
# and we live together #

830
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,150
# won't this be a cute picture #

831
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:38,315
Love you, sis.

832
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,790
She has the talent to go all the way.

833
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:42,790
That's nice.

834
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:43,757
Thanks.

835
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:44,655
She stinks.

836
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,355
No, I'm just kidding.

837
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,560
Now say something good about me.

838
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:49,142
Ah!

839
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:50,655
Hi.

840
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,230
They come in twos.

841
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:53,197
Yes, we do.

842
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,095
Sisters.

843
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,865
Who's the best singer?

844
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,600
We're equally great.

845
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,735
Who's gonna go first?

846
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,370
Um, if you don't mind, sis, I'm oldest.

847
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,340
I'm supposed to stand to the side.

848
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,442
Wherever you'd like.

849
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:06,510
It's your show, honey.

850
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:08,450
Get it, girl.

851
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,275
# oh #

852
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,815
# oh, baby, oh, baby #

853
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,215
# don't you leave me this way #

854
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,580
# you're the meanest old thing #

855
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,652
# that I ever did see #

856
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:17,438
# I guess if you say so #

857
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:19,190
# I gotta pack my things #

858
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:19,955
# and go #

859
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,625
# that's right #

860
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,060
# and hit the road, jack #

861
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:23,460
# and don't you come back #

862
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:24,877
# no more, no more #

863
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:26,371
# no more, no more #

864
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:27,795
# hit the road, jack #

865
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,430
# and don't you come back #

866
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:30,295
# no more #

867
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,805
Okay, thank you.

868
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,700
Sis number two, please.

869
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:34,522
Little sis.

870
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:35,275
All right.

871
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,505
# I need a man #

872
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,240
# who'll take the chance #

873
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:40,012
# on a love that burns #

874
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,715
# hot enough to last #

875
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,465
# and when the night falls #

876
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,795
# my lonely heart calls #

877
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,090
# oh, I want to dance #

878
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,785
# with somebody #

879
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,290
# I wanna feel the heat #

880
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:54,255
# with somebody #

881
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,060
# yeah, I wanna dance #

882
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,290
# with somebody #

883
00:30:57,325 --> 00:30:57,977
# yeah #

884
00:30:58,012 --> 00:30:58,595
Hmm.

885
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,300
# with somebody #

886
00:30:59,335 --> 00:30:59,925
Hmm.

887
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,730
# who loves me #

888
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:02,565
Hmm.

889
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,335
I love her.

890
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,065
Yeah, you guys love each other, huh?

891
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Yeah, you... you're kind of judging each other.

892
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:08,272
Are you from Jersey?

893
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:09,223
How did you guess?

894
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,105
Was it the hair?

895
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,475
Oh, yeah. I don't know.

896
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,080
Something about something that told me you were from Jersey.

897
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:15,015
"Joisey."

898
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,180
They're from Jersey.

899
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:16,815
"Joisey," yeah.

900
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,475
Randy, what do you think?

901
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,400
Uh, I actually think you picked the better song.

902
00:31:20,435 --> 00:31:23,290
Hit The Road Jack was a little easier to sing.

903
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:24,490
You picked a really tough one.

904
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:25,625
I don't know.

905
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,430
- Interesting. - I kind of like something about them.

906
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:29,495
They look a little like they...

907
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,660
they could really bring something to Hollywood week.

908
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:32,295
Thanks, Kara.

909
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,730
I think we can, for sure.

910
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:34,365
We're it.

911
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,335
We're ready to work.

912
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,620
We're ready to work.

913
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:37,870
- We want it. - Work.

914
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:38,505
Simon?
Simon?

915
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,540
I mean, your crazy nodding when you were listening to your

916
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:45,080
sister, like Whitney's been reborn, or like...

917
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:46,197
Yes, yes.

918
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:47,245
She hasn't.

919
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,050
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

920
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:50,345
Uh...

921
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,980
Please, Randy.

922
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:55,080
Yeah.

923
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,760
Hollywood needs us, right?

924
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:01,960
The show needs us.

925
00:32:01,995 --> 00:32:03,325
Kara knows.

926
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,660
She's like, "yeah." Oh!

927
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,230
We can't go back out there and look my mom in the face.

928
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,900
Uh, I'm gonna say yes to the sisters.

929
00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:13,665
I'll give it... shh!

930
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,610
I'll give the sisters one more shot.

931
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,775
Kara?

932
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,540
How do you break these two up?

933
00:32:19,575 --> 00:32:20,292
Oh!

934
00:32:20,327 --> 00:32:20,975
I know.

935
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,330
I'm gonna say yes.

936
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:23,692
I'm gonna say yes.

937
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:25,403
Uh, I would have said,

938
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:26,844
"Sister in blue, yes.

939
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,215
Sister in yellow, no."

940
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,250
But you're both going through to Hollywood.

941
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,090
Welcome to Hollywood!

942
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,355
# One and two! #

943
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,960
We're going to Hollywood!

944
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,395
We're going to Hollywood!

945
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,435
Just around the corner from the sisters,

946
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,470
Jarrod Norell is warming up for his big moment.

947
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:49,535
Hey, hey, hey!

948
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,280
Want to see those judges, gotta have the energy.

949
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:53,862
Gotta have the enthusiasm.

950
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:55,375
Gotta have the passion.

951
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,950
Gotta show it from front to back.

952
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,615
Get that breath going.

953
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,820
Make sure that that's there.

954
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:00,845
Zzzzzzzz.

955
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,135
Gets your buzz on.

956
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,330
Rrrrr-rrrr-rroom!

957
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:04,490
Get your car started.

958
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,377
And not give in.

959
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:08,230
Not give in.

960
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:09,295
Hello.

961
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,490
How are y'all doing?

962
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:11,330
Hi, Jarrod.

963
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,395
Hi.

964
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,600
So you're a great singer.

965
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,670
I... I believe so.

966
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:16,195
Yeah?

967
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,970
One of the best?

968
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:17,872
Could be.

969
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:18,705
Really?

970
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,400
And you think you could win?

971
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:20,787
I really do.

972
00:33:20,822 --> 00:33:22,105
All right.

973
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,475
What are you gonna sing?

974
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,410
Amazing Grace.
Amazing Grace

975
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:25,540
Gotta give it up to God.

976
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:27,175
All right.

977
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,945
# amazing grace #

978
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,435
# how sweet the sound #

979
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,890
# that saved a wretch #

980
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:48,395
# like me #

981
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:54,020
# I once was lost #

982
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:59,610
# but now I'm found #

983
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:03,412
# was blind #

984
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:07,180
# but now I see #

985
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:09,267
Thank you.

986
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:11,831
Oh, Good Lord.

987
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,325
What was that?

988
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,490
Do you really think you're a good singer?

989
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:17,125
Seriously?

990
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,095
I'm not trying to be rude.

991
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,970
Do you think you're a great singer?

992
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,135
Are you serious?

993
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,300
Honey, it sounded like a lawnmower.

994
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:26,535
I mean, it's just not...

995
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,840
Are you... are you seriously in agreement, man?

996
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,575
I'm sorry, honey.

997
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,040
Just... I don't... music is not... is not where you're headed.

998
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:34,610
All right, thanks a lot, Jarrod.

999
00:34:34,645 --> 00:34:35,315
Yeah.

1000
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,520
Guys, can I please have two seconds more, Man?

1001
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:38,515
I'm just right here.

1002
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,950
I'm tripping. I'm tripping right now.

1003
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:40,585
Are you feeling me?

1004
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm tripping. I'm losing it.

1005
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:43,767
I'm just trying my best.

1006
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,146
Can I sing one more song?

1007
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:46,585
Oh, Dog, Dog, the vocals.

1008
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,990
Man, you can't sing, Dude.

1009
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:52,260
# amazing grace #

1010
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:53,297
No, no, no.

1011
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:54,281
# how sweet #

1012
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:55,323
No, no, no.

1013
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,330
# the sound #

1014
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:57,235
No, no.

1015
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,105
# that saved #

1016
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,740
# a wretch like me #

1017
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:04,842
Help.

1018
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:05,778
Help.

1019
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:06,645
Security.

1020
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,380
# I once was lost #

1021
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:10,215
It's a no.

1022
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,520
# but now I'm found #

1023
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:14,185
It's a no.

1024
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,320
You're hearing me, Bud.

1025
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:16,037
You're hearing me.

1026
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:16,931
It's a no, it's a no.

1027
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,043
You're hearing me, Man.

1028
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:19,085
This way, let's go.

1029
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,590
I can't... I can't leave.

1030
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,725
I cannot leave.

1031
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,430
I'm not try... I'm not going to get violent.

1032
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:24,147
I'm not getting violent.

1033
00:35:24,182 --> 00:35:24,841
I'm not getting violent.

1034
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:25,500
I'm asking you to leave.

1035
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,365
Come on, Dog.

1036
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,665
Are you kidding me?

1037
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,950
Are you kidding me?

1038
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:31,165
Jarrod was obviously

1039
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,055
agitated, and refusing to quit,

1040
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,035
left security with no choice but to intervene.

1041
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,800
Come on, Man, do you see me fighting for this show,

1042
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,980
and now you're gonna kick me out like that?

1043
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,175
Look, Dude.

1044
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,320
Everybody get excited.

1045
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:45,985
Go ahead.

1046
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,975
Okay, you're gonna bend your knees

1047
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,520
and you're gonna roll over and step up.

1048
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:49,837
Come on, bend your knees.

1049
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:51,981
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1050
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,090
Bend your knees and get up.

1051
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,225
So...

1052
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:01,130
if that's the way it's got to be, you guys take me out in cuffs.

1053
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:03,552
You gotta take me out in cuffs.

1054
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:05,940
Act like I can't sing, Randy.

1055
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,065
Yes or no?

1056
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,260
It's a no.

1057
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:22,307
No, it's a no.

1058
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:23,451
It's a no.

1059
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:24,560
Come on, Man.

1060
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:25,525
No.

1061
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,755
Come on, man.

1062
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,430
Coming up, a mistake ten years ago robbed him of his youth.

1063
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:34,035
I spent four birthdays behind bars.

1064
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,470
But what lies in Matt Lawrence's future?

1065
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:40,870
An emotional conclusion after the break.

1066
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,395
It's 6:00 PM, and day two in Orlando is winding down.

1067
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:54,870
What was once 10,000 hopefuls has been whittled to less than a handful.

1068
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:58,970
Orlando had proven to be the city of hope, with each person

1069
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:01,675
auditioning for their own particular reasons.

1070
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,750
Some came to make life better for a loved one, others to beat the odds.

1071
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:10,615
Some came to conquer an insecurity.

1072
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,820
The last contestant of the day was there for redemption.

1073
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,720
My name is Matt Lawrence.

1074
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:19,055
I'm 25 years old.

1075
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,830
I'm from Starke, Florida, and I manage my father's trucking company.

1076
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,105
When I was in high school,

1077
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,670
I was the guy that had everything going for me.

1078
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:31,805
But I also had this desire for adventure.

1079
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,640
One day I came home, and there was a note that basically

1080
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:38,810
said he was going on an adventure,

1081
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:42,050
And one thing led to another.

1082
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:44,685
I got into some trouble.

1083
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,390
I robbed a bank with a BB gun when I was 15.

1084
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:54,827
I spent four birthdays behind bars.

1085
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:59,416
Being locked up was the hardest thing

1086
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:03,970
that i've ever been through because...

1087
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:07,175
it hurt my family so much.

1088
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,780
I never saw my dad cry before that time.

1089
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:11,540
Good luck in there, Matt.

1090
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:12,775
Thank you, Man.

1091
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,945
I auditioned for American Idol

1092
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,065
because I want to do something

1093
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,925
that'll make my family proud.

1094
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,505
You know, I want to be able to,

1095
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,015
you know, put a smile on their

1096
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,130
face ten times more than I ever made them cry.

1097
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:28,595
So... yeah.

1098
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,795
How are you doing?

1099
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,960
What's going on, Matt?

1100
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:31,777
Not too much.

1101
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:32,571
How are you guys?

1102
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:33,318
Welcome, Man.

1103
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:33,995
Thank you.

1104
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,730
So is singing your dream?

1105
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:36,465
It is.

1106
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,970
Um, that's really all it's been up to this point.

1107
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:40,772
I never really pursued it that much but, uh,

1108
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:42,558
I got some positive feedback and figured

1109
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:44,316
I'd give it a shot and see what happens.

1110
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,300
All right, so what you singing today, Dog?

1111
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,250
I'm singing Trouble by Ray Lamontagne.

1112
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,602
Oh, get down.

1113
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:50,858
Good to go?

1114
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:52,891
Go for it.

1115
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:54,855
# trouble #

1116
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,460
# trouble, trouble, trouble #

1117
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:59,155
# trouble #

1118
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,560
# trouble been doggin' my soul #

1119
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:05,930
# since the day I was born #

1120
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:08,265
# worry #

1121
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,455
#orry, worry, worry, worry #

1122
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,085
# worry just cannot seem #

1123
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,680
# to leave my mind alone #

1124
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:21,610
# i've been saved #

1125
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:25,645
# by a woman #

1126
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,090
# i've been saved #

1127
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:32,255
# by a woman #

1128
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,110
# she won't let me go #

1129
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:39,107
# no, she won't let me go #

1130
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,521
- All right. - Thank you.

1131
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,900
- Brilliant. - Mm-hmm.

1132
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,105
Brilliant.

1133
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,435
You can really, really sing.

1134
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,170
It almost feels like you could have written that song.

1135
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:50,145
Oh, yeah.

1136
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,645
That's how believable it was.

1137
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,045
I don'mean that in a bad way.

1138
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,410
It's just that it... it...

1139
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,815
Well, maybe I did.

1140
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,920
- No, no, but no, it... it felt authentic. - Yeah.

1141
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:02,250
- I was very impressed. - Mm-hmm.

1142
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:02,885
Well, thank you.

1143
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,120
Very, very impressed.

1144
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,085
Good for you.

1145
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,240
I completely agree with Simon.

1146
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:09,325
And what I love about you is,

1147
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,500
you hit those high notes and I didn't feel like I was gonna fly through the window.

1148
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,500
You have such control over your voice, you know?

1149
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,400
And that's a hard song to sing.

1150
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:21,157
You're so genuine, Dude.

1151
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:22,880
That's what it's about, Man.

1152
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:23,980
And you've got vocals.

1153
00:40:24,015 --> 00:40:24,775
What?

1154
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,475
He's the real deal.

1155
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,180
He's the real deal.

1156
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:26,850
Let's take a vote.

1157
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:27,475
Sime?

1158
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,780
Easiest yes I've said today.

1159
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:29,885
Kara?

1160
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,145
I think one of the best.

1161
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,890
Definitely one of the best today.

1162
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:33,920
Welcome to Hollywood, Matt!

1163
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:34,755
Whoo!

1164
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,715
You made it, Dude.

1165
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,205
Thank you, guys, so much.

1166
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,660
He's gonna go top 12.

1167
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,060
This represents an opportunity to change everything.

1168
00:40:44,095 --> 00:40:46,105
This represents an opportunity to

1169
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,390
maybe get back some of the things I lost a long time ago.

1170
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:52,640
My name is Matt Lawrence, and I'm the next American Idol.

1171
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:54,035
And that's a wrap.

1172
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,645
And that's where our story ends, for tonight at least.

1173
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,750
In total, 31 contestants made their dreams come true in Orlando.

1174
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:05,080
- Whoo! - Yes!

1175
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,860
For them, this truly was the happiest place in the world.

1176
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:12,160
See you in Hollywood.

1177
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:13,325
Whoo!

1178
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,200
Next week, idol is back home in Los Angeles, California.

1179
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:19,060
Welcome to LA!

1180
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,370
Where more unbelievable talent takes home the gold.

1181
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:24,737
# get up and go #

1182
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:26,035
# if I knew #

1183
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,555
Dude, that was excellent.

1184
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,040
Our guest judges get naughty.

1185
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:31,145
I feel dirty.

1186
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,880
Katy, you make me feel dirty.

1187
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:34,015
And others get nice.

1188
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,675
Are you sure this isn't my daughter?

1189
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,050
But not everything's hot under the California sun.

1190
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:40,372
It's not good. You shouldn't be doing this.

1191
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:42,660
And Simon meets his biggest competition yet.

1192
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,810
Simon Cowell, I'm going to Hollywood.

1193
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,080
No, you're not.

1194
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,470
Is idols in the city of Angels we are seeing are as angelic as they sing?

1195
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,590
You want to leave on your own, or with an escort?
