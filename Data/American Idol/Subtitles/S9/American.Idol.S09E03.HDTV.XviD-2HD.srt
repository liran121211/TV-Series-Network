00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,130
This week, our search for the next American Idol

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,670
brings us to the jewel of the midwest.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,160
# this is #

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,240
# my kind of #

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,120
We're excited to be in the Windy City,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,490
and we're blown away by the warm welcome.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,490
Get this out of my face.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,830
# my kind of town #

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,400
That is a joke.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,740
# Chicago is #

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
You think I playing ?

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,760
# my kind of people who #

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,450
They suck.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,610
This place. Goodbye.

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,670
American Idol.

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,730
Kiss my...

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,240
This is American Idol.

18
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,730
Get out my face.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,620
Chicago-style.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,730
We started things off here back in season one.

21
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,220
And we came back in season five.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,820
Now it's season nine, and we're set to do it all over again.

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,520
Welcome to Chicago!

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,880
They were glad to see us back in the Windy City...

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,020
We love it when American Idol comes to Chicago.

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,480
And since this is the hometown of our nation's president,

27
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,610
they gave us a welcome fit for...

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,290
Well, you know...

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,760
a president.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,010
Where we are met with cynicism and doubt,

31
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,730
we will respond with that timeless creed

32
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,370
that sums up the spirit of a people...

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,570
Yes, we can.

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,660
His influences have been felt all over the country,

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,800
and today many of the idol hopefuls

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,810
are following in his footsteps.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,780
Yes, we can!

38
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,450
Yes, we can.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,190
Yes, we can.

40
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,450
He's my main man.

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,710
Hopefully, the next idol will be from Chicago,

42
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,330
and this could be the new sign.

43
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,760
I may not be Obama...

44
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,130
but he's the next American Idol!

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,570
So far, this is our largest stop on the audition tour.

46
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,140
And we're hoping that somewhere in this sea of

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,770
12,000 candidates we find the one person we're looking for.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,540
I believe I have what it

49
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,780
takes to become America's next top model.

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,180
Idol!

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,550
I mean... I mean... I mean America's...

52
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,550
Now that we know where they stand...

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,880
It's time for the idol candidates to move inside...

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,250
and deliver.

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,050
I'm Chicago's finest.

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,260
And to make sure of that...

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,530
The judges arrive in Chicago hots on the audition trial.

58
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,160
Yo! Party people!

59
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,350
And speaking of hot,

60
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,030
our guest judge is country music superstar...

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,390
# let's go, girls #

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,340
Shania Twain.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,340
Oh, yeah!

64
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,970
I love Shania Twain.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,080
She has penned some of the greatest pop songs.

66
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,580
She's like a pioneer,

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,780
And now I'm gonna go and stalk Shania Twain.

68
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,090
Having sold over 65 million albums,

69
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,640
Shania has changed the face of music as

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,520
she successfully crossed country with pop.

71
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,290
And she won five grammys for her efforts.

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,860
# man, I feel like a woman #

73
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,630
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance

74
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,130
for so many of these people.

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,760
Honestly, I think I'd pee myself

76
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,270
if I was really standing here for real.

77
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,270
I did do that once when I was younger.

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,840
Good thing Simon is here to comfort Shania through her childhood trauma.

79
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,340
I'd be bored without you.

80
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,340
He even tries to brighten her day.

81
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,350
By the way, can we get some light in here?

82
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,980
It's like being in a bunker or something.

83
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,980
Is there a reason why we have to sit in the dark then?

84
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,450
Thanks to Simon, things are properly lit.

85
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,570
The cameras are rolling,

86
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,810
and now the judges are ready for

87
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,560
the first contestant of the day.

88
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,760
My name is Caitlin Upperly.

89
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,630
I am 19 years old, and I'm from West Des Moines, Iowa.

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,970
My mother has been trying to talk me into trying out

91
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,900
for American Idol for a really long time.

92
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,220
I always just was kind of standoffish about the idea,

93
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,500
But some thing's happened this summer

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,640
that changed my way of thinking.

95
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,140
For the last, um... few months,

96
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,050
our family has kind of been broken up.

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,950
My, um, husband decided to divorce and just...

98
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,260
rug kind of pulled out from underneath us, so...

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,530
it's been really hard for all of us.

100
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,520
My parents have gone to all of my performances

101
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,200
and everything since I was very young.

102
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,230
And this is the first one that they, you know,

103
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,470
that they're not here together.

104
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,540
She's doing this, in part, for me, I know.

105
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,390
This day could be a new chapter in our lives,

106
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,610
and especially for Caitlin, so...

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
we're excited to see what happens.

108
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,250
- Hello!  - Hello.

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,920
- Hi.  - How are you?

110
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,180
Very good.

111
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,410
Very nice to meet all of you.

112
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,570
Thank you. What's your name?

113
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
- My name's Caitlin.  - Caitlin. Okay.

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,330
And why did you enter the show this year?

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,230
Well, I'm doing it because

116
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,810
I've a lot of family problems at home, so...

117
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,480
Like what?

118
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,660
Um, like my dad leaving my mother.

119
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,800
So it's her favorite show, and it's kind of...

120
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,040
Who are you siding with?

121
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,100
What are you doing, man?

122
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,090
I mean, I'm kind of forced to side with my mom,

123
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,640
but I'm still speaking with my dad.

124
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,640
Simon Cowell, therapist hour!

125
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,110
What are we doing here?

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,110
You feel better off after that conversation, don't you?

127
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
It's like the air's now cleared.

128
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,920
Yeah, it's all out in the open now.

129
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,750
Part of the reason why I'm here.

130
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,020
Okay, and what are you gonna sing?

131
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,220
Syrup and Honey by Duffy.

132
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,490
Yum!

133
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,320
Sounds good, right?

134
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,690
# don't you be out #

135
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,130
# all night long #

136
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,970
# leaving me all alone #

137
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,700
# because I #

138
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,140
# need your love #

139
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,040
# don't you be usin' #

140
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,850
# every day #

141
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,520
# workin' away #

142
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,020
# because I... I... I #

143
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,960
# need your love #

144
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,160
- Thank you.  - Shania.

145
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,460
I think your voice has a lot of very interesting qualities

146
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,160
and I just thought it sounded very unique.

147
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,310
Yeah, what I really like is

148
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,780
you don't sound anything like Duffy

149
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
cause we've had so many sound-alikes

150
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,400
that come in here and sound like Duffy and Adele.

151
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,970
But I think that there's something there.

152
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,590
Kara.

153
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,780
Yeah, I do see potential in you, you know?

154
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,960
You're a pretty girl.

155
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,240
But I'd like to see you do something a little perkier,

156
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,220
a little more energetic.

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,800
Okay.

158
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,010
Yeah, it's all a little bit the lights are off.

159
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,420
- But somebody's home!  - Yes.

160
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,150
The lights are dim.

161
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,690
Like the room we walked into today...

162
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,360
Had to sort of open the curtains and...

163
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,360
I think you have a voice that could sing a hit song.

164
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,660
I think.

165
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,660
Okay. Kara, yes or no?

166
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,660
- Yes.  - Randy.

167
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,100
- Yes.  - Yes for me too.

168
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,200
You got four yeses.

169
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,200
Welcome to Hollywood!

170
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,970
Thank you so much!

171
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,970
- Awesome.  - Thank you. Thank you so much!

172
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,710
Well done.

173
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,810
We're going to Hollywood!

174
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,810
Yay!

175
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,580
Looks like Day One in Chicago is off to a good start.

176
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,650
Love you.

177
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,050
Love you too, mom.

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,720
Coming up...

179
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,020
The season nine talent keeps getting stronger.

180
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,020
Four yeses.

181
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,290
Welcome to Hollywood!

182
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,860
Yeah! Chicago shows her personality...

183
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,730
Whoa! Ow!

184
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,100
And is this guy for real?

185
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,170
Oh, come on, Brian.

186
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,300
Welcome back to American Idol.

187
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,530
Before we get back to the auditions,

188
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,220
we thought we'd allow one of the city locals

189
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,910
to tell you a little bit about a few of

190
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,370
the names of this great city.

191
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,340
Chicago has rarely been the same place twice.

192
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,510
It's been the Windy City, the Second City,

193
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,890
the city of big shoulders,

194
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,810
player with the nation's railroads,

195
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,450
candy capital of the world.

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,050
My kind of town, city in a garden, chi-town, Chicagua.

197
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,310
Whatever you wanna call it.

198
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,390
Me and nearly 3 million others call it home.

199
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,790
Those are a lot of names to live up to.

200
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,080
Back at the auditions.

201
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,590
And just looking to make a name for herself,

202
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,860
is 26-year-old Broadway baby Amy Lang.

203
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,380
I'm auditioning for American Idol

204
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,130
Because I figure if all I have to do is

205
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,710
wait in a line for a couple of days,

206
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,710
to be famous and make my dreams come true.

207
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,740
It's worth it.

208
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,140
If someone were...

209
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,100
to write a music about me,

210
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,950
it would probably be called Amy Lang,

211
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,710
Amy Lang, Amy Lang...

212
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,380
The musical! Yeah!

213
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm excited to meet Ryan.

214
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,220
Tell me something...

215
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,860
Cause we have, um... we have a history.

216
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,360
# always thinks of you #

217
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,360
Me and Ryan secretest...

218
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,360
hot item.

219
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,430
- You look good.  - Thanks.

220
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,230
Just a little shorter than I remember you.

221
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,270
- Remember me?  - He was the first celebrity

222
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,700
that I ever had an inappropriate dream about.

223
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,810
- And how did the dream end?  - Good!

224
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
Why don't we send you into the audition.

225
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm happy you ended that... in that way.

226
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,980
Oh, my god!

227
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,980
- Hello.  - Hi! How's it going?

228
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,420
You guys look good.

229
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,690
So do you.

230
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,690
- Oh... Stop!  - Oh!

231
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
I like her.

232
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,990
- I like you already.  - You're funny.

233
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,390
You can do something with your boobs, it says here.

234
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm gonna do it during the song... just wait for it.

235
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,850
- Yeah, I'll make it happen.  - Can we sing?

236
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,820
What's going on up here, man?

237
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,800
Sing? What are you talking?

238
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,800
Is this a singing show? Nobody told me.

239
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,770
What you singing?

240
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,160
Dr. Feelgood, by Aretha Franklin.

241
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,540
Okay. Freaking out.

242
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,280
We got it.

243
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,190
# don't send me no doctor #

244
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,020
# fillin' me up #

245
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,950
# with all those pills #

246
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,260
# I got me a man #

247
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,660
# named Dr. Feelgood #

248
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,690
# and yeah #

249
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,960
# ooh #

250
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,700
# that man takes care #

251
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
# of all my pains #

252
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,370
# and my ills #

253
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,930
# good god all mighty #

254
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,270
# the man sure makes me #

255
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,270
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.

256
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,270
- I actually thought she fainted.  - Where's the boob thing?

257
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,140
Oh, just a little...

258
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,280
- Whoa!  - I was busy singing.

259
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,110
It wasn't as big as it usually...

260
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,950
You wanna be careful with that.

261
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,820
We do it to the beat too,

262
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,720
like... # good god almighty #

263
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,250
# the man sure makes me feel #

264
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,250
Oh my god!

265
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,760
Whoa! Talent.

266
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,190
Randy, she's boob-boxing.

267
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,860
Boob-boxing... yeah.

268
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,860
Boob-boxing.

269
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,200
She's boob-boxing.

270
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,130
Musical boobs.

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,100
Nobody else.

272
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,970
- Just me.  - I'm gonna say no, Amy.

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,000
Really? Even though I can sing?

274
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,600
Yeah, they're not gonna go to Hollywood.

275
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,410
I can sing things more serious too. I was kinda having fun with it, but...

276
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,880
It was just too funny of an audition...

277
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,410
Couldn't really take it seriously.

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,950
- That's it. It's over.  - Simon.

279
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,050
That's it. That's it.

280
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,210
You gotta move on.

281
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,150
- Okay.  - Thank you, Amy.

282
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,150
All right, thank you.

283
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,080
Bye, sweetheart.

284
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,750
I should have sang something serious,

285
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,190
but I thought it was so fun...

286
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,010
that it would stand out and they'd enjoy it,

287
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,260
- They'd laugh.  - I just wanted to make myself stand out.

288
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
And what'd they call your... move?

289
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,160
I don't know. I call it the boob flex.

290
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,100
That's the first time we've seen that.

291
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,860
What are you gonna do?

292
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,000
And so farewell, America.

293
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,500
Ba-dump-bum!

294
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,370
Amy didn't get the support she wanted from the judges,

295
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,810
but her family was there to give her a lift.

296
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,640
And as with many contestants who audition...

297
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,780
I'm here to support.

298
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,380
Knowing that family and friends have their backs goes a long way.

299
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,220
# long as we got each other #

300
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,820
- Next Idol, right here.  - She's really good!

301
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,720
- And I'm good.  - That's Emily!

302
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,870
And with her family set by her side,

303
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,830
our next contestant hopes she will make the cut.

304
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,030
My name is Charity Vance.

305
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,430
I'm 16 years old, and I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas.

306
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,830
I live with my mom and my dad.

307
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,170
They have a salon. It's in our house.

308
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,900
Vance Salon. This is Charity.

309
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,860
Both my mom and my dad,

310
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,890
they've been doing hair together for like 20 years,

311
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,440
and the clients are really encouraging.

312
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,230
They always want me to sing for them,

313
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,840
so it's really fun, and I get to practice performing.

314
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,550
We've been watching American Idol

315
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,050
since she was eight years old.

316
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,980
Every Tuesday night,

317
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,240
we'd have friends and family over to the house and,

318
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,050
I mean, it's like a party at our house.

319
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,390
If I get that golden ticket, I am going to freak out.

320
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,830
I will be a crazy person on American Idol, like...

321
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,660
I want it a lot!

322
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,100
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,800
- Hello.  - Hi.

324
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,730
Okay, what are you going to sing today, Charity?

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,900
- Summertime.  - Okay.

326
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,600
# summertime #

327
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,080
# and the livin' is easy #

328
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,610
# fish are jumpin' #

329
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,080
# and the cotton is high #

330
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,550
# well, your daddy's rich #

331
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,460
# and your ma is good-lookin' #

332
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,930
# so hush, little baby #

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,100
# don't you cry #

334
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,710
Thank you, Charity. Randy?

335
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,570
Wow. I was really impressed.

336
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,210
I didn't know really what to expect.

337
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,980
I mean, small voice, but very interesting sound.

338
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
I liked it.

339
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,850
I was pleasantly surprised.

340
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,350
And you're using your range.

341
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,750
You're not afraid to do it.

342
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,370
You probably have to hone in a little bit more

343
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,750
on the better qualities of your voice.

344
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,390
But she has a lot of personal style, I would say.

345
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,190
Mm-hmm. That was a great version.

346
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,120
Thank you so much.

347
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,130
Yeah, I've heard that song a lot.

348
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,990
What I liked about it, Charity,

349
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,190
was it was unique to you.

350
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,610
Yeah. Mm.

351
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,130
On record, you sound great.

352
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
I gotta tell you.

353
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,930
Okay, Kara, yes or no?

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,490
- Yes.  - Randy?

355
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,570
100% yes.

356
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,200
- Shania.  - I say yes as well.

357
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,940
Charity, full house. You're through.

358
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,940
Welcome to Hollywood, Charity, Charity!

359
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,580
- Awesome.  - Well done, kiddo.

360
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,050
She made it her own.

361
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,610
Can't believe she's 16!

362
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,620
So let's see what happened here...

363
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,560
Simon said yes! Simon!

364
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,060
Come on!

365
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,130
I'm going to Hollywood! Whoo!

366
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,430
That's my little dance.

367
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,400
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!

368
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,740
So Charity snags the second gold ticket in Chicago.

369
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,170
Hollywood!

370
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,980
And as she twirls her way to Hollywood...

371
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,060
we had to break.

372
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,200
Coming up...

373
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,250
more incredible performances.

374
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
You singers like you is why I like doing this show.

375
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,520
As Chi-town feels the pressure.

376
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,250
Out my face.

377
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,980
Plus, it's Angela Martin's last chance.

378
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,660
I can't give up... until I touch my dream.

379
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,930
Does her journey end in Chicago?

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,670
Find out what happens after the break.

381
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:32,180
Welcome back to American Idol

382
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,410
and welcome back to Chicago.

383
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,150
Since the break, things have taken a turn.

384
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,980
# my name is kelly #

385
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,650
# ke... kelly #

386
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,380
# my name is kelly #

387
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,180
# kell... kell #

388
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:41,850
# my name is kelly #

389
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,520
# ke... kelly #

390
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,620
# do you hear my name? #

391
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,190
Dude, no, no.

392
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,790
And all of the characters have started to come out.

393
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,160
How are you guys?

394
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,860
Causing the judges' patience to wear thin.

395
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,630
# I am the crazy #

396
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,830
# accordion lady #

397
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,840
# this is my song #

398
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,000
Maybe this next batch of contestants will cheer them up.

399
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,910
# give 'em the old #

400
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,710
# three ring circus #

401
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,150
# hi #

402
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,740
# ah #

403
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,200
# ma #

404
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,900
No.

405
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,090
# stun and stagger them #

406
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,080
That wasn't serious, was it?

407
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,880
# how can they spot #

408
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,880
# you got no talents? #

409
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,550
# Here's a hero #

410
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,990
# it's not unusual #

411
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,220
# to be loved by anyone #

412
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,390
# can you feel #

413
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,960
# the love tonight #

414
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,160
Do you enjoy giving people pain?

415
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm a high-pitched singer so...

416
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,130
You shouldn't even be doing that.

417
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,300
# razzle dazzle 'em #

418
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,000
# and they'll make you a star #

419
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:42,210
# ah #

420
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,880
This is a complete and utter waste of time.

421
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,080
All right, thank you very much.

422
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,820
Okay, so that didn't help.

423
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,120
While the judges take a much-needed break...

424
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,850
Not really great ones today.

425
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,660
The affects of the afternoon slump can be felt all around.

426
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,490
- Out of my face.  - They suck.

427
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,360
That is a joke.

428
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,130
So far, only four golden tickets have been given away.

429
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,110
And the excitement that was experienced earlier

430
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,700
by contestants going to Hollywood...

431
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,770
Aw.

432
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,040
has been replaced by tears and the sounds of disappointment.

433
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,740
I'm not coming back.

434
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,850
And as Simon heads back from the break...

435
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,480
He was wrong about Jennifer Hudson.

436
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,610
He's wrong about me.

437
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,050
he has to handle some unfinished business.

438
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,650
- Simon.  - Oh.

439
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,750
How could you say such awful things about my daughter?

440
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,960
So you're not happy with me?

441
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,160
Hell to the no.

442
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,360
I was giving your daughter good advice.

443
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,190
I do not agree with you.

444
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,560
Try to be mad at me, but you do agree with me a little bit.

445
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,900
I do not agree with you.

446
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,560
I've always liked you.

447
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,970
But now I don't like you anymore!

448
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,600
You know you still like me.

449
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,270
And our final contestant of the day is 28-year-old Angela Martin.

450
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,550
She's auditioning for a third time

451
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,610
And has some unfinished business of her own.

452
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,610
The very first time I auditioned, uh,

453
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,550
shriners hospital saw me on American Idol

454
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,150
and they agreed to take care of my daughter till she turned 21.

455
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,020
And it's a blessing.

456
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,950
# we climbed down #

457
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,090
# the mountains #

458
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,720
But after my audition, my dad was killed.

459
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,160
I had to go to Hollywood a week after his funeral.

460
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,160
# oh-oh-oh #

461
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,260
He was planning on coming to hollywood with me.

462
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,370
It's all over.

463
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,900
After being cut in Season 7,

464
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,000
Angela came back in Season 8,

465
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,340
making the top 50 only to face another setback.

466
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,180
Last year, you couldn't make it to one of our shows.

467
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,080
- Mm-hmm.  - Tell us why.

468
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,780
Well, I had a traffic violation... a warrant.

469
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,750
Had to leave and take care of that.

470
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,560
- You had a court date.  - Yeah.

471
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,230
I've seen a lot of dreams die.

472
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,610
But I will never give up.

473
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,610
I can't give up until I touch my dream.

474
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,780
I remember this girl.

475
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,320
Yes, I remember Angela.

476
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,720
Come on in, man.

477
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,120
She looks great.

478
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,020
You look great.

479
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,050
Angela Martin.

480
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,320
So you made it to Hollywood last time, right?

481
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,460
I made it to the top 50 and I had a warrant.

482
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,660
And I had to drop out.

483
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,500
- Naughty Angela.  - Traffic, though.

484
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,170
- Not that bad.  - Speeding.

485
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,640
You need to slow it back a bit.

486
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,840
- Yeah.  - All right, so what you singing today?

487
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,140
Just Fine by Mary J. Blige.

488
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,910
- Do it.  - Okay.

489
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,910
# let it go #

490
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,940
# can't let this thing #

491
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,450
# called love get away #

492
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,150
# from you #

493
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,080
# feel free right now #

494
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,880
# go and do #

495
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,490
# what you want to do #

496
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,890
# can't let nobody #

497
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,530
# take it away from you #

498
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
# from me, from we #

499
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,430
# no time for moping around #

500
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,830
# are you kidding? #

501
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,970
# and no time #

502
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,540
# for negative vibes #

503
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,840
# 'cause I'm winning #

504
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,810
# it's been a long year #

505
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,140
# I put in my hardest #

506
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,080
# gonna live my life #

507
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,980
# feels so good #

508
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,880
# to get it right #

509
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,520
# just fine #

510
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,190
- Ah, yeah.  - Good choice of song too.

511
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,750
Nice too 'cause she's been through it.

512
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,120
Yeah. You have the right attitude and it shows in your voice.

513
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,680
It's people like you...

514
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,390
Singers like you why I like doing this show.

515
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,760
Because you're really talented.

516
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,630
You need a break. And you're just good.

517
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,130
Thank you.

518
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,470
Yeah. You're good.

519
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,170
You're good. And you try, try again.

520
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,100
This is what I really like about you.

521
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,350
You actually listen to the criticism,

522
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,010
and you take it in, and then you show up and you're better.

523
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,750
- And you do deserve a break.  - Definitely hot vocals.

524
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,310
Very good audition. Let's take a vote.

525
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,880
- Kara, yes or no?  - Definitely.

526
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,150
- Simon.  - No.

527
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,990
- Kidding!  - Yeah.

528
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,090
It's a yes.

529
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,220
- Shania.  - Yes for me.

530
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,860
Yes for me. Welcome to Hollywood!

531
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,360
Welcome back, baby!

532
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,230
Angela's back. She's back.

533
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,560
Pay your tickets, girl.

534
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,960
Pay 'em. Pay them tickets.

535
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,430
Don't have that happen next year.

536
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,530
Go slower.

537
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,140
How many times would this be?

538
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,810
- This would be the...  - she's great.

539
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,140
- Try, try again works.  - She's great.

540
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,280
When you're good, try, try again works.

541
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,580
So how's this chapter gonna end?

542
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,470
Hopefully with my daughter getting everything

543
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,160
And me just continue on doing what I do.

544
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,120
You guys... you guys have me in tears now.

545
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,690
I'm going to Hollywood again.

546
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,060
Again again. Again.

547
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,617
The storm is over.

548
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:13,353
- Over.  - Over.

549
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,855
And so is the drought.

550
00:20:18,603 --> 00:20:21,296
It wasn't easy, but seven other contestants from day one

551
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:23,173
will be joining Angela in hollywood.

552
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,407
Through to the next round.

553
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:25,575
Welcome to Hollywood!

554
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:30,012
And for these contestants and their loved ones...

555
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:32,916
It doesn't get any better than this.

556
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,618
- Nick, four yeses.  - Whoo!

557
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:35,652
Welcome to Hollywood, Nick.

558
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:40,882
Mom, I just wanted to call

559
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:43,627
and let you know I'm going to Hollywood.

560
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:51,601
Yeah, Chicago!

561
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:54,704
Yeah!

562
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,206
Yes!

563
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:59,056
Up next, the day two auditions begin

564
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,379
and Chicago reaches for the right notes.

565
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:06,983
Maybe we should give her the note.

566
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:08,251
# and I #

567
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,586
# and I #

568
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:12,290
Okay, okay, okay.

569
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:25,283
Welcome back to Chicago, where day two is about to begin.

570
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,448
Here in Windy City, we've seen the largest audition crowd of the circuit.

571
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:32,317
I would say it's almost like a million people here.

572
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:34,953
More like 16,000.

573
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,490
And with such big numbers come big dreams.

574
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,058
I'm the next American Idol!

575
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,227
I am it! I'm number one. Whoo!

576
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:44,463
And even bigger expectations.

577
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,997
She can sing her behind off.

578
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:47,999
I'm gonna be the next American Idol.

579
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,968
Yeah! Yeah!

580
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,667
And despite a poor showing on day one,

581
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:55,507
the judges' hopes are still magnified.

582
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,476
This is town of big talent, Ryan.

583
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:58,944
Jennifer Hudson. Kanye.

584
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:01,980
Hopefully today, man, Chicago will show improvement.

585
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:03,215
Come on, Chicago.

586
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,280
And as everyone settles in for the big day,

587
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:11,022
will the first contestant, 26-year-old curly newborn, measure up?

588
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,258
- Hello. How are you?  - All right.

589
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:15,327
- And your name is?  - Curly.

590
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:17,863
And what are you going to sing today, Curly?

591
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,899
Today I'm gonna sing Maxell, a woman's work.

592
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,000
Aw.

593
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:24,603
- Y'all ready?  - Please.

594
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,842
# oh-oh-oh-oh ooh ooh ooh #

595
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,712
# pray god you can cope #

596
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:37,615
# I stand outside #

597
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,851
# this woman's work #

598
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,987
# this woman's work #

599
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:46,358
# now starts the craft #

600
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:52,731
# and the fa-wa-ah #

601
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:55,300
# I know you got a little life #

602
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:56,334
# in you yet #

603
00:22:57,303 --> 00:22:59,104
# I know you got a lot #

604
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,772
# of strength in you #

605
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,642
Okay. Yeah, dog, it was...

606
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,144
You have a high voice.

607
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:09,481
The high voice and the whole thing with the woman's work...

608
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:11,516
Okay, I don't know what that was.

609
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,086
- Oh, god.  - Yeah.

610
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,415
Do you find when you sing at home,

611
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,123
a lot of animals turn up outside the house?

612
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,291
Stop it. Stop it.

613
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,427
And it takes days to finish a song.

614
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:24,295
He just has a high voice. He has a high voice.

615
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:28,666
- High?  - Oh, the Chicago skyline's so beautiful.

616
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:30,702
All right, Curly, that's right.

617
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,337
We weren't expecting a high...

618
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,742
Thanks a lot.

619
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,546
Not the start we expected for the day to auditions here in Chicago.

620
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:42,680
We haven't said yes or no.

621
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,783
- I guess it's no.  - It's a no.

622
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,885
- No?  - No?  - No?

623
00:23:46,952 --> 00:23:48,987
- No.  - No.  - Yes.

624
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,022
- No.  - No.

625
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,957
Curly's high notes didn't quite hit the mark.

626
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,592
Maybe next time.

627
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:58,172
Well, until then, 19-year-old Alana Halbert

628
00:23:58,173 --> 00:24:00,632
is picking up right where he left off.

629
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:02,634
# I think of you #

630
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:05,103
# every step of #

631
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:09,441
# the way #

632
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:11,209
- Here we go.  - Should I keep going?

633
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:12,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

634
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,611
You should've started lower, maybe.

635
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,847
Bring the chorus down and then start the chorus.

636
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:18,483
- Okay. Um...  - Maybe we should give her the note.

637
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:21,152
I'll cue you in. Let me cue you in.

638
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,188
# and I #

639
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,355
# and I #

640
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,390
# and I #

641
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,624
# and I #

642
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,993
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

643
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,629
A singing lesson, season 9.

644
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:33,431
- This is wild.  - It's getting worse.

645
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:34,899
That was your $10 singing lesson.

646
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,334
Okay, it's a no for now, sweetheart.

647
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:37,669
Okay. Thank you.

648
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:40,071
Thank you. Take care.

649
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:41,639
- No.  - Aw.

650
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:43,174
Aw. Why'd they say no to you?

651
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:43,875
Why do you think?

652
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:44,976
Um, I don't know, they said...

653
00:24:45,044 --> 00:24:45,643
I don't know, actually.

654
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:48,446
I was kind of just, like, dang off and...

655
00:24:48,514 --> 00:24:50,714
I didn't know what they were trying to say,

656
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:52,250
like, you know what I mean?

657
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:53,584
I had no idea what was, like...

658
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:55,853
I... I really had no idea what I was doing so...

659
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:59,590
They told me, uh, I don't really remember, actually.

660
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,659
- Um, I don't know.  - Did you have fun?

661
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:03,394
Yes, I had fun. Thank you.

662
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,015
But if Alana wasn't clear on what happened

663
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:08,032
inside the audition room...

664
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,802
It was black and white to the rest contestants

665
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:14,906
throughout the early morning auditions.

666
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,308
They go in...

667
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:20,244
And they come out...

668
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:25,116
Without a golden ticket.

669
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:28,586
Hoping to add some color to the morning is our next contestant.

670
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,287
Yoo... hoo... hoo!

671
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:30,421
Sir, my name is Brian Kraus.

672
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,925
I'm 27. I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

673
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,059
I was in the army.

674
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:36,427
I was in Korea.

675
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,126
Being in the army's very depressing.

676
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,131
So they need some form of entertainment,

677
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,733
some type of morale.

678
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,134
I used to sing for the troops.

679
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:45,436
I was told not sing in uniform.

680
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:50,108
And, you know, I couldn't help it and I got in trouble.

681
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:53,177
Screw you, Sergeant Hart, I'm the next American Idol.

682
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:55,780
Hi. Hi. Good... good afternoon, Ma'am.

683
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,281
- Your name is Brian?  - Yes.

684
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:58,883
Okay, anything we need to know?

685
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:01,385
I'm gonna be doing, uh, uh,

686
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:04,388
one of my favorite artists today, Tiny Tim.

687
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:07,859
Oh, okay. Any... any time you're ready.

688
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:14,198
# tiptoe to the window #

689
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,900
# by the window #

690
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:17,869
# that's where I'll be #

691
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:19,504
# come tiptoe #

692
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:24,776
# through the tulips with me #

693
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:27,712
# oh, tiptoe #

694
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,147
All right, okay. Okay, Brian.

695
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,548
Brian, is this a joke?

696
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,283
No, it's not a joke, Ma'am.

697
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:34,318
And... and do you tiptoe like that?

698
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,487
Ask anyone from grade school till... till current.

699
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,221
Yes, I do, ma'am.

700
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,557
Brian, swear on your mother's life that was not a joke.

701
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:42,987
Uh, yes, Simon, I'm gonna swear on my moter's life that is not a joke.

702
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:44,122
That is my singing voice.

703
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:46,858
Well, okay, well, then I guess we have to analyze that.

704
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,626
Brian, it was not good.

705
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:49,627
That was weird.

706
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,695
That was weird, right?

707
00:26:50,763 --> 00:26:54,098
Uh, Mr. Jackson, I was shooting for Tiny Tim today.

708
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,967
What do you mean shooting for Tiny Tim?

709
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,336
- Uh, Mr. Cowell...  - oh, come on, Brian.

710
00:26:58,404 --> 00:27:01,372
Please don't call him Mr. Cowell and Mr. Jackson.

711
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,807
I apologize, Sir.

712
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,410
Brian, we're just gonna... we're just gonna leave this.

713
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:07,835
Yeah. Brian, no.. Thank you.

714
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:09,470
Tiptoe that way.

715
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:12,040
# tiptoe by the window #

716
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:15,209
To be honest, it was a very long process today.

717
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,277
I feel exhausted.

718
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,186
So I feel like slipping into a warm bubble bath

719
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:22,884
and just relaxing my thoughts.

720
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,486
# oh, tiptoe #

721
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:30,591
# by the gardens with me #

722
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,161
Brian's audition left the judges asking

723
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:35,663
the age-old question "real or fake?"

724
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:39,234
My question is why are there no golden tickets,

725
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:42,737
nobody jumping up and down, no tears of joy?

726
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:44,572
We'll be back after this.

727
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,009
After the break, she beat the odds once already.

728
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:49,458
I had a really bad asthma attack

729
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,012
And went into anaphylactic shock.

730
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,714
But what are her chances of making it to Hollywood?

731
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,583
And the guest judge gets technical.

732
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:57,118
You have a beautiful bottom end and...

733
00:27:57,186 --> 00:28:01,189
- Huh?  - Whoo whoo.

734
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:11,467
Welcome back to Chicago.

735
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:15,605
It's 12:00, and the day two auditions are moving full speed ahead.

736
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:16,639
Whoo!

737
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:20,109
Inside, the awaiting contestants are all pumped up.

738
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:23,079
Yeah! Oh!

739
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:25,248
- Those are good.  - Talking to him.

740
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:26,827
But with no golden tickets so far,

741
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:28,918
the judges are looking for a real contender.

742
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:31,087
I usually say yes, but this time I have to say no.

743
00:28:31,155 --> 00:28:32,996
Okay. They just might find it

744
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:35,091
in Chicago's own Harold Davis.

745
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,226
Ow! I have spirit.

746
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:38,261
I have soul.

747
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:39,829
I have everything that I need,

748
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,431
you know, to be the greatest.

749
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:42,765
This is my life.

750
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,934
I'm tired of eating microwave dinners.

751
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:46,102
I want to eat steak.

752
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,104
# trying hard now #

753
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:50,773
I'm gonna do things I didn't even know I can do in there.

754
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:54,043
I'm gonna hold notes as long as I can possibly can.

755
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:57,013
# ohhh #

756
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,982
I'm willing to fight for the glory of being on American Idol.

757
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,117
# ohhh #

758
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:03,389
When I walk into the judges' room,

759
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,788
I'm gonna shoot off like a rocket.

760
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:07,490
I'm gonna blast off in glory.

761
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:08,791
# ohhh #

762
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,626
I'm gonna show them I'm the best.

763
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:13,796
The champion is here. The champion is here.

764
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,165
# oh oh oh #

765
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,633
- Your name is?  - Harold Davis.

766
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:18,968
Okay, nice to meet you, Harold.

767
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:19,802
Nice to meet you too.

768
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,404
What are you gonna sing?

769
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:23,573
- Usher, nice and slow.  - Okay.

770
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,475
# lady #

771
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,810
# Would you mind if I #

772
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,980
# and take it nice and slow? #

773
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,980
# Slow, slow, slow, slow #

774
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:33,980
# Ooh, yeah #

775
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,920
# I'm talking to you, lady #

776
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,490
# would you mind if I #

777
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,990
# and take it nice and slow? #

778
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,890
# Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh #

779
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,160
# It's 7:00 on the dot #

780
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,830
# I'm in my drop-top #

781
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,330
# cruising the street #

782
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,000
# I got a real pretty #

783
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,500
# pretty little thing #

784
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,830
Okay, okay, got it, got it,

785
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,670
Got it, got it, got it, Harold.

786
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,170
Thank you. Right, Kara, yes or no?

787
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,010
In terms of your vocals,

788
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,510
They're not where they need to be.

789
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,010
- Okay, Randy, yes or no?  - No.

790
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,710
Yeah, dog, it's a no.

791
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,510
You're not up for this.

792
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,510
No, I just got allergies,

793
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,010
'Cause my allergies is acting up.

794
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,180
No, it's not allergies.

795
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,880
Harold, for now, it's an absolute no.

796
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,850
It wasn't a great audition, I promise you.

797
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,350
I'm not being mean. It wasn't great.

798
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,030
Oh, Harold. Aw, Harold.

799
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,460
Oh, dog, it's not the end.

800
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,790
Don't cry.

801
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,140
Harold, come on.

802
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,800
- Chin up.  - Dog, it's not the end, man.

803
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,140
You made it to the audition.

804
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,970
That's a good look.

805
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,970
You learned a lot from us, hopefully.

806
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,640
You can take that and work on it, dog.

807
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,310
Work on it and come back.

808
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,080
Not even the champ was a match for our panel today.

809
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,150
Sorry, Harold.

810
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,660
It's early afternoon, and so far, there's been little reason to celebrate.

811
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,850
This is the longest it's been, ever,

812
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,330
this season without any golden tickets.

813
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,330
So you guys all feel confident you'll get one?

814
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,760
Yep.

815
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,500
Well, she'll have to impress the judges first...

816
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,000
Something that's been difficult to do

817
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,670
since we've been in Chicago.

818
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,840
# Baby, I'll try #

819
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,180
# to love again, but I know #

820
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,510
It's like Shania's song...

821
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,510
That don't impress me much.

822
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,680
# That don't impress #

823
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,750
# me much #

824
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,520
# oh #

825
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,750
# so you... #

826
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,690
God!

827
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,390
# ah #

828
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,090
# ah #

829
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,060
# how did you get here? #

830
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,960
It's just not... it's not... No.

831
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,230
# oh oh oh #

832
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,830
You'll never, ever make a living out of singing.

833
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,970
# ah-ah-ah #

834
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm sorry.

835
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,300
Baby, that was bad.

836
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,810
- I'm sorry.  - No.

837
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,140
A no for now.

838
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,140
Thanks.

839
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,910
We're trying to be too kind because they're so bad.

840
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,910
I know, I know, I know.

841
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,050
Hoping to make a good impression is our next contestant.

842
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,580
My name is John Park.

843
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,490
I'm a student, but I could be the next American Idol.

844
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,550
When I was a senior in high school,

845
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,150
I dicided to apply for voice program in college,

846
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,040
my parents were very against it at first,

847
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,700
because, you know, they wanted me to have a job when I graduated.

848
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,500
I come here today

849
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,100
because I just feel like music is the only way

850
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,040
that I can truly express myself to people.

851
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:19,040
# If I ever leave you, baby #

852
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:24,920
# you can say, "I told you so" #

853
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,490
# and if I ever hurt you #

854
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,660
# you know I hurt myself #

855
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,430
# as well #

856
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,760
# I love you #

857
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:46,270
# more than you'll ever know #

858
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,340
# more than you'll ever know #

859
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,840
Thank you very much, John.

860
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,350
- Shania?  - I was very surprised.

861
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,850
And, yes, you have beatiful bottom end.

862
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,180
Huh? What?

863
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,190
Why, thank you.

864
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,520
She's right.

865
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,360
- Why, thank you, Shania.  - She's right.

866
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,520
- You have nice lips.  - Thanks.

867
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,030
- Shania, what's going on?  - I'm flattered.

868
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,200
Lips and a bottom end... what is going on?

869
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,700
Yeah, I mean, you made the bottom-end thing.

870
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,870
- I mean the voice.  - I... no, I...

871
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,200
You have a nice tone down there, okay?

872
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,700
Down there? What are we doing here?

873
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,810
- Randy...  - You're attractive!

874
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,950
Okay, anyways, no, I was very pleasantly surprised,

875
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,650
And you have a good head.

876
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,150
And you...

877
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,480
Well, now you've got me thinking.

878
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,650
I didn't even do anything.

879
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,820
Somebody save me.

880
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,660
Anyway, I think you have a nice voice.

881
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,490
These are dangerous. Be careful.

882
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,500
I agree with Shania. I was also very surprised.

883
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,120
I didn't know what you would sound like,

884
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,830
and I think you have a really good voice.

885
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,000
And I would say yes.

886
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,340
- Randy?  - Yes, I like John.

887
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,670
- Shania?  - Yes.

888
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,340
- Well, obviously. Uh, it's four yeses.  - Oh. Thank you so much.

889
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,680
- This is a dream come true.  - Welcome to Hollywood, John.

890
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,840
Thank you so much.

891
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,680
There's gonna be a lot of people screaming in about a second.

892
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,850
Watch this.

893
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,690
Finally, finally!

894
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,860
I'm gonna be very careful of my choice of words.

895
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,360
I don't think you are gonna regret what you want back, Shania...

896
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,360
It just all went on a roll there.

897
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,700
I have no regrets.

898
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,130
Shania loved me.

899
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,470
She said... she said really...

900
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,300
Oh, my goodness.

901
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,810
Are you surprised?

902
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,140
- Yeah, a little bit.  - Yeah?

903
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,480
All four of them said yes.

904
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,980
Now, what do we do to celebrate?

905
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,820
So a very happy John Park is the first winner of the day.

906
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,180
And we're gonna take a break and come back

907
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,540
and see if the golden-ticket streak

908
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,660
can stay alive right here in Chicago.

909
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,160
Stay with us.

910
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,330
After the break, the touching story of Paige Dechausee.

911
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,330
They said she had a 30% chance of surviving.

912
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,830
And she's still here.

913
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,270
She's beaten the odds with a second chance at life,

914
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,840
but will the judges give her a chance in Hollywood?

915
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,820
We're approaching the end of two long days here in Chicago,

916
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,870
and as the last of our 12,000 empties in the stadium,

917
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,390
the reputation of the city's talent falls on the shoulders

918
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,000
of a small handful inside the holding room.

919
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,100
This is the group right here that has not had a chance

920
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,830
to see the judges yet, but they're excited.

921
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,170
Are we gonna find the next idol here in this group today?

922
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,180
There's been a shortage of golden tickets so far today,

923
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,850
so we're expecting a lot from this small group right here.

924
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,190
Hoping to breathe new life into the judging room

925
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,360
is 21-year-old Paige Dechausse,

926
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,420
and she's brought a few supporters along for the ride.

927
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,620
The whole family's here.

928
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,660
We came up in a limo.

929
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,370
Grandma Roxy got us the limo today,

930
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,330
And we all squeezed in.

931
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,670
So we're looking forward to a happy ride home.

932
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,290
As a kid, I had asthma and was in the hospital a lot,

933
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,960
and when I was 15, I had a really bad asthma attack

934
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,530
and went into anaphylactic shock,

935
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,510
where your throat closes up.

936
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,680
I was in the studio where I was singing at the time.

937
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,120
We were in a lesson, and next thing I knew, I passed out.

938
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,620
When we got to the hospital,

939
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,380
They actually called us into a back room

940
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,960
and had the grief counselor there.

941
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,130
And they said she had a 30% chance of surviving,

942
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,790
and if she did that she would probably have brain damage.

943
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,960
I told my husband, "I want her music and her earphones.

944
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,300
It's the only thing that's gonna keep her going."

945
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,800
And we did that.

946
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,800
And she's still here.

947
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,610
- All right, what you singing?  - Sam Cooke,

948
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,980
- A change is gonna come.  - Do it.

949
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,980
# I was born by the river #

950
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,920
# In a little tent #

951
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,650
# Oh, just like the river #

952
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,960
# I've been running ever since #

953
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:01,160
# It's been too hard livin' #

954
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,800
# And I'm afraid to die #

955
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,270
# It's been a long #

956
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,510
# A long time comin' #

957
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,280
# But I know #

958
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,440
# A change gonna come #

959
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,110
# Hmm, yes, it will #

960
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,110
Thank you.

961
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,120
All right, what'd you think, Simon, of Paige?

962
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,700
Okay, a little bit indulgent, I thought...

963
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,290
All about you singing to yourself almost.

964
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,790
Yeah, I thought the vocal was pretty good.

965
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,290
You just had some pitch problems in the beginning.

966
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,120
It got better towards the end.

967
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,460
Let's take a vote. Simon?

968
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,790
- No.  - Shania?

969
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm not entirely convinced, but for now,

970
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,300
I would say... I'll say yes.

971
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,630
I see potential in you.

972
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,300
I'm gonna say yes.

973
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,140
She needs a chance to show us what she has, I think.

974
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,980
Come on, look at her.

975
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,310
- What's going on here?  - Let's get him, let's get him, shania.

976
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,980
- What's going on here?  - Please?

977
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,810
She's cute, and she's good.

978
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,480
She can do it.

979
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,150
Because she knows...

980
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm a blubbery mess.

981
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,180
She seems to know what she wants.

982
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,490
Yes, she's just got to work...

983
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,250
She didn't put her personality into her vocal,

984
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,660
and I think she needs to work on that.

985
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,160
I mean, you've heard so many...

986
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,480
You realize here, you have Shania Twain,

987
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,780
one of the greatest to ever do it, here,

988
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,000
trying to convince me that you should go to Hollywood.

989
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,100
I think she has potential.

990
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,270
Come on, Randy, please.

991
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,440
She seems humble.

992
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,440
She's got her head on straight.

993
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,440
She wants to do it.

994
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,110
She's attractive.

995
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,940
She wants to do it.

996
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,610
She wants to do it.

997
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,780
She wants to do it.

998
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,780
Yeah.

999
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,780
Randy.

1000
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,780
Okay.

1001
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,950
Welcome to Hollywood!

1002
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,700
I think I can't be surprised.

1003
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,370
We got you.

1004
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,210
It's an overwhelming moment for everyone.

1005
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,550
That's what...

1006
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,350
That was... that was...

1007
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,680
You just got "girlified."

1008
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,720
Didn't see that one coming.

1009
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,520
We have seen only, maybe one other today.

1010
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,360
Tell me how it feels to have the other one.

1011
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,530
I don't even know.

1012
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,060
Breathe, breathe.

1013
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,730
Give me a second.

1014
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
As Paige takes it all in,

1015
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,400
She's thankful for her family's support and overcome with emotion.

1016
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,070
I'm so happy, I can't even describe it.

1017
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,610
The last thing I wanted to do was walk out to all these people

1018
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,910
without a golden ticket, and I did it.

1019
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,080
Ah, it'll be a good ride home in the limo.

1020
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,610
And as our time here in Chicago comes to a close,

1021
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,360
The last few hopefuls vie for a golden ticket of their own.

1022
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,930
# why does it hurt #

1023
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,600
# so bad? #

1024
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,870
# you hurt me so bad #

1025
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,100
# baby, you're all #

1026
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,770
# that I want #

1027
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,270
# when you're lying here #

1028
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,270
# in my arms #

1029
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,610
# I'm finding it hard #

1030
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,110
# to believe #

1031
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,340
# we're in heaven #

1032
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,110
# and I'll be #

1033
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,120
# you're crying shoulder #

1034
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:59,720
# I'll be love's suicide #

1035
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,420
- I'm gonna pass. - Okay.

1036
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,730
I say yes.

1037
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,300
I'm gonna say yes.

1038
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,130
I'll give you one more chance...

1039
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,130
I'm gonna say yes.

1040
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
Welcome to Hollywood.

1041
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,570
Finally, finally!

1042
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,240
Oh!

1043
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,240
Marcus, you got four yeses.

1044
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,910
You guys for real? Oh, my god!

1045
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,310
Welcome to Hollywood, Marcus.

1046
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,080
Finally the dream has come true.

1047
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,120
Yes, I'm happy.

1048
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,950
Welcome to Hollywood.

1049
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,850
You got four yeses!

1050
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,720
- Hi, mom?  - Yeah?

1051
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,260
I made it to Hollywood.

1052
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,760
See you in Hollywood.

1053
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,270
Golden tickets were hard to come by...

1054
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,440
But the grand total for Chicago was a lucky number 13.

1055
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,740
I'm going to Hollywood!

1056
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,440
# go, Ryan #

1057
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,440
# go, Ryan #

1058
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,270
I'm going to Hollywood.

1059
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,110
Whoo!

1060
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,780
I'm the next American Idol!

1061
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,940
Whoo!

1062
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,450
Yes, we can!

1063
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,520
In all, 12,000 hopefuls descended upon us,

1064
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,420
and after two days of grueling auditions,

1065
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
We now say good-bye to the Windy City.

1066
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,790
We're out. That's it.

1067
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,630
- That's Chicago.  - That's it... Chicago.

1068
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,460
Nice to see you.

1069
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,290
Thanks for hanging with us.

1070
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,960
This was fun.

1071
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,900
And it's safe to say we walk away with Chicago's finest.

1072
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,730
And for the ones who made it...

1073
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,230
Yes, we can!

1074
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,900
Yes, they did.

1075
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,410
We're going to Hollywood!

1076
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,910
# when you wish #

1077
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,740
# upon a star #

1078
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,920
Tomorrow night we'll be coming to you

1079
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,980
From Orlando.

1080
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,450
But this ain't no sing-along.

1081
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,290
Welcome to New Orlando!

1082
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,950
American Idol, baby!

1083
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,620
This is where dreams can come true.

1084
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,180
Competition is fierce, as we continue our search for

1085
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,100
the most talented singers in America.

1086
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,460
- Brilliant.  - You're so genuine.

1087
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,470
Whose dreams will become reality?

1088
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,300
Yes!

1089
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,440
And who will come apart at the seams?

1090
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,770
- Ow!  - Ow.

1091
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,970
My pants feel ripped.

1092
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,270
You see me fighting for this show,

1093
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,970
and then you're gonna kick me out like that?

1094
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,310
You don't want to miss this.
