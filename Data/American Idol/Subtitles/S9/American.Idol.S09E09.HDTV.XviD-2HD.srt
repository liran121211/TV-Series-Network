1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
Tonight, the event you've been waiting for is finally here.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,600
I am gonna be the new judge on American Idol.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,410
As Ellen Degeneres takes her permanent place at the panel.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,310
You should put some shoes on.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,580
It's filthy here.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,350
Hollywood is a disgusting town.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,680
Together we commence Hollywood week.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,980
We're in Hollywood, baby!

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,250
100,000 came to us from every corner of the country.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,190
I'm a bartender.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,220
I'm a police officer.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm a receptionist, but I could be...

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,690
But I could be...

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,360
We could be...

15
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,430
the next American Idol!

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,900
and after our exhaustive

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,200
seven-city search, we discovered 181 of the nation's best.

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,270
Very, very nice.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,870
That was amazing.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,410
You could be the potential winner.

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,070
whoo!

22
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,240
But now the most difficult test of all.

23
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,780
I don't care about them.

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,910
Man.

25
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,150
They were such idiots.

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,750
I hated everything about that.

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,520
I did everything I could!

28
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,990
After this process, we'll be down to 12 guys and 12 girls.

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,990
This will no doubt be the toughest week of their lives,

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,730
because this is Hollywood week.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,200
And this is American Idol.

32
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,970
whoo!

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,770
It's 7:00 a.m. in California,

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,375
and the sun has risen on Day one of Hollywood week.

35
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,910
From around the country, 181 hopefuls have arrived...

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,380
Hollywood!

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,080
taking the first step towards the chance of a lifetime.

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,880
Oh, my god!

39
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,390
There's hundreds of people here, and I have to stand out.

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,550
Living the dream, baby.

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,760
I'm just ready to do what I got to do, and do my best.

42
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,860
whoo!

43
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,520
I can't even imagine how much it would change my life,

44
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:17,830
but I am so ready.

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,070
Here we go.

46
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,500
Adding to the pressure,

47
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,940
performing on the most high-profile stage in the world,

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,710
the Kodak Theatre.

49
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,640
As the hopefuls take their seats,

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,680
anxiously waiting for their shot...

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,510
I feel so nervous.

52
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm, like, shaking.

53
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,080
they're not the only ones about to start a new journey.

54
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,090
Please say hi to your new judge on American Idol,

55
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,290
Ellen Degeneres.

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,510
I... I don't know how you feel right now,

57
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,060
but I'll tell you one thing.

58
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,100
When people say, you know, "what do you know about music?"

59
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,170
I'll tell you what I do know.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,085
I do know what it's like to stand on stage

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,470
and try to please an entire room full of people.

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,480
That is a hard thing to do.

63
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,450
There's been a lot said about what kind of a judge

64
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,980
you will be on this show.

65
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,550
Uh, kind, generous, honest, but at the same time pretty direct,

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,990
and one of the few people, I think, that can be honest

67
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,190
with Simon about how he takes on the contestants.

68
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,860
Yes.

69
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,530
Is that your plan?

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,460
I wasn't listening.

72
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,130
Goodbye.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,170
I think she's gonna fit in just fine.

74
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,095
So our new team is assembled and

75
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,800
ready to start Hollywood week season nine.

76
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,140
so this is it, huh?

77
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,010
When I come on, you leave.

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,940
Let the games begin.

79
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,110
Knew you were gonna say that.

80
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,210
But for the contestants, this is no laughing matter.

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,320
Here's how this round will work.

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,965
Like in years past, the contestants will

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,550
come out on the stage in groups of eight.

84
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,820
They'll have a choice.

85
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,490
They can sing either a cappella,

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,590
or with an instrument.

87
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,590
And this round is sudden death.

88
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,930
That means you're either moving on...

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
You're through to the next round.

90
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,570
or heading straight home.

91
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,040
You didn't make it.

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,540
Are you ready, judges?

93
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,200
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,740
Stand by, stand by.

95
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,510
Let's go, guys.

96
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,310
Hollywood week starts right now.

97
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,475
In the first line, two familiar faces from

98
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,320
the road. Skiiboski from Atlanta, and Katie Stevens from Boston.

99
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,190
She shared her family's emotional struggle at her first audition.

100
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,890
I'm really close with my grandmother.

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,360
she has Alzheimer's.

102
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,060
She's probably not gonna remember me for much longer,

103
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:29,150
so I want her to see me succeed in my dream

104
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,660
before she forgets who I am.

105
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,390
But how will this 17-year-old deal

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
with the bright lights of Hollywood?

107
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,300
# for once in my life #

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,170
# I have someone who needs me #

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,980
# someone I've needed so long #

110
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,150
# for once unafraid #

111
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,220
# I can go where love leads me #

112
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,350
# somehow I know #

113
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,520
# I'll be strong #

114
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,420
# for once I can touch #

115
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,320
# what my heart #

116
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,390
# used to dream of #

117
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,630
# long before I knew #

118
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,030
# oh someone warm like you #

119
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,330
# would make #

120
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,540
# my dreams come true #

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,200
# yeah #

122
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,340
# for... #

123
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,070
Thank you.

124
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,840
Actually, you're quite good.

125
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,010
Yes!

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,710
I remember when we saw you the first time, and I said then,

127
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,550
"great natural talent".

128
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Thank you.

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,660
Next up, who could forget...

130
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,260
Skiiboski, baby.

131
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,490
Skiiboski, baby.

132
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,730
Skiiboski, baby.

133
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,700
You already know.

134
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
That's right, but will he

135
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,970
bring his swagger to Hollywood?

136
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,630
How you doing?

137
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,400
How you doing?

138
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,600
How you doing?

139
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,800
How you doing?

140
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,100
I'm all right.

141
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,010
What's your name?

142
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,540
Skiiboski.

143
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,740
Oh, yeah.

144
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,080
# I know #

145
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,980
# you want to leave me #

146
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,450
# but I refuse to let you go #

147
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,620
# if I have to beg, plead #

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,090
# for your sympathy #

149
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,520
# I don't mind #

150
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,650
# 'cause you mean #

151
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,860
# that much to me #

152
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,020
# ain't too proud to beg #

153
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,490
# sweet darling #

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,300
# please don't leave me girl #

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,230
All right, Skiibo... ski?

156
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,500
You frighten me.

157
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,900
You were... you were stalking us.

158
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,840
You were like a leopard behind the cage.

159
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,710
Looking... I was watching you.

160
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,270
Look at us like...

161
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,140
I'm gonna get you.

162
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,680
Looked like you were gonna get us.

163
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,710
- Standing in front of y'all, - I know. I know.

164
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,050
this is the American dream.

165
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,180
Of course, but seriously,

166
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,480
um, don't frighten your audience.

167
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,820
Don't... don't get so intense, you know?

168
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,190
Sexy and scary, it's a fine line.

169
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,120
Okay.

170
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,060
All right?

171
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,730
So...

172
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,900
anyway, thanks so much.

173
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,760
Thank you, Skiiboski.

174
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,560
Thank you.

175
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,600
Thank you, thank you.

176
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,030
Now the contestants have had a chance to sing in a group of eight.

177
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,840
The judges will compare notes and deliberate.

178
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,240
We had yes, yes, no, no.

179
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,295
They will then divide the group into two lines,

180
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,280
by asking certain people to step forward or back.

181
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,210
But only one of the lines will be going through.

182
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,920
The judges wrapping up their deliberation.

183
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,320
Now it's time for the verdict.

184
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,620
So who's in? Who's out?

185
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,850
Let's go.

186
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,830
Marcus and Christy, step forward,

187
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,230
and, Antonio, step forward.

188
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm sorry, guys.

189
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,670
You didn't make it, but thank you very much.

190
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,610
So Katie's in, but Skiiboski's out.

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,740
And while the winners celebrate...

192
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,410
Whoo!

193
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,680
looks like someone's not going down without a fight.

194
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,550
I just got to know,

195
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,280
what... what was it?

196
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,990
You're just not a very good singer.

197
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,820
You failed the audition.

198
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,220
It's time to go.

199
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,760
And my name is...

200
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,530
# Skiiboski #

201
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,960
# yeah #

202
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,960
I would change your name, to start.

203
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,830
Yeah.

204
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,970
So this season's Hollywood week is in full swing,

205
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,100
but we're only getting started.

206
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,670
Coming up, they blew the judges away at their first audition.

207
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,080
You got mad vocals, dude.

208
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,280
That was excellent.

209
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,180
When you are good, you're really good.

210
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,650
None of my friends is gonna believe this.

211
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,480
Whoo!

212
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,480
But what happens when they face the music at the Kodak?

213
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,320
Unbelievable.

214
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,820
Plus, some of the most amazing performances in Hollywood week history.

215
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,830
Genius.

216
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,390
It's 11:30 a.m. on day one of Hollywood week.

217
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,495
181 of the country's best singers have been invited to the

218
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,200
prestigious Kodak theatre for their one shot on center stage.

219
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,870
And for those waiting in the wings, the tension is mounting.

220
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,640
It's a big day.

221
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,170
And it's not helping that for the past hour,

222
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,810
Simon's been on the warpath.

223
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,840
I hated everything about that.

224
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,610
That was painful.

225
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,180
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

226
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,620
Oh, my god.

227
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,080
Think the front row or back row made it?

228
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,620
It's a good thing our new judge Ellen knows how to sugar coat.

229
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm tired as it is,

230
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,090
that almost put me right out.

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,460
It was crazy, I think.

232
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,260
um, in a bad way, crazy.

233
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,930
Where are you from?

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,600
Florida.

236
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,270
Okay.

237
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,800
You should put some shoes on here.

238
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,600
It's filthy here.

239
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,800
This is... Hollywood is a disgusting town.

240
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,970
Seems the comic relief is lightening the mood in the theater,

241
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:24,130
but for those about to take the stage,

242
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,680
it's not helping at all, including country girl Vanessa Wolfe.

243
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,120
Try and keep it cool.

244
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,625
And Andrew Garcia, the father who's here to

245
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,060
make a better life for his struggling family.

246
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,720
I love you.

247
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,990
I love you too, you know?

248
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,530
Today, he's about to take a huge risk.

249
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,460
I am singing Paula Abdul's "Straight up".

250
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:52,340
I've done my own little rendition, hopefully they like it.

251
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,810
# lost in a dream #

252
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,010
# don't know which #

253
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,950
# way to go #

254
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,350
# mm #

255
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,120
# if you are all that you seem #

256
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,920
# mm #

257
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,090
# then baby I'm moving #

258
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,460
# way too slow #

259
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,530
# oh #

260
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,530
# I been a fool before #

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,430
# wouldn't like to get my love #

262
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,870
# caught in the slamming door #

263
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,000
# how 'bout some #

264
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,670
# information please #

265
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,610
# oh #

266
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,070
# straight up now tell me #

267
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,610
# do you really want to love #

268
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,140
# me forever #

269
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,680
# oh #

270
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,980
# am I caught in a hit-and-run #

271
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,520
# straight up now tell me #

272
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,620
# is it gonna be #

273
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,690
# you and me forever #

274
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,460
# oh #

275
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,800
# are you just having fun #

276
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,030
Andrew,

277
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,710
that was genius.

278
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,370
Oh, thank you.

279
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,510
Genius.

280
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,340
Paula would be screaming and yelling and clapping and dancing.

281
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,010
Exactly, dude.

282
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,510
She would be doing this for you right now.

283
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,550
Like, dying, and...

284
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,750
Thank you.

285
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,480
You just owned that moment,

286
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,950
and interpreted something in a way...

287
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,070
similar to the way Adam did last season,

288
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:18,120
when he would take a song and flip it.

289
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,830
Thank you.

290
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,560
Great job.

291
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,860
Thank you so much.

292
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,360
That was ri... ridiculous.

293
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,665
And after hearing Andrew's rave reviews,

294
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,900
Vanessa's nerves are at a breaking point.

295
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,170
After all, she's a long way away from Vonore, Tennessee.

296
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,510
I don't really have a life.

297
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,340
Never goes to the movies or the mall or anything.

298
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,180
I'm stuck.

299
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,550
I can't get out.

300
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,850
But then one day in Atlanta, everything changed.

301
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,520
You stand out in the crowd for me, and I like you.

302
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,120
Welcome to Hollywood, Vanessa!

303
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,790
Ow!

304
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,460
Yeah!

305
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,720
Whoo!

306
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,560
Man, I'm going to Hollywood.

307
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,830
I'm gonna ride on a aeroplane.

308
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,030
What's life without a risk or two?

309
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,870
Ow.

310
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,630
Now she'll take another risk,

311
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,040
leaving everything she knows behind.

312
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,200
first day in the rest of your life, girl.

313
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,810
# ooh #
# ooh #

314
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,040
Bye.

315
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,910
I just can't hardly take this.

316
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,150
Having never left home before, it's all a new experience for Vanessa.

317
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,590
So fancy.

318
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
I cannot believe this is happening.

319
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,190
# ooh #
# ooh #

320
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,230
This is a chance to make something of myself.

321
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,160
Just a big, nervous moment.

322
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,330
This is the moment.

323
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
Here they come.

324
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,340
Hi.

325
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,100
Hello, my name is Vanessa Jo Wolfe.

326
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,770
In the mic.

327
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Microphone.

328
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,110
Oh, yeah.

329
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,770
Hello.

330
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,580
# all I can say #

331
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,910
# is that my life #

332
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,680
# is pretty plain #

333
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,850
# I like watching the puddles #

334
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,050
# gather rain #

335
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,550
# and all I can do #

336
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,590
# is just pour some tea #

337
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,820
# for two #

338
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,790
# and speak my point of view #

339
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,030
# but it's not sane #

340
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,260
Thank you.

341
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,900
You're unique.

342
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,370
I think you have a unique quality that you should embrace,

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,810
and just really just accept who you are.

344
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,705
You're... you're hiding inside and scared to death,

345
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,810
and you got to let go of that, 'cause those nerves are gonna kill ya.

346
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,480
Thanks.

347
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,050
Now it's judgment time for this line.

348
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,720
Oh, no.

349
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,380
I liked her.

350
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,590
Which also includes worship pastor, Tasha Layton.

351
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,260
Yes, yes.

352
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,620
No, yes.

353
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,430
The tension is palpable.

354
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,065
Everyone on pins and needles,

355
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,560
waiting to find out what is in their future.

356
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,830
Debbie, stage manager giving the cue to go.

357
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,940
Andrew, step forward.

358
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,380
With Andrew stepping forward,

359
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,510
Vanessa can only hope her name is called next.

360
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,420
Front row...

361
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,720
Congratulations.

362
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,650
We'll see you tomorrow.

363
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,250
You made it through to the next round.

364
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,060
Back row, end of the line.

365
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,060
Thank you.

366
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,105
Andrew moves on,

367
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,900
but we say good-bye to the country girl who stole our hearts.

368
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,830
My family's gonna be disappointed, but...

369
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,870
you know, I just... I blew it.

370
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm sorry, mom.

371
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,915
And as morning turned to afternoon,

372
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,510
plenty more came so far to have their dreams cut short.

373
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,310
You've got a frustrated look on your face.

374
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,380
I think they made a mistake.

375
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,040
Yeah?

376
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,550
I think they made a mistake.

377
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,380
# but that's not #

378
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,610
# what gets me #

379
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
Sorry, guys.

380
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,990
# what hurts the most #

381
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,920
# was being so close #

382
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,020
Come on, sweetheart.

383
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,160
Let's go.

384
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,360
Let's go back home.

385
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,930
# watching you walk away #

386
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,170
# and never knowing #

387
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,140
This was the ticket to get out of Vonore.

388
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,540
I took a risk, and it... it didn't pay off.

389
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,840
# is what I #

390
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,250
# was trying to do #

391
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,090
When we return, more incredible performances on center stage.

392
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,190
You're really a great singer.

393
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,230
Who will survive the wrath of the judges?

394
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,130
That was painful.

395
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,660
Stay tuned.

396
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,530
You never know what might happen during Hollywood week.

397
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,240
I hated everything about that.

398
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,620
It's 3:30 p.m. on day one of Hollywood week.

399
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,635
And back inside the Kodak Theatre,

400
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,730
things are not so picture perfect for some memorable faces from the early auditions.

401
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:47,230
Like Cornelius Edwards,

402
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,200
whose pants-splitting performance in Orlando seemed to be his only asset.

403
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,570
# cowgirl, take me away #

404
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,880
Cornelius, why did you choose that song?

405
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,720
And Maegan Wright, whose little brother was a huge support in Dallas.

406
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,720
I really want her to be the next American Idol.

407
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,460
# and I wonder #

408
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,790
# whose loving you #

409
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,530
It was a little all over the place.

410
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,060
Okay.

411
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,100
It's heart-breaking to have to go home.

412
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,600
It really is.

413
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,570
It meant everything to me.

414
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,095
And who could forget Amadeo Diricco,

415
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,050
who charmed America with his big family and even bigger personality?

416
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,850
But in Hollywood, he failed to find his voice.

417
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,720
# 'cause this #

418
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,180
# fine old world #

419
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,520
# it keeps spinning around #

420
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,890
That was not good.

421
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,390
I came here to be the best me I can be.

422
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,890
I ask you for another chance.

423
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm begging you.

424
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,030
Please.

425
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,295
Amadeo, you shouldn't be begging,

426
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,100
'cause you're not gonna get a second chance.

427
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,500
Seriously.

428
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,230
I really thought that this was my chance, and I didn't want

429
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,070
to just walk away from it.

430
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,670
I figured let me ask.

431
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,410
Can't hurt to ask.

432
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,580
But Orlando's Janell Wheeler hopes she'll stick around here for a little longer.

433
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,610
I cannot go home.

434
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,910
I want to be here so bad.

435
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,620
I want to be the next American Idol so bad.

436
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,390
# he said #

437
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,690
# hey sister #

438
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,030
# it's really, really nice #

439
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,360
# to meet you #

440
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,600
# I just met this #

441
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,030
# five foot seven #

442
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,600
# guy who's just my type #

443
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,000
# like the way he's speaking #

444
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,770
# his confidence is peaking #

445
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,740
# don't like his baggy jeans #

446
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,040
# but I might like #

447
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,780
# what's underneath them #

448
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,010
# no I've never been to M.I.A. #

449
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,680
# I heard... #

450
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,220
That was amazing.

451
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Amazing.

452
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,850
I loved it.

453
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,390
Yeah, that was a good audition.

454
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,050
Well done.

455
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,720
Thank you so much.

456
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,830
So Janell was an easy yes, and off to the next round.

457
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,315
But as the day continued,

458
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,730
others failed to strike a chord with their instruments.

459
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,340
Maybe learn how to play the guitar.

460
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,100
# people keep talking #

461
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,270
# talking 'bout people #

462
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,740
I hated everything about that performance.

463
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,450
# I seen a rainbow #

464
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,710
# yesterday #

465
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,950
# too many storms come and go #

466
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,780
# leave a trace #

467
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,650
# of not one god-given ray #

468
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
# clear unconditional skies #

469
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,490
# dry tears from my eyes #

470
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,650
# no lonely cries #

471
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,120
Thank you.

472
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,860
Can I be honest with you?

473
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,590
That was painful.

474
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,630
# sweet love #

475
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,400
# don't you ever go away #

476
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,130
Bossa will be appearing nightly at the Holiday Inn,

477
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,740
Columbus, on Highway 52.

478
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,710
And after seeing so many people crash and burn with their

479
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,550
instruments, 16-year-old Hayley Vaughn starts to second-guess herself.

480
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,650
Hopefully I can perform well,

481
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,245
and the nerves will leave me somewhere along as

482
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,490
I'm walking up to sing, 'cause I'm pretty nervous, and I'm totally scared.

483
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,060
But she shouldn't be, after the high praise she received in Denver.

484
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,060
Million percent yes.

485
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,200
I love this girl.

486
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,870
Now, armed with her guitar,

487
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,970
can she have the same impact?

488
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,000
# it's a revolution #

489
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,940
# throw your hands up #

490
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,780
# 'cause we never gave in #

491
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,420
# we'll sing Hallelujah #

492
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,220
# we'll sing Hallelujah #

493
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,490
# Hallelujah #

494
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,200
# oh #

495
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,430
# yeah #

496
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Yo.

497
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,840
I actually kind of like it.

498
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,670
It's very interesting to me.

499
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,370
Kind of a pop-country girl.

500
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,240
16. Interesting.

501
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,740
Thank you.

502
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,920
Also in this line, someone who's on the other end of the age range,

503
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,320
28-year-old rocker mom, Mary Powers.

504
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,750
Hello.

505
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,420
At her L.A. audition, she not only brought her voice...

506
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,390
Rock it, girl.

507
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,520
but also her biggest fan.

508
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,460
Are you sure this isn't my daughter?

509
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,760
# I'm safe up high #

510
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,760
# nothing can touch me #

511
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,100
# and why do I feel #

512
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,740
# this party's over #

513
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,270
# no pain inside #

514
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,170
# you're like perfection #

515
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
# and how do I feel this good #

516
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,780
# sober #

517
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,820
You have an amazing voice, and you were very in that song.

518
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,920
Really good.

519
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,420
Thank you.

520
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,460
Now it's the moment of truth for the country girl and the rocker.

521
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,230
I think she's gonna get annoying.

522
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,100
I like her better than her.

523
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,870
All right.

524
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,040
Stephanie, step forward.

525
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,840
Kiera, step forward.

526
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,740
Front row, it's the end of the line.

527
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,480
Sorry, you didn't make it.

528
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,820
Back row, you're through to the next round.

529
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,350
It's an emotional victory for both ladies.

530
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,950
I'm so proud of you.

531
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,460
You did so good.

532
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,090
Thank you.

533
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,630
My whole life, my family's life, everything, is gonna change.

534
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,270
And it's... it's... it's amazing.

535
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,770
Oh!

536
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,200
We'll check back in with them on group day.

537
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,910
And back on stage, the final results of the day.

538
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,950
Maddy, step forward.

539
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,780
Claire, step forward.

540
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,620
I'm sorry.

541
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,820
Claire, step back.

542
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,250
Danny, step forward.

543
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,660
Tori, step forward.

544
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,590
Now, Maddy, step back.

545
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,000
Danny, step to your left a little bit.

546
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,970
Claire, step forward.

547
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,700
And then step back real quick.

548
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,500
You're all going through.

549
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,900
That was funny.

550
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,670
You sadist.

551
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,440
Congratulations, you're through.

552
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,210
# move on up #

553
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,680
And among those moving on up, Todrick Hall from Dallas...

554
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,650
Charity Vance from Chicago.

555
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,320
I know.

556
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,980
I'm, like, shaking.

557
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm so excited, I can't believe it.

558
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,960
# so keep on pushing #

559
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,190
And Boston native, Ashley Rodriguez.

560
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,830
I'm staying another day.

561
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,830
Aah!

562
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,500
# move on up #

563
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,670
whoo!

564
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,400
# move on up #

565
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,740
46 contestants have made it through.

566
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,910
At the end of day one in Hollywood...

567
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,870
That's a wrap everybody.

568
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,540
We're out.

569
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,380
Tomorrow we come back and do it all over again.

570
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,480
We start from scratch with new contestants after the break.

571
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,280
Have a good night. Bye.

572
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,550
# we made it #

573
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,780
# we made it #

574
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,450
# ooh, ooh #

575
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,225
After the break, it's day two of Hollywood week,

576
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,490
and that means a whole new crop of the nation's best hit the spotlight.

577
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,330
This could be the most important day of your life.

578
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,300
There's no turning back.

579
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,660
Who survives?

580
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,560
You have conviction.

581
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,200
And who sees their demise?

582
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,230
That was ridiculous.

583
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,430
It's day two of Hollywood week at the world-famous Kodak Theater.

584
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,665
Yesterday, half the contestants took the stage

585
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,540
for their all-important shot in front of the judges.

586
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,700
Safe to say it was a brutal day.

587
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:29,999
Horrible song choice.

588
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,092
Horrible performance.

589
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:32,042
Just didn't get it.

590
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:33,225
It was very karaoke.

591
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:34,352
It was weird for me.

592
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:35,178
I don't know.

593
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,696
It was really, really... dull.

594
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,305
- Did you like it? - Uh, I loved it.

595
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,317
But today is a fresh start for a new batch of contestants.

596
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,830
As the judges settle in, Simon has some inspirational words.

597
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,200
This could be, arguably, the most important day of your life.

598
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,630
Don't be nervous.

599
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,170
Don't be boring.

600
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,710
And don't forget the words.

601
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,880
After Simon's warning, everyone's on edge.

602
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,010
There's no turning back.

603
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,910
Your whole future.

604
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,810
this is it.

605
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,945
And as the first line takes the stage,

606
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,910
Jay Stone is confident because he knows being boring

607
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,470
is the last thing he has to worry about.

608
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Jay, Jay, that was ridiculous.

609
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,900
Something's wrong with his microphone.

610
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,930
That is...

611
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,270
Next up is Lilly Scott,

612
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,500
a 20-year-old sandwich maker who caught the judges' eye back in Denver.

613
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,340
Okay, Lilly, you got four yeses, darling... well done.

614
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,110
Thank you so much, guys!

615
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,795
Since arriving here in Hollywood,

616
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,980
Lilly's been anxiously awaiting her moment in the spotlight.

617
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,980
I want to show everybody that I have what it takes.

618
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,380
It can happen in Hollywood.

619
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,050
Totally, it can happen here.

620
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,560
What's goin' on?

621
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,290
I'm doing, uh, Lullaby of Birdland by Ella Fitzgerald.

622
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,060
# guitar playing #

623
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,060
# have you ever heard #

624
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,800
# two turtle doves #

625
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,370
# bill and coo #

626
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,740
# when they love #

627
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,940
# that's the kind of #

628
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,740
# magic music we make #

629
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,680
# with our lips #

630
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,410
# oh, when we kiss #

631
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,850
# and there's a weepy #

632
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,080
# old willow #

633
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,290
# baby, he really knows #

634
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,920
# how to cry #

635
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,090
# well, that's how I'd cry #

636
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,660
# in my pillow #

637
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,860
# if you should tell me #

638
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,100
# farewell and good-bye #

639
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,730
# la la #

640
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,710
Well, Lilly, everything about you is refreshing.

641
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,110
I really liked you.

642
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,980
You're unique.

643
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,110
You did your own thing.

644
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,110
Very good.

645
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,410
Thank you so much.

646
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,610
Thank you.

647
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,255
So what do you wanna do?

648
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,690
So what do you wanna do?

649
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,790
- Do you have a yes for him? - I have a maybe for him.

650
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,590
Okay, Sam, can you step forward, please?

651
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,330
Lilly.

652
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,760
You're the ones who've made it.

653
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,130
Congratulations.

654
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,870
So Lilly has reason to celebrate.

655
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,110
but for Jay, it wasn't the news he wanted to hear.

656
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,840
# p-ah-p-ah-p-p #

657
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,180
# peace out #

658
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,231
And outside in the lobby,

659
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:27,880
expectant father big Mike just got some huge news of his own.

660
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,750
how are you feeling?

661
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:34,990
All right.

662
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,090
This morning, I got a call from my wife.

663
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,930
She told me that she's starting to feel contractions.

664
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,200
She thinks she's going into labor.

665
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,670
Of course I want to be there.

666
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,700
It's my first child.

667
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,030
But I got a long week, and my wife wants me to succeed right now,

668
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,140
so... I gotta do it.

669
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,810
Michael Lynch has got a lot on his mind.

670
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,250
His wife could be having their first child any moment.

671
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,980
And he's gotta knock it out of the park here.

672
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,150
Let's see what he does.

673
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,538
I'm the next American Idol

674
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,420
because my wife is in labor right now with our first child.

675
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,829
And she wouldn't be happy

676
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,250
if I didn't come home with a victory this week,

677
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:08,660
- so... - That's big.

678
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,960
and also, I'll pummel anybody who disagrees.

679
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,870
# me and all my friends #

680
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,300
# we're all misunderstood #

681
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,800
# they say we stand #

682
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,040
# for nothing #

683
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,210
# and there's no way #

684
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,540
# we ever could #

685
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,540
# and now we see #

686
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,680
# everything has gone wrong #

687
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,540
# with the world #

688
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,380
# and those who lead it #

689
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,750
# just feel like we #

690
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,150
# don't have the means #

691
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,650
# to rise above and beat it #

692
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,020
# that's why we're waiting #

693
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,290
# yeah #

694
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,290
# ah, waiting #

695
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,460
# on the world to change #

696
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,790
# that's why we're waiting #

697
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,230
# waiting #

698
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,760
- # ah, waiting on the # - Thank you.

699
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,460
# yeah, yeah #

700
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,400
I thought that was good.

701
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,640
It was a good choice of song.

702
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,500
It was a good arrangement.

703
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,900
It was different.

704
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,110
Thank you.

705
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,410
Michael...

706
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,880
It's a good day.

707
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,180
So Michael and baby are on board for group day.

708
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,750
We'll check back tomorrow to see how it all plays out.

709
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,345
We have a lot more coming your way...

710
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,290
great performances and some dramatic cuts.

711
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,290
Stay with us.

712
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,520
More from Hollywood after the break.

713
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,351
Coming up, they shared their incredible stories

714
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:19,760
with the nation at their first audition.

715
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,230
When I step out on stage,

716
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,440
I'll just be thinking of how much I want to do my best for my family.

717
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,440
I was in a motorcycle accident.

718
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,440
The doctor said that I would never play guitar again.

719
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,280
I think it's a miracle that things happened the way that they did.

720
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,150
But what happens when Maddy and Casey hit the stage?

721
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,350
Casey, step forward.

722
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,800
Welcome back to day two of Hollywood week.

723
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,900
It's 4:00 p.m., and performances are in full swing.

724
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,810
Back stage is Justin Williams,

725
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,670
the cancer survivor we met in Boston.

726
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,880
# you know how I feel #

727
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,810
Thank you.

728
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,550
You know, I am gonna remember you.

729
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,550
Also waiting in the wings is Tim Irvin,

730
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:17,320
who had a shakier start in Dallas.

731
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,130
# so what happened to #

732
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,460
# bulletproof weeks #

733
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,260
# in your arms #

734
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,760
# and what happened #

735
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,840
# to feeling cheap radio songs #

736
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,840
Okay. Simon,

737
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,270
what do you think?

738
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,110
I think it was, uh...

739
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,340
probably not the best song choice in the world.

740
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,110
Yeah.

741
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,710
But I think there's more to come out of you, Tim.

742
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,350
I'm gonna give you another shot.

743
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,350
Now both guys take the stage.

744
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
First up is Tim.

745
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,150
Can he prove to Simon he was worth a second chance?

746
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,150
How y'all doing?

747
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,860
I will be singing David Cook's song, "Come back to me".

748
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,860
# you say you gotta #

749
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,270
# go and find yourself #

750
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,730
# you say that you're #

751
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,470
# becoming someone else #

752
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,770
He's got a good voice.

753
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,140
# to recognize the face #

754
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,210
# in the mirror #

755
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,410
# looking back at you #

756
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,520
# and so I let you go #

757
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,350
# I set you free #

758
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,650
# and when you see #

759
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,260
# what you need to see #

760
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,890
# when you find you #

761
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,100
# come back to me #

762
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,560
Thank you, Tim.

763
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,800
The chorus got a little shaky there, but other than that,

764
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,240
pretty good.

765
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,600
Thank you.

766
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,770
He's so serious, though.

767
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,080
Now it's Justin's turn.

768
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,780
Can this crooner continue to impress?

769
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,410
# fly #

770
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,690
# oh oh oh fly #

771
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,820
# in other words #

772
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,930
# I love #

773
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,330
# you #

774
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,770
# yeah, yeah, yeah #

775
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,400
- Thank you very much. - Yeah. It's a...

776
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,340
Thank you.

777
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,510
Jeez! It's crazy.

778
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,550
Uh, you know, definitely interesting.

779
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,020
Um... interesting.

780
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,950
That's all I'll say.

781
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,650
Thank you.

782
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,190
Thank you.

783
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Decision time has come.

784
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:38,430
Justin, step forward.

785
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,970
back row...

786
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,340
welcome to the next round.

787
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,670
front row, you're going home.

788
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,340
So Tim moves on, while the journey ends here for Justin.

789
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,915
and as the sun began to set,

790
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,750
we had to say good-bye to more of the friends we made on the road.

791
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,450
like Paige Dechausse.

792
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,990
You just were all over the place.

793
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,720
It kind of didn't work that well.

794
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,260
And Erica Rhodes.

795
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,830
I think you have some work to do on your vocals.

796
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,730
I said I wasn't gonna cry.

797
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,000
um...

798
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,030
I know my folks would still be proud.

799
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,670
Jersey sisters Amanda and Bernadette were doubly convincing in Orlando.

800
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,500
Hollywood needs us, right?

801
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,500
The show needs us.

802
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,840
But, individually, they weren't able to deliver.

803
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,980
That was really strange for me.

804
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm sorry, I just, uh, was not a fan of that.

805
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,880
They're my American Idols.

806
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,650
That's good. Thanks, Mom.

807
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
Thank you.

808
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,420
And back on stage is someone else who knows a lot about family support.

809
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,690
Hi, my name's Maddy Curtis.

810
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,280
We first met the 17-year-old in boston,

811
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,400
where she introduced us to her four brothers.

812
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,630
I think some people are a little skeptical of Down Syndrome.

813
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,900
Those four boys bring out the best in every person they meet.

814
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,485
When I step out on stage,

815
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,040
I'll just be thinking of how much I want to go out there and do my best for my family.

816
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,310
I like Maddy, dude.

817
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,210
I like Maddy too.

818
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,780
Welcome to Hollywood!

819
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,610
Well done, baby.

820
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,850
Thank you.

821
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,020
# when you're in my arms #

822
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,930
# I need no soft lights #

823
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,830
# if you'll only grant me #

824
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,070
# the right to hold you #

825
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,580
# ever so tight #

826
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,180
Thank you.

827
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,220
That was certainly the wrong song for you, Maddy.

828
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,220
Yeh.

829
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,020
Definitely, definitely, definitely.

830
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,090
All right.

831
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,420
Hopefully, I can do better next time?

832
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,090
We'll have to wait and see.

833
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,090
Thank you.

834
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,790
Thank you.

835
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
Next to take the stage is Casey James.

836
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,270
In Denver, he bared it all for Kara.

837
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,640
Personally, I say yes.

838
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,570
But that wasn't the only thing Casey wanted to expose us to.

839
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,230
My goal in this thing is to make it this the next round

840
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
so that I can really show you guys what's... what I do.

841
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,150
And what he does is play blues guitar.

842
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,120
# well, the doctor says #

843
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,280
# I need rest #

844
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,690
# all I need is her tenderness #

845
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,120
# put me on the critical list #

846
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,320
# when all I need #

847
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,920
# is her sweet kiss #

848
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,030
# he gave me #

849
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,660
# a medicated lotion #

850
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,760
# but it didn't soothe #

851
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,530
# my emotion #

852
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,740
# I don't need no doctor #

853
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,940
# comin' down with a misery #

854
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,340
Thanks, Casey.

855
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,280
Thanks, y'all.

856
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,080
Yo, dude, I actually loved that, and I loved the guitar playing.

857
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,920
It was really dope.

858
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,880
You really are a real singer-songwriter.

859
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,490
Thank you so much, man.

860
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,620
Now it's judgment time.

861
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,060
But if we don't, we're only gonna send two people home.

862
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,730
Okay, yeah, uh...

863
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Casey, I had a...hmm.

864
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,770
Thank you, guys, all of you,

865
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,870
for coming and showing us what you got.

866
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,840
Casey, step forward.

867
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,120
Yes! Yeah!

868
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,890
Yeah!

869
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,330
So Casey moves on.

870
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,730
But the road ends here for Maddy Curtis.

871
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,215
Much like her Mom,

872
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,280
the judges must have thought Maddy simply wasn't ready yet.

873
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,880
After the break, it's the biggest moment in the lives of a waitress...

874
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,850
My heart is, like, beating out of my chest right now.

875
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,490
And a single Mom.

876
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
I'm doing this because I love my son.

877
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,530
He's the reason I'm gonna be the next American Idol.

878
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,830
Give him a better life.

879
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,670
But it's what they deliver onstage that will blow you away.

880
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,240
Wow, your voice is amazing.

881
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,010
It's 7:30 p.m. on day two of

882
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,755
Hollywood week, and over the past two days,

883
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,190
the stage of the Kodak Theatre has been riddled with drama.

884
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,490
You just failed the audition.

885
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,320
It's time to go.

886
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,260
to go, to go...

887
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,310
But the first round is nearly over,

888
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,500
and waiting in the wings is the last line of the day.

889
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
No turning back now.

890
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,800
Head out, go ahead, jump on the red marks, and good luck.

891
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,370
This is it.

892
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,480
In it, an emotionally fragile Didi Benimi, a waitress we met in L.A.

893
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,790
My heart is, like, beating out of my chest right now,

894
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,580
but I'm really excited that I did that.

895
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,250
You're going to Hollywood.

896
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,250
Welcome to hollywood, Didi!

897
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,050
But can she hold it together now that the pressure has doubled?

898
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,390
I'm gonna be singing Terrified by Kara Dioguardi.

899
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,820
And, heh... I've been working real hard at this,

900
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,830
and I think it's my time.

901
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,430
- Got it. - Yep.

902
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,900
# you by the light #

903
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,210
# is the greatest find #

904
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,910
# in a world full of wrong #

905
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,250
# you're the thing #

906
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,410
# that's right #

907
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,080
# finally made it #

908
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,920
# through the lonely #

909
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,920
# to the other side #

910
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,160
# you said it again #

911
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,460
# my heart's in motion #

912
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,860
# every word feels #

913
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,760
# like a shooting star #

914
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,830
# I'm at the edge #

915
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,300
# of my emotions #

916
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,340
# watching the shadows #

917
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,100
# burning in the dark #

918
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,380
# and I, I, I'm in love #

919
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,650
# and I, I, I'm terrified #

920
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,680
# for the first time #

921
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,420
# and the last time #

922
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,650
# in my only #

923
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,330
# life #

924
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
Thank you.

925
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,540
I hate to admit it, but I really liked that song.

926
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,222
- Really? You're lying. - I did, really.

927
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:26,010
I did too, I really...

928
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,740
Yeah, it sounded really current.

929
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,110
You're a waitress, right?

930
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,110
Yes.

931
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,309
I like the idea, somebody like you, waitress

932
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,580
of coming on a show like this, doing well.

933
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,180
That's what it's all about.

934
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,220
I thought that was terrific.

935
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,820
Thank you.

936
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,320
I think she's good.

937
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,420
I like that.

938
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,560
Also in this line is Chicago's Crystal Bowersox,

939
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,830
a single mom who's looking to make a permanent change in her life.

940
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,130
I am about to get a tattoo.

941
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,270
I'm really hoping that it's gonna be good luck.

942
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,640
Actually, I know it's gonna be good luck.

943
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,900
Here we go.

944
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:03,440
I'm doing this because I love my son, and I want his name on my back forever.

945
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,380
Look at this guy.

946
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,580
Look at that guy.

947
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,050
I can't be with him right now,

948
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,850
and I really, really miss him.

949
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,620
# Before the day I met you #

950
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,490
He's the reason I'm gonna be the next American Idol.

951
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,020
Give him a better life.

952
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,390
He deserves it.

953
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,130
# to my piece of mind #

954
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,930
# and you make me feel #

955
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,270
# you make me feel #

956
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,370
# you make me feel #

957
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,510
# like a natural woman #

958
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,410
# yeah #

959
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,310
# whoa, my baby #

960
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
# what you've done to me #

961
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,710
# done to me #

962
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,580
# mm, you make me feel #

963
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,150
# so good inside #

964
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,090
# good inside #

965
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,490
# oh, and I just wanna be #

966
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,760
# wanna be #

967
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,890
# close to you #

968
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,890
# 'cause you make me feel #

969
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,760
# so alive #

970
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,900
# you make me feel #

971
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,000
# you make me feel #

972
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,000
# you make me feel #

973
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,870
# like a natural #

974
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,310
# woman #

975
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,910
# you make me feel, honey #

976
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,310
Thank you.

977
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,150
I think what you have is that you're infectious.

978
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,090
People like you.

979
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,190
So you have a head start.

980
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,990
Uh, and you're real.

981
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,990
That was good.

982
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,930
Thank you.

983
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,430
You got mad love from your peeps over here singing background.

984
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,970
And now it's time for Crystal and Didi to hear the verdict.

985
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,770
Crystal, step forward.

986
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,680
Didi, step forward.

987
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,680
Front row, you're going through.

988
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,320
Back row, I'm so sorry.

989
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,420
So the single mother and the waitress are through.

990
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,620
Round one ends on a high.

991
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,530
I don't even know what to say, honestly.

992
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm at a loss for words.

993
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,430
Well, 85 others will have plenty to say.

994
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,970
You're through to the next round.

995
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,170
Because this group still has something to believe in.

996
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,310
She made it too!

997
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,580
You're the ones who've made it... congratulations.

998
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,660
I'm just very grateful to have another day to try and get my... together.

999
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
What?

1000
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,830
I think I might have just gotten an American Idol sign on my mouth,

1001
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:35,730
and I'm very sorry about that, America.

1002
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,970
- That is a wrap. - That is a wrap.

1003
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,010
I made it. I made it.

1004
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,950
I love you, daddy.

1005
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,620
Tomorrow night will be the ultimate test for the contestants

1006
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:59,300
who have survived the first cut.

1007
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,070
It doesn't look great.

1008
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,740
It doesn't feel good.

1009
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,770
Do you not want us to be in the group?

1010
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,340
Some will be victorious.

1011
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
And others devastated.

1012
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,350
You don't know what you're doing.

1013
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,000
- That was a disaster. - Don't take anything for granted.

1014
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,900
This is it for me.

1015
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,130
Don't beg, it's not cool.

1016
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,532
Because this is group round.

1017
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:18,221
They stoled our idea...

1018
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,814
And the results will shock you.

1019
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:22,464
Don't panic.
