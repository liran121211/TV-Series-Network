1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,690
Tonight it's the final road show before Hollywood week.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,700
Four yeses.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,160
Dude, you're through to Hollywood!

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,500
And we are saving the best for last.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,440
Lee, through to the next round.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,440
Welcome to Hollywood, Lee!

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,540
More incredible moments and unbelievable voices.

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,940
I like you.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,980
Yeah, you're cute.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,950
Get ready for more outstanding new talent.

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,220
One of the best 16-year-olds I've ever heard.

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,820
You're definitely one of my favorites.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,650
Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,750
As our biggest audition tour come to a climax.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,450
The longest of journeys starts with the smallest of steps.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,490
This year into the most famous arena in the history of television

17
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,460
have walked some of the most talented people we have ever seen.

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,530
And what does everyone remember?

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,370
# pants on the ground #

20
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,770
# pants on the ground #

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
# lookin' like a fool #

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,470
# with your pants #

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,140
# on the ground #

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,770
# with the gold in your mouth #

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,510
"General" Larry Platt singing "Pants On The Ground".

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,110
# call yourself a cool cat #

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,380
# lookin' like a fool #

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,310
# walking downtown #

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,010
# with your pants #

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,680
# on the ground #

31
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,480
# get it up #

32
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,720
We knew it was gonna be popular...

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,290
You know, I have a horrible feeling that song could be a hit.

34
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,590
Yeah.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,520
But even we were surprised at just how influential it turned out to be.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,630
# pants on the ground #

37
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,460
# pants on the ground #

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,330
# lookin' like a fool with #

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,730
# your pants on the ground #

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
It's in your homes.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,070
# pants on the ground #

42
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,970
# pants on the ground #

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,940
It's in our colleges.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,240
# pants on the ground #

45
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,410
# pants on the ground #

46
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,540
It's even entered the political debate.

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,740
# pants on the ground #

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,640
# pants on the ground #

49
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,740
# looking like a fool with #

50
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,580
# the pants on the ground #

51
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,580
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

52
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,400
It's not exactly "Bohemian Rhapsody", but it is a number that stays with you.

53
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,415
And on this year's road, the contestants found

54
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,260
that picking that one special song was as crucial as ever.

55
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,730
Nobody should sing that song.

56
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,760
I didn't even know what song that was, man.

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,100
I think of all the songs in the world you could have sung,

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,730
that wouldn't have been in my top million.

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,670
Wow.

60
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,380
Returning Denver contestant Jessica Furney had

61
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,810
an interesting take with her song choice.

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,240
Back in season eight, she went with a "Joplin Track".

63
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,610
# honey, I know that she #

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,380
# told you she loved you #

65
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,050
# much more than I #

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,750
But one year and one makeover later...

67
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,450
Thank you very much.

68
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,320
She thought she'd stand out by singing a song co-written by you know who.

69
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,120
What are you gonna sing?

70
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,960
Um, I'm gonna sing "Footprints In The Sand".

71
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,230
Oh, that's a Simon co-write.

72
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,890
It is.

73
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,700
Wow.

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm not doing it just to suck up.

75
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,860
I promise.

76
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,870
You wrote this song?

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,530
Co-wrote.

78
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,670
You co-wrote it.

79
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,330
Wow.

80
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,340
Jack of all trades.

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,970
- Anyway, it's a beautiful song, so good luck.

82
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,210
It's one of the greatest songs ever written.

83
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,780
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,340
# I promise you #

85
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,940
# I'm always there #

86
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,280
# when your heart is filled #

87
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,350
# with sorrow and despair #

88
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,190
# I will carry you #

89
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,220
# when you need a friend #

90
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,530
# you'll find my footprints #

91
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,700
# in the sand #

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,360
Beautiful song.

93
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,030
Nice song.

94
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,700
Wow.

95
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,330
Have you written any more songs?

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

97
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,900
Why?

98
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,240
You're embarrassing me.

99
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,170
I had no idea he was a songwriter.

100
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes, uh, can we get back to our contestant here?

101
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,140
What are we doing?

102
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,810
We got to vote.

103
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,480
Randy?
Randy?

104
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,210
I'm gonna say yes.

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,850
I think you definitely improved.

106
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,520
Thank you.

107
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,750
Kara?

108
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm gonna say yes.

109
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,490
And I'm gonna say yes too.

110
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,220
You've got a full house, Jessica.

111
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,890
Wow, well done.

112
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,560
Thank you so much.

113
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,220
See you later, guys.

114
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,060
Bye, sweetheart.

115
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,730
Whoo-hoo.

116
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,260
Jessica's risk paid off.

117
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,940
But as you'll see, making it all the way down the road

118
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:10,630
to hollywood takes more than just guts.

119
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,270
It takes ambition.

120
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,170
Singing is what I love to do, man.

121
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,010
Please, listen to me.

122
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,040
Perseverance.

123
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,570
This is my seventh time.

124
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,280
And of course a great voice.

125
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,180
# somewhere #

126
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,490
# over the rainbow #

127
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,990
Stay with us for more

128
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,860
incredible unseen talent, as we save the best for last.

129
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,960
# oh, I told you so #

130
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,570
In this hour, we may just meet the next American Idol.

131
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,370
# there'll come a day #

132
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,670
# when you walk out #

133
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,840
# of my dreams #

134
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,640
# face to face #

135
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,040
Or maybe not.

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,900
The road to hollywood is paved with attention-seekers,

137
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,070
and understandably so.

138
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,365
With thousands of people to compete against,

139
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,600
it is vital to stand out from the crowd.

140
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,710
In Boston, Amanda Shechtman showed me how to grab attention.

141
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,240
Act out.

142
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,760
# I think I did it again #

143
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,200
# I made you believe #

144
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,930
# we're more than just friends #

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,670
Okay, now do Lil Wayne.

146
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,040
I do all kinds of, like, voices,

147
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,810
and I can talk with my mouth closed.

148
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,510
This is me talking with my mouth closed.

149
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,470
Part of my journey is hopefully finding that

150
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,850
really special thing that I can do.

151
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,230
I just want my true, true voice to shine through,

152
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,560
And I'm pretty confident it will.

153
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,290
# wish I'd forget you #

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
# but you are here to stay #

155
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,030
# seems I met you #

156
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,940
# when my love went away #

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,010
# now every day I start by #

158
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,680
# saying to you #

159
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,640
# good morning heartache #

160
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,650
# what's new #

161
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,680
Okay.

162
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,250
Good.

163
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,020
Hmm.

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,520
I think you need to work on your expression.

165
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,150
Definitely.

166
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,050
Yeah.

167
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,190
I think it's the connection, really.

168
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,120
It's sort of about you figuring out who you are

169
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,690
and connecting to what you're singing.

170
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,430
Simon, what do you think with her connecting?

171
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,300
You didn't connect with me,

172
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,130
Amanda, to be honest with you.

173
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,330
Seriously?

174
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,330
Yeah. Yeah.

175
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,870
It's... it's hard for me to do the thing where I sing and I, like,

176
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,570
interact, because I've done so much theater, and I do this.

177
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,680
like, out here thing...

178
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,340
Yeah, that's it.

179
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,010
And I'm trying... like, I... I

180
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,010
really, like, I promise I can get into it.

181
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,880
Like, I really can.

182
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,950
I want to connect with people.

183
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,980
But you're such an actress.

184
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,650
Oh.

185
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,450
But you are, Amanda.

186
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,720
You're so dramatic.

187
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,390
Don't be sad.

188
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,990
You... you do have a good voice.

189
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,520
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

190
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,030
We're not trying to make you feel bad.

191
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,730
We're trying to help you.

192
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,590
I know. I understand.

193
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,260
Victoria, yes or no?

194
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,430
You know, I'm gonna... I'm gonna say yes.

195
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,330
I like you.

196
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,000
I do.

197
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,700
Kara, yes or no.

198
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,300
I'm gonna say yes.

199
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:03,970
Guys...

200
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,870
Simon, yes or no?

201
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,910
I promise... Okay.

202
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,870
Simon, stop it.

203
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,310
I'm...

204
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,610
Stop it.

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,380
That's... you know, what I think?

206
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,580
she really...

207
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,080
Singing is what I love to do, man.

208
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,520
Please listen to me.

209
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,620
It's good to be dramatic.

210
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,280
Yes.

211
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,950
I'm dramatic.

212
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,190
We're all dramatic.

213
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,850
Yes.

214
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,520
Randy's dramatic.

215
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,190
I have to say...

216
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,720
Oh, Simon, you're being mean.

217
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,390
Yes or no?

218
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,060
I know it's hard.

219
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,060
It pains you.

220
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,230
Yes.

221
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,400
You got four yeses.

222
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,430
Welcome to Hollywood!

223
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,200
Yes.

224
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,870
You made it.

225
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,530
You did.

226
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,570
Whatever you did, keep doing it.

227
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,670
I can't take anymore.

228
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,510
Oh, you can't take anymore?

229
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,210
You are dramatic.

230
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,040
Where's the curtain?

231
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,280
Are they still there?

232
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,580
Take your bow.

233
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,250
Take your bow.

234
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,510
Yes.

235
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,180
Yes.

236
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,850
Yes, thank you.

237
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,220
Lovely.

238
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
See you in Hollywood, doll.

239
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,320
Fabulous, fab... Encore, encore.

240
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,990
No more.

241
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,660
I love you.

242
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,320
I love you.

243
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,220
Amanda with lots of drama.

244
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,860
So Amanda Shechtman is

245
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,960
awarded gold for her

246
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,660
performance.

247
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,400
And what award would be complete without an acceptance speech?

248
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,930
I can't believe this is happening.

249
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,440
This is my dream.

250
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,810
I really didn't think I was gonna get through.

251
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,110
I really didn't think I was.

252
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,980
I just want to be able to let my voice shine through, and be myself, and...

253
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,420
And I think...

254
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,590
This is just a dream come true for me.

255
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,590
Dramatic actress Amanda wasn't the only one

256
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,060
who showed they could do more than just sing.

257
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,530
Contestants bend over backwards to demonstrate their talent.

258
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,030
And we were never short of musicians.

259
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,660
Although instruments couldn't be played in the room,

260
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,110
They're often brought along.

261
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,310
Why did you wear a guitar for...?

262
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,910
It's kind of a comfort blanket for me.

263
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,235
But at this stage of the auditions,

264
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,520
these musicians must rely solely on their vocals.

265
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,850
# ain't no sunshine #

266
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,020
# when she's gone #

267
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,150
# hmm, hmm, hmm #

268
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,290
# ain't no sun #

269
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,990
# when she goes away #

270
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,890
# hmm, hmm, hmm #

271
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,360
# ain't no sunshine #

272
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,830
# when she's gone #

273
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,700
# and she's always #

274
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,170
# gone too long #

275
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,240
# anytime she goes away #

276
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,500
# take it #

277
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,770
# another little piece #

278
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,010
# of my heart now baby #

279
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,810
# yeah #

280
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,310
# break another little piece #

281
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,140
# of my heart #

282
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,880
# my heart now oh #

283
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,710
You're going to Hollywood.

284
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,450
Welcome to Hollywood.

285
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Thank you.

286
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,890
100%.

287
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,720
Lee, through to the next round.

288
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,720
Welcome to Hollywood, Lee.

289
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,175
The golden tickets for Lee and Chrystal mean

290
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,030
They can finally play their instruments in Hollywood.

291
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,600
But these pieces of paper are not just the gateway to a golden future.

292
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm going to Hollywood!

293
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,700
They're a prop.

294
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,410
Let's take a vote, Sime.

295
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,580
Yes or no?

296
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,850
So how would a ticket to Hollywood or success on this show impact you guys?

297
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,650
Oh...

298
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,150
It would mean the world to us.

299
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,820
The world, yeah.

300
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,490
He wants it.

301
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,490
His papa would be so proud.

302
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,130
Where there's wind, there is a contestant.

303
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,830
Ah, so sorry, man.

304
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,730
Aah!

305
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,960
# I got you #

306
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,730
# uh-huh #

307
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,630
Ah, the fake-out...

308
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,940
A time-honored tradition on idol.

309
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,090
If it was good enough for Daughtry,

310
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,540
It was good enough for this season's contestants.

311
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,150
# don't turn it loose now #

312
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,750
# hold it #

313
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,620
# a little bit longer now #

314
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,280
# hold it #

315
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,180
Whoo!

316
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,680
Even I got in on the act.

317
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,260
But as ever, Cowell had to have the last laugh.

318
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,670
He didn't make it.

319
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,870
Uh, sorry.

320
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,540
This always happens.

321
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,375
He has a tantrum about this far into the shooting,

322
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,610
And so he's got to go out and get a little bit of botox.

323
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,180
Does that mean he didn't make it?

324
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,115
Yes, idol just wouldn't be idol without the fake-out,

325
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,520
and the show wouldn't be the same without people like this.

326
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,790
You lost weight, you know that?

327
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,520
Ah, thank you, yes.

328
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,520
I've seen you on TV.

329
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,330
Coming up, the road to

330
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,330
Hollywood takes a few detours.

331
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
There's, like, a small schoolboy inside you.

332
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,130
But like so many of our contestants...

333
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,570
This is my seventh time.

334
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,600
We persevere and head back in the right direction with dazzling new talent.

335
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,110
Definitely one of my favorites.

336
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,210
The journey to Hollywood continues...

337
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,240
May I be excused?

338
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,710
After the break.

339
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,920
Welcome back to American Idol.

340
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,760
Whoo!

341
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,790
Yeah, man!

342
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,230
Welcome back to American Idol.

343
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,750
When you've done a show like this for nine seasons,

344
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,730
you're going to see some familiar faces.

345
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,830
I auditioned last year.

346
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,300
I auditioned for American Idol last season.

347
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,440
This is my fifth time auditioning.

348
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,070
Last season I did try out.

349
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,210
Let's not talk about that.

350
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,870
I cried,

351
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,870
a lot.

352
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,580
This year I feel much more comfortable in my own skin.

353
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,750
I think I could get farther this time.

354
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,410
I feel it. I feel it.

355
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,820
I feel it.

356
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,450
But remembering them is easier for some...

357
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,450
Welcome to Idol season nine.

358
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,150
She was here last year.

359
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,360
than others.

360
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,860
I don't remember any of these people.

361
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,930
Do you remember me?

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,100
Oh, I know this girl.

363
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Hey.

364
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,830
You remember me.

365
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,500
This is the reunion show.

366
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,230
Simon, do you remember me?

367
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:31,817
No.

368
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:32,370
Rose.

369
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,030
Rose.

370
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,540
You even said in my audition,

371
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,440
"You're one of the few I'm going to remember."

372
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,110
I tried out last year.

373
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,940
You thought we'd remember you, so you came in disguise.

374
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,610
Mm-hmm.

375
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,580
Yes.

376
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,550
Uh, it says here you're pretty sure I will remember you.

377
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,220
Mm-hmm.

378
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,880
I don't.

379
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,920
You don't?

380
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,090
Tan girl? Dark skin?

381
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,320
Really bronze?

382
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,560
Oh, no, you know what?

383
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,790
Yeah, it's beginning to ring a bell.

384
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,090
Um, you need me to explain anything?

385
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,760
Hey, what's up, people?

386
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,530
Yes, the tan.

387
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,730
Okay, um, my name is Chrystal.

388
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,530
Um, I just turned...

389
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
No, I want to hear about your suntan.

390
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,170
Okay, um, I'm singing and I'm telling you by Jennifer...

391
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,440
No, no, no, I want to hear about your suntan.

392
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,270
Oh, my suntan?

393
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,140
Yeah.

394
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,540
I go tanning.

395
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,710
No.

396
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,590
In Orlando, Lacey Brown hoped she had made a lasting impression in season eight.

397
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,490
Hello.

398
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,150
Hi.

399
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,890
Have we seen her before?

400
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,550
Yes.

401
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,460
Last year I was top 50 for season eight.

402
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,830
Lacey, how are you?

403
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,560
Good. How are you doing?

404
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,600
Good. How are you feeling?

405
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,400
I was sitting in the chair

406
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,630
next to Megan Joy, and I thought it might be that

407
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:41,100
they may put me and her both through.

408
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,140
Lacey...

409
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,725
- it's the end of the road. - It was disappointing at the moment,

410
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,180
but something inside of me said "This isn't the end of the road for you."

411
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,280
Immediately I knew.

412
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,150
People are gonna tell me no all the time.

413
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,950
You can't just take noes and live by 'em.

414
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,450
You got to turn 'em into yeses.

415
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,860
# somewhere over the rainbow #

416
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,460
# blue birds fly #

417
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,640
# well if blue birds #

418
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,200
# fly over the rainbow #

419
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,810
# then why #

420
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,640
# tell me why can't I #

421
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,280
# someday I'll wish #

422
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,050
# upon a star #

423
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,150
# and wake up where the clouds #

424
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,020
# are far behind me #

425
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,690
Thank you.

426
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,720
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

427
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,190
Uh, I actually like the tone of your voice.

428
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,860
I'm gonna say yes.

429
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Kristin?

430
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,460
I loved it. Yes.

431
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,120
Kara?

432
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,090
You're definitely one of my favorites this season.

433
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,960
Yes.

434
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,630
You're through.

435
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,060
Welcome to Hollywood.

436
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,730
Yes.

437
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,400
Thank you so much.

438
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,230
Welcome to Holly... Welcome back to Hollywood.

439
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,570
She's so pretty.

440
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,270
So Lacey got a second shot at Hollywood.

441
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,970
Yeah!

442
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,580
Whoo!

443
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,520
In Denver, we meet a girl preparing for her seventh attempt...

444
00:14:58,555 --> 00:14:59,750
Stephanie Fischer.

445
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,020
Seven's my lucky number.

446
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,520
I was born in the seventh month.

447
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,890
I was seven pounds and seven ounces.

448
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,550
I live at 7...

449
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,920
Well, I don't want to say my address, do I?

450
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,260
Seventh house on a street.

451
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,930
And this audition was particularly exciting to her.

452
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,530
I am so excited for Victoria Beckham.

453
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,740
She's my idol.

454
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,970
She's the most beautiful creature I've ever seen.

455
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,440
She's so pretty.

456
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,840
It's bad enough to have Simon,

457
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,280
who I have a huge crush on.

458
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,640
But Victoria Beckham?

459
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,850
Oh, my gosh.

460
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,620
Hi. Wow.

461
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,450
Wow.

462
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,120
You are...

463
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,150
I almost wore the same thing.

464
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,820
Yeah.

465
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,890
Okay, let's hear it.

466
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,060
# never know how much #

467
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,390
# I love you #

468
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,260
# never know how much I care #

469
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,260
# when you put your arms #

470
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,600
# around me #

471
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,930
# you give me fever #

472
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,430
# that's so hard to bear #

473
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,040
# you give me fever #

474
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,200
# uh, uh #

475
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,370
# when you kiss me #

476
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,080
# fever when you hold me tight #

477
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,210
# oh fever #

478
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,750
# In the morning #

479
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,150
# fever all through the night #

480
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,080
Thank you, Stephanie.

481
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,780
What did you think?

482
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,950
Terrible.

483
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,160
Honestly, you can't sing, sweetheart.

484
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,420
To be honest, I'm really starstruck by Victoria Beckham.

485
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,730
She's, like, my fashion icon.

486
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,460
Oh, thank you.

487
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,630
And, honestly, I wanted to cry when I came in here.

488
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,400
Thank you.

489
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,000
Would you like Victoria to turn away?

490
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,470
Do you want me to look the other way?

491
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,370
Yeah, you're putting her off.

492
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,030
Am I putting you off?

493
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,700
Okay.

494
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,400
Okay, she won't look.

495
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah.

496
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,140
# ooh #

497
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,740
# baby love #

498
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,070
# my baby love #

499
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,810
All right, turn around.

500
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,080
I think It was better when she was looking at you.

501
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,850
Yeah, yeah, better turned around.

502
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,450
That was even worse.

503
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,110
She was giving you good vibes, I think.

504
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,920
With the greatest respect,

505
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,650
you have a horrible voice.

506
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,490
Really?

507
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,420
Yeah, honestly.

508
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,660
Yeah, Stephanie, you are not got it going on on the vocals.

509
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,760
You can't give me, like, a few minutes to get un-nervous?

510
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,560
We'd need years, Stephanie.

511
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,160
We'd be in, like, American Idol 27.

512
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,230
Yeah.

513
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,100
Victoria, talk to Stephanie.

514
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,770
Come here.

515
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,300
Do you like what she's wearing?

516
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,605
No, you know, I think she has a very definite look.

517
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,340
I wouldn't say it's necessarily a look that I would go for.

518
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,310
I think you'd look good in that, V.

519
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
No, I wouldn't.

520
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,580
Come here.

521
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,310
Got to work on the vocs, baby.

522
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,980
Aw.

523
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,080
Come on.

524
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,520
You're gonna be fine.

525
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,320
You're a smart girl.

526
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,090
We've got to do the yessing and the noesing.

527
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,950
Yeah, yeah, will you step back over here?

528
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,890
No.

529
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,690
No.

530
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,360
No?

531
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,490
Well, at least she's leaving with some dignity.

532
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,130
Did you just say no, Stephanie?

533
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,800
She did. Good.

534
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,460
I like your attitude.

535
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,960
Okay, It's a no.

536
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,500
Stephanie, what if it was gonna be a yes?

537
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,630
See, you don't even know.

538
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,600
Was it gonna be a yes?

539
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,340
No.

540
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,240
Well, there you go.

541
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,780
So for posh's number one fan, the seventh time was not a charm.

542
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,380
Maybe next year.

543
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,750
Luckily for us, each season we get a new batch of contestants,

544
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,120
as thousands of American kids hit sweet 16.

545
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,660
And this year's crop of 16-year-olds provided some of the best new talent yet.

546
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,990
# how can you walk #

547
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,030
# that extra mile #

548
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,660
# I see forgiveness #

549
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,430
# In your smile #

550
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,470
# So sure you'd reject me #

551
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,040
# Wrong again #

552
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,440
Thank you, Rachel.

553
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,910
# How am I supposed to live #

554
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,910
# Without you my love #

555
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,910
Whoo!

556
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,150
# how am I #

557
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,280
# supposed to carry on #

558
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,950
Thank you.

559
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,380
Oh, wow.

560
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,980
# I told you so #

561
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,000
# oh I told you so #

562
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,500
You definitely got chops.

563
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,370
I mean, there's no denying you can sing.

564
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,300
One of the best 16-year-olds I've ever heard.

565
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,300
I'm impressed.

566
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,710
You guys...

567
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,850
I'm going to Hollywood.

568
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,360
Hollywood!

569
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,230
Hollywood!

570
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,430
Up next, you would believe what we save for you.

571
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,570
Definitely have a good voice.

572
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,200
As we meet more of the faces you'll see next week in Hollywood.

573
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,870
Four yeses.

574
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,670
Dude, you're through to Hollyweird.

575
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,340
But not everyone strikes gold.

576
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,040
Baby, you can't sing.

577
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,780
It's just not... Aw, no.

578
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,220
Stay with us as the talent flexes some muscle, while showing its softer side.

579
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,650
# I am this beautiful #

580
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,090
# man-flower #

581
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,490
# I will keep blossoming #

582
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,330
# and blossoming #

583
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,460
# I shine my beauty... #

584
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,550
You're joining us on the road to Hollywood.

585
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,210
This year, American Idol visited seven cities and saw over 100,000 contestants.

586
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:08,170
These idol hopefuls have come to us from all walks of life.

587
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:08,970
I'm a waiter.

588
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm a photographer.

589
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,100
I'm a police officer.

590
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,895
And I'm a clown.

591
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,050
But right now, it's not the nine-to-five professional

592
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,610
that we want to talk about.

593
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,248
Athletes make up a large percentage of the contestants

594
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:21,940
that try out for the show.

595
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,850
And we want to pay tribute.

596
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,110
I'm a gymnast.

597
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:26,957
I play a little bit of ultimate frisbee.

598
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,280
I play college football.

599
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,520
I'm technically the female version of Bruce Lee.

600
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,490
For these contestants, it's a different kind of game.

601
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,130
But the idol auditions are a competition all the same.

602
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,260
Winning is the number one goal.

603
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,560
Put me in the game, coach.

604
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,490
And these athletes, just like other contestants,

605
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:48,295
soon find out that making it past the judges

606
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,850
can be a very tall order.

607
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,370
- What's your name? - Hi, I'm Adrian.

608
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,040
How old are you?

609
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm 17 years old.

610
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,940
You're 17?

611
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,610
Wow.

612
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,650
How tall are you?

613
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm 6'8".

614
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,580
Do you dunk?

615
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,250
I can't dunk.

616
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,650
I'm sorry. I'm a terrible jumper.

617
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,650
People think I should go into basketball, but swimming is my thing.

618
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,120
My coach calls me the Big Kahuna, the big fish.

619
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,160
I have a lot of nicknames.

620
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,500
It always has something to do with something big.

621
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,000
Big man, big kahuna,

622
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,500
Blonde-Zilla.

623
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,840
I love that name.

624
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,910
# I say love #

625
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,210
# it is a flower #

626
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,450
I am a beautiful man-flower.

627
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,260
I will blossom the beautiful, big petals blossoming out...

628
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:42,000
keep blossoming until it shows its entire glory and beauty.

629
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,640
What do you hope to prove in this audition today?

630
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,740
I would like to prove that,

631
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,540
um, it doesn't matter what size you are when you sing.

632
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,510
I got to tell you, for America,

633
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,680
I am the only one.

634
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,010
Wow, you're tall.

635
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
How tall are you?

636
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,250
I am 6'8".

637
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,815
Nice.

638
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,320
And what are you gonna sing?

639
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,887
I'm going to sing, um, a hit by Elvis Presley,

640
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,960
"Can't Help Falling In Love With You".
"Can't Help Falling In Love With You"

641
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,630
Okay.

642
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,560
Beautiful song.

643
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,000
Good luck.

644
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:20,170
# wise men say #

645
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,880
# only fools rush in #

646
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,480
# but I an... am #

647
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,680
# falling in love #

648
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,720
# with you #

649
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,790
Thank you.

650
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,930
Adrian, there's, like, a small schoolboy trapped inside you.

651
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Either that, or you've eaten one.

652
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,030
"Let me out"

653
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,515
You know, you're a nice guy,

654
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,710
look, you're not a horrible singer.

655
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,480
No.

656
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,240
I mean, it just doesn't match you.

657
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,030
Yeah.

658
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,520
Randy, yes or no?

659
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,170
No, Adrian.

660
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,830
Yo, Adrian, this is not for you, baby.

661
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,340
- Kara? - Adrian, you are a very sweet guy, so...

662
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,880
But I have to say no.

663
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,750
And I... I encourage you to find something else.

664
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:11,755
Yeah, man.

665
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,520
Okay, it's a no, but nice to meet you, Adrian.

666
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,260
Nice to meet you, man.

667
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,670
- Nice guy. - Sorry.

668
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,780
You have my number,

669
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,960
if you want to do re-callbacks, then call me.

670
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,630
Okay.

671
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,610
Okay, thank you.

672
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,510
Thank you very much.

673
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,250
Adrian couldn't deliver a championship performance.

674
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,490
You have my number.

675
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,690
You can just call me or send me an email.

676
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,370
Let me know when there's a job opportunity for me.

677
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,977
Maybe the outcome would have been

678
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,740
more favorable if he'd done some training,

679
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,590
like his fellow Orlando contestant.

680
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,910
My name is Michael Lynch.

681
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm 26 years old.

682
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,210
And I'm a personal trainer.

683
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,690
I do, like, a circuit training.

684
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,910
Uh, a lot of body-weight action.

685
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,870
Big Mike is the next american idol, because I got these guns, baby.

686
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,830
Big guns, and as it turned out, big news.

687
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,130
So I've got my first child on the way, and, uh,

688
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,630
we just found out on Monday it's gonna be a baby girl.

689
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,640
Although everybody thinks it's gonna be a boy,

690
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,850
so we're gonna find out.

691
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,520
Yo, yo.

692
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,710
- What it is? - Hey.

693
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,930
How are you doing?

694
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,160
How are you doing?

695
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,660
- Whenever you're ready, Honey. - All right.

696
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,210
# oh #

697
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,950
# my love #

698
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,220
# my darling #

699
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,890
# I've hungered for #

700
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,090
# your touch #

701
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,930
# a long #

702
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,430
# lonely time #

703
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,000
# and time #

704
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,170
# goes by #

705
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,910
# so slowly #

706
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,540
# and time can do so much #

707
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,845
# are you still mine? #

708
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,750
Okay, Michael, thank you very much.

709
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,750
Thank you.

710
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,850
Randy?

711
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Uh, you can definitely sing.

712
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,160
He's kind of like a singing teddy bear.

713
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,930
All right, so let's take a vote.

714
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,590
Sime, yes or no?

715
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,390
I'm gonna say yes.

716
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,060
Kara?

717
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,900
Yes.

718
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,560
KC?

719
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,200
You have my vote.

720
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,230
Welcome to Hollywood.

721
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,870
All right, Baby, yeah.

722
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,610
So our father to be muscled his way into Hollywood.

723
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,240
Nice, Brother.

724
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,210
Nice, Brother.

725
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,880
Yeah.

726
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,510
Whoo.

727
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,385
Back in Los Angeles,

728
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,790
Didi Benami showed a different kind of strength when she battled her emotions.

729
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,830
I am auditioning today in memory of my best friend, Rebecca.

730
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:42,900
Almost four years ago, she passed away, and it was horrifying.

731
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,700
I felt like I had lost a part of me.

732
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,140
# love of mine #

733
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,070
Rebecca is absolutely the reason that I pursue music.

734
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,610
She believed in me.

735
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,450
You know, and when I didn't even know if I could believe in myself.

736
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:01,080
So... Yeah.

737
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,550
I miss her.

738
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,720
# then I'll follow you #

739
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,260
# into the dark #

740
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,425
My audition today is emotional already, but I'm...

741
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,870
I'm sure it's gonna be crazy once I get up there and do this,

742
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,600
because I am singing in honor of Rebecca.

743
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,140
What are you gonna sing today?

744
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,170
Uh, it's a last-minute decision, but I believe I'm gonna sing "Hey Jude".

745
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,280
That's a great song.

746
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,140
Mm.

747
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,140
# any time #

748
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,780
# you feel the pain #

749
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,410
# hey Jude refrain #

750
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,080
# don't carry the world #

751
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:40,090
# upon your shoulders #

752
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,220
# well you know #

753
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,490
# that it's a fool #

754
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,930
# who plays it cool #

755
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,600
# by making this world #

756
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,030
# a little colder #

757
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,540
# nah, nah, nah, nah, nah #

758
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,570
# nah, nah, nah #

759
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,040
# hey Jude #

760
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,880
# don't let me down #

761
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,410
# you have found her #

762
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,280
# now go and get her #

763
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,720
# remember so let her #

764
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,650
# into your heart #

765
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,990
# then you can start #

766
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,620
# to make it better #

767
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,530
Thank you.

768
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,130
You really want it bad.

769
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,790
I do.

770
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,630
You do, yeah.

771
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,930
It's okay, Sweetie.

772
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,370
Did good.

773
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,300
Aw.

774
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:25,970
I'm sorry.

775
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,100
No, I know.

776
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:27,770
I know it's rough.

777
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,440
It's rough.

778
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,100
It's...

779
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,770
I know.

780
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,110
My heart is, like, beating out of my chest right now,

781
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:33,910
but I'm really excited that I did that.

782
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,080
- You sang really well. - Really well.

783
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,740
You did good.

784
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,410
You did.

785
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
Take a deep breath.

786
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,820
She did good.

787
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,350
I actually thought it was really cool.

788
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,690
You got good range.

789
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,390
And sounded like you had your own kind of sound jumping out,

790
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,620
so I actually liked you.

791
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,120
Let's take a vote and let's see, okay?

792
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,460
Randy.

793
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,790
Uh, I'm gonna say yes.

794
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,330
I'll give you another shot.

795
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,330
I think you got a good voice.

796
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,000
Thank you.

797
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,330
Simon?

798
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Uh, a very small yes, Didi.

799
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,670
Thank you.

800
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,340
I really appreciate it.

801
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,200
But it's a yes.

802
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,440
Avril?

803
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,210
I would absolutely say yes.

804
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
I think you have huge potential.

805
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,010
You're going to Hollywood.

806
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,010
Welcome to Hollywood, Didi.

807
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,620
Aw, she's sweet.

808
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,550
See you later, Didi.

809
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,490
So Didi will be joining us in Hollywood.

810
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,430
I did it with everything on my mind and all my emotions,

811
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,160
and I tried to put it all in the back and just dig in and do it,

812
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,830
'cause this was my one shot.

813
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,600
So I... I did.

814
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,570
Coming up, they've faced adversity...

815
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,700
We had no money.

816
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,010
My dad couldn't keep a job.

817
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,310
Things just weren't good.

818
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,080
I didn't know we were poor when I was little.

819
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,810
I thought a lot of kids didn't eat dinner.

820
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,250
But what happens when they face our judges?

821
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,020
That wasn't even the melody, Sweetie.

822
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,050
The Road to Hollywood continues after the break.

823
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,020
You're back on The Road to Hollywood.

824
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,340
We've seen how our contestants come in many different shapes and sizes,

825
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,760
and how they embody different aspects of star quality.

826
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,860
In some, the judges found heart.

827
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,130
It's okay, Sweetie.

828
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,800
In others, they saw determination.

829
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,950
Singing is what I love to do, Man.

830
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:18,610
Please listen to me.

831
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,050
I can't...

832
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,450
And in Aaron Kelly from Orlando, they saw resilience.

833
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,645
When I was a year old,

834
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,590
things just weren't really going that great with my biological parents.

835
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,590
We moved around so much.

836
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,960
Uh, never stayed in one place.

837
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,430
We had no money.

838
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,830
My dad couldn't keep a job.

839
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,230
Things just weren't good.

840
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,010
Social services, about ready to step in, take me and my brother away from them.

841
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,210
My aunt and uncle did not want that.

842
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,485
They didn't want us going to somebody we didn't know

843
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,280
and never getting to see any of my family or real family again.

844
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,480
So they adopted us.

845
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,520
I do call my aunt "Mom", because the one who raised you is your...

846
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,790
is your mom.

847
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,120
This is my mom, Kelly.

848
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm grateful for everything that she's done for me.

849
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,535
She's given up a lot to make sure I am... how I am today,

850
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,570
and I've had all the things in life that every 16-year-old should have.

851
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:18,070
I've lived a happy life, and hopefully it's gonna be... get a lot better.

852
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,740
What you singing?

853
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,140
Uh, I'm gonna do "The Climb" by Miley Cyrus.

854
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,810
Great song.

855
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,480
Do it.

856
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,180
Okay.

857
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,420
# I can almost see it #

858
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,480
# that dream I'm dreaming but #

859
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,650
# there's a voice #

860
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,190
# inside my head saying #

861
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,530
# you'll never reach it #

862
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,960
# there's always gonna be #

863
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,030
# another mountain #

864
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,430
# I'm always gonna want #

865
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,200
# to make it move #

866
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,430
# always gonna be #

867
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,270
# an uphill battle #

868
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,100
Okay.

869
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:48,770
All right. Cool.

870
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,310
Sime, what do you think of Aaron here, Man?

871
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,610
Uh, Aaron, I thought that was a good choice of song for you.

872
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,810
I think the moms will like you.

873
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,250
Uh, I thought it was a pretty good audition, Aaron.

874
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,080
Dude, I think it was a great audition.

875
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,320
I love everything about you.

876
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,365
I love the fact that you're 16, you're shy,

877
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,350
and that voice comes out of somebody that shy,

878
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,690
which is cooler to me and more endearing.

879
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,620
I'm with Randy.

880
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,160
Uh, let's take a vote.

881
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,830
Sime, yes?

882
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,490
Yes.

883
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,160
Kara?

884
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,830
Yes.

885
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,500
KC?

886
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,160
Oh, yeah.

887
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,330
Yes for me.

888
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,160
Four yeses.

889
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,930
Dude, Aaron, you're through to Hollyweird.

890
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,070
Thank you all so much.

891
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,740
He's so...

892
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,770
He's adorable.

893
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,240
Aaron is now one step closer to fulfilling his dream.

894
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,750
I might even be a role model someday to kids everywhere.

895
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,120
Whoo!

896
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,735
And while Aaron's dream is to inspire,

897
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,290
people ultimately come here with one goal.

898
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,090
I'm the next American Idol.

899
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,760
But they all have different ideas of what they'd do with their fame.

900
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,490
I want to inspire other singers.

901
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,660
This's gonna change my zip code, my address.

902
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,700
Make people feel good.

903
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,630
My phone number.

904
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,170
I just want people to know my name.

905
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,120
My car, my gas quality.

906
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,890
'cause right now...

907
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,770
For Kimberly Bishop, it was about more than herself.

908
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,585
I feel like I have what it takes to be the American Idol

909
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,330
and the next pop singer, 'cause I have a really good heart,

910
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,050
and I would be very into recycling and helping kids in Africa.

911
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,720
Hello.

912
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,580
Hi.

913
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,290
Hi.

914
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,950
You lost weight.

915
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,950
You know that?

916
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,950
Aw, thank you, yes.

917
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,960
I've seen you on TV.

918
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,990
Thank you.

919
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,230
Okay, and what are you gonna sing?

920
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,030
Katy Perry "I Kissed A Girl".

921
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,860
All right, good luck.

922
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,760
# this was not #

923
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,570
# the way I planned #

924
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,300
# not my intention #

925
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,500
# I got so brave #

926
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,870
# with drink in hand #

927
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,280
# lost my discretion #

928
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,350
# it's not what I'm used to #

929
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,580
# just want to try you on #

930
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,150
Okay, Kimberly.

931
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,820
Ooh.

932
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,690
I love all the struggling with your arm and pulling your hair out.

933
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,490
Yeah.

934
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,690
A seductive girl.

935
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,490
Yeah, you are.

936
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,430
I think you're naughty.

937
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,230
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

938
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,900
Wasn't good enough.

939
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,570
Mm-hmm.

940
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,630
Kara?

941
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,340
No, Kimberly.

942
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,100
I would have said yes.

943
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,410
But it's a no.

944
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,770
May I be excused?

945
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,640
Or would you like me to sing another song?

946
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,410
No, you're excused now, Kimberly.

947
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,840
You're definitely excused.

948
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,110
Kimberly, Honey, the other way.

949
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,720
Other way.

950
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,720
Turn left.

951
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,620
Kimberly has a... no yellow ticket.

952
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,090
They said I was naughty.

953
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,890
She'd be fun on a date, wouldn't she?

954
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,900
That was so weird.

955
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,630
Maybe that means I'm really good.

956
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,430
Do you want anything? No.

957
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,900
Are you having a good time? No.

958
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,370
What was the "may I be excused"?

959
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
I quite liked that.

960
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,270
At least Kimberly showed Orlando had manners.

961
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,050
Over in Dallas, Shenee Harris

962
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,050
was certain that she had Texas-size talent.

963
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,890
My mom's here today with me, and I'm really thankful that she came,

964
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:55,220
and, um, I always appreciate her, and I love her dearly.

965
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,590
Don't put lips and she used to always put lipstick on my jaw.

966
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,030
When I went to class, it would be some big, red lips on my jaw.

967
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,830
When I was pregnant with her,

968
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,630
the lord gave me a vision.

969
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
And the vision was it was a little girl baby,

970
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:10,665
and she was on my heel, and she would always,

971
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,945
always be singing, and I always told her, you know,

972
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,570
after she got old enough, that she had the gift to sing.

973
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,040
Was this dream very near that little girl in front of judges?

974
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,700
Yes, it is.

975
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,370
It's a dream.

976
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,110
Come true today.

977
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,640
# I keep falling #

978
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,580
# in #

979
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,290
# in love #

980
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,690
# with you #

981
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,520
# sometimes I love ya #

982
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,860
# sometimes #

983
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,300
# you make me blue #

984
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,470
# loving you darling #

985
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,800
Mm.

986
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,370
# makes me so confused #

987
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,040
# I keep on falling#

988
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,710
Thank you.

989
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,370
# in and out #

990
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,340
# of love #

991
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,010
Do you know what?

992
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,710
I actually can't hear that song anymore.

993
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,950
I'm actually allergic to it now.

994
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,350
Honey, that wasn't even the melody, Sweetie.

995
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,880
She doesn't even know it's not the melody.

996
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,020
She's not... this is not a good singer.

997
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,490
Can I try something else please?

998
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,390
No, Baby, you can't sing.

999
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,090
It's just not... oh, no.

1000
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,920
Should we just vote on this?

1001
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,660
# she's out of my life #

1002
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,030
And hopefully out of mine soon.

1003
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,160
Okay, right, Shaddaii,

1004
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,500
it's... it's... Shaddaii, Shaddaii, it's a no.

1005
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,170
It's a no.

1006
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,130
It's a no.

1007
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
It's a no.

1008
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,670
Kara?

1009
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,170
Yes or no?

1010
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,570
N... no.

1011
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,770
No, I'm sorry.

1012
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,680
Baby, you can't sing.

1013
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,010
- Okay, Randy? - No, no.

1014
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,480
Okay, thank you Shaddaii.

1015
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,150
Okay.

1016
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,450
Thank you, Sweetheart.

1017
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,620
After the break, the story of Hope.

1018
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,520
I didn't know we were poor when I was little.

1019
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,020
I thought a lot of kids didn't eat dinner.

1020
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,430
We're saving the best for last as the road comes to an end.

1021
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:56,750
And we'll lift the curtain on the dreams and the drama of our most tense Hollywood week to date.

1022
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,320
I hated everything about that.

1023
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,390
- Welcome back to... - American idol!

1024
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,235
As our audition tour nears an end,

1025
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,360
I'd like to thank all the cities for the warm welcomes.

1026
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,900
Welcome to LA!

1027
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,400
Welcome to Atlanta!

1028
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,430
Welcome to Chicago!

1029
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,940
Welcome to Denver!

1030
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,140
But no one did hospitality better than Dallas, Texas.

1031
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,180
Welcome to Dallas!

1032
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,880
This is the greatest day ever at work.

1033
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,950
And it was in the Lone Star State where we met Texas native hope Johnson.

1034
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,520
I have a lot of siblings.

1035
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,220
I have six sisters and a brother.

1036
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,885
I had to overcome a lot of poverty,

1037
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,860
which a lot of people I'm sure deal with that, but I didn't...

1038
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:54,100
I didn't know we were poor when I was little.

1039
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,900
I thought a lot of kids didn't eat dinner.

1040
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,000
My parents would say, "you're gonna eat at school."

1041
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,525
I used to take food from my lunch tray, take it home with me,

1042
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,700
cause whenever my brother, little brother would tell me he was hungry,

1043
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:10,950
and he would cry, so I would give my brother my food or my lunch.

1044
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,220
I felt like...

1045
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:19,160
you know, there's always tomorrow, and things are always gonna be better.

1046
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,930
Just make it through the night, you know?

1047
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,770
I'm sorry.

1048
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,300
There's a lot worse things than just going without.

1049
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,970
There's a lot worse.

1050
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,870
Music's my escape.

1051
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,240
I can sing a song and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

1052
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,980
I hope the judges see the positive side of me, you know?

1053
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,450
When I walk up, I hope like, "oh, she's a star."

1054
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,750
I hope they see that.

1055
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,620
# I hope you never fear #

1056
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,520
# those mountains #

1057
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,320
# in the distance #

1058
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,460
# and never settle #

1059
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,930
# for the path #

1060
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,700
# of least resistance #

1061
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,330
# living might mean #

1062
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,630
# taking chances #

1063
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,240
# but they're worth taking #

1064
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,740
# and loving might #

1065
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,110
# be a mistake #

1066
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,510
# but it's worth making #

1067
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,440
# and when you get the choice #

1068
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,580
# to sit it out or dance #

1069
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,220
# I hope you dance #

1070
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,990
# I hope you dance #

1071
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,760
Okay.

1072
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,160
All right, cool.

1073
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,820
Hope.

1074
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:28,130
There's something very interesting about you and your tone and just... I like you.

1075
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
You're... you're... I'm gonna remember you.

1076
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,460
Thank you.

1077
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,130
I like you too.

1078
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,665
I think... I think that you're very sweet.

1079
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,900
There's a certain sort of innocence, and I love that song,

1080
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,100
Love that you picked that song.

1081
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,910
And it's one of the best lyrics I think written in a long time.

1082
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,910
I agree.

1083
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,710
You know, what's cool is that you've got a beautiful tone to your voice.

1084
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,780
The only thing you need to work on is completing the phrases.

1085
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,550
Letting them...

1086
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,320
# last out #

1087
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,350
I've heard that.

1088
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,390
# make sure you close #

1089
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,650
I like you.

1090
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,320
Thanks.

1091
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,420
Yeah, I like you.

1092
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,090
Yeah.

1093
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,760
Yeah, you're cute.

1094
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,530
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

1095
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,190
Yes.

1096
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,860
Joe?

1097
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,530
Yeah.

1098
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,190
Kara?

1099
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,600
I'd say yes too.

1100
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Four yeses.

1101
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,330
Whoo!

1102
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,170
Yeah, right, right, right.

1103
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,830
This is ridiculous!

1104
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,500
Oh, my god!

1105
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,300
It's ridiculous.

1106
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,100
Welcome to Hollyweird.

1107
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,800
Gonna be ridiculous in Hollywood, yes.

1108
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,600
It already is.

1109
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,170
Season nine is already pretty ridiculous.

1110
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,140
It's already ridiculous.

1111
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,970
Yeah.

1112
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,710
I'm going to Hollywood.

1113
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,550
I'm going to Hollywood.

1114
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,045
That was the most overwhelming experience

1115
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,390
I think I've ever experienced so far in my life.

1116
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm so amazed that it actually...

1117
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,820
it's actually happening.

1118
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,060
This is real.

1119
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,660
Like... It's real.

1120
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,360
America, I am going to Hollywood.

1121
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,570
Whoo!

1122
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:43,440
So Hope, along with a select group of talented singers are all that remain.

1123
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,150
They've taken great leaps of faith to get here,

1124
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,140
- and it's been a long journey for all of us. - Y'all.

1125
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,410
This season, over 100,000 people showed up.

1126
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,150
Holla!

1127
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,150
# tiptoe #

1128
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,750
But only 172 walked out with gold.

1129
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,590
Just say something like,

1130
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,290
"my favorite judge."

1131
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,920
And for them, the journey has just begun.

1132
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,590
Yeah!

1133
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,930
Daddy's going to Hollywood.

1134
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,890
Yay!

1135
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,000
Yay! Whoo!

1136
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,340
Next week, it's the event you've been waiting for,

1137
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,710
as Ellen Degeneres takes her permanent place at the panel.

1138
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,540
You frighten me.

1139
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,150
You were stalking us.

1140
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,910
You were like a leopard behind a cage.

1141
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,180
But it's not all fun and games.

1142
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,990
That was really strange for me.

1143
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,390
But I'm not sure you know how to perform.

1144
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,990
That was painful.

1145
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,430
That was really, really... dull.

1146
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:42,430
Together we'll embark one journey known as Hollywood week.

1147
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,170
Hollywood!

1148
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,470
They may be the most talented

1149
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,700
we've ever seen.

1150
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,370
Very, very nice.

1151
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,970
You're really a great singer.

1152
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,170
That was amazing.

1153
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,670
But they have never broken down quite like this.

1154
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,170
I have so much...

1155
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,010
I don't want to get cut, because I've worked so hard.

1156
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,850
Now after this process, we'll be down to 12 guys and 12 girls.

1157
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,950
Who will survive...

1158
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,420
Oh, my gosh.

1159
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,650
Hollywood week?
