1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,405
Hey, quick pop quiz.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,040
What city has Idol visited five times,

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,640
has given us Fantasia, Clay Aiken, and Jennifer Hudson,

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,760
and is the birthplace of yours truly?

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,500
Yep, that's me.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,310
- Howell Michigan. - No

7
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:15,537
- Phoenix. - Not it.

8
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:16,730
- Frisco. - Dallas.

9
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:17,405
No and no.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,715
- Frisco. - No.

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,735
- Tampa. - No.

12
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,685
- New York. - No!

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,695
- San Diego? - Not it!

14
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,670
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil?

15
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:23,460
Not even close.

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,270
I mean, come on!

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,630
Was it really that hard?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,270
American Idol is back in the peach state.

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,840
# same old place #

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,270
Welcome back to Hot-lanta!

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,140
Whoo!

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,680
And every time we come here,

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,710
the crowds are bigger than ever.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,880
# on my way back to Georgia #

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,265
The 10,000 on hand were ready to show us

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,250
the depth of the talent pool in the deep south.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,290
Bring it on, Simon.

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,300
Simon and Kara arrived ready to go.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,970
But Randy still needed a little me time.

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,770
I don't want to get out.

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,840
I don't want to get out.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,240
Poor baby. Good thing we had our guest judge Mary J. Blige on hand.

33
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,910
I'm really excited.

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,110
I think I'm gonna be an honest judge.

35
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,045
I'm not gonna be so rigid,

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,450
but you have to just tell the truth.

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,380
The Atlanta auditions just couldn't be without her.

38
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,735
She's been called the empress of soul,

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,020
And this music legend has the goods to back it up.

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,475
Having sold over 40 million albums,

41
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,825
and with nine Grammys to her name,

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,705
Mary J. Blige has helped to redefine R&B

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,900
and has taken her place as a pillar of the music industry.

44
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,305
So here in Atlanta,

45
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,680
the contestants will walk into this elevator,

46
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:19,610
then hit the 27th floor.

47
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,420
On their way up, once they reach the top,

48
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:23,660
exit the elevator,

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,650
and the judges will listen to their song.

50
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,620
It's gonna be a long ride down if they don't get a golden ticket.

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,005
The judges were set,

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,905
And their first contestant,

53
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,520
27-year-old Dewone Robinson was feeling confident.

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,460
His success was clearly meant to be.

55
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,990
Music is in my blood.

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,430
It runs through my veins.

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,300
My great uncle discovered Gladys Knight and the Pips.

58
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,770
His name is Clyde.

59
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,035
And other kinfolks of mine,

60
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,870
He was playing the drums for Motown.

61
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,240
His name is Bobby. Motown bobby.

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,810
Well, I first found my voice when I was young.

63
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,540
I came home, and I sung this song.

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,290
I just made up a song, and my brother and sister said,

65
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,550
"where you learn that at? In church?"

66
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,980
I said, "no, I just made it up."

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,780
It just come natural.

68
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,750
Like a diamond in the rough.

69
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,025
When I go upstairs,

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,090
I'm gonna sing from the bottom of my heart.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,860
Right through there.

72
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,090
Take it on up.

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,990
And I'm gonna sing the best to my ability,

74
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:21,000
so that I can go to Hollywood.

75
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,540
Yo, yo. What's up, man?

76
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,870
How you doing? You chilling?

77
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,070
Yes, sir. How you doing?

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,210
What's your name, man?

79
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,470
My name is Dewone Robinson.

80
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,070
- So you ready? - Yes, I'm ready.

81
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,210
- What you gonna sing? - I'm gonna sing something that I originally came up with.

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,880
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,180
All right, cool.

84
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,320
# lady, I know you #

85
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,990
Hold on.

86
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,450
What's this?

87
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,890
What song is that?

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,890
- It's his original song. - Oh, it's an original song.

89
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,330
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

90
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,660
There you go. Start again.

91
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,560
Start over, yeah.

92
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,000
# la... #

93
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,030
And it's called what?

94
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
What's it called?

95
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,830
What's the song called?

96
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,470
It's called "Lady, We're Not Together Anymore".

97
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,100
"Lady, We're Not Together Anymore".
"Lady We're Not Together Anymore"

98
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,840
Okay. Now she knows.

99
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,940
Now she knows.

100
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,810
# lady, I know you #

101
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,600
# baby, I know you #

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,250
# la-la-lady, I know you #

103
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,660
# it's over #

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,230
# it's over #

105
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,260
# it's over #

106
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,030
# it's over #

107
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,470
Oh, please god.

108
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,470
- What you all want me to sing? - Honey...

109
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,800
Usher or something? I won't sing... Usher?

110
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,740
Honey.

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,770
Dewone, did you write that as a duet?

112
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,670
No, not a duet, sir.

113
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,240
No, not a duet. I was... I was...

114
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,910
You were playing both parts.

115
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,580
Yes, sir.

116
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,110
Yes, sir, I was playing both parts at the same...

117
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,810
Okay, I can honestly say,

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
Dewone, it's one of the worst original songs i've ever heard.

119
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,750
I know.

120
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,980
I couldn't really sing at all,

121
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,255
Because you said... you said,

122
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,970
"uh, you... you're not doing it right."

123
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,620
"You're not... What is this called?"

124
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,720
Oh, honey, it had nothing to do with him.

125
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,910
I was gonna tell you what it was called,

126
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,030
but you just jumping up on me like...

127
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,730
No, no, I wanted to know what it was called.

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
What y'all want me to sing? Rick James?

129
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,170
# fire and desire, baby #

130
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,630
Huh?

131
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,030
You got me shell-shocked.

132
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,800
You got me shell-shocked.

133
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,640
He jumped on me.

134
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,540
I didn't jump on you, Dewone.

135
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,365
I asked you what the song was called.

136
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,670
He said "what is this called?" He said "what is this called?"

137
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,180
Okay, Dewone, I'll tell you what.

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,180
Experiment.

139
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm not gonna ask you a single thing.

140
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,850
Sing the song again.

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,050
# lady, I know you #

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,420
# baby, I know... #

143
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,890
Okay, Dewone.

144
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,630
# hey, la... #

145
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,400
Dewone, that was even worse.

146
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,900
I can sing. But I was singing...

147
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,660
But I was trying to sing.

148
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,030
Dewone.
Dewone

149
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,800
What are you talking about?

150
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,470
# lady, I know you #

151
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,840
Oh, god, no. Please.

152
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,210
- Security! Security! - Bye!

153
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,410
What you all want me to sing?

154
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,240
- Security! - What you all want me to do?

155
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,910
- Leave. - Out, out, out.

156
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,510
Still have a nice, blessed day, and god bless you all.

157
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,520
God bless you.

158
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,390
# it's over #

159
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,220
# it's over #

160
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,390
# with me #

161
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,490
Uh, yes, it is, Dewone.

162
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,900
But Atlanta is just getting started.

163
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,000
Coming up, Georgia delivers some spectacular talent.

164
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,800
So far, best vocal we've seen yet.

165
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,600
- I love you. - I mean, it was just dope.

166
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,140
Whoo!

167
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,610
We're deep in the south.

168
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,810
Welcome to Vonore, Tennessee.

169
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,110
And the southern belles are a-ringing.

170
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,110
# well #

171
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,210
It's like a cat barking.

172
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,420
This is gonna take my dream away from me.

173
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,320
Plus drama like we've never seen before.

174
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,990
- What are you doing? - Lamar, Lamar.

175
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,590
- *** your mom. - Oh!

176
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,530
That... can't sing a lick.

177
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,790
And one audition you'll

178
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,760
definitely be talking about tomorrow.

179
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,590
I have a horrible feeling that song could be a hit.

180
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,260
Boom!

181
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,200
Atlanta gets down after the break.

182
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,200
I would really love to go to Hollywood.

183
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,900
Not based on that audition,

184
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,470
you won't be.

185
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,500
Welcome back to Atlanta!

186
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,600
We're hotter than ever!

187
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,870
Whoo!

188
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,970
We're back in the Atl.

189
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,775
They call it hot-lanta,

190
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,280
but the talent is leaving the judges cold.

191
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,750
I'm good at high notes, like,

192
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,920
# and she coming like ooh #

193
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,120
# ooh, baby #

194
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,190
# high, high, high #

195
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,920
# whoo #

196
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,320
Whoo! Whoo!

197
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,160
Whoo!

198
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,760
That's turned everything around.

199
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,770
Downstairs, the holding room is rallying

200
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:34,230
To get their first golden ticket.

201
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,700
# Straight line champions #

202
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,140
# Compete with class #

203
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,340
# you know and I know #

204
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,610
# We'll kick your (ass) #

205
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,040
On deck is our next contestant,

206
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,110
26-year-old Kia Johnson.

207
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,680
Maybe her bright and sunny smile

208
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,180
can warm up the judging room.

209
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,880
- Good afternoon. - Hello.

210
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,220
- Like your hair. - Thank you.

211
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,650
- How are you? - I'm ecstatic.

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,160
So you competed for a Miss America competition,

213
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,620
- and you won Miss Congeniality? - Yeah.

214
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,690
So you didn't get the "I'm good-looking".

215
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,860
You got the "I'm a good personality".

216
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,530
- Yeah. - Which is a great award.

217
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,170
I'd rather have the other one.

218
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,270
Well, of course you would. Of course you would.

219
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,030
You wouldn't get any award.

220
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,505
- Anyway. - Who would enter a beauty competition

221
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,910
and want to get "I've got a good personality"?

222
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,240
- Me. - I like this girl.

223
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,940
Oh, you a good girl. We like that.

224
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,840
And it's all about you.

225
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,650
- You're beautiful. - Thank you.

226
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,950
I appreciate that.

227
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,420
So I guess you want to hear me sing, maybe?

228
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,490
- Yeah. - Okay, um, I'm gonna do Titanic song.

229
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,890
# you're here #

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,260
# there's nothing I fear #

231
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,500
# and I know that my heart #

232
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,000
# does go on #

233
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,270
# and we'll, we'll stay #

234
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,310
# forever this way #

235
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,850
# you're safe in my heart #

236
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,520
# and my heart will go on #

237
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,890
# and on #

238
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,720
Thank you.

239
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,060
- What'd you think? - If you ask me...

240
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,660
- Mary, what'd you think? - If you asked me vocally,

241
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,760
truthful and honest, she can sing.

242
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,730
You definitely can sing.

243
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
I like the way you close some of the phrases.

244
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,300
Like, "oh. That's good, right there."

245
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,830
Yeah.

246
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,740
I think that I can really see how you won that contest,

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
cause your personality really comes across.

248
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,710
Genuine.

249
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,765
You're very genuine,

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,540
and you're nice to look at when you're performing.

251
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,110
You don't make any crazy faces,

252
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,450
- and you do have really good vocals. - Thank you.

253
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,510
I like... I like you, but, you know,

254
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:31,165
if I'm being honest with you,

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,560
I could imagine you standing in line,

256
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:35,920
and sort of getting the part in Oklahoma.

257
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,890
But you know what she did?

258
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,775
It was the way she ended certain things,

259
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,000
and she made that big song that everybody knew

260
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:43,430
and auditioned with her own.

261
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,460
- Yeah. - You had some good riffs.

262
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,830
- I like you, though. - Thank you, Simon.

263
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,240
- Yeah. - That means a lot.

264
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,940
Thank you. Okay, we're gonna vote.

265
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,510
- Randy? - Uh, yes, I love this girl's voice.

266
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,240
I think you can sing, man.

267
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,780
- Thank you, Randy. - Yes.

268
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
- Kara? - Definitely.

269
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,780
- Oh. - Yes.

270
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,320
Uh, and I'm gonna say yes as well.

271
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,680
Four yeses. Welcome to holly-weird.

272
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,050
Oh, my god! Thank you so much.

273
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,420
She's so cute.

274
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,790
She's sweet.

275
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,490
Got the golden ticket!

276
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,870
Oh, my god! Thank you, god!

277
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,240
Whoo! Going to Hollywood.

278
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,440
Super excited.

279
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,410
Now I can do a real dance move.

280
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,980
Kia has finally got Atlanta cooking.

281
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,350
And the judging room began to sizzle.

282
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,720
# there's always gonna be #

283
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,760
# another mountain #

284
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,990
# I'm always gonna want #

285
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,760
# to make it move #

286
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,090
# always gonna be #

287
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
# an uphill battle #

288
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,760
# sometimes you gonna have #

289
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,270
# to lose #

290
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,570
# don't make me close #

291
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,310
# one more door #

292
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,970
# I don't want to hurt #

293
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,810
# anymore #

294
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,750
# if you don't let me know #

295
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,950
# what you're feeling #

296
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,620
Mm-hmm.

297
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,920
# yeah, ooh #

298
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,850
Whoo.

299
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,820
# it's impossible #

300
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,990
Thank you.

301
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,020
I think that was the best we've seen all day.

302
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,630
I really do.

303
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,390
One billion percent yes.

304
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,930
You're going to Hollywood!

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,660
- Four yeses to Hollywood. - You deserve it.

306
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,630
- Whoo! - Welcome to Hollywood.

307
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,400
- It's a yes. - Thank you.

308
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,110
Welcome to Hollywood, Miriam.

309
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,910
Now we're talking.

310
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,310
Atlanta is taking care of business.

311
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,760
And our next contestant has spent his life

312
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:45,020
caring for another.

313
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,390
I'm Jermaine Sellers.

314
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,450
I'm 26 years old, and I'm from Joliet, Illinois,

315
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,590
And I'm a church singer.

316
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,960
Is that where you work? That's your job?

317
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,880
That's what I do for a living.

318
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:52,740
- You get paid to sing? - Yes.

319
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,135
- That's cool. - Yes.

320
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,340
This is what I've wanted my whole, entire life.

321
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,095
So my mom's like

322
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,990
"Jermaine, you should go and get an audition"

323
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,330
My mother has a condition

324
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,040
is called Spinal Bifida,

325
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,890
where she has grown spurs on her spinal cord,

326
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,960
and sometimes she's in a lot of pain,

327
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,310
she can't move at all.

328
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,440
I've been taking care of my mom since I was 17.

329
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,625
If I make it to Hollywood,

330
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,150
I'll be proving myself that I can sing.

331
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,650
This is my dream, and I'm gonna make it happen.

332
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,690
- How are you, Jermaine? - I'm doing good.

333
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,190
Well, you seem like a nice guy here.

334
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,060
Caring for your sick mom and singing at church.

335
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,400
- Yes. - That's really great.

336
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm a church boy.

337
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,160
What are you gonna do here today?

338
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,000
Sing. I love to sing.

339
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,140
And what are you gonna sing? Huh?

340
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,540
- What did you do? - He's gonna juggle.

341
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm singing Joan Osborne

342
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,110
What If God Was One of Us.
What If God Was One of Us

343
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,540
Oh, that is a great song.

344
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,880
Wow.

345
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,910
# yes, yes #

346
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,950
# god is good #

347
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,690
# and yes, yes #

348
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,890
# god is great #

349
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
# yes, yes #

350
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,830
# yeah, yeah, yeah #

351
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,700
# oh, what if god #

352
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,860
# was one of us #

353
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,400
# just a slob like one of us #

354
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,770
# he's just a stranger #

355
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,970
# on the bus #

356
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,880
# trying to make his way home #

357
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,920
- Wow. - Jermaine, I love you.

358
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,960
- Wow. - That was a great interpretation of that song.

359
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,090
It really was.

360
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,125
Like, and I like that you came in here,

361
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,690
and you picked something that really you felt.

362
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,670
Listen. This, so far, all the cities,

363
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,530
best vocal we've seen yet.

364
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
You've got skills.

365
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,440
- This kid is hot time. - He is.

366
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,710
This kid is... This is the real deal right here.

367
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,210
Thank you.

368
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,610
- That was incredible. - Thank you.

369
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,780
It was so much control.

370
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,340
It was anointed.

371
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,310
It was all of the above.

372
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,780
Let's take a vote. Randy?

373
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,520
Uh, ask Simon first.

374
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Sime?
Sime?

375
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,920
- Yes. - Thank you, Simon.

376
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,820
- Mary? - I say yes.

377
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,160
- Thank you. - Definitely.

378
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,060
- 100% yes. - Thank you.

379
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,830
Million, thousand, 110% yes.

380
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,000
Welcome to Hollywood, Jermaine!

381
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,430
- Thank you. - I got my ticket.

382
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,470
# I got my ticket #

383
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,840
# ticket, ticket #

384
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,340
Mom?

385
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,970
Oh, I made it.

386
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,780
Whoo, baby! Yeah!

387
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,380
I will call you back, ma.

388
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,250
Bye.

389
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,350
She's gonna call the whole neighborhood now.

390
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,600
While Jermaine heads to Hollywood

391
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:37,780
and his mother rings the neighbors,

392
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,160
We head to a break.

393
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,860
Can hot-lanta continue to heat things up?

394
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,430
- You were fearless. - That was beautiful to me.

395
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,130
That... was great.

396
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,270
Or is the atl just hot-headed?

397
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,530
Y'all.

398
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,070
Plus we meet a small-town girl with big dreams.

399
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,710
I want to make something of myself.

400
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,810
I am. I'm stoked about being here.

401
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,070
Welcome back.

402
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,720
And almost done with the first day of auditions,

403
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:09,590
and Atlanta has shown us once again

404
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,880
why we love this city.

405
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,450
I'm going to Hollywood, baby!

406
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,850
Yeah!

407
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,455
High hopes and even higher temperatures

408
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,750
have everyone ready to get to that 27th floor.

409
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,155
And as the Georgia crowd thinned,

410
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,790
a colorful personality began to emerge.

411
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,260
I'm Christy Marie, and I just turned 25.

412
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,060
What do you do for a living?

413
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,510
I am a TV show hostess and producer

414
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:33,770
for Georgia TV's 411 the show.

415
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,730
I always get people to do 411 the show,

416
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,540
cause it's so much fun.

417
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,570
411 the show.
411 the show

418
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,730
So, in other words, if I were to incorporate that,

419
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:44,410
it would be, "This is American Idol."

420
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,650
- Yes, exactly. - That's how we'd start the show?

421
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,845
If the key to success is to do you,

422
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,980
then this is doing me, Christy Marie.

423
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,650
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Yeah.

425
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,890
All right. You're 25 from Atlanta.

426
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,590
It says you're a TV show host.

427
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,920
- What do you host? - I am.

428
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,290
It's called 411 the show.

429
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,980
And it's all about the fiery 411

430
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:05,600
on what makes hot-lanta so darn hot.

431
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,000
Whoa. You're like a walking commercial.

432
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,945
I would love to sing for y'all Pat

433
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,710
- Benatar's Love Is A Battlefield. - Do it.

434
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,180
# oh, whoa, whoa, whoa #

435
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
# whoa #

436
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,680
# we are young #

437
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,380
# heartache to heartache #

438
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,320
# we stand #

439
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,890
# with no promises #

440
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,220
# no demands #

441
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,290
# love is a battlefield #

442
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,430
# we are strong #

443
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,330
# no one can tell us #

444
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,770
# we're wrong #

445
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,770
# searching our hearts #

446
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,670
# for so long #

447
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,270
# both of us knowing #

448
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,680
# love is a battlefield #

449
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,010
- Thank you. - It is, girl.

450
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,350
- Wow. - It is.

451
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,480
- Wow. Wow. - This is my battlefield today,

452
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,920
because this is my love.

453
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,250
Singing is my life.

454
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Music is my passion.

455
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,960
I would really love to go to Hollywood.

456
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,620
Well, not based on that audition,

457
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:07,590
you won't be, Christy.

458
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,830
Uh, it was a terrible version of the song.

459
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,030
Honey, it's not gonna work out.

460
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,840
We got our own 411 for you.

461
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,670
This is not... shouldn't be your career, sweetie.

462
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,810
You seem like a really sweet girl, but...

463
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,270
- I think it's more of a 911. - Yeah, exactly.

464
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,740
Emergency.

465
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,380
It's a no, Christy, but nice to meet you.

466
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,350
- Sorry, Christy. - Thank you for coming out, babe.

467
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,980
What do you think's gonna happen when she comes down?

468
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,920
Ooh, I hope she's got that golden ticket.

469
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,020
I hear the elevator moving,

470
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,290
so we may have a verdict.

471
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,160
I go up there, I sing for them, I, you know,

472
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:40,960
I put on the show, I give it my heart and soul,

473
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:42,330
and they're just like, "no, no."

474
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,060
I thought they were just being ridiculous.

475
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,970
"we think your show should be called 911 instead of 411."

476
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,670
This is one show I won't be promoting.

477
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,840
Random strangers that I don't know are clapping for me,

478
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,840
Telling me I sound amazing.

479
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,235
Well, the good news is,

480
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,210
Christy has plenty to talk about on her show.

481
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,765
Back in the room,

482
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,940
quite a few others were getting

483
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,080
the 411 on their singing voices.

484
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,080
And it's a long elevator ride down from that 27th floor.

485
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,050
I'm sorry, no.

486
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,320
# I'm going down #

487
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,190
- I'm gonna say no. - Can I sing something else?

488
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,430
Chelsea, that's it.

489
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,630
God, I didn't go through.

490
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,360
It's not enough, sweetheart.

491
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,460
It's really not.

492
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,200
I wish I could say yes, but I can't.

493
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,270
Singing is not for you, sweetie.

494
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,300
I'm gonna say no, man.

495
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,840
I didn't think it was a great audition, man.

496
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,010
Uh, no.

497
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,880
# baby, my whole world's #

498
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,950
# upside down #

499
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,090
- You didn't make it? - No.

500
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,770
Well, if you don't like the elevator,

501
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:45,630
you can always take the stairs.

502
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,850
Or if you're the last person of the day

503
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,650
and you live in rural Tennessee,

504
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:50,830
you could just jump.

505
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,500
Hi, I'm Vanessa Wolf.

506
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,370
I jump bridges. Peace out.

507
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,500
Ow!

508
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,640
Welcome to Vonore, Tennessee.

509
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,840
Ow!

510
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,180
There ain't really much to do in Vonore,

511
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,380
So I jump bridges.

512
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,680
I like jumping bridges.

513
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,790
I like... the higher the better.

514
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,790
Don't try this at home.

515
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,760
This is risky business.

516
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,760
100% pure beef.

517
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,100
Vonore, it's about the smallest town probably in Tennessee.

518
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,730
My mom lives right down the road.

519
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,900
I go see her every day.

520
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,670
Come here, Clem.

521
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,370
I don't really have a life.

522
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,740
Never goes to the movies.

523
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,110
Or the mall. Or anything.

524
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm stuck in Vonore.

525
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,910
I can't get out.

526
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,410
# I was lost #

527
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,450
# in the lakes #

528
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,850
I don't really have very much, you know?

529
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,950
I got this dress.

530
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,420
I think I got a good deal on this.

531
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,530
Got this for $4.50 at the dollar store out in Smyrna.

532
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,590
I come out for American Idol

533
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,060
cause I feel so trapped.

534
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,730
I want to make something of myself.

535
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,500
This is her dream.

536
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,670
And if she works to achieve it,

537
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm standing behind her 100,000%, you know?

538
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,305
I love you, mama.

539
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,810
You make me feel good about myself.

540
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,110
This is the biggest thing that's happened to me. I am so nervous.

541
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,720
I know the judges, they are high-profile people,

542
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,260
And I don't want them to, like, look down on me,

543
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:20,520
or nothing like that.

544
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,190
You know.

545
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,160
What's life without a risk or two?

546
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,830
You know? Today is... most important day of my life.

547
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,800
I am. I'm stoked about being here.

548
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,440
Hello.

549
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,770
- How are you? - I'm doing pretty good.

550
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,640
- Where you from? - I'm from Vonore, Tennessee.

551
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,440
- "Vonroe"? - Vonore.
- "Vonroe"? - Vonore

552
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,250
V-o-n-o-r-e.
V-o-n-o-r-e

553
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,750
What you gonna sing?

554
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,180
Uh, Wagon Wheel, by Old Crow Medicine Show.

555
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,320
Okay.

556
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,990
# well, I'm #

557
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,150
# headed down south #

558
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,760
# to the land of the pines #

559
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,290
# and I'm thumbing my way #

560
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,890
# into north caroline #

561
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
# staring up the road #

562
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,760
# and pray to god I see #

563
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,360
# headlights #

564
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,600
# well, I made down the coast #

565
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,330
# in 17 hours #

566
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,940
# picking me a bouquet #

567
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
# of dogwood flowers #

568
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,270
# and I'm a-hoping for raleigh #

569
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,880
# I can see my baby tonight #

570
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,040
# so rock me, mama #

571
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,450
# like a wagon wheel #

572
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,550
Okay, okay.

573
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,680
All right.

574
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,950
I love that song.

575
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,850
I can tell. Wow.

576
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm really nervous.

577
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,550
Vanessa ready for this audition?

578
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,190
Yes. Yes, I believe she is.

579
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,960
- Nerve-racking? - Yes.

580
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,360
Instead of butterflies, I got frogs.

581
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,660
You got... instead of butterflies you have frogs?

582
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,305
Yes. Vessa, I know it's really nerve-racking

583
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,845
to get up here, but, you know, I got to say, uh,

584
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,100
you were a lot better than I thought you were gonna be.

585
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,660
- Really? - You're a country singer,

586
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,202
and that's what you should be doing,

587
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,710
Because you're really true to it.

588
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,205
When you're singing it,

589
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,640
it feels real authentic.

590
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,310
Well, I am from the country.

591
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,240
You're a country girl.

592
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,780
Right smack dab in the middle of it.

593
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,850
That's right.

594
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,520
Vanessa, I like you.

595
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,750
- Well, I like you. - There's something about you I like.

596
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,420
I like all y'all.

597
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,730
Um, I think that you are incredibly ill-prepared

598
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:04,960
for this...very, very nervous.

599
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,030
But when you are good, you're really good.

600
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,760
- Mm-hmm. And you're distinct. - Yeah.

601
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,870
Um, and it's all about self-belief with you, sweetheart.

602
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,970
But you stand out in the crowd for me, and I like you.

603
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,670
And I think you're very authentic.

604
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,140
If I didn't have a dress on,

605
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,900
- I'd throw you a backflip, Simon. - Ah...

606
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,640
Randy, yes or no?

607
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm gonna say yes to the country girl from the country.

608
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,750
- Vanessa, yes. - Vonore, Tennessee.

609
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,150
- Vanessa Jo. - Kara?
- Vanessa Jo - Kara?

610
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,750
Very authentic, and I like that about you.

611
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,160
Keep singing country. Yes.

612
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,760
Yes to the country girl.

613
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,330
Uh, yes, to you, Vanessa.

614
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,100
Are you serious?

615
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,430
We are 100% serious.

616
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,870
Welcome to Hollywood, Vanessa!

617
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,200
Ow! Yeah!

618
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,800
Whoo! Whoo!

619
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,570
Yes.

620
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,270
My mom's gonna have a heart attack.

621
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,070
But, Vanessa, you've got to start practicing.

622
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,740
Mm-hmm.

623
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,280
You got to start believing in yourself.

624
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,585
Mm-hmm.

625
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,210
Otherwise you're gonna get swallowed up in Hollywood, right?

626
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,380
- That's right. - None of my friends is gonna believe this.

627
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,080
- Take the ticket, you go. - Take your ticket. Show 'em all that ticket.

628
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,150
- Yay. - Thank you, guys.

629
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,690
See you later.

630
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,820
- I like her. - Oh, jeez.

631
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,660
I can't believe this is happenin' to me.

632
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,890
Yeah, I like her voice.

633
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,330
- She's authentic. - Sweet girl.

634
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,900
- She's Rike. - Wow, okay.

635
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,800
Whoo!

636
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,900
Ow! Whoo!

637
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,370
Man, I'm going to Hollywood.

638
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,070
I'm gonna ride on an aeroplane.

639
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,540
And eat peanuts on a aeroplane.

640
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,710
- Have you been on a plane before? - No.

641
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,040
- You've never been? - No.

642
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,980
Goodbye, Vonore, Tennessee!

643
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:43,610
Mom, I am going to Hollywood.

644
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,990
Whoo!

645
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,530
# seems so small #

646
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,950
With that, a very successful day one

647
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:56,840
in Atlanta comes to a close.

648
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,570
Coming up, day two brings incredible highs.

649
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,770
# and I #

650
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,110
Oh, god.

651
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,440
# I #

652
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,610
And unbelievable lows.

653
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,480
And who is Kara?

654
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,150
I ain't never heard of that.

655
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,050
As the amazing talent...

656
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,590
- Whoo-hoo! - I'm loving Atlanta.

657
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,990
Stays alive.

658
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,790
Have you ever died before?

659
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,590
All right, Mary. Mary's upset.

660
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,365
It's early in the morning here in Atlanta,

661
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,560
And our crew is finishing last-minute preparations

662
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:37,540
for the start of the second day of auditions.

663
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,350
Outside, enthusiastic crowds are lining up.

664
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,280
Remember this face.

665
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,020
Upstairs, our judges are getting settled in.

666
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,220
- Yeah. - Oh, let's do it.

667
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,605
And yesterday must have been a good day,

668
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,760
because today Simon is far less cranky than normal.

669
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,200
My name is Simon.

670
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,800
- Hi. - I'd like to sing.

671
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,420
You know, people come to this show to change their lives,

672
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:03,870
to turn their luck around.

673
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,410
I think this next contestant

674
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,470
could use a little bit of that.

675
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,740
I'm Jesse Hamilton.

676
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,450
I'm 26 years old, and I'm from Anniston, Alabama.

677
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,150
I've come close to death quite a few times.

678
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,680
Well, tell me about the close calls.

679
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,820
What do you mean?

680
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,380
I've almost died three times in the last...

681
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:19,690
My whole life, so...

682
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,160
- You almost died... How old are you? - 26.

683
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,890
- You almost died three times? - Yeah.

684
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,490
When I was real young, I had tick fever.

685
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,870
My grandpa came in and found me in my crib.

686
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,200
He said I was limp as a dishrag.

687
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,970
So I almost died, they said.

688
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,060
Well, I was out shooting pistols with my buddy,

689
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:45,880
and I almost got hit by a speeding bullet.

690
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,190
The third one, I almost got ran over in my yard,

691
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:51,080
uh, about two months ago.

692
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,320
Whoo!

693
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,230
Missed me about from there to you.

694
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,060
- Wow. - Yes.

695
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,870
It's just the good lord looking at me.

696
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,200
That's all it is.

697
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,770
Just blessed. He's got a reason for me.

698
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,100
That's the way I look at it.

699
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,400
You're excited to be here.

700
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,840
- Yeah. - You've been through a lot.

701
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,610
You're a survivor.

702
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,080
Are you a good singer?

703
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,780
We'll find out.

704
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,210
Oh, hey.

705
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,550
- Hey. - How are you?

706
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm all right. How about you?

707
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,450
- Uh, what's your name, please? - Jesse Hamilton.

708
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,750
Jesse Hamilton. Um, have you ever died before?

709
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,390
I've came close, but, you know, I'm blessed.

710
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,490
Oh, I thought he was saying he looked like he had died.

711
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,990
Have you ever sang in public before?

712
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,330
- No, sir. - No.

713
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,100
Have your friends heard you sing?

714
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,430
- No. - Right.

715
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,960
No one's ever heard you sing apart from your mother?

716
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,300
- Just my mom. - Good, Jesse.

717
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,230
Okay. Uh, what's the song, please?

718
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,740
Can I try a Garth Brook's song?

719
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,970
That's what I want to try.

720
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,110
They said I'm good at that.

721
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,740
- I want to try that. - Go on.

722
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,650
Oh, man, I'm...

723
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,360
I done froze. I'm so sorry.

724
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,660
- It's just... - What...what was the name of it?

725
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,490
She's upset.

726
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,860
- It's okay, Mary. - What was the name of it?

727
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,730
Garth Brooks, um...

728
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,070
The river. That's it.

729
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,400
Oh, it was the river. The river.

730
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,600
Garth Brooks.

731
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,950
- Okay. - Okay, Mary, it's okay.

732
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,540
If I can get the first line going, I...

733
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,010
It'll be okay. All right, Mary. Mary's upset.

734
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,140
- Mary, honey. - Mary's having a hard time.

735
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,740
You better do it quick, because Mary's really...

736
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,680
Mary's having a hard time.

737
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,850
Mary's feeling your pain and

738
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,250
your loss and everything.

739
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,920
Oh, god.

740
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,220
I'm so sorry, I can't...

741
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,880
Go for it, man.

742
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,420
The river.

743
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,990
Go ahead.

744
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,090
# sailin' on the river... #

745
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,730
And, um...

746
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,230
Sorry. We're okay, now.

747
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,330
- I'm just... - Sail down the river.

748
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,000
I'll try.

749
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,430
If I had the first sentence...

750
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,270
I got a mental block all of a sudden.

751
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,200
I could go with...

752
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,770
Does anyone know the song?

753
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,510
Uh, I know Garth Brooks

754
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,840
If tomorrow never comes.
"If tomorrow never comes"

755
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,740
Very sad, though.

756
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,510
# if tomorrow never comes #

757
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,880
Yeah.

758
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,480
# will you know how much #

759
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,050
# I loved her #

760
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,160
# did I try in every way #

761
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,230
# to show her every day #

762
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,830
# that she's my only one #

763
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,630
# and if my time on earth #

764
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,070
# were through #

765
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,770
# and she must face this world #

766
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,370
# without me #

767
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,870
Okey, what was that?

768
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,110
It was Garth Brook's, man.

769
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,280
If tomorrow never comes.

770
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,680
I didn't recognize that.

771
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,020
Um, Jesse, I mean, look.

772
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,020
The whole thing was terrible.

773
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,395
Uh, you're a nice guy,

774
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,760
but this is absolutely not for you.

775
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,990
And you're a welder, right?

776
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,660
Yes, that's right.

777
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,230
There's nothing wrong with that.

778
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,890
Go back to weld.

779
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,330
- Are you good in welding? - It's dangerous.

780
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,830
It's dangerous in here too, honey.

781
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,760
Well, if anyone's gonna survive welding, it's you.

782
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,770
It's fine, you know...

783
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,170
Did you just say, "if anybody's gonna survive..."

784
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,970
Well, because this guy's got nine lives.

785
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,140
Oh, my god.

786
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,710
That's a great profession for you.

787
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,370
It's true.

788
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,060
Okay, yeah, Jesse, full house, four noes,

789
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:04,140
But thank you very much.

790
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,480
- All right, thank you. - Sorry, Jesse.

791
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,010
That way.

792
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,820
# sometimes late at night #

793
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,220
- Whoa, look out. - I'm all right.

794
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,090
# and watch her sleeping #

795
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,760
He's coming down.

796
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,530
# she's lost in peaceful #

797
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,360
# dreams #

798
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,370
# so I turn out the light #

799
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,030
Didn't make it.

800
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,000
- Didn't make it? - No, they tore me up, man.

801
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,600
They crucified me, man.

802
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,670
Right there.

803
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,310
Take care, guys. Appreciate it.

804
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,210
We'll see you later, yeah?

805
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,555
Though his idol journey may be over,

806
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,480
this definitely won't be the end of Jesse.

807
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,195
With his chin held high,

808
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,220
he'll hopefully move on to greener and safer pastures.

809
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,110
And by mid-morning, misfortune seemed to plague everyone

810
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:56,430
that stepped foot into the judging room.

811
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,400
Honey, I'm sorry.

812
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,730
It's not good news.

813
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,970
I want this so badly.

814
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,500
No, dude, you're not ready yet.

815
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,240
You need more experience.

816
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,270
They're gonna take my dream away from me.

817
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,980
# if tomorrow never comes #

818
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,260
I think that could get quite annoying,

819
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:18,180
actually, if I'm being honest.

820
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,020
Simon is...

821
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,030
He said I was whiny.

822
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
# if tomorrow never comes #

823
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,560
I'll get my guitar and I guess I'll just be singing the blues on the way home.

824
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,360
Coming up...

825
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,900
# and I #

826
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,530
Oh, god.

827
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Can Atlanta turn its luck around?

828
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,100
Hi.

829
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,900
Maybe.

830
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,810
Y'all!

831
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,810
Or maybe not.

832
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,140
It's gonna take an arresting performance to save the day.

833
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,140
The senior police officer is hot.

834
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,370
We are back in the great state of Georgia.

835
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,795
A couple of seasons ago,

836
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,430
we introduced instruments to the idol stage,

837
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:01,610
And since then it's made for

838
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,450
some pretty spectacular performances.

839
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,700
However, in that first audition in front of the judges,

840
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,880
You can't play an instrument.

841
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,560
I think our next contestant may have found a loophole.

842
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,410
My name's Holly Hardin, I'm 20 years old,

843
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,830
And I'm from Rockmart,Georgia.

844
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,460
And I'm a human guitar.

845
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,160
My friend's like, "you look cute!"

846
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,930
And everybody was like,

847
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,930
"Holy... Let me tune your guitar."

848
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,570
They were like, "let me strum you."

849
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,400
What's bigger, your glasses or your voice?

850
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,540
Probably my voice.

851
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,910
- Yeah? - Yeah.

852
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,580
I think when I go in there to see the judges,

853
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,180
I'm gonna do really good.

854
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,950
This might be a little bit distracting for the judges.

855
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,580
Are you worried about that at all,

856
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,830
that this might be a distraction, that it might...

857
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,940
No, I think it's kinda cute. I'm the next...great thing.

858
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,160
Guitar girl.

859
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,920
Holly, head on up there. 27.

860
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,360
All right. That's the number.

861
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,190
# we're gonna rock #

862
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,920
# this town #

863
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,290
# rock it inside out #

864
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,500
Whoo!

865
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,500
- Wow. - Hi.

866
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,600
- Hello, Holly. - Hi.

867
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,540
Why have you walked in as a guitar?

868
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,980
Well, because, like, I was a guitar for Halloween,

869
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,520
And everybody was like, "that's so cute."

870
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,960
So I figured, since I sing,

871
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,100
I was gonna be a guitar.

872
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,280
- Right, okay. - I got my glasses too.

873
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,310
You want to see these?

874
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,620
Oh, yeah, let's get the whole visual.

875
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,580
Yep, that just completes everything, Holly.

876
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,590
That's it.

877
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,420
Do you think you can win this show?

878
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,790
I do, I do think I can be the next American Idol.

879
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,490
All right, Holly, and what's the song?

880
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,330
Um, You ain't woman enough to take my man, by Loretta Lynn.

881
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,330
Wow.

882
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,630
All right, we're all yours,

883
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,900
Holly.
Holly

884
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,130
# you come to tell me #

885
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,670
# somethin' #

886
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,410
# you say I ought to know #

887
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,580
# he don't love me anymore #

888
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,280
# and i'll have to let him go #

889
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,320
# say you're gonna take him #

890
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,980
# oh, but I don't think #

891
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,820
# you can #

892
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,490
# 'cause you ain't woman #

893
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,490
# enough #

894
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,560
# to take my man #

895
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,760
Do you understand how this...

896
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,200
You can keep them on. Okay.

897
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,030
- How... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,040
Slightly bizarre this is that you're dressed as a guitar,

899
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:10,210
but also look a little bit like an insect

900
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:11,810
singing country and western?

901
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,040
I think it's cute.

902
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,040
Well, I know it's cute.

903
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,180
It just wasn't quite what we were looking for,

904
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:18,250
I don't think, Holly, when we set out this year.

905
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,440
But you're fun.

906
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,850
You've got great personality.

907
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,850
And I can always lose the guitar outfit.

908
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,320
- Really? - Yeah!

909
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,950
Okay.

910
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
Of course!

911
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,090
Randy, what do you think?

912
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,090
You're funny, Man.

913
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,460
You're hilarious.

914
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,530
You are.

915
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,460
Kara, what do you think?

916
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,635
You know, Holly, normally,

917
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,670
If someone dressed up in a guitar like that,

918
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,030
I just would write them off.

919
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,805
But I kind of...

920
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,500
She's a ballsy girl to come in like that in that getup.

921
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,370
And, you know, you got a good voice.

922
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,370
Thank you.

923
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,370
You do, you're like a country girl.

924
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,910
What do you think, Mary?

925
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,540
I don't get it.

926
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,450
Not many people do.

927
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,580
- Well, we're gonna vote. - OK

928
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,080
Randy.
Randy

929
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,150
Since I love the guitar, I'm gonna say yes.

930
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,665
- Kara. - The whole thing's crazy,

931
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,020
but I did hear some singing talent in there.

932
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,520
I feel like I got to give you another shot.

933
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,360
- Yes. - Mary.

934
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,030
I would say no.

935
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,130
Come on, Simon.

936
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,300
You're gorgeous.

937
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,560
Oh, come on.

938
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,060
He is.

939
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,790
Do you honestly think that I'm the sort of person

940
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,910
that would respond to that kind of flattery?

941
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,630
Aah!

942
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,350
I got it!

943
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,790
We've got our first person

944
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,220
from day two heading to Hollywood.

945
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,150
Whoo! Going to Hollywood!

946
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,020
Going to Hollywood!

947
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,835
But unlike Holly and her guitar,

948
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,560
right now the judging room needs some tuning.

949
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,800
# nothing's real #

950
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,370
# I just dream about you, baby #

951
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,800
It's like a cat barking.

952
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,000
- Huh? - Yeah, pretty much.

953
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,040
It shouldn't happen.

954
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,610
# when will my reflection #

955
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,680
# show who I am #

956
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,650
# insi-i-ide #

957
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,250
Terrible. No, no.

958
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,250
Singing's not your thing.

959
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,250
Don't... don't even...

960
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,850
Don't gas yourself up like this.

961
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,390
Britney Spears changed your life?

962
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,660
What if it's not good news?

963
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,830
- What are you gonna do? - What's that mean?

964
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,530
It is what it is.

965
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,760
All right, good. Good luck.

966
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,130
# oops, you #

967
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,870
# think that I'm standing #

968
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,470
# from above #

969
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,840
# I'm not that innocent #

970
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,840
Oops is right.

971
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,100
Well, Britney Spears may not have changed

972
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,950
the next contestant's life,

973
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,360
but she's hoping to get a trip to Hollywood that will.

974
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,320
- Hello, Mallory. - Hello.

975
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,250
Uh, so you're Mallory Haley.

976
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,490
You're 20. From where?

977
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
Winner, South Dakota.

978
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,520
Wow, okay.

979
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,140
All right, so what are you gonna sing today?

980
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm going to sing Piece Of My Heart.

981
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,650
Go for it.

982
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,800
# each time I tell myself #

983
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,180
# I think i've had enough #

984
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,890
# well, I'm gonna #

985
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,650
# show you, baby #

986
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,110
# that a woman can be tough #

987
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,010
# so come on, come on #

988
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,340
# come on and take it #

989
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,650
# take another little piece #

990
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,250
# of my heart now, baby #

991
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,950
# take another little piece #

992
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,590
# of my heart, I know you will #

993
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,620
# and break it #

994
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,890
# break another little piece #

995
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,520
# of my heart now, baby #

996
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,360
# 'cause you know you got it #

997
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,030
# if it makes you feel good #

998
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,360
# so good #

999
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,500
All right, cool.

1000
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,730
Uh, Mary, what do you think of Mallory?

1001
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,370
She... wow.

1002
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,570
I hope I'm not premature.

1003
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,510
She could go to Hollywood.

1004
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,180
Like some... that was great.

1005
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,140
That was the best vocal I heard.

1006
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,150
Thank you.

1007
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,480
Like, I mean, it was just dope.

1008
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,150
That was beautiful to me.

1009
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,550
- I liked it. - Thank you.

1010
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,380
I really like her too.

1011
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,730
I mean, I think what's great about you

1012
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,310
is you came in here, you know who you are,

1013
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,770
you know what you want to do.

1014
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,190
I think you got a good look too.

1015
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,940
I think you're a really beautiful girl.

1016
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,580
I like you being a country singer,

1017
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,290
and I like that you claimed and owned that.

1018
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,300
You got a good voice.

1019
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,500
What I was really impressed about was that.

1020
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,685
The fact was is that you were fearless

1021
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,800
during that audition, and it didn't...

1022
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:02,940
Didn't let it show.

1023
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,810
You had great fun, great energy.

1024
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,840
Emm... and I like you.

1025
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,340
Randy, yes or no?

1026
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,380
Yes.

1027
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,710
- Mary? - That was great. I say yea

1028
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,110
- Kara. - So yea, yea, 100%.

1029
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,310
- Amazing. - You got four yeses.

1030
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,620
Welcome to Hollywood! Go!

1031
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,020
Beautiful girl, right?

1032
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:24,950
- She's great. - She's good.

1033
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,890
Yep, it was effortless and she was confident.

1034
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,850
Bam!

1035
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,520
So Mallory nabs a golden ticket.

1036
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,860
And there were plenty more to go around in Atlanta.

1037
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,730
Yay!

1038
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,400
I'm loving Atlanta.

1039
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,800
Atlanta is fire right now.

1040
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm going to Hollywood, Baby!

1041
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,210
Yeah!

1042
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,150
After the break, can Georgia keep this winning streak alive?

1043
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,380
# and with a broken wing #

1044
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,590
They're gonna have to stick

1045
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,840
together to make it through.

1046
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,790
What happens if somebody

1047
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,970
makes it and somebody doesn't?

1048
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,240
That's not gonna happen.

1049
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,030
This is gonna be really

1050
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,730
awkward for the two of you now.

1051
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,750
The best friend I could ask for.

1052
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Welcome to Atlanta.

1053
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,140
Ah.

1054
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,720
It's a little past noon here in Atlanta,

1055
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:26,740
and you know what that means.

1056
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,950
It's time for some Skiiboski.

1057
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,980
Skiiboski.
Skiiboski

1058
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,420
Skiiboski is the thing.

1059
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,290
Skiiboski, Baby.

1060
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,920
My name Antonio Willa,

1061
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,060
but people call me Skiiboski.

1062
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,830
# skii-bo-ski #

1063
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,180
And please say the Baby.

1064
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,910
Skiiboski, Baby. Yeah.

1065
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,935
When I dance, I ski, and when I blow,

1066
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,240
I blow out miles when I sing my R&B.

1067
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,470
So all you gotta do is just watch TV.

1068
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,475
And you gonna see,

1069
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,410
I'm gonna blow your mind indeed.

1070
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes, Skiiboski.

1071
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,520
S-k-i-i-b-o-s-k-i.
S-k-i-i-b-o-s-k-i.

1072
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
There's only one "i" on that.

1073
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,520
Okay, we got a misprint.

1074
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,810
When I get in that judge room,

1075
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,060
they gonna throw their hands up.

1076
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,560
"Skiiboski, we been waiting on you."

1077
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,460
I am the next American Idol.

1078
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,970
Baby! Skiiboski.

1079
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,570
Of course. Yes.

1080
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,770
Skiiboski.
Skiiboski

1081
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,220
Is that what that says on your shirt?

1082
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,570
Skiiboski. Skiiboski.
Skiiboski Skiiboski

1083
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,040
But it's spelled wrong.

1084
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,040
Right?

1085
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,795
Oh, well, you know,

1086
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,520
that's what we got discounts for.

1087
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,850
You know? Just keeping it real.

1088
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,250
So you're the next big thing?

1089
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,750
- Biggest thing. - You, for sure?

1090
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,520
Phenomenal.

1091
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,420
- We're gonna be blown away? - Blown away.

1092
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,090
Yeah, he says it.

1093
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,070
Mary's just gonna, like,

1094
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,420
get out of her chair and scream.

1095
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,720
All right, so wait a minute.

1096
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,660
- What you gonna sing? - Grapevine.

1097
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,360
Go for it.

1098
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,360
# I bet you wonder #

1099
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,460
# how I knew #

1100
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,070
# 'bout your plans #

1101
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,240
# to make me blue #

1102
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,640
# with some other guy #

1103
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,870
# that you knew before # that y#

1104
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,810
# between the two of us guys #

1105
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,440
# you know I love you more #

1106
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,150
# oh, I heard it #

1107
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,640
# through the grapevine #

1108
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,130
Whoo.

1109
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,320
# and I'm just about #

1110
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,240
# to lose my mind #

1111
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,310
# honey, honey, yeah #

1112
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,440
Antonio.
Antonio

1113
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,420
It's more... it's a package deal.

1114
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,760
It's a package?

1115
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,110
Really? What else?

1116
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,110
Because I'm liking the dollar store.

1117
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,780
What?

1118
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,580
You know, with the dollar store,

1119
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,620
even with the dollar store,

1120
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,480
you can have everything you want in that one package.

1121
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,260
And it don't cost you no more than a dollar.

1122
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,160
- Dollar killer? - Okay, look... - I'm worth a lot.

1123
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,390
That didn't even make sense,

1124
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,330
- what you were just saying. - No.

1125
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,730
Like the dollar store?

1126
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,200
He just said he's worth a dollar.

1127
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,060
Look, to be honest with you,

1128
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,530
the outfit kind of put me off.

1129
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,640
Um, the singing was awful.

1130
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,200
The dancing was terrible.

1131
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,840
- Oh, come on! - Oh.

1132
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,710
What do you think, Kara?

1133
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,140
I mean, I gotta tell you,

1134
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,680
I thought when you walked in here, Skiiboski,

1135
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:57,125
whatever is going on here,

1136
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,110
that it was gonna be a disaster.

1137
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,980
Really.

1138
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,220
And you really had a good voice.

1139
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,490
Well, once you feel me, I feel you.

1140
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,490
You know what, I...

1141
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,920
What else is there to feel now

1142
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:09,120
since I felt you today?

1143
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,390
I'm really impressed.

1144
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,990
Vocally, Man, you have...

1145
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,230
You have a great voice.

1146
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,780
Um, image-wise, if you can make

1147
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,700
that match what your vocal is doing,

1148
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,670
you gonna be all right.

1149
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,700
Well, I'm preppin'.

1150
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,670
I'm gonna prep for you. Believe that.

1151
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,610
Heh, thank you.

1152
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,410
- Okay, now... - Listen, let me just say...

1153
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,885
You got some good vocals,

1154
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,410
but I would lose all the other nonsense.

1155
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,180
Okay.

1156
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,650
All right, let's take a vote here.

1157
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,680
- Sime. - A resounding no.

1158
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,090
Mary, yes or no?

1159
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,050
I absolutely think he should go to Hollywood.

1160
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,460
His voice shouldn't ever go to waste.

1161
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,690
I'd let him go.

1162
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,260
- Kara, what do you say? - Antonio, I'm buying in.

1163
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,530
You got a yes from me.

1164
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,900
Okay, and before you speak,

1165
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,810
acknowledge that I am acknowledging good music,

1166
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,980
and you made some.

1167
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,640
What in the world are you saying, Man?

1168
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,640
Shut up.

1169
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,910
You're through to Hollywood.

1170
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,010
What is all this nonsense?

1171
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,140
Yes! Take it! Go!

1172
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,510
- My God. - Bye, Antonio.

1173
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,680
Skiiboski, Baby.

1174
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,920
Yes, Skiiblow, Skiiblow.

1175
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,090
Skiiblowski.
Skiiblowski

1176
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,720
Skiiboski, baby!

1177
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,990
Yeah! Yeah!

1178
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,860
This is not a joke.

1179
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:22,960
That guy is serious.

1180
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,000
I was shocked that that came out of his mouth.

1181
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,820
I was shocked that he could even sing,

1182
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:28,400
'cause it was like, oh, my god.

1183
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,780
Believe me, it takes more than a shirt to explain.

1184
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,040
Skiiboski, baby.

1185
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,210
S-k-double-i-b-o.

1186
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,210
You already know.

1187
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,310
American Idol, next one. Yeah.

1188
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,150
Skii-bo-ski!
Skii-bo-ski!

1189
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,480
Skii-bo-ski!
Skii-bo-ski!

1190
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,990
Skii-bo-ski!
Skii-bo-ski!

1191
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,590
Skii-bo-ski!
Skii-bo-ski!

1192
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,960
Skii-bo-ski!
Skii-bo-ski!

1193
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,780
Atlanta is moving along nicely.

1194
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,800
But there are still hundreds left to audition.

1195
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,320
Contestants spend a lot of hours waiting for their turn.

1196
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,020
And many bring along a close friend to keep them company.

1197
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,540
Oh, I'm loved.

1198
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,010
I'm loved.

1199
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,080
And back in the holding room,

1200
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,130
we met two girls who knew the meaning

1201
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,090
of best friends better than anyone.

1202
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,180
Hey, I'm Carmen Turner. I'm 19.

1203
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,350
And I'm Lauren Sanders, and I'm 18.

1204
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,550
- And we are BFFs - For life.

1205
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,820
Let's talk about the friendship here.

1206
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,320
How long have you been friends?

1207
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,990
We have been friends since...

1208
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,360
third grade.

1209
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,260
We spend every weekend together.

1210
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,070
We're BFFs, remember?

1211
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,070
What happens if somebody makes it and somebody doesn't?

1212
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,540
That's not gonna happen.

1213
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,570
You're both gonna make it.

1214
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
Duh!

1215
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,140
Simon and Randy...

1216
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,680
if you let us go...

1217
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,480
unforgivable!

1218
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,450
Carmen and Lauren...

1219
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,920
Need to go to Hollywood!

1220
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,850
Hello.

1221
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,760
- Hi. - Hello.

1222
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,920
- How are you? - I'm starstruck.

1223
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,030
- Are you starstruck? - Yeah.

1224
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,560
- I'm Lauren. - And I'm Carmen. Carmela.

1225
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,670
Are you guys sisters or best friends or...

1226
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,700
We're best friends.

1227
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,670
You guys get in trouble together, the two of you?

1228
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,170
Too much trouble.

1229
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,700
I bet, I bet.

1230
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,010
We give our parents trouble.

1231
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,130
Anyone who walks in here like that looks like

1232
00:44:15,165 --> 00:44:16,840
she's gonna get into some trouble.

1233
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,780
Are you gonna sing together or what?

1234
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,480
No, we have totally, totally,

1235
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,640
totally different voices.

1236
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,320
Okay, who's the better one?

1237
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,550
You'll have to see.

1238
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,110
- Well, who do you think? - We're the same.

1239
00:44:26,145 --> 00:44:26,750
We're equally...

1240
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,450
I believe we're equally talented.

1241
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,050
Okay. Annoying, annoying.

1242
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,350
What are you gonna sing?

1243
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:34,350
Mmm... my pants

1244
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,820
- No, you're lying. - What?

1245
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,920
I was just kidding.

1246
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,030
Lauren, okay, you go first.

1247
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:38,930
What are you gonna sing?

1248
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,590
All right, I'll go ahead and tell you all,

1249
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,650
I got a soft voice,

1250
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,920
but you all are gonna love it.

1251
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,020
- Okay. - I doubt that.

1252
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,370
I'm so nervous, so I'm sorry.

1253
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,570
Carmen, you just need to

1254
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,940
stand away from Miss annoying.

1255
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,040
I'm so nervous.

1256
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:55,380
# I'm awake in the infinite #

1257
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,880
# cold #

1258
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,850
# but you sing to me #

1259
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,180
# over and over and over again #

1260
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,280
Okay, that was beautiful.

1261
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,490
Okay, Carmen, your turn.

1262
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,690
# where is your heart #

1263
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,230
# 'cause I don't really #

1264
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,660
# feel you #

1265
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,670
# where is your heart #

1266
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,730
# what I really want #

1267
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,900
# is to believe you #

1268
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,710
# is it so hard #

1269
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,170
# to give me what I need #

1270
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,940
# I want your heart to bleed #

1271
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,780
# that's all I'm asking for #

1272
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,780
Okay.

1273
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,250
Thank you very much.

1274
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,420
Come on back together, you two.

1275
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,145
I think, Carmen,

1276
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,190
you were obviously better than your friend.

1277
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,215
Um, having said that,

1278
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,220
I would be in a group, the two of you,

1279
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,790
because you're really, really funny together.

1280
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,230
- You are. - No, you are,

1281
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,030
you're hysterical.

1282
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,450
And then when one of you leaves the other one,

1283
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:52,530
you become boring.

1284
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,370
And then you're back together, and you're fun.

1285
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,270
I'll practice all y'all want me to.

1286
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,300
You should be in a group.

1287
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,140
My nerves are getting to me so bad.

1288
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,170
You could be like the ditz sisters or something.

1289
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,710
- The what? - The what?

1290
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,120
- Ditz sisters. - The ditzies?

1291
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:04,900
'Cause you're ditzy.

1292
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,910
- You could be the ditzies. - The ditz.

1293
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,450
Randy, yes or no to Lauren?

1294
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,280
I would say yes to Carmen and no to Lauren

1295
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:13,220
Based on the vocals, honestly.

1296
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,200
Please, please.

1297
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,720
I'll practice. I promise.

1298
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:17,440
All right. Okay, Kara?

1299
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,620
Sweetie, Lauren, part of being best friends,

1300
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,875
you gotta support your best friend,

1301
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,910
'cause she did a little bit better than you.

1302
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,830
I disagree.

1303
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,230
I'd either want to go up together

1304
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,450
or down in flames together.

1305
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,850
No, if they're good friends,

1306
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,690
they'll support each other no matter what.

1307
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,280
Can I sing another song or something?

1308
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:32,810
No, no, honey.

1309
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,900
So wait, I gotta say, um,

1310
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,140
yes to Carmen and no to Lauren.

1311
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,270
I'm sorry, honey.

1312
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,080
- Mary. - I'm gonna say yes to Carmen.

1313
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,110
I'm so sorry. This is hard.

1314
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,700
Well, look, if it's any comfort,

1315
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,830
I would have said no to both of you.

1316
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,640
Um, but right now, Carmen,

1317
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,890
You're through.

1318
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,850
This is gonna be really awkward for the two of you now.

1319
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,530
Hug it out. Hug it out, hug it out.

1320
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,630
Oh, guys.

1321
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,330
Oh, this sucks!

1322
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,615
Carmen, if it's any consolation,

1323
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,830
I don't think you're going to

1324
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,390
be away from her for too long, so...

1325
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,040
You're going to Hollywood, Carmen!

1326
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,610
Whoo!

1327
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,140
She wasn't that bad, Carmen.

1328
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,280
But you guys still be best friends, promise us.

1329
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,850
Love each others forever.

1330
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,590
I couldn't ask for a better friend in life.

1331
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,160
I don't care what anybody says.

1332
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,320
It's a lifetime friendship.

1333
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,730
You don't find that.

1334
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,030
It's all right, Darling.

1335
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,130
- I'm sorry. - It's fine.

1336
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,670
I'm proud of you.

1337
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,770
You'll support each other.

1338
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,500
# keep smiling #

1339
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,940
# keep shining #

1340
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,740
# knowing you can #

1341
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,680
# always count on me #

1342
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,940
How difficult was that for you?

1343
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,810
I'm gonna support her 100% of the way.

1344
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,450
Are you upset?

1345
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,180
I'm fine, I'm glad for her.

1346
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,920
A lot of mixed emotions.

1347
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,960
I wouldn't have gotten this far without you, Lauren.

1348
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,420
Don't worry about it.

1349
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,960
Best friend I could ask for.

1350
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,460
# that's what friends #

1351
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,300
# are for #

1352
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,940
Let's hope their friendship will continue

1353
00:48:04,975 --> 00:48:06,770
through these tough times.

1354
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,440
And we will continue after a break.

1355
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,340
Coming up, the sweet Georgia peaches turn sour.

1356
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,810
# lovin' that man of mine #

1357
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,050
Is that a motor or something going on in your throat?

1358
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,210
It's like, "uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh."

1359
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,760
And a street-tough cop blows away the judges.

1360
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,470
You know, this is what I love about this job.

1361
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,750
Welcome back to Atlanta.

1362
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,480
We're over halfway through

1363
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,390
the second day of auditions,

1364
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,870
and right now, a batch of southern belles

1365
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,010
are clanging in the room.

1366
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,940
# tell me I'm crazy #

1367
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,910
# maybe I know #

1368
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,280
# and I just can't help #

1369
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,720
# lovin' that man of mi-ine #

1370
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,060
# and I, I #

1371
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,290
Oh, god.

1372
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,160
# will always love you #

1373
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,260
# ooh ooh #

1374
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,600
# and with #

1375
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:10,040
# a broken wing #

1376
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,740
# she carries her dreams #

1377
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,740
- Should I stop? - Yes.

1378
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,680
Do people tell you, sweetie,

1379
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,080
you're a good singer?

1380
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,410
Well, not really.

1381
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,680
But I don't let them discourage me.

1382
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,980
Is there a motor of something going on in your throat?

1383
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,420
It's like, "uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh."

1384
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,190
Why did you stop?

1385
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,990
Because of your facial expressions.

1386
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,030
- What were they like? - Dreadful.

1387
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,530
# do re fa so la #

1388
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,300
Huh?

1389
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,230
I don't know what else to say.

1390
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,630
That's all I needed to hear.

1391
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,360
- Okay. - That's fine.

1392
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,630
Well, then, we'll leave it at that.

1393
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,810
So Simon's ears were now ringing.

1394
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,970
A little migraine.

1395
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,210
A little one?

1396
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,580
So he stepped out for a minute,

1397
00:49:50,615 --> 00:49:51,880
leaving the rest of the panel

1398
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,550
to take a few auditions on their own.

1399
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,120
Or was he really just avoiding the next contestant?

1400
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,180
I'm Bryan Walker.

1401
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,390
I'm 25 years old.

1402
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,620
I'm a police officer in Sevierville, Tennessee.

1403
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,900
Favorite part of my job is just getting the chance

1404
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,120
to go out and protect, one,

1405
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,710
the people that I love in the town,

1406
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,290
in the hometown that I've grown up in.

1407
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,860
and, two, just to get a chance to help people out.

1408
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:12,560
All right, Sir, you have a safe day.

1409
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,300
- Make sure you buckle up. - All right.

1410
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,500
If I do make it on to Hollywood,

1411
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,220
I know it would completely change my life.

1412
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,820
I love my job, but I really want to

1413
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,490
get a chance to, uh, chase a dream.

1414
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,230
When I see the judges,

1415
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,180
I'm gonna show them exactly what I'm there to do,

1416
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,160
which is sing, to win America over,

1417
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,850
and be the next American Idol.

1418
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,970
What's going on, ATL?

1419
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,910
ATL! Come on, ATL.

1420
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,840
How you doing?

1421
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,730
Good. How are you?

1422
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,790
So you are currently a police officer?

1423
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,050
Yes, Sir. Sure am.

1424
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,420
- Ah, serving and proud, right? - Yes, Sir.

1425
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,890
- I like that. - That is good.

1426
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,160
So what are you gonna sing?

1427
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,715
I'm actually gonna sing Superstar

1428
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,200
in the style of Ruben Studdard.

1429
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,900
- You ready? - Sure.

1430
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,940
# long ago #

1431
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,810
# and, oh, so far away #

1432
00:50:54,870 --> 00:51:00,050
# I fell in love with you #

1433
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,820
# before the second show #

1434
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,350
# whoa oh oh oh oh #

1435
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,620
Hmm.

1436
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,050
# don't you remember #

1437
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,660
# you told me you loved me #

1438
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,520
# baby #

1439
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,130
# and you said you'd be coming #

1440
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,060
# back this way again #

1441
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,500
# baby, baby, baby, baby #

1442
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,840
# oh, baby #

1443
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,170
# I love you #

1444
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,680
# I really do #

1445
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,380
God, you know, this is what I love about this job,

1446
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,650
'cause this guy comes in, and you think,

1447
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,880
"oh, here we go."

1448
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:41,020
But you know what?

1449
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:43,890
- That... was great. - Thank you.

1450
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,860
This guy could sing, right?

1451
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:46,980
I agree with Kara.

1453
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,840
You know, the thing that I love the most about you,

1454
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:51,155
you being a police officer,

1455
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,400
you look nothing like what you sound like.

1456
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,370
I love the fake out like that.

1457
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,110
You know what I'm saying?

1458
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,780
I do too.

1459
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,400
The singing police officer is hot, Dude.

1460
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,640
You... I... whew!

1461
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,770
You can sing, man.

1462
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,710
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1463
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,970
You have the type of voice

1464
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,240
where you don't have to try to prove anything.

1465
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,410
It's just there.

1466
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,920
I think we can expect the unexpected from Bryan.

1467
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,850
- Yes! - That's what I'm feeling.

1468
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,520
What do you think?

1469
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,090
Yes! Hollywood for Bryan!

1470
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,220
Yes, I say yes!

1471
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,090
You're going to Hollywood. Welcome to Hollywood.

1472
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,360
- Three yeses! Hollywood! - Thank you so much.

1473
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,590
- You're awesome. - The singing police officer.

1474
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,960
I like it, Man.

1475
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,100
Hey.

1476
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,630
I have never seen a policeman

1477
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,900
so excited to get a ticket.

1478
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,020
But our next contestant wasn't just

1479
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,290
thinking about Hollywood.

1480
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,510
He had someone special looming in his head.

1481
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,380
Oh, wow, I'm...I'm very excited about performing

1482
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,610
in front of Mary J. Blige.

1483
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,380
Um, she's like a... she's an idol herself.

1484
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,420
She's just this big superstar,

1485
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,690
and I really want to meet her.

1486
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,020
Today, no matter what the judges say,

1487
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,310
I will respect their opinion and...

1488
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,730
I love taking constructive criticism.

1489
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,330
And that's what I plan to do.

1490
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,530
# baby #

1491
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,370
# I compare you to a kiss #

1492
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,600
# from a rose on the gray #

1493
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,040
# ooh, the more I hear of you #

1494
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,980
# the stranger it feels, yeah #

1495
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,280
# now that your rose #

1496
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:14,650
# is in bloom #

1497
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,080
# a light hits the gloom #

1498
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,690
# on the gray #

1499
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,520
Powerful, Lamar.

1500
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,290
Randy.

1501
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,660
Lamar, Man, I got mad love for you, Man, but...

1502
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,260
that was kind of torturous, Man.

1503
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,560
I mean, I, you know... torturous?

1504
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:32,760
Pitch was all over the place.

1505
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,370
It was like, I don't...Dog...

1506
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,770
Can I do another song for you?

1507
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,140
No, no, it's not that, Man.

1508
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,170
I just don't think you're that good, Man.

1509
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,810
Sweetie, you know, you're 19 years old.

1510
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,180
- I'm 20. - Okay, 20.

1511
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,710
Y... I'm not gonna say that you're a terrible singer.

1512
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,380
I'm really shocked, 'cause that's not true.

1513
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,680
Hold on, I'm not gonna say...

1514
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,090
No, she said she's not saying that.

1515
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,560
Dog, are you a good listener?

1516
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,120
I am a very good listener.

1517
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,830
Okay, so listen to us for a second.

1518
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,200
It wasn't great.

1519
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,390
There's a voice in there somewhere.

1520
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,960
You need to do a lot of work.

1521
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,430
I don't even know if you're really, for this level...

1522
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,300
# la la la #

1523
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,870
No, Dog. Dog, Dog, Dog...

1524
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,270
Don't sing anything else.

1525
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,330
Dog! Listen, I asked if you were a good listener,

1526
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:15,310
and you keep singing.

1527
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,080
I am, 'cause I... I just can't believe...

1528
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,810
Lamar, let me give you one little bit of advice.

1529
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,350
What is going on?

1530
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,120
I want to just share something with you.

1531
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,945
You have to find some humility

1532
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,320
in order to do this and pull back...

1533
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,050
I want to...

1534
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,320
Listen, and stop trying to exalt yourself.

1535
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,490
And that's what you're doing.

1536
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,060
You're running, so just...

1537
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,990
- relax. - You need to do the work, Sweetheart.

1538
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,860
You haven't done the work yet. So let's take a vote.

1539
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,060
Lamar, no.

1540
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,170
I'm gonna say no, 'cause you're

1541
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,230
not ready yet, Dog.

1542
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,500
I feel your passion.

1543
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,000
But see, you're not even listening.

1544
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,870
# baby, I compare you to #

1545
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,710
# a kiss from a rose #

1546
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,870
Lamar, what are you doing?

1547
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,310
You all mother.

1548
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,210
Lamar, we're trying to help you.

1549
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,080
I don't understand. I really don't understand.

1550
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,980
Lamar, listen. Listen, Sweetie.

1551
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,550
You're all telling me, basically, I can't sing.

1552
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,390
- No, we said... - That's an insult to me.

1553
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,820
Nobody said you couldn't sing.

1554
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,590
Nobody said that.

1555
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,720
It wasn't great today, Dog.

1556
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,360
You're not ready for this level.

1557
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,560
- Are you serious? - Yes.

1558
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,130
We're trying to find the best... you weren't the best.

1559
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,830
We are trying to help you Honey, we're not trying to hurt you.

1560
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,030
# la la la la la la #

1561
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,570
Honey, right off the bat.

1562
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,740
It's just...

1563
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,070
# la la la #

1564
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,540
# la la la la la la #

1565
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,180
Work on that vibrato, Dog.

1566
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,310
You all,

1567
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,080
Mother.

1568
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,520
Oh! That's... that's not...

1569
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,580
Oh, really? We love you!

1570
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,820
Mother!

1571
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,990
That is not cool.

1572
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:39,190
Just the whole damn American Idol show.

1573
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,630
Mary J. Blige, all that.

1574
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,260
That can't sing, neither.

1575
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,900
She can't sing a lick.

1576
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,430
Ooh, I started ducking,

1577
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,330
'Cause I didn't know he was...

1578
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,570
I started acting like...

1579
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:48,430
Whack singers!

1580
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,405
'Cause I didn't know

1581
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,440
if he was gonna pull out a gun or what.

1582
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,510
And who is Kara? Who is she?

1583
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,270
I ain't never heard of that.

1584
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,370
I wish Paula was here.

1585
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,540
Randy, I thought you were gonna get up and...

1586
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,780
I started getting my duck ready.

1587
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,380
Get my duck ready!

1588
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,780
Mary J. Blige said I can't sing.

1589
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,690
That can't sing a lick!

1590
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,950
He's crazy, Man.

1591
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,520
Mary, that boy is crazy right there.

1592
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,710
That boy is crazy right there.

1593
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,930
What are you looking for? All right, this whole American Idol thing ain't

1594
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,860
# la la la #

1595
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,100
# la la la #

1596
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,900

1597
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,340
# ha la #

1598
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,540
# la la #

1599
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,310
Y'all!

1600
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,940
It's American Idol coming

1601
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,680
Ain't! The mother!

1602
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,850
Still to come, we're wrapping things up in the ATL.

1603
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,760
And our last audition proves to be, uh...

1604
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,590
You'll have to watch it for yourself.

1605
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,560
I have a horrible feeling that song could be a hit.

1606
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,700
After the break.

1607
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:02,710
Welcome back.

1608
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,670
We're wrapping things up in Atlanta.

1609
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,560
But before the Georgia sun sets,

1610
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,110
we've got one last audition to show you.

1611
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,110
Hello.

1612
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,510
Your name is Larry Platt?

1613
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,910
My name's General Larry Platt, yes.

1614
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,920
- A general? - General Larry Platt.

1615
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,180
Oh, you're a General, okay.

1616
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,950
I want to sing my song called Pants On The Ground.

1617
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,120
Pants On The Ground?

1618
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,760
Pants On The Ground.

1619
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,860
Okay, what's it about?

1620
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,460
People need to pull their pants up.

1621
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:29,330
All right.

1622
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,260
Okay. Ready when you are.

1623
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,830
- Okay, ready? - 1, 2, 3.

1624
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,270
# pants on the ground #

1625
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,800
# pants on the ground #

1626
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,800

00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,360
# lookin' like a fool #

1646
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,160
# with your pants #

1647
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:00,960

# gold in the mouth #

1649
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,060
Okay. Okay!

1650
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,000
Thank you.

1651
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,470
# talkin' with your pants on the ground #

1652
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,500
# boom, yeah #

1653
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,970
Whoa! Careful.

1654
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,170
# lookin' like a fool #

1655
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,840
# with your pants #

1656
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:15,540

# pants hit the ground #

1660
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,110
Larry, Larry...
Larry Larry...

1661
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,250
Thank you.

1662
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:26,680
Larry, what was that song called?

1663
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,820
Pants on the ground.

1664
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,560
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1665
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,160
Positive?

1666
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,150
You know, I have a horrible feeling

1667
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,790
that song could be a hit.

1668
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,555
Yeah. I'm gonna get my pants,

1669
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,330
and I'm gonna buy some belts after this.

1670
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,720
Yeah. Yeah, a lot of belts.

1671
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,340
- Larry, can I ask you a question? - Yes.

1672
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,200
- How old are you? - 62 years old.

1673
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,610
What? 62 years old.

1674
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,340
Good for you.

1675
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,610
This year'll be my birthday on the 27th.

1676
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,060
Okay, the only slight problem, Larry,

1677
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,810
is that you're a little bit over the age limit,

1678
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,080
which is 28.

1679
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,230
But I don't think this is gonna be

1680
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,430
the last we hear about you.

1681
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,770
I have a feeling about you, Larry.

1682
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,010
And we learned something today, Larry.

1683
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,520
You know what we learned?

1684
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,560
# pants on the ground #

1685
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,030
Both: # pants on the ground #

1686
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,360
# lookin' like a fool with #

1687
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:11,600
# your pants on the ground #

1688
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,160
Larry, thank you.

1689
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,070
I'm now going to buy a belt.

1690
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,380
With our pants pulled up and our belts tightened,

1691
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:20,370
we say good-bye to Atlanta.

1692
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,870
We gave out 25 golden tickets

1693
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,140
and found some amazing talent.

1694
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:28,550
And we learned a very important lesson.

1695
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,550
# pants on the ground #

1696
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,650
# pants on the ground #

1697
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,580
# you lookin' like a fool #

1698
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:32,420
# with your pants #

1699
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,150
# on the ground #

1700
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,120
# with the gold in your mouth #

1701
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,550
# hat turned sideways #

1702
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:36,890
Yes!

1703
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,960
Consensus, Atlanta.

1704
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,920
Gang, how'd we do?

1705
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,990
# hey, get your pants #

1706
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:41,960
# off the ground #

1707
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,860
I'm going to Hollywood!

1708
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:46,860
- What'd you think of Mary? - Very harsh.

1709
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,170
I think this show has changed you.

1710
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:51,300
You know what? I think so too.

1711
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,070
# call yourself a cool cat #

1712
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,370
# lookin' like a fool #

1713
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,340
# walkin', talkin' with #

1714
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,780
# your pants on the ground #

1715
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,680
# gold in your mouth #

1716
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,680
Both: # with your hat #

1717
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,440
# turned sideways #

1718
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,450
# pants hit the ground #

1719
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,650
# walkin', talkin' #

1720
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,410
# with your pants #

1721
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,520
# on the ground, get it up #

1722
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,580
- Is that an original? - Right.

1723
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,820
All right.

1724
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:08,890
All: # pants on the ground #

1725
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:10,250
# pants on the ground #

1726
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,260
# lookin' like a fool #

1727
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:11,920
# with your pants #

1728
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,820
# on the ground #

1729
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,060
# Hollywood, Hollywood #

1730
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,060
# let's go to Hollywood #

1731
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,200
Hey!

1732
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,570
Hollywood.

1733
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,270
Hollywood, you got it.

1734
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,140
All right, that is Atlanta.

1735
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,140
We move on.

1736
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,610
Pack the bags, roll 'em out.

1737
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:28,870
That's a wrap.

1738
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,610
A real superstar, Ryan.

1739
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,940
Pants on the ground.

1740
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:35,550
General Larry Platt, out.

1741
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:39,890
Next week, we encounter one of our biggest Idol audition crowds ever.

1742
01:00:39,925 --> 01:00:43,620
As idol takes on the midwest, Chicago-style.

1743
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,520
# ah, ah, yeah #

1744
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:50,390
Along the way, we'll hear some amazing voices...

1745
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,130
# don't you be usin' #

1746
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,830
# every day #

1747
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,170
100 million percent yes.

1748
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,270
See some familiar faces...

1749
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,370
I remember this girl.

1750
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,570
And make some new friends.

1751
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,310
Get the out of my face.

1752
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,080
As the windy city talent...

1753
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,380
# aah #

1754
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:08,310
No.

1755
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,350
- blows the judges away. - Whoa!

1756
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,330
Join us next week as

1757
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:14,320
American Idol rolls through Chicago.

1758
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,120
# aaah #

1759
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,430
Do you find when you sing at home,

1760
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,350
a lot of animals turn up outside the house?

1761
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,920
Stop it!
