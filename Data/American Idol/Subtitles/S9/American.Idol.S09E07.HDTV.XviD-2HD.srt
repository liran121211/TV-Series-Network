1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,422
Tonight on Idol, we reach new heights in the Mile High City

2
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:07,306
as Season Nine takes to Denver, Colorado.

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,408
Denver rocks! Whoo!

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:13,012
Prepare yourself as the altitude brings out the tension...

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,381
Please get that camera out of my face.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,281
The terrible...

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,718
You just killed every cat in Denver.

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,320
and the talent.

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,055
# something kinda ooh #

10
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,590
Best voice today in Denver.

11
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:28,994
And watch out as one Denver contestant takes it to the limit.

12
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,430
Buckle up, because...

13
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,333
This is American Idol.

14
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,033
You all know this guy.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,903
His band had 20 number one hits around the world...

16
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,872
Platinum four times over...

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,274
Safe to say, a household name.

18
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,642
# every time #

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,944
# you turn around #

20
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:20,279
# whoo-hoo #

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,980
Well, there was a time...

22
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,716
Let's call it September 2005...

23
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:29,521
when Chris Daughtry was just another face in the Denver crowd.

24
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,823
Four years later, that crowd has doubled in size,

25
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,861
making it twice as hard to get to Hollywood.

26
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:36,528
Yeah!

27
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,697
But these people were far from failing.

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,500
Oh, yeah, American Idol is mine! Boom!

29
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,403
Denver has the next American Idol, and it is Moi.

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,572
I'm the next American Idol!

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,376
No! I'm the next American Idol!

32
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,115
So they had the confidence.

33
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,650
But do they have the talent?

34
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,522
American Idol, Denver, yeah!

35
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:06,024
There was only one way to find out.

36
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,827
So we set up shop as the judges rolled in.

37
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,062
How are you guys?

38
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,496
Rejoining us on the panel,

39
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:12,831
Victoria Beckham.

40
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,132
Wow!

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,302
The altitude left the judges a little confused.

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,637
I thought this was Chicago.

43
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,604
No, it's Atlanta.

44
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,505
Austin.

45
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,406
Hi.

46
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,075
Kara, Kara!

47
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,076
Ha!

48
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,879
Not surprisingly, the girls were first to their seats,

49
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,782
giving Randy the chance to offer some insight on today's guest judge.

50
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,950
I actually like her.

51
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:32,885
Yeah, yes, you do.

52
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:33,719
You fancy her, don't you?

53
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,653
I think she's cool.

54
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,687
And listen, by the way, listen.

55
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,256
You know what someone said to me?

56
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,174
"I know Victoria's here,

57
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,192
but you're like the darker version of David Beckham."

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,861
I go, "I've been told that, yeah."

59
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,163
Literally separated at birth.

60
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,401
In your dreams, Jackson.

61
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,657
Mistaken identity was also an issue for

62
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:53,339
our first contestant of the day, Mark Labriola.

63
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,810
I probably get at least once a day that I look like Jack Black.

64
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,213
You know, I don't have a problem being compared with, like,

65
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,381
the ugliest guy in Hollywood,

66
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,916
You know, 'cause he's funny.

67
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,918
And I'm sure he gets girls.

68
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,920
So I deal with it, you know?

69
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,523
I am feeling stoked about today.

70
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,192
I mean, this is the day,

71
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,026
You know?

72
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,342
I'm the guy doing the thing that dude's do, and I'm here.

73
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,867
Hello.

74
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,066
Chello!

75
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,836
- Good, what's your name? - My name's Mark.

76
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,072
Okay, so tell me something interesting about you.

77
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,907
Well, I, uh...

78
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,342
I love cheese.

79
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,810
Yeah, what else?

80
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,481
Um, as a child, my mom took me when as a young kid.

81
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,550
We were kind of on the run for six years.

82
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,284
Yeah.

83
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,703
And I, you know, lived all over the place in tents

84
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,455
and cars and Hare Krishna temples...

85
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,057
On the run from what?

86
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,260
Um, well, my mom took me against the will of my dad.

87
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,261
And how old were you?

88
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,395
I was four years old.

89
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,964
So you're like a fugitive.

90
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,925
- Not good to be on this show, then. - Not a fugitive.

91
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,202
I think... wouldn't that be if I like escaped from prison?

92
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,637
I was like Harrison Ford or something?

93
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,471
No, but you were on the run.

94
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,171
Yeah.

95
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,806
Yeah, and did you get back with your father?

96
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,081
Yeah, my dad found me when I was 10

97
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,411
and brought me here to Colorado, so...

98
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,013
Okay, where did that leave your mother?

99
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,281
Uh, it left her in Maui, and, uh...

100
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,449
Maui?

101
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,717
You made it all the way to Maui?

102
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,319
Yeah, we lived in Hawaii,

103
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,553
and we lived in Alaska...

104
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,755
So she hasn't tried to get you back now?

105
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,589
I got a kid of my own,

106
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,524
so he lives with me...

107
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,059
You don't live with your parents?

108
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:20,793
No, you don't.

109
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,261
You're old enough to live on your own.

110
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,329
Exactly, yes!

111
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,697
What's happening here?

112
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,299
So your child is not in Maui now.

113
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,300
What are you doing, man?

114
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,002
My child's here in Denver!

115
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,770
Would you take your child to Maui?

116
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,538
Okay, that's it.

117
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,173
I would take my child to Maui.

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,641
I can't, I can't.

119
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,909
I would take my kids to Maui.

120
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:37,977
Let's take our kids to Maui.

121
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,778
Maybe we all could go to Maui.

122
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,479
What are you gonna sing?

123
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,348
I'm gonna sing " Tempted " by Squeeze.

124
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,148
Good luck.

125
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,849
Go ahead.

126
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,718
# I bought a toothbrush #

127
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,152
# some toothpaste #

128
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,088
# a flannel for my face #

129
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,423
# pajamas, a hairbrush #

130
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,792
# new shoes and a case #

131
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,995
# I said to my reflection #

132
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,298
# let's get out of this place #

133
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,899
# past the churches #

134
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,501
# the steeple #

135
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,536
# the laundry on the hill #

136
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,537
# the billboards #

137
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,805
# and the buildings #

138
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,707
# A memory of them still #

139
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,376
# keep calling #

140
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,210
Okay.

141
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,344
I was really surprised.

142
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,977
I mean, when you walked in, at first, I got a little bit angry

143
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:17,950
because I thought that you were kind of gonna do something quite jokey.

144
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:18,751
Yeah, I hate that.

145
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,981
Yeah, when there are so many people that come such a long way,

146
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,789
and those people are wasting time.

147
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,291
So that was a really nice surprise, right?

148
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,627
Yeah, and you were very, very honest about your background,

149
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,661
which I liked.

150
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,797
And he grilled you on the background.

151
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,765
Oh, yeah.

152
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,967
I do think you should go to Maui and meet your mom.

153
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,636
Well, my mom lives in North Carolina.

154
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,138
I thought she was in Maui.

155
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,072
Oh, god, please!

156
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,906
No, we lived in Maui,

157
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:41,640
and then...

158
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,508
Randy, yes or no?

159
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,675
Randy, yes or no?

160
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,077
- You didn't tell me that. - What is this, man?

161
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,378
You didn't tell me that.

162
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,513
What are we saying to this guy?

163
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,280
Yes or no, Randy?

164
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,248
I'm saying yes.

165
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,115
Victoria.

166
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:50,816
I'm saying yes.

167
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:51,850
Kara.

168
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,152
100% yes.

169
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,920
Okay, you're through to the next round.

170
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,388
Welcome to Hollywood!

171
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,756
I'm confused.

172
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,590
Me too.

173
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,525
Really?

174
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,794
Yes! Whoo!

175
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,594
Oh!

176
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,029
Whoo!

177
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:04,930
Yeah!

178
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,968
This is for my little boy, Ian, and, uh,

179
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,938
also my mom who couldn't be here. Yeah!

180
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:13,839
I don't know, you know,

181
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,940
I thought my time was over.

182
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:15,974
You know, I'm, like, 28.

183
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,739
You know, I have a kid, and I just thought,

184
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,946
"Well, you know, my dream's done."

185
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,682
And, uh, I don't know.

186
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,050
That's not the case!

187
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,286
It's not over yet.

188
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,121
So that's cool.

189
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,155
Really cool.

190
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,890
Mark made it to Hollywood,

191
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,581
leaving a room full of people upstairs hoping they

192
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:36,562
just make it through the auditions.

193
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,933
Let's not forget, trying out for this show is a big deal...

194
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,001
the lights...

195
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,237
the cameras...

196
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,338
Him.

197
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,272
I'm kind of nervous.

198
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,540
You guys are awesome!

199
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,810
So it's only normal for people to feel a little anxious.

200
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,878
It's a big day for me.

201
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,548
And everybody deals with their nerves in their own way.

202
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,083
I have some xanax.

203
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,952
Some turn to a higher power.

204
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,420
Father god, you're...

205
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,057
And others try to hide behind costumes.

206
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,459
Some people have a nervous tick...

207
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,461
while others...

208
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,463
a queasy little laugh.

209
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,567
Meet Mario Galvin.

210
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,535
Hello.

211
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,636
Hello.

212
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,271
Hello. What's up?

213
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,206
Oh, everything and anything.

214
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,241
How are you doing?

215
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:22,975
Your name is?

216
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,109
My name is Mario.

217
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,144
Mario.

218
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,979
Mario.

219
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,380
Okay, and what do you do, Mario?

220
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,084
Uh, currently I'm working as a nicotine addictions counselor.

221
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,051
Okay, apart from that...

222
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,988
why are you here?

223
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,024
I'm here because I'd like to be the next American Idol.

224
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,927
Okay.

225
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,196
You have very white teeth as well.

226
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,931
What are you going to sing today?

227
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,967
I will perform Elvis Presley's " Jailhouse Rock ".

228
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,769
Right, okay, that's very brave.

229
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,837
Well, good luck.

230
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,138
Thank you.

231
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:54,312
# the warden threw a party #

232
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,781
# in the county jail #

233
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:56,782
# the prison band was there #

234
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,350
# and they began to wail #

235
00:07:58,418 --> 00:07:59,151
# the band was jumpin' #

236
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:01,019
# and the joint began to swing #

237
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:01,953
# you should've heard those #

238
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:03,422
# knocked-out jailbirds sing #

239
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:04,723
# let's rock #

240
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,558
# everybody, let's rock #

241
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,059
# everybody in the whole #

242
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,327
# cell block #

243
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:10,295
# was dancin' to #

244
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:11,563
# the jailhouse rock #

245
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:12,497
Whoo!

246
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,400
Okay, what's the closest

247
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:18,236
you've got to getting a break?

248
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,305
Two years ago for a Broadway

249
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:21,807
Revue here, I got the role of

250
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:23,041
"Jekyll and Hyde".

251
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:23,975
And did that show actually

252
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:24,776
open?

253
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:27,946
That's a good thing.

254
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,952
No.

255
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,554
No.

256
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:36,555
No?

257
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,222
No.

258
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,790
Life goes on.

259
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,892
And there's always next year.

260
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,127
So never give up.

261
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:47,666
Coming up, Denver's talent dominate...

262
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah!

263
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:51,069
as many contestants are headed to Hollywood.

264
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,237
Welcome to Hollywood!

265
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,273
But Kenny's not going anywhere.

266
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:57,108
Kenny, you've got to leave.

267
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,110
I can't believe this.

268
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:08,502
Denver, Colorado.

269
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,038
A city known for the great outdoors.

270
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,431
Whether you come here for the cycling, the rafting,

271
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:16,577
or the skiing, there's one guarantee...

272
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,446
the air is always clean.

273
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,748
That is, until Idol shows up.

274
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:24,185
# 'cause I hate everyone #

275
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:26,053
# I hate everyone #

276
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:26,921
Get off!

277
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:27,655
Get out of here.

278
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:28,456
I'm gonna stick you.

279
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,158
Douche bag.

280
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:33,528
American Idol.

281
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:34,662
Kiss my...

282
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,696
Camera off me.

283
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,015
I'm a hateful person.

284
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,902
They keeping people who don't know how to sing.

285
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:43,371
They take me out in handcuffs like... like I'm a criminal,

286
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,006
like I'm a little...

287
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:46,274
Yeah, you...

288
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,609
What the... do you think they told me, damn it?

289
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,211
American Idol.

290
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,047
Please get that camera out of my face.

291
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,348
Quit talking to me.

292
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,583
Unh!!

293
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,251
Despite all that negative energy...

294
00:09:58,253 --> 00:09:58,953
there was so hope in the

295
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,721
shape of our next contestant.

296
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:04,325
Meet Kimberly Kerbow and her five-year-old daughter Amelia.

297
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:07,562
My mom is Aamerican's...

298
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,363
next American Idol.

299
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,998
One more time, one more time.

300
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,067
All right, take two.

301
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,436
Amelia, say "my mom is..."

302
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,004
"My mom is..."

303
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:21,676
My mom is the next American Idol!

304
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:23,277
There you go!

305
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:24,779
Exactly.

306
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,480
Ready to do this?

307
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,682
Yes, I am ready.

308
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:28,816
What are you singing today?

309
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:31,385
"The way I am" by Ingrid Michaelson.

310
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:32,520
All right, let's hear it.

311
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,555
Go for it.

312
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,659
# 'cause I love the way #

313
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:41,963
# you say good morning #

314
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,031
# and you #

315
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:49,003
# take me the way I am #

316
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,038
# I'd buy you rogaine #

317
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,440
Okay.

318
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:53,808
# when you start #

319
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,843
# losing all your hair #

320
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,712
- Wait a minute... - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

321
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,981
You said "you'd buy him rogaine" and you looked at Simon?

322
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:02,483
I would buy him rogaine if he needed rogaine.

323
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,551
Don't you think he has thick,

324
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:04,452
lovely hair?

325
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,319
Kimberly, yes, thank you.

326
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:08,823
I don't think I need it quite yet, but thank you.

327
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,191
I didn't say yet, but,

328
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:11,359
you know, in a few years, it'll start...

329
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay, right, okay.

330
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:14,128
Kimberly, have we met before?

331
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,663
Am I missing something?

332
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,665
It's like saying to someone "I'll buy you a wheelchair."

333
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,166
Yeah!

334
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,101
And a cane!

335
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:21,469
Okay, let's go back to you.

336
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:22,603
You're a single mom.

337
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:23,738
Yes, I am.

338
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:24,872
I wonder why.

339
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,107
Um...

340
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:26,941
Stop it.

341
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,275
Simon, that's not nice.

342
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:29,610
Simon, that's mean.

343
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:30,878
Kidding!

344
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,647
But you like Simon's hair, though.

345
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:33,848
It's... Of course I do.

346
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:34,815
I love his hair.

347
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:36,717
Good. Okay, Randy, yes or no?

348
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:37,952
Uh, I'm gonna say yes.

349
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,153
Oh, thank you!

350
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:39,987
Victoria.

351
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,122
I'm gonna say definitely yes.

352
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:42,256
Okay.

353
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:43,090
Kara.

354
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,025
I'm gonna say yes, too.

355
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,192
Oh, my god, thank you.

356
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,128
Kimberly, you're very lippy,

357
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,964
but you're very funny, and I'm gonna say yes.

358
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:51,499
Whoo-hoo!

359
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:52,333
Welcome to Hollywood!

360
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,334
Thank you so much!

361
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:54,301
I think you're trouble,

362
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:55,069
though, Kimberly.

363
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:56,203
Oh, no, I promise,

364
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:56,971
no trouble.

365
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,005
Look at me.

366
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:58,939
That's trouble.

367
00:11:59,007 --> 00:11:59,607
We'll see.

368
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:00,307
Off you go.

369
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,108
Celebrate.

370
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,143
Welcome to Hollywood!

371
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,843
Thank you!

372
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:03,778
Go and talk to your ex.

373
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,353
Can't believe you said that.

374
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,020
That was funny.

375
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:13,855
Well, sorry.

376
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,323
That was bad, though.

377
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,291
No, but someone comes in and talks to me about going bald,

378
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,293
and you wonder why she's a single mom.

379
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:20,628
The irony was, I think she was wearing a wig.

380
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,730
No, she was not wearing a wig!

381
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:23,431
- She was. - She was. Because it won't be me, but I konw that.

382
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:24,232
Thank you.

383
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,299
She was wearing a wig?

384
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:26,434
Thank you.

385
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:28,836
Do you know why mom's so happy?

386
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,638
Because she's going to Hollywood!

387
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,639
Yeah!

388
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,040
# I'm a winner #

389
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:36,344
And Kimberly wasn't the only one headed to Hollywood.

390
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,571
As day one progressed, it seemed like everybody who

391
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,550
walked into that room heard the very same word.

392
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:43,317
Yes.

393
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:43,918
Yes.

394
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:44,585
Yes.

395
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:45,386
I'm gonna put you through.

396
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:46,187
Thank you, yeah!

397
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:47,221
Welcome to Hollywood!

398
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,222
Whoo!

399
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,056
The confidence the

400
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,526
contestants had shown may have been warranted after all.

401
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:53,761
Hollywood!

402
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:56,564
The judges were seriously loving the talent.

403
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:57,632
Wow.

404
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,400
God, we're putting 'em through, huh?

405
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:04,372
And our next contestant is hoping a golden ticket is also in her future.

406
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,640
My name is Danielle Hayes.

407
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:08,342
I'm 24 years old from Seattle, Washington.

408
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,234
And I host a live Karaoke, and do a little bit of

409
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:13,381
song writing and singing on the side.

410
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,716
I didn't exactly choose the easiest path.

411
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,652
It's really hard to make a living off of this.

412
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,122
And having a little three-year-old boy at home makes it even that much tougher.

413
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,158
# now I'm ready #

414
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:26,594
# to rise again #

415
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:29,788
So this would be an incredible opportunity to kind of

416
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:32,800
get to that next level so I can support my family.

417
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,268
Hello!

418
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,069
Hello.

419
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:35,870
How are you?

420
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:37,738
Oh, my God, I'm a wreck.

421
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,073
You nervous?

422
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:42,610
It's just, um... it's pretty crazy to be here.

423
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:45,313
And just watching everybody go through everything, it's just kind of emotional.

424
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,648
- Oh. - What do you do for a living, Danielle?

425
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,283
I host a live Karaoke,

426
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,651
and I sing in a cover band.

427
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,586
Wow.

428
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:52,453
Do you hate it?

429
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:53,421
Yes!

430
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:54,922
Why are you crying?

431
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,558
It's just been quite a ride.

432
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:58,259
Wow.

433
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:00,394
What do you mean by "quite a ride"?

434
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:04,413
I, um, decided a couple years ago to... to really start pursuing it,

435
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:07,668
and it's just... it's a lot more work than you think...

436
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,669
- It's hard. - when you got the dreams...

437
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:09,704
- It is. - so...

438
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:10,705
It's very, very hard.

439
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,794
A lot of bars, a lot of casinos,

440
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:16,043
a lot of corporate parties, and putting on a smile,

441
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:17,345
And...

442
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:18,813
But you're here today,

443
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,247
and this is your shot.

444
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,816
What are you gonna sing today?

445
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,619
I was gonna do "I'm the only one" by Melissa Etheridge.

446
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,020
Okay.

447
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:28,522
# and I'm the only one #

448
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,459
# who'll walk across the fire #

449
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:35,196
# for you #

450
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,698
# and I'm the only one #

451
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:40,534
# who'll drown in my desire #

452
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:43,738
# for you #

453
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,206
# it's only fear #

454
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:46,540
# that makes you run #

455
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:47,708
# the demon #

456
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,344
# that you're hiding from #

457
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:52,480
# when all your promises #

458
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:53,814
# are gone #

459
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:54,482
Thank you.

460
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:58,653
# I'm the only one #

461
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,254
I like you.

462
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,490
Um, but I think, for whatever...

463
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:06,299
I don't know what's going on in your life, but you're almost broken,

464
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,996
where you may have come in here just in time...

465
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:09,930
Yeah.

466
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,832
to rescue you from corporate hell.

467
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,500
Yeah.

468
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,537
Couldn't have said it better myself.

469
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:19,840
I don't think you've been allowed to be who you should be,

470
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:21,676
and I think you're a good singer.

471
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:24,516
For me, this was the most moving audition,

472
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:28,516
and what people look for when you're singing is to be moved.

473
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,017
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

474
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:32,687
I'm gonna say yes, 100%.

475
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:35,690
This girl's got a great voice and a bright future.

476
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:36,357
Victoria?

477
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:37,525
And I'm gonna say yes.

478
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:39,889
I think you're gorgeous, and I think you should take that little boy out

479
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,029
and celebrate with him, 'cause I think you're gonna go a long way.

480
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:44,432
I love that you wear your heart on your sleeve.

481
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:45,533
It's priceless.

482
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,202
And I'm gonna say 100% yes.

483
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,036
Simon?

484
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:50,204
And I'm gonna say yes.

485
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:50,971
Welcome to Hollywood!

486
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,806
Thank you.

487
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,307
I will not let you down.

488
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,477
Yes, Danielle, today is your day.

489
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,979
Yes!

490
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,648
# wanting more #

491
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:05,319
# before it slips away #

492
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:08,823
This opportunity means that it's not all in vain.

493
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,978
You know, maybe it's possible that I can really do this and that

494
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:16,939
I can support my son, and I can raise my son doing something that I love to do.

495
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,669
Still to come, the judges are looking good.

496
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:22,937
That is a photograph,

497
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:23,704
Not a drawing.

498
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:24,472
Yeah.

499
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,007
The talent keeps getting better.

500
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,509
Best voice today in Denver.

501
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:29,777
You're going to Hollywood!

502
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:34,515
And if you thought Simon was full of it, wait till you see these guys.

503
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,716
I'm a great singer.

504
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,577
Welcome back to Denver, baby!

505
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:52,153
The Denver talent has been impressive,

506
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:55,552
but it's not just the voices the judges have been noticing.

507
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,253
Yo, y'all look for me.

508
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,254
No, look for me.

509
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,088
Look for me.

510
00:16:58,156 --> 00:16:59,256
Don't look for her.

511
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:01,550
With posh back on the judging panel,

512
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:05,262
It's more important than ever to come dressed to impress.

513
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,596
Hot dog in the house.

514
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:07,764
# fashion #

515
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:11,601
What I like about you is I think you do have natural style.

516
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,602
He's got a great look.

517
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,105
Yeah, a great look.

518
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:15,939
# fashion #

519
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,607
There's some funny hair going on here.

520
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,109
I love the fro.

521
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,612
# fashion #

522
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,947
She won me over with the boots.

523
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:25,449
I was like, "yeah, they're nice."

524
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:26,283
So you like the boots.

525
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,950
You like the eyes.

526
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:27,617
What did you like, Randy?

527
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:29,286
I actually like the voice.

528
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:30,554
Oh, yeah.

529
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:34,091
Casey James wasn't too worried about what he was wearing.

530
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,959
He was just happy being here.

531
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,127
When I was 21 years old,

532
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,463
I was in a motorcycle accident.

533
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,051
I remember thinking this truly is the end of my life.

534
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,401
It definitely changes you forever.

535
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:48,270
I had mutip-compound fractures in my femur,both bones and my arm and wrist

536
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,046
The doctor said that I would never play guitar again.

537
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:53,762
There's quite a bit of pain that I go through on a day-to-day basis,

538
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:57,748
but I think it's a miracle that... that things happened the way they did.

539
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:01,144
My whole goal in this entire situation is to make it to Hollywood,

540
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:02,784
because if I can just get there,

541
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,921
I really think I've got a shot, you know.

542
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:05,922
# it's not a silly #

543
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,424
# little moment #

544
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,425
# it's not the storm #

545
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:10,427
# before the calm #

546
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:11,261
# this is a deep #

547
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,929
# and dying breath of #

548
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:13,597
# this love that #

549
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:15,599
# we've been working on #

550
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,600
# can't seem to hold you #

551
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,268
# like I want to #

552
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,604
# so I can feel you in my arms #

553
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,605
All right, Casey.

554
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,106
This is a bad audition.

555
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:23,774
Yeah.

556
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,609
I disagree.

557
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:27,110
I totally disagree.

558
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:27,778
Really?

559
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:28,445
I like Casey.

560
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:29,112
Thank you.

561
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,780
I do.

562
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,114
No charisma, no effort...

563
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:32,449
But he's got a good voice.

564
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:33,116
He does.

565
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:33,784
Doesn't matter.

566
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,118
No, it does matter.

567
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:36,453
V, what did you think?

568
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,290
What do you look like with your hair down?

569
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,726
Cute.

570
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,227
He looks like a model.

571
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,896
You know, Simon, he's got a great look.

572
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:46,563
Yeah, a great look.

573
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,231
A great look, very handsome.

574
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:48,899
Wow.

575
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:51,735
You got to work on your personality 100%.

576
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:52,402
Absolutely.

577
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,104
I'm willing to do anything that I need to do.

578
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:54,738
Really?

579
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:55,605
Absolutely.

580
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:58,074
What about unbuttoning your shirt a little bit?

581
00:18:58,142 --> 00:18:59,075
Take it off.

582
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:00,577
Take the shirt off.

583
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:01,912
Take your shoes off.

584
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:02,913
I mean, what are we doing here?

585
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,414
You got to see bikini girl.

586
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:06,082
Victoria, don't you want to see it?

587
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,083
For me, it was the hair.

588
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:08,418
What are we doing?

589
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:09,920
Say yes.

590
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:11,755
Personally, I say yes.

591
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,257
I say yes, because I do think he's got a good voice.

592
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:15,592
Randy, come on, dog.

593
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,927
Swing the vote, man.

594
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:17,761
Swing the vote.

595
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:18,929
Project runway.

596
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:19,930
Yeah, I know.

597
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:21,097
It's a different show.

598
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,599
Hey, you won't regret it.

599
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,768
You are when you watch this back, Casey.

600
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,937
This is really embarrassing.

601
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:28,438
This is the boys against the girls.

602
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:29,773
I'm gonna say no.

603
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:30,941
Kara, what are you saying?

604
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,275
I'm saying yes.

605
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:33,777
Yeah, I'm saying yes.

606
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:36,613
Randy, yes or no?

607
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,449
For the girls, 'cause maybe they'll prove me wrong later,

608
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:40,951
I'm gonna say yes.

609
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,089
You got another shot, but you do got to show...

610
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,689
You got to find some star persona, build something, dude.

611
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:47,123
I won't make you look bad, man.

612
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:47,824
I won't make you look bad.

613
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,461
I'm going nuts in my mind right now.

614
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:52,128
It's just insane.

615
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:54,226
I honestly never thought in a million years that

616
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,966
I would be able to make it to Hollywood.

617
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:56,800
Yes?

618
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,301
Hey, I made it to Hollywood.

619
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,474
So Casey had the looks and the talent.

620
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,644
While Tori Kelly had her very own fan club.

621
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:09,312
Are we interrupting a kindergarten class?

622
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,980
No.

623
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:11,815
These are all friends.

624
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:12,649
They're family friends.

625
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:13,650
These are family friends?

626
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:14,317
Yeah.

627
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:15,318
My name's Tori Kelly.

628
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,209
I'm 16 years old, and I'm from Canyon Lake, California,

629
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,823
and I'm a high school student.

630
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:20,824
She a good singer?

631
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:21,491
Mm-hmm.

632
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,000
American Idol is huge to me.

633
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,600
This is, like, at the top.

634
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,470
This is, like, crazy for me,

635
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,140
and I really want it really bad.

636
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm gonna be on this show when I'm 16.

637
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,980
- You are? - Mm-hmm.

638
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,640
I'm gonna be really old when you're 16.

639
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,150
Yeah.

640
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,830
But Hope was more interested in meeting the judges

641
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,920
and made a beeline for the table.

642
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,420
Wow, is that for me?

643
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,760
Aw.

644
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,420
Wow, that is so cool.

645
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,730
Oh, Simon.

646
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,090
Why don't you give that to Simon?

647
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,200
- Wow, you're a good artist, aren't you? - You are.

648
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,860
You did these yourself?

649
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,200
- Kara. - Mm-hmm.

650
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,600
- You did this yourself? - Oh, how cute.

651
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,930
He lost his color.

652
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,440
You're a very good drawer.

653
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,940
That is a photograph, not a drawing.

654
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,940
Yeah. Simon.

655
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,940
Come on, hold it up.

656
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,940
Hold it up. Hold it up.

657
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,440
This is a photograph.

658
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,110
Yeah, that's not a drawing.

659
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,110
No, you're right.

660
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,620
Sorry, that's too accurate.

661
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,120
- That is real life right there. - Yeah.

662
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,620
- Hi, Hope. - Hi.

663
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,790
Listen, we love Hope, but we should get to...

664
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,790
Tori.

665
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,460
Tori, what's up, man?

666
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,165
You're gorgeous,

667
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,790
and that dress is gorgeous as well.

668
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,790
I love it too.

669
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,800
What are you gonna sing for us?

670
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,130
I'm gonna sing Gravity by John Mayer.

671
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,130
Okay, let's hear it.

672
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
# gravity #

673
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,140
# wants to bring me down #

674
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,480
# oh, twice as much #

675
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,250
# ain't twice as good #

676
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,410
# and can't sustain #

677
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,920
# like one half could #

678
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,420
# it's wanting more #

679
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,750
# it's gonna send me #

680
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,690
# to my knees #

681
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,990
- Thank you, Tori. - All right.

682
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,760
Tori. I really like Tori.

683
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,600
And you brought hope star in,

684
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,030
which is a definite plus in my book.

685
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,700
Hope is cool.

686
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,860
Well, if I'm being honest with you,

687
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,940
out of the two, I'd put Hope through.

688
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,110
- Oh. - Oh, no, that's ridicu...

689
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,440
Stop it. She's got a good voice.

690
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,440
Sorry, I don't think so at all.

691
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,110
I thought your voice was almost annoying.

692
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,280
Really?

693
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,280
- What'd you think, V? - Quite the opposite.

694
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,780
I mean, I love the way you look.

695
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,950
I love your turquoise.

696
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,620
- I love your dress. - Not a fashion show.

697
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,620
You look very...

698
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,290
It is about that as well, Simon.

699
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,290
It's about the whole package.

700
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,290
It's about star quality.

701
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,630
Voice is the important part.

702
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,630
You look classy.

703
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,130
Women are gonna like you.

704
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,960
You're really sunny, and that's great.

705
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,970
You're only 16?

706
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,200
You're like a human orange.

707
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,740
Let's take a vote. Randy?

708
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,070
- I'm gonna say 100% yes. - Oh, my goodness.

709
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,240
I love you... best, best, best voice today, definitely.

710
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,750
We have ended this audition day on a high.

711
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,080
- You're through. - Yes.

712
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,910
I'm gonna say no.

713
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,250
I think these three are mad, but there you go.

714
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,690
Welcome to Hollywood!

715
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,590
I'm so excited.

716
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,260
This is so amazing.

717
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,880
After our best day yet,

718
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:08,430
Tori is heading to...

719
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,600
Hollywood, Baby!

720
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,430
With 14 other contestants.

721
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,770
Can I keep this?

722
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,270
- You've gonna sign it? - Mwah!

723
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,640
I'm going to Hollywood, Baby.

724
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,245
Just say to...

725
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,780
Something like "my favorite judge."

726
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,280
I'm going to Hollywood!

727
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,950
"my favorite..."

728
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,520
- Sign it. - "judge."

729
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,120
That's very sweet of you.

730
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,120
Give me a kiss.

731
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,460
I'm going to Hollywood! Whoo!

732
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,030
Coming up...

733
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,730
It's Day two in Colorado,

734
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,840
and Denver goes the distance.

735
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,400
You flew 14 hours to make this audition?

736
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,840
As the talent reaches new peaks.

737
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,070
# ah #

738
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,910
You just killed every cat in Denver.

739
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,800
Welcome back to the second day

740
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,130
of auditions in Denver.

741
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Denver rocks!

742
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,270
After an incredibly successful first day of auditions,

743
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,590
the crowds were still feeling nothing but confident...

744
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,440
- I'm good-looking. - They will love me.

745
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,460
I'm the cream of the crop.

746
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm the creme de la creme.

747
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,780
And so were the judges.

748
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,520
Got a good feeling, a really good feeling.

749
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,210
However no one believes in

750
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,380
their own abilities more than this guy.

751
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,980
My name's Austin Paul.

752
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,695
I'm from Washington, DC,

753
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,390
and I'm a student at the University of Colorado,

754
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,060
where I study music composition and play football.

755
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,560
I'm a long snapper.

756
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,910
A long snapper is the guy that snaps the ball back,

757
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:45,160
hikes it through his legs back to

758
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,730
the holder for the kicker.

759
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,190
You know, my other teammates are jealous,

760
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,670
because I don't have to do that much,

761
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,240
and I still get fans and the joy and everything.

762
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,910
When I'm not playing football,

763
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,740
I sing all the time.

764
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,910
I sing on my moped.

765
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,510
Songs are coming to my head,

766
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:03,580
and I'll be like...

767
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,080
# do do do do do #

768
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,750
It's like, "wait. Who... did I just write that?"

769
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,370
I wrote down what I wanted to

770
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,925
accomplish before I died,

771
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,470
and number 42 was make it

772
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,300
to Hollywood on American Idol.

773
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,130
Wait, wait, wait.

774
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,500
42nd?

775
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,010
Well, what was his 41st?

776
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,380
I'm a singer, composer,

777
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:27,590
and I'm a football player?

778
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,940
# this is a call #

779
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,710
# to the color blind #

780
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,210
# this is an IOU #

781
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,220
# I'm stranded #

782
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,050
# behind the horizon line #

783
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,390
# tied up in something true #

784
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,960
# and someday I'll fly #

785
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,560
# someday I'll soar #

786
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,100
# someday I'll be #

787
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,400
# so much damn more #

788
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,900
# cause I'm bigger #

789
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,570
# than my body #

790
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,070
# gives me credit for #

791
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,580
Thank you. Randy?

792
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,740
Is that the way you normally,

793
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,240
naturally sing all the time?

794
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,250
Uh, no.

795
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,080
That's just one of the tricks up my sleeve.

796
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,020
Oh! Tricks!

797
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,580
- I like that. - Tricks.

798
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,590
Yeah, whoo! Yeah.

799
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,090
Right.

800
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Kara, what do you think of the tricks?

801
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,645
You know, the whole grabbing his pecs

802
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,470
and the "bigger than his body" thing,

803
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,260
it was just... you come off a bit... cocky.

804
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,470
Sime?

805
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,770
Um, I think you could be very annoying.

806
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,770
Oh, my god.

807
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,370
It's one of those voices,

808
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,370
- after 30 seconds, you go, "oh, shut up." - Yeah.

809
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,510
I've just been there,

810
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,710
and that's the kind of voice you've got.

811
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,880
I mean, I disagree, but,

812
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,720
you know, you're the boss.

813
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,880
- For me, it felt a little bit arrogant. - Mm-hmm.

814
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,705
And like Kara said,

815
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,220
the lyrics... bigger than my body...

816
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,750
it kind of made me go, "no, don't."

817
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,860
I got a bit itchy from it,

818
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,390
cause I thought, "no, don't do it."

819
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,890
You should almost go the other way.

820
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,390
Okay, Randy, yes or no?

821
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,390
Dog, I'm gonna say no, Man.

822
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,230
I didn't quite get it, Baby.

823
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,070
- I didn't get it. - Kara?

824
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,400
- I got to say no. - Hold on.

825
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,070
And I think we're doing you a favor by saying no.

826
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,900
I think a guy like you needs to

827
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,070
be a little bit less confident.

828
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,370
I mean, I really think, like,

829
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,910
I could really be marketed well by you guys.

830
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,910
I think, Simon, I could make you money.

831
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,910
You could be the singing football player.

832
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,080
- No. - I think it's a great story.

833
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,420
- I mean... - It is?

834
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,920
We've already said it. It's a no.

835
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,090
It's a unanimous no.

836
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,420
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

837
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,760
Thanks for turning out, Man.

838
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,430
Take it easy.

839
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,700
I mean, even his sort of strut...

840
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,700
Yeah, no.

841
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,670
"Look at me. I am fine."

842
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,870
I'm shocked. I... uh...

843
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,040
I'm just... I can still be a star.

844
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,200
I think I still will be.

845
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,870
So it was back to the bench for Austin.

846
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,725
And just when we thought the confidence

847
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,040
couldn't get any higher in the mile high city,

848
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,880
24-year-old Kenny Everett stepped up.

849
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,680
I am the world's best singer,

850
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,950
for those of you that don't know me.

851
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,560
I consider myself the male Mary J. Blige.

852
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,390
I sing in the park around my way.

853
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,090
Everybody knows Kenny.

854
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,280
My singing is sort of a public service to others,

855
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,400
because it brings the community together.

856
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,570
I'm so ready to do this.

857
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,730
That's why I can't stay still, you know?

858
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm so happy.

859
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,400
I'm ready to be the next American Idol.

860
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,910
Whew.

861
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,510
# call the radio #

862
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,110
# if you just can't be #

863
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,350
# without me, baby #

864
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,820
# hey-ey-ey-eeeyyy #

865
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,790
# ey-ey-ey-eyyyyy #

866
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,090
# yeah-eah eah-eah eah-eah #

867
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,790
# eah-eah eah-eah eah-eah #

868
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,590
# eah-eah eah-eah eah-hey #

869
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,330
# hoo-ooooh #

870
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,960
# ooh-ooh ooh-ooh #

871
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,260
# ooh-ooh ooh-ooh #

872
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,700
# hoo-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ah #

873
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,270
# ah-ah ah-ah-ah #

874
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,270
# ooh! #

875
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,200
# and I just wanna be... #

876
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:46,940
Thank you.

877
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,340
# with you-ooh-ooh #

878
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,510
Thank you. That was catchy.

879
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,880
Yeah, we saw some gutsy and ballsy there.

880
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,980
It sounded, actually, like you'd been punched.

881
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,250
Um, and you were just screaming at us, Kenny.

882
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,490
I mean, it wasn't singing.

883
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,190
It was literally screaming at us.

884
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,260
Well, maybe I should sing something for you less...

885
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,620
Only one song today, Kenny.

886
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,590
Randy, yes or no?

887
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,690
Terrible. No, man.

888
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,060
- It wasn't good, dog. - Kara?

889
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,600
Yeah, I'm sorry to say, no, Kenny.

890
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,100
- Victoria? - I'm going to have to say no.

891
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,730
I'm sorry. It's a no, Kenny.

892
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,130
You gotta be kidding me.

893
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,140
- I'm a great singer. - No, you're not.

894
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,040
I've always been told that.

895
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,810
Kenny, you're not, and you never will be, honestly.

896
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,440
# no more drama #

897
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,010
# no more, no more #

898
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,580
# hey-ey hey-ey-ey-yeah #

899
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,280
# no more... #

900
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,180
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny...

901
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,820
# no more, no more #

902
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,320
- Kenny. - It's getting louder.

903
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,150
It's getting worse.

904
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,990
# go ahead, go ahead #

905
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,820
- Kenny. - Kenny, you've got to leave.

906
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,030
It's not getting better, dog.

907
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,400
I can't believe this.

908
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,400
Yeah, but I did like the choice of song.

909
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,400
- The choice... - Victoria...

910
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,540
It was a good choice of song.

911
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,335
I love Mary J.,

912
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,710
so I thought it was a great choice of song.

913
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,340
Kenny, you've got to leave.

914
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,110
# go, go, go #

915
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,140
- That's what I'm saying. - Yeah, go.

916
00:29:59,210 --> 00:29:59,980
# go, go, go #

917
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:00,980
# go #

918
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,980
Yes, Kenny. The other way.

919
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,980
- That way, that way. - Sorry, Kenny.

920
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,990
- Excuse me. - Go, go, go.

921
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,990
Go, go out, go out.

922
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,360
Go, go, go.

923
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,920
So what has Kenny learned from this experience?

924
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,195
How can four people tell you

925
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,760
that you can't sing and you know you're a good singer?

926
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,830
Something has to be up with that.

927
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,960
Nothing.

928
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,000
# never knew what I was #

929
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:22,800
# missing #

930
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,760
But the community service continues

931
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,890
as he selflessly shares his gift with the world.

932
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,110
# ah ah-ah-ah ah ah-ah-ah #

933
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,110
# ah ah-ah-ah ah ah-ah-ah #

934
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,005
But coming up,

935
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,580
the talent in Denver goes a mile high.

936
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,580
A million percent yes. I love this girl.

937
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,150
Whoo!

938
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,540
Plus, some of our most shocking auditions ever.

939
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,120
# yeeee #

940
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,860
Oh, god, I love this show!

941
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Welcome back to American Idol.

942
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,890
We are 5,280 feet above sea level.

943
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,040
Looks nice enough.

944
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,230
But the mountain air is thin,

945
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,990
and so was the talent on day two.

946
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,860
# wha-ha- #

947
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,160
You just killed every cat in Denver.

948
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,860
# I had it all #

949
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,670
Nope.

950
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,700
# in a sad, sad #

951
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,600
# situation #

952
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,770
Was that in tune?

953
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,410
Relatively, yes.

954
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,640
# I had it all, baby #

955
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,240
They're a cruel bunch.

956
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,610
I didn't sing very well.

957
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,510
- I'm not gonna lie. - I did so bad, Mom.

958
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,150
Keep watching me till I cry?

959
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,380
# freedom... #

960
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,380
Freedom!

961
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,220
# freedom... #

962
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,020
# whoo... hoo... hoo #

963
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,790
# freedom... #

964
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,020
# yeah #

965
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,220
# a little less conversation #

966
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,230
# a little more action, please #

967
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,860
# all this aggravation #

968
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,700
# ain't satisfactionin' me #

969
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,900
What about Vegas? Right?

970
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,500
It's a holiday, yeah.

971
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,070
# gonna ring once #

972
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,940
# sing out the phone #

973
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,300
# telling me know #

974
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,270
# you made it home #

975
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,810
What is...

976
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,250
Get me out of here!

977
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,510
It wasn't good, dog.

978
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,550
It was really, really bad.

979
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,820
Oh, god, I love this show.

980
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,150
Come on, that was awful.

981
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,960
Guess I just don't have what it takes.

982
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,000
# dit dit hey ee ee yeah #

983
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,270
Okay, do you know what?

984
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,300
It's like having Paula back on the show.

985
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,610
Oh, come on!

986
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,610
Where did all the talent go?

987
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,340
I'm the next American Idol.

988
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,450
No, he ain't.

989
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,570
There were still thousands outside

990
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,650
as Denver tried to go the distance.

991
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,520
All the way from Hawaii, baby!

992
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,420
Hey, we're from Texas.

993
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,620
We're from Walla, Washington.

994
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,560
But no one traveled farther than Nicky Nix.

995
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,730
At the moment I'm living in Florence, Italy.

996
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,780
And I traveled all the way from Firenze Airport

997
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,230
to Frankfurt, Germany, to Denver, Colorado,

998
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,360
For American Idol.

999
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,100
Music, growing up, was fun

1000
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,000
because I didn't really know

1001
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,650
that, that was gonna be something

1002
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
I would end up doing.

1003
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,400
I think, at a certain point,

1004
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,840
I realized that was the only thing I really liked to do.

1005
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,580
And... then here I am.

1006
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,700
So, what... You've come a long way today,

1007
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,650
Yeah, 14 hours you flew to get here.

1008
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,290
So you flew 14 hours to make this audition.

1009
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,290
- Yes. - Wow.

1010
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,290
- I'm impressed. - Yeah, that is impressive.

1011
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,960
That's dedication.

1012
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,490
I flew from Florence to Frankfurt, Germany, to here.

1013
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,500
Ask her if she's drunk any Helium.

1014
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,190
- Why don't you ask that? - I didn't.

1015
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,860
- Go on. - What?

1016
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,570
Go on.

1017
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,220
Victoria wants to know

1018
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,800
if you've eaten any helium today.

1019
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,810
- Pardon? - Nothing.

1020
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,810
- What? - I just said... no.

1021
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,180
Simon, come on!

1022
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,180
- That is awful. - Come on, Simon.

1023
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,850
- She's teasing. - You look beautiful.

1024
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,850
- I like your dress. - Thank you very much.

1025
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,220
What are you going to sing today?

1026
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,080
Girls Aloud, "Something Kinda Ooh".

1027
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,090
Good luck.

1028
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,390
# something kinda ooh #

1029
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,620
# jumping on my toot toot #

1030
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,860
# something inside of me #

1031
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,390
# wants some part of you... ooh #

1032
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,830
# something kinda ooh #

1033
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,800
# makes my heart go boom boom #

1034
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,330
# something inside of me #

1035
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
# wants some part of you... ooh #

1036
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,600
# ooh... ooh... ooh #

1037
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,040
# when tomorrow comes, baby #

1038
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,440
# I won't even know your name #

1039
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,780
# baby, so good #

1040
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,140
# wanna follow on by #

1041
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,950
# but I'll never meet ya #

1042
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,550
# never see you again #

1043
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,950
One of the most meaningful lyrics ever written.

1044
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,790
- Better than... - I've got it... Yeah.

1045
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,560
Every time I hear that lyric I almost cry.

1046
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,690
Let's see the toot toot part.

1047
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,960
You'r jumping on Simon's toot toot.

1048
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,760
- I know. - Beautiful, beautiful.

1049
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,630
You sing so much deeper than you talk.

1050
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,030
- It's weird. - I've been told that.

1051
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,340
I've a very high voice.

1052
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,340
Yes, when you talk.

1053
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,870
And then you sing, and it goes lower.

1054
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,810
You're a funny little thing, aren't you?

1055
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,780
- What? - I really like your attitude.

1056
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,250
Um, I thought the song really suited your voice.

1057
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:49,980
I thought you sounded great.

1058
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,680
Yeah, and I like your look.

1059
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,420
- You have beautiful skin. - Thank you.

1060
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,020
All right, we're going to vote on you now.

1061
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,720
Randy, yes or no?

1062
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,720
A million percent yes. I love this girl.

1063
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,210
- Good. Kara? - A thousand percent yes.

1064
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,730
- Thank you. - Gone down a bit.

1065
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,580
- Yes. - You've got four yeses.

1066
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,730
You're going to Hollywood!

1067
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,730
- Can I go out this way? - Yeah!

1068
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,330
Grazie!

1069
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,740
- She's cute. - Grazie! Mille Grazie!

1070
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,980
Ma, I made it to Hollywood.

1071
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,650
Oh, my god!

1072
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,690
So Nicky's off to Hollywood on a high.

1073
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,660
Coming up, she was a miracle baby.

1074
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,320
I'm lucky to be here. I was two pounds.

1075
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,320
Like, I couldn't even...

1076
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,360
I couldn't breathe by myself.

1077
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,860
- Can she work magic with the judges? - Right.

1078
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,860
Is Hayley going to Hollywood?

1079
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
It's 7:00 in the evening,

1080
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,790
And the Denver auditions are coming to a close.

1081
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,790
The thousands who arrived with so much confidence

1082
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:58,520
Are now leaving, dejected.

1083
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,925
I just don't wanna go home

1084
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,160
and tell anybody that I didn't make it.

1085
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,360
That's it. It's over.

1086
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,325
In the face of so much disappointment,

1087
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,700
Hayley Vaughan was trying to stay positive.

1088
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,000
After all, she'd been a fighter right from the start.

1089
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,010
I was born June 5, 1993.

1090
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,310
Um, I was premature.

1091
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,780
I was supposed to be born in August,

1092
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:17,640
I was born in june.

1093
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,240
And I fit in my mom's hand.

1094
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,510
Two pounds.

1095
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,780
I couldn't breathe by myself.

1096
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,020
And I had a heart monitor.

1097
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,450
So I'm pretty lucky.

1098
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,450
I'm a miracle child. Hah!

1099
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,730
When I was ten years old my dad passed away,

1100
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:30,490
and that was really hard for us.

1101
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,420
I loved being with him. And he always sang to me.

1102
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,590
And so I think I got a little bit of my voice from him.

1103
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,140
But we're getting through it. And now we're here.

1104
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,500
And if he could see it, it would be so awesome,

1105
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,870
'cause he'd be so proud.

1106
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,430
My mom is so excited to be here.

1107
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,900
She's wanted this forever too.

1108
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,880
Like, she said that when she first saw the show,

1109
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,790
she was like, "my daughter's gonna be on that,

1110
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:48,570
she can do that."

1111
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,860
I hope I can really pull through for my family

1112
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,030
because we're going through a lot of stuff, you know?

1113
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,170
So if I can be the first

1114
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,910
black pop country kinda mainstream singer,

1115
00:36:57,945 --> 00:37:00,130
it would change my life completely.

1116
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,560
# today I woke up #

1117
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,330
# thinkin' about Elvis #

1118
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,730
# somewhere in Vegas #

1119
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,430
# I'm not sure how I #

1120
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,430
# got here #

1121
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,670
# or how this ring #

1122
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,500
# on my left hand #

1123
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,700
# just appeared outta nowhere #

1124
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,700
# I gotta go #

1125
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,940
# take the chips and the pinto #

1126
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,070
# and hit the road #

1127
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,070
# they say what happens here #

1128
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,070
# stays here #

1129
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,310
# all of this'll disappear #

1130
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,810
# and I don't even know #

1131
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,180
# his last name #

1132
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,550
# my mama would be so ashamed #

1133
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,560
- Okay. - Thanks, Haeley.

1134
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,260
What do you think, Simon?

1135
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,760
Cute little thing, aren't you?

1136
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,530
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1137
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,360
You've got a slight lisp when you sing, you know that?

1138
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,860
- Yeah... - Yeah.

1139
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,530
I know...

1140
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,970
What I like about you is that you're different, you know?

1141
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,370
You're not coming in singing Mary J. Blige.

1142
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,270
Therefore you stand out a little bit.

1143
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,640
You obviously love that kind of music.

1144
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,840
- And I think you're infectious. - Thank you.

1145
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,610
- You've got a great smile. - Thank you.

1146
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,180
I like you too.

1147
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,250
You're so bubbly, which I think is great.

1148
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,710
I love the way you're dressed.

1149
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,170
You know what I like about you, Haeley?

1150
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,280
There are not many black pop country singers.

1151
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,200
Definitely.

1152
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,890
So, that you have that dream, that's a big dream.

1153
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,890
Yeah, I like that too.

1154
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,650
I like that you're bold and you want to go there.

1155
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,590
The only thing I would watch

1156
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,240
is that you don't wanna get to

1157
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,890
sound alike with Carrie and all of these singers.

1158
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,900
She should start lower in her register too.

1159
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,070
- I think you were a bit high. - A bit high.

1160
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,870
That's what my sister told me before I came in here.

1161
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,870
And I was like, "ooh!"

1162
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,240
Where is your sister? She was right.

1163
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,600
My sister loves you, by the way.

1164
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,610
- She'd love to meet you. - Oh, really?

1165
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,610
- Well, bring her in. - Really?

1166
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,610
- Of course! - My sister and my mom.

1167
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,610
- Can I bring both of them? - Yeah, of course!

1168
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,610
Bring them all in.

1169
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,150
You got any friends out there,

1170
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:37,620
anybody from the mall we can call?

1171
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,620
- Hello! - Hello!

1172
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,690
What's up? What's up?

1173
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,420
What's up?

1174
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,060
- Nice family, nice family. - Beautiful family.

1175
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,860
Is Haeley going to Hollywood?

1176
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,860
As far as I'm concerned, it's a yes.

1177
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,870
- Victoria? - That's only one.

1178
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,870
- Yes. - Thank you.

1179
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,870
- Randy? - A hundred million percent yes.

1180
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,870
- You're going to Hollywood! - Welcome to Hollywood!

1181
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,180
Maybe with mom and sis.

1182
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,280
- That's so great. - Yeah.

1183
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,810
Thank you so much.

1184
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,820
Nice to meet you guys.

1185
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,350
Welcome to Hollywood.

1186
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,850
Whew.

1187
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,090
Screams?

1188
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,590
# and the world comes alive #

1189
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,500
# and the world comes alive #

1190
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,060
Day two saw 11 tickets fly out the doors.

1191
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,270
Welcome to Hollywood!

1192
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,640
Whoo!

1193
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,650
I'm going to Hollywood!

1194
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,260
From the mile-high city to a sky-high total of 26.

1195
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,390
Hollywood!

1196
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,190
And so that wraps up Denver...

1197
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,660
well, almost.

1198
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,090
In seasons past,

1199
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,250
many contestants have tried hard to get noticed.

1200
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,130
But only one has achieved the ultimate in notoriety.

1201
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,740
Ha ha ha ha.

1202
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,370
Last year, we gave you bikini girl.

1203
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,410
The guys loved her.

1204
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,880
Wow.

1205
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,050
The ladies? Not so much.

1206
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,350
How could anyone possibly go one better?

1207
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,550
Aside from Kara, of course.

1208
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

1209
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,550
it's the final contestant in Denver.

1210
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,560
Prepare to meet...

1211
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,750
No, really?

1212
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,010
- Oh... - Come on.

1213
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,120
What's the song? What're you singing?

1214
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,410
I'm gonna sing, uh, Billy Ray Cyrus.

1215
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,640
"Achy Breaky Heart"?

1216
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,340
Of course, of course!

1217
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,310
- Come on, bikini boy. - Here we go.

1218
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,080
# you can tell my arms #

1219
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,410
# to go back to the farm... #

1220
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,110
I'm going back to Los Angeles.

1221
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,320
- Bikini boy... - Don't move your hips like that, Honey.

1222
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,990
- It's not a good look. - No?

1223
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,990
- No. - It's bikini boy time.

1224
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,590
Don't you want to finish? That's kinda rude.

1225
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,790
I think you should, like, at least stay...

1226
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,560
Kara, please stay. Can I get a hug?

1227
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,790
They're coming back, right?

1228
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,940
We... uh... well... bikini boy?

1229
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,100
Are they really leaving?

1230
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,460
Yeah.

1231
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,640
Tomorrow night, we have one more stop for you,

1232
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,330
and we strike goal.

1233
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,040
It's the last audition episode before Hollywood,

1234
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,510
and we are saving the very best for the very last.

1235
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,770
One of the best 16-year-old I've ever heard.

1236
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,510
Definitely one of my favorites.

1237
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,480
Four yeses. Dude, you are going to Hollywood.

1238
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,420
I can't believe this.

1239
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,600
Join us tomorrow night as we end the auditions on the high.

1240
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,780
I quite like that.
