1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,150
Washington.

Here they go.

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,100
Over the years we've really got around.

6
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:10,160
Welcome to New York City

7
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:11,032
Cleveland

8
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:11,928
Austin, Texas

9
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:12,755
Minnesota.

10
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,025
Say hello to Los Angeles.

11
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,340
But isn't it time we just
get away from it all?

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,300
This is Colorado.

13
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,040
And this is American idol.

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,245
The family vacation.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
A ritual rooted deep in American culture

16
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:04,055
so after eleven seasons

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,870
the idol family is loading
up the station wagon

18
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:10,020
and heading for the mountains.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,735
This isn't an ordinary trip to Colorado.

20
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,670
Welcome to colorful Colorado.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,170
The altitudes' car gives
me a bit of headache.

22
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,930
Does anyone got an Aspen?

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,240
Known for its extraordinary slopes

24
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,342
and breath taking beauty

25
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:30,375
Aspen, Colorado is now known as

26
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,040
the next stop of the
American idol's auditions.

27
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:37,650
Welcome to Colorado!

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,929

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,270
- it's been a while.
- For ten years.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,680
It's chilly, our first chilly city.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,465
This is Aspen, beautiful place

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,420
I hope beautiful people.

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,840
I think we can find our one out here.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,735
It seems this fresh Mountain air

00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,035
Steady by.

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,400
It also makes us a little loopy

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,380
I mean it's just unbelievable.

41
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,680
The colors.

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,520
God's paintbrush.

43
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,830
The art of making the perfect snowball.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,110
You are amazing.

45
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:23,620
And you are pretty.

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,910
Hey, have the vibe here, check this out.

47
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,680
- Good vibe.
- Look at this.

48
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,250
It certainly is.

49
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,010
Peaceful, tranquil and, oh,
so quiet.

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,920
Let's meet our first contestant of Aspen.

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,780
I'm Jenny schick I am 24 years old

52
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,020
I am from sterling, Virginia

53
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,525
I've always been overly energetic

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,580
to the point where people
have to tell me to stop

55
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,895
I am a music teacher.

56
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,730
And I teach kindergarten to six-grade.

57
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:04,900
My least favorite part
is definitely recorders.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,335
Cause 30 recorders in one room

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,950
with beginners recorder players

60
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,690
makes me wanna vomit

61
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,320
Jenny isn't shy about much

62
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,575
but the prospect of meeting one judge
does have her on edge.

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,580
I will get nervous about
sing to Steven Tyler

64
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,270
because he's gorgeous.

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,040
Ever seen aerosmith?

66
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,355
No, I wish!

67
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,220
But I going to meet Steven Tyler!

68
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:28,115
What will your boyfriend think?

69
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,190

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,065
No. We have a list of

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,460

I think that is all for me.

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,820
He has Adam levine, lady gaga and you.

79
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,430
- And he's not here today.
- I know! He couldn't take off the fork.

80
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:51,280
- Oh man.
- Can I get a kiss for him?

81
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,175
Unlucky. I tell you what,

104
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,680
<i>Your love is like a tidal wave.</i>

<i>Spinning over my head.</i>

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,420

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,005
<i>You're the right kind of sinner.</i>

109
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,920
<i>To release my inner fantasy.</i>

110
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,135
<i>The invincible winner.</i>

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,535
<i>You're a heartbreaker, dream maker.</i>

Yes, I kinda like it too.

Kind of wild, crazy, anything can happen.

121
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:22,245
Exactly.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,940
- Should we take a vote?
- Yeah, let's take a vote.

123
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,635
I think we should just go to voting
or kissing, what are we doing Steven?

124
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,270
- Voting and kissing, ok?

I'm gonna say yes too.

128
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,205
And you may kiss the judge!

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,320
- Come on.
- You may kiss the judge!

Thank you!

135
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,690
Hollywood is that way!

136
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,045
I got to kiss Steven Tyler.

137
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,460
I think on the lips, too, didn't you?

138
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,940
Wait 'till your students hear about this!

139
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,520
- You laid one on her there.
- I'm going to get trouble for that!

140
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,250
- Steven, wow!
- Yes you are!

141
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,250
His lips are very soft.

142
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,250
Very soft!

143
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,675
And voluptuous.

144
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,650
So, it's a wet start to Aspen auditions.

145
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,490
And over the next hour,

146
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,925
I love your voice, so much.

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,285
Can we reach new heights

148
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
in the rocky mountains?

149
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,917
Of course, yes!

150
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:37,180
Or will fall into the

151
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:39,170
valley of no return.

152
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:40,935
Stay tune.

153
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,690
As the idol auditions explode from Aspen.

154
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,500
Good morning.

155
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,670
It's about six o'clock.

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,810
Slept wicky good, last night.

157
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,610
Unbeliveable, how good I've slept.

158
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,035
Like every auditioner knows

159
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,100
trying out for idol takes a
certain amount of dedication.

160
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:13,130
- Waking up at the break of dawn.
- It's 3:45.

161
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,625
Dressing for sucess

162
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,750
and making your way to the stadium,
to wait in line

163
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:21,430

of super-stardom.

164
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,430
Ready to get my voice ready!

165
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,540
And altough he might
not have look it at 6am this morning

00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:34,310
Curtis gray is up for the challenge

167
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:37,062
I've been playing music since
I was a young buck.

168
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,780
Singin' in the church with mom,
my grandmother

169
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,095
I'm in a five piece group

170
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,090
I play keyboards and vocals.

171
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,950
And we've doing that, a
year and a half now.

172
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,755
If I come out of that room
with a golden ticket and say.

173
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,450
"Finally! All those voice exercises!"

174
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,450
"Coming in hot, baby"

175
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,390
<i>the good times.</i>

176
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:04,200
<i>That made us laugh.</i>

177
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,250
<i>Outweigh the bad.</i>

178
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,497
<i>Ooh-ooh-ooh.</i>

179
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,710
<i>And if we get.</i>

180
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,095
<i>To see tomorrow.</i>

181
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,300
<i>Well I hope it's worth.</i>

182
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,145
<i>All the wait</i>

183
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,580
<i>'cause it's so hard.</i>

184
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,120
<i>To say goodbye.</i>

185
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,670
<i>To yesterda-a-ay.</i>

186
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,892
<i>Eeeeh.</i>

00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:41,045
<i>And I.</i>

188
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,815
- Yo yo.
- Hey hey.

189
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,230
Listen, listen, very nicely done.

190
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,722
Song selection was brilliant.

191
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:48,538
I'm gonna start this off

192
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,285
I'm gonna say, definitely yes!

193
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,415

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,620
You're good looking, I think you sing great
and I'm gonna say yes, too.

195
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,990
- Steven Tyler!
- Major talent, man.

196
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,660
I'm gonna say yes

197
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,730
- That's how I go!
- Thank you guys!

198
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,815
Here we go!
We're on a roll y'all!

199
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,090
- That was character...
- Really good!

200
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,280
Everything!

201
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,840
Curtis is rolling on to Hollywood

202
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,910
as he kicks off a hot
streak in the judging room.

203
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,275
<i>I wouldn't be a man.</i>

204
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,610
<i>If I didn't feel like this.</i>

205
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,812
<i>I wouldn't be a man.</i>

206
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:30,945
<i>If a woman like you.</i>

207
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,940
<i>Was anything I could resist</i>

208
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,465
nice

209
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,540
you have a strong and
powerful voice right there.

210
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,425
<i>Got some words on cardboard.</i>

211
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,300
<i>Got your picture in my hand.</i>

212
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:43,425
<i>Singing.</i>

213
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,050
<i>If you see this girl.</i>

214
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,565
<i>Can you tell her where I am</i>

215
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,070
<i>'cause I'm not moving no.</i>

216
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:57,360
<i>I'm not moving</i>

217
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,680

- Nice.

218
00:09:58,715 --> 00:09:59,890
Natural voice.

219
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,495
<i>Remember.</i>

220
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,680
<i>To let it under your skin.</i>

221
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,330
<i>Then you begin.</i>

222
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,897
<i>To make it better.</i>

223
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,430
<i>Better better better.</i>

224
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,160
<i>Better better.</i>

225
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,022
<i>Yeah.</i>

226
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:15,815
Yes!

227
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,965
<i>Oh nah nah nah.</i>

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,045
<i>Nah-nah-nah nah</i>

229
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,330
I said oh nah-nah-nah

230
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,580

231
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,250

234
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:27,692
Yes!

235
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,400
Yes!

236
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,510
You're going to Hollywood!

237
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:32,995
Thank you guys so much!
Thank you so very much!

238
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,710
You are going to Hollywood, baby!

239
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,700
Let's "hey" for Richie!

240
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,230
Hoping to keep Aspen's golden ticket
rush coming,

241
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:00,015
is our next contestant

242
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,925
for the 19-year-old talena

243
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,240
singing is no longer a sister act

244
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,570
I have a twin sister named Stevie l.

245
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,625
She is going to a school for performing

246
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,560
she is an amazing performer
she's my best friend

247
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,375
Stevie and I are totaly different.

248
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,220
We have a different personalities
we have different voices.

249
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:23,012
Even though she is so good at
performing and acting stuff

250
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,770
I am more of the outgoing person

251
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,760
I am more of the person
that would go up to you and be like.

252
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,620
Hey I like your shirt.

253
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,620
- Like, I get goose bumbs when you sing.
- Thank you oh.

254
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,745
That's sort to complements me.

255
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,830
- Because I sing too.
- I guess that's true.

256
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,142
I've spent my whole entire life
living in her shadow

257
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,420
when I was younger, all my friends would
come up to me and tell me

258
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,600
how talented my sister was.

259
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,990
And, it sucks.

260
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,330
She's amazing at what she does.

261
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:54,032
And I know that.

262
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,700
But I can be amazing too!

263
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,010
I feel like she's so much better than me.

264
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,330
And, so glad I'm going in there alone!

265
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,165
I'm just gonna go in there confident

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,060
by myself, on the solo and rock it.

267
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,750
Come on in. Bright sunshine!

268
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:15,320
What's going on?

269
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,020
Not much!

270
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,860
What is your name?

271
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,000
My name is talena Ron.

272
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,140
But you can call me dog if you want to.

273
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,670
- Really?
- Yeah! Go ahead!

274
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:22,920
Hello dog,

275
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,310
so tell me something interesting
about yourself.

276
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,465
I have a twin sister

277
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,610
I've just been living in
her shadow for 19 years

278
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,580
she is so talented.
She is amazing!

279
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:31,785
But I'm ready to do it.

280
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,145
I'm ready to let myself shine.

281
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,120
Cause I don't want to be
in her shadow any more.

282
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,245
Cute. Cute.

283
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,365
So what are you going to sing today?

284
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
"Bring me some water" by Melissa Etheridge.

285
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:40,960
Nice.

286
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,215
<i>Tonight I feel so weak.</i>

287
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,865
<i>But all in love is fair.</i>

288
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,320
<i>I turn the other cheek.</i>

289
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:48,740
<i>And I feel the slap.</i>

290
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:49,715
<i>And the sting.</i>

291
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,755
<i>And the foul night air.</i>

292
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,300
<i>And I know we're only human.</i>

293
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,465
<i>And I haven't got talking room.</i>

294
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,690
If you ask her for another song,
I'm gonna kill you.

295
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,890
<i>But tonight while I'm
making excuses.</i>

296
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,060
<i>Some other woman.</i>

297
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,770
<i>Is making love to you.</i>

298
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,920
<i>Hey, somebody bring me some water.</i>

299
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:10,677
<i>Can't you see.</i>

300
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:11,566
<i>I'm burning alive.</i>

301
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:12,385
<i>Can't you see.</i>

302
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,680
<i>My baby's got another lover.</i>

303
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,625
<i>And now I don't know how.</i>

304
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,795
<i>I'm gonna survive.</i>

305
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,960
<i>Somebody bring me some water.</i>

306
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,805
<i>Can't you see.</i>

307
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,835
<i>It's out of control.</i>

308
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,790
<i>My baby's got my heart.</i>

309
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:29,675
<i>My baby's got my mind.</i>

310
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,500
<i>But tonight the sweet devil.</i>

311
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:35,290
<i>The sweet devil's got my soul.</i>

312
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:36,610
Ok.

313
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,355
You are funny, man!

314
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,600
- I like you.
- Thank you, thank you, I try.

315
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,700
Good in the drama! Have you ever
recorded your voice and listened back?

316
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,720
- No.
- You gotta do that.

317
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,860
- 'Cause then you'll hear what we're hearing.
- Yeah.

318
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,010
All right baby, we're going
to take a quick vote, ok?

319
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,050
Steven, yes or no?

320
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:54,430
I'm gonna say no.

321
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:55,315
Ok.

322
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,515
I'm gonna say I think you adorable

323
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,310
but it's a no for the singing.

324
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:01,010
Love you. You're so cute, man,
we love that,

325
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,740
but the singing is not there yet.

326
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,445
Ok.

327
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,900
- Sorry sweetheart.
- I'm sorry baby.

328
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,050
It's okay.

329
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,580
That's okay, honey.

330
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,210
Didn't go your way?

331
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,195
No, I just...

332
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,030
Well, will always be my idol.

333
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:23,360
Yeah, sure.

334
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,650
So talena find solace with their twin
sister Stevie by her side

335
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:32,390
as they embrace the music together.

336
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,050
<i>I am lonely, pondering.</i>

337
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,765
<i>Who would want to.</i>

338
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,380
<i>Join this madness who would change.</i>

339
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:41,695
This song's just not working.

340
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,735
What do you want to sing then?

341
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,705
- I don't know.
- What's wrong?

342
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,190
It's just...
It wasn' working for me.

343
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,290
Ok.

344
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,195
<i>When we come back!</i>

345
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,580
Turkey has [Bleep]?

346
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:51,245
What are we talking about?

347
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,095
What are we talking about?

348
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,010
<i>The judges aren't quite
on the same page.</i>

349
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,890
You know I just want to shut you up.

350
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,740
<i>But one audition will bring
them back together.</i>

351
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,080
I am honored to be here,
listening to your voice.

352
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,450
<i>Welcome back to Colorado
in the magnificent west.</i>

353
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,670
<i>And someone who knows this mountains
like her own backyard,</i>

354
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:30,370
<i>is 18-year-old hayley Smith</i>

355
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,360
I live in a log cabin
in the middle of nowhere,

356
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,310
I love nature.

357
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,260
I definetly love being outdoors,

358
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,220
it's where I feel most at peace.

359
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:45,350
You could say I guess.

360
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,600
Where I enjoy the most of
my reckoned get away.

361
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,180
The landscape is to die for.

362
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,470
If you would die for anything.

363
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,620
It's beautiful.

364
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,600
<i>And there is a reason why she needs that peace
and quiet that only mother nature can bring.</i>

365
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,895
I've acquired three new jobs

366
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,900
I house-clean and am a bussel
for a restaurant

367
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,360
and I'm a vegetarian working
at the meat department.

368
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,090
You're making the sausage?

369
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:16,895
Yeah.

370
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,500
What is in the sausage?

371
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,695
Ground and free-think.

372
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,205
This is the reason you're a vegetarian.

373
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,540
Even more so now.

374
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,310
Let's see if you can get another job
here as a singer.

375
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,740
That sound's a plan.

376
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:28,795
Well, all right.

377
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,750
- Thank you.
- Head on in.

378
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:32,345
- Hello.
- Hello.

379
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,670
Come on in, what's your name?

380
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,457
Hayley Smith is my name.

381
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,210
And hayley how old are you?

382
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:39,225
I am 18 years old.

383
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,995
Tell me about yourself,

384
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,520
are you a performer,
do you play?

385
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:42,705
Yeah, I do.

386
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,925
I feel like a 70's vibe from you.

387
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,060
- A '60s, 70's vibe.
- Wow! Yeah!

388
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,400
I really do enjoy that era of music.

389
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:51,130
What are you gonna sing today?

390
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,195
Rufus and chaka Khan,
"tell me something good"

391
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,730
yeah! Come on written
by the great Stevie wonders here we go.

392
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,410
Yeah, yeah.

393
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:07,680
<i>You ain't got no kind
of feeling inside.</i>

394
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>What I got is sure to set
your stuff right on fire.</i>

395
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:24,400
<i>What I got will knock
all your pride aside.</i>

396
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:27,120
<i>Tell me something good.</i>

397
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,480
<i>Tell me that you like me yeah.</i>

398
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,090
<i>Tell me something good.</i>

399
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,360
<i>Come on tell me that
you love me yeah</i>

400
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,775
I just laughing because
you put in your own spin

401
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,655
on a great R&B classic with chaka.

402
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,570
- You're doing it in like more of flower...
- Johnny mitchel way!

403
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:50,820
Johnny mitchel sort of way!

404
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:51,865
But you know what?

405
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,240
It's not, like, perfect for the song.

406
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,160
But I actually kinda like that!

407
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,255
- I love your voice so much.
- Thank you.

408
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,170
You're right at my era.

409
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,500
And I'm honoured to be here.

410
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:05,990
Listening to your voice.

411
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,255
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome

412
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,690
I bet you're even more comfortable
when you have a guitar or,

413
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,940
you have music around you too, huh?

414
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,220
Yeah. Definitely.

415
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,280
I just love the commitment to you
just being who you are.

416
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,985
And just the natural gift.

417
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,890
We always say to people,
make it your own.

418
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:25,740
You don't need to sound like the record.

419
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:26,295
Yeah.

420
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,230
And, you know, you defintely been doing
your own thing with this. I love that.

421
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:29,895
I love that.

422
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,220
Let's take a vote.
Jennifer, yes or no?

423
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:32,510
I'm gonna say yes,
I want to see you more.

424
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,780
Randy. I'm gonna say yes.
Steven?

425
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,255
I'm gonna say so yes.

426
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,280
- And what that's mean, Steven?
- You're going to Hollywood.

427
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,260
Thank you so much!

428
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,450
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

429
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,475
- A real flower chow.
- She is...

430
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,320
- A real flower chow.
- Yes.

431
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,520
And now all these new jobs
you got leave behind.

432
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:59,300
Ooh. Darn.

433
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,795
At 18, that's impressive.

434
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,680
- Flowr chow.
- Uniqueness.

435
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,950
She's not following any
of the artists out ther.

436
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,005
She's just herself.

437
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,710
Warm weather and Hollywood,
here I come!

438
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,560
<i>Looks like the rockie Mountain
originality is showing up!</i>

439
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:15,800
<i>After the break:</i>

440
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,670
<i>Colorado leaves us high and dry.</i>

441
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:21,600
Ok. Is that for real?

442
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,090
I hope is no.

443
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,575
<i>Plus, one contestant inspire us all.</i>

444
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,360
I want to show people that bipolar
doesn't define who you are.

445
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,880
- Beautiful.
- So beautiful.

446
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:37,070
Beautiful!

447
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,140
<i>Welcome back to Aspen!</i>

448
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,415
<i>After a busy morning.</i>

449
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,865
<i>We are done with lunching
and ready to go.</i>

450
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,100
- Great lunch.
- Maybe that means we're gonna have a good afternoon.

451
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:53,365
Good afternoon!

452
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,380
<i>But looks like one of
our judges is stil...</i>

453
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,185
<i>And this rockstar certainly knows</i>

454
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,930
<i>the importance of a balance diet to
make it through the day.</i>

455
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,450
<i>Now let's see if Steven can stomach
what our</i>

456
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,730
<i>next contestant is serving up.</i>

457
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,720
My name is Elena snare, I'm 22,

458
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,810
and I'm from Florence, Colorado.

459
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,095
I am a bartender-waitress

460
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,900
at a bar that is famous for selling
rockie-Mountain oysters.

461
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,100
Most people might be like:
"Oh, oysters from the sea."

462
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:28,200
But they're actually bull testies'

463
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,820
which is something a lot of people are like,
couldn't get, and not really into it.

464
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,385
But we got a lot of regulars in there.

465
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,600
If you are a little adventurous,
you'll try it.

466
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,525
Here we go.

467
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
At least once.

468
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,280
Hi, what's your name?

469
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,225
Elena snare.

470
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,760
- What a great musical name.
- Snare.

471
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,845
What do you do?

472
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,780
I'm actually a bartend-waitress

473
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:50,265
at a bar that is famous for selling
rockie-Mountain oysters.

474
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,410
What is that?

475
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,615
- They're bull testies' actually.
- No!

476
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,870
We actually have Buffalo
and Turkey ones as well.

477
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah.

478
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,705
Ah, turkeys have [Bleep]?

479
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,450
They do, but actually they're internals
so you don't get to see them.

480
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:03,510
Gaable gaable.

481
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,200
What are we talking about?

482
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,030
What are we talking about?

483
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,502
- True.
- Yes.

484
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,905
What are you singing?

485
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,250
I'm gonna sing "jolene" by Dolly parton.

486
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:13,110
- Do it.
- Good.

487
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,195
<i>Jolene jolene jolene jolene.</i>

488
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,400
<i>I'm begging of you please
don't take my man.</i>

489
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,690
<i>Jolene jolene jolene jolene.</i>

490
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,650
<i>Please don't take him
just because you can.</i>

491
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,550
<i>Your beauty is...</i>

492
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,670
Have you eaten those preary oysters?

493
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,070
I have.

494
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,270
You're all over the place with
melody and it's just...

495
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,290
It's bad.

496
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,285
I mean, I really like you
as a person, I think you're cool.

497
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,750
Singing is just not your thing, man.
It was terrible.

498
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:55,180
Can I sing something else?
Just try to...

499
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,820
No. I think we heard,
I think we heard.

500
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:58,065
- I thinks we're okay.
- I think we heard what's going on.

501
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,020
- Steven, would you say yes or no?
- No.

502
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,820
It's a no from me.

503
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,270
Thank you.

504
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,280
<i>Seems like Jennifer has had enough
animal talk.</i>

505
00:22:07,315 --> 00:22:09,020
No, and no.

506
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,220
<i>Let's see if the next country girl
can win her over.</i>

507
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:13,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

508
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:14,360
How are you?

509
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,920
Great, man. What's your name?

510
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:16,825
Shelby.

511
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,010
Yeah. Where're you from?

512
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,455
Mankato, minessota.

513
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,270
And how much do you love to sing?

514
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,585
I love it, you don't even understand.

515
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,415
It kind gets me emotional these days.
I don't know why.

516
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,030
Cause it's made so happy and
gotten me over so much stuff,

517
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,905
it's kind my safe harbor.

518
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,370
Like what? What do you mean?

519
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,010
I was diagnosed bipolar in march,

520
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,640
but I have been strugling with depression
since forth grade

521
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,705
American idol has gave me a reason
to stand in my meds,

522
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,290
I wasn't focusing on sing with them,
because I didn't really care.

523
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:54,100
When I'm off my meds, I'm incoherent
and...

524
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,110
- She's not the same person.
- I'm not myself. Yeah.

525
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:58,970
She doesn't have the
light, you know, in her.

526
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,180
There's been times where
I've had hypomenic episodes,

527
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:08,842
I'll be shaking, I'll stutter

528
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:11,470
I can't control my body.

529
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
And my mom will be like:
"Well, let's sing together."

530
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,200
And I'll sing and...

531
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,945
And, like, it really helps.

532
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,730
American idol has given us
something to believe in.

533
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:24,807
And, uh... it's really
important to me because

534
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:28,850
I do wanna show people that.

535
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,480
Bipolar doesn't define who you are.

536
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,420
I can't even tell you
how proud of her I am.

537
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,510
I just stomp, feel like I could have
my daughter back a little bit, so..

538
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,560
I love you.

539
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,725
<i>Young mom on her own.</i>

540
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,620
<i>She needs a little help
got nowhere to go.</i>

541
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,150
<i>She's looking for a job
looking for a way out.</i>

542
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:00,267
<i>Cause a halfway house.</i>

543
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:02,350
<i>Will never be a home.</i>

544
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,030
<i>At night she whispers.</i>

545
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:11,075
<i>To her baby girl.</i>

546
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:20,640
<i>Someday we'll find a place
here in this world.</i>

547
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,140
<i>This is our temporary home.</i>

548
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:27,420
<i>It's not where I belong.</i>

549
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:29,985
<i>Windows and rooms.</i>

550
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,900
<i>That we're passing through.</i>

551
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:37,780
<i>This is my temporary home.</i>

552
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,210
- Beautiful!
- So beautiful.

553
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,160
Beautiful!

554
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,480
Something going on here in Aspen!

555
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,585
I got tears to my eyes!

556
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,190
- I love that.
- Got tears to my eyes.

557
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:49,080
I mean, I love that song too, but...

558
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,435
Somebody's got to really sing it so,
you know...

559
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,320
Do you know what's cool about you?

560
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:54,867
To me is that you got a great voice,

561
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:56,345
dude, you're good to go,

562
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,570
'cause you feel us as a singer.

563
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,485
So I love that.

564
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,760
- The sound of your voice.
- Dude!

565
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,965
And the little rasp in it,
it's just all in the right place.

566
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,130
- Just so beautiful, I just love it so much.
- The potential, yeah...

567
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:07,225
- Let's take a vote Jennifer.
- Please.

568
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,720
I think everybody knows, yes. Big yes.

569
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:11,280
- One hundred percent yes!
- Big yes.

570
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:12,662
Yes, big huge yes!

571
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:14,010
You're going to Hollywood, baby!

572
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,210
Shelby Lynn at Hollywood!

573
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,555
- See you guys!
- See you later!

574
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,150
- Awesome!
- She is great.

575
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,210
Another star!

576
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,285
That's huge potential, right there.

577
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,790
When the sound of somebody's voice
is so beautiful.

578
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:33,100
And that's a tough song to sing.

579
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,585
Everyone told me I couldn't do it.

580
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,180
And I was like, you know what?
I'm gonna prove y'll wrong someday.

581
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:39,480
I'm gonna do it.

582
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,930
See you later minne "snow" tta...

583
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,860
I'm going to be at Hollywood!

584
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,410
Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood!

585
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,805
<i>When we come back,
one contestant.</i>

586
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,270
<i>Just may have what Jennifer
is searching for.</i>

587
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:55,555
You are a lover!

588
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,600
Uh, yeah, I'm a lover
and not a fighter.

589
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:58,940
I can tell.

590
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,310
<i>And... where did this guy come from?</i>

591
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:07,040
I'm originally from Davenport, Iowa.

592
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:08,432
Davenport, Iowa?

593
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,988
What is this?

594
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:11,510
This is crazy!

595
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,790
Welcome back to "American idol"

596
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:24,210
where is turning in a bit of winter
wonderland here in Aspen.

597
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,720
Let's hope this cold snap isn't affecting

598
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:29,290
the judges inside the audition room.

599
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,200
We got it?

600
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,210
We're good. Thanks Ron.

601
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,975
<i>Every guy grab a girl.</i>

602
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,700
<i>Everywhere around the world.</i>

603
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,415
<i>Keep dancing.</i>

604
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,770
<i>If I go crazy then will you
still call me superman.</i>

605
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,455
<i>Yeah.</i>

606
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,910
Ok. Is that for real?

607
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,490
I hope is no.

608
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,570
<i>Just as long.</i>

609
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,540
<i>As you stand.</i>

610
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,020
<i>Stand by me.</i>

611
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,620
<i>Now is death.</i>

612
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,060
- Is that enough for you?
- Yeah.

613
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,220
<i>That rough path has left
the judges felling cold.</i>

614
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,195
<i>But maybe our next contestant</i>

615
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,090
<i>can break the ice
with something new.</i>

616
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,345
My name is jairon Jackson

617
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,310
I'm 19 years old,
and I'm from Denver, Colorado.

618
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,540
My song choice is actually an original
piece that I wrote myself.

619
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,680
I had to cope with people, tell me
I shouldn't sing it

620
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:46,575
because it's not something
that's known.

621
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,890
But I've a lot of fate in this song.

622
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,230
I've a lot of faith in it.

623
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,800
Door to stardom!

624
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,090
Jairon's door to stardom.

625
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,415
Yo, come on in, man!

626
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,240
Come on in, come on in!

627
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:00,995
- How are you?
- I'm doing beautiful!

628
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,700
- What is your name?
- Jairon "don't forget the" Jackson.

629
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:06,370
- Yeah baby!
- Don't forget the Jackson.

630
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:06,785
Brothers!

631
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,405
- Another Jackson in the house...
- Yes, yes, yes.

632
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,990
What you gonna sing, man?

633
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,660
I'm start of with an original piece
that I wrote

634
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:14,840
about a year ago, is called "so hard"

635
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,050
- do it.
- All right.

636
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,855
<i>I'm so scarred.</i>

637
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,050
<i>And I don't know what to do.</i>

638
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,210
<i>I'm so lost in love and
I don't know about you.</i>

639
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,270
<i>So tell me baby.</i>

640
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,580
<i>Are we in this together.</i>

641
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,910
<i>Supposed to be my friend.</i>

642
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,910
<i>Through the stormy weather.</i>

643
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,835
<i>I wonder.</i>

644
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,000
<i>Do you feel the same pain.</i>

645
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,005
<i>I'm crying from my heart.</i>

646
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,290
<i>Trying to love you through my vans.</i>

647
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:46,540
<i>Have you ever loved someone so deep</i>

648
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:47,867
<i>he great love ah.</i>

649
00:28:47,902 --> 00:28:49,160
<i>I can't even sleep.</i>

650
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,425
<i>It's so hard.</i>

651
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,325
<i>I can't feel my heart any more.</i>

652
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,190
<i>Do you want to love no no no.</i>

653
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,200

707
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:06,185
a part-time singer.

708
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,045
People would call me lady gaga sometimes.

709
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,870
When they see me walking down the street.

710
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:12,052
She makes everything a performance
and that's sort of

711
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,165
how I like to sing.

712
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,430
I would look to open for her
and then

713
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,660
be best friends with her.

714
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,255
I am the next American idol

715
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,155
I think because there hasn't really
been anybody else like me.

716
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,020
- You seem very confident.
- Thanks.

717
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:27,955
It's working.

718
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,590
It is time for vintage glitter queen

719
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,552
on "American idol" and

720
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm here to provide that for you.

721
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,055
- Hey.
- Hi.

722
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,555
- How are you.
- I'm so excited to be here.

723
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,660
- I like the dress.
- Thank you.

724
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:42,730
- Way cute dress. And the hair.
- And the hair.

725
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:43,835
And the earrings.

726
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,335
The hair matches the dress, exactly.

727
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,800
- What is your name?
- Angie zeiderman.

728
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:48,945
- And Angie, how old are you.
- 25.

729
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,790
What kind of artist do you see
yourself being, you know?

730
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,565
I love the lady gaga.

731
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,905
'Cause I love to put on the whole show

732
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,200
I like to sing and dance
and have the outift...

733
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,470
Ok. Well sing a little song for us.

734
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:01,320
All right.

735
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,060
<i>Then I was just a
little girl in Sweden.</i>

736
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,430
<i>My thoughtful mother
gave me this advice.</i>

737
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:15,220
<i>If nature blesses you
from top to bottom.</i>

738
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,650
<i>Show that top to bottom
don't think twice.</i>

739
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:23,245
<i>When you got it, share it.</i>

740
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,540
<i>Let the public feast
upon your charm.</i>

741
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,159
<i>Buh-nee-nah-nee-nee.</i>

742
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,980
<i>Dah-dah dah-dah.</i>

743
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,530
<i>Don't be shy be bold and cute.</i>

744
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,945
<i>Dah-ch-ch.</i>

745
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,035
She is not shy.

746
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,420
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit.</i>

747
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,630
<i>When you got it.</i>

748
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,460
<i>Shout out.</i>

749
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:50,705
<i>Hoora-a-ay.</i>

750
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,230
- Okay.
- Thank you, baby.

751
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:53,685
I usually get down a little more.

752
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,680
- But this dress is a little constricted.
- We get now, we get it.

753
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:59,625
- I don't do just show tunes.
- No, no.

754
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,240
What I don't want to know about all that
the show tunes definetly it turns me off.

755
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,695
But any way, let's vote.

756
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,320
- It does.
- I love musicals.

757
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,315
- I love musicals but...
- Let me tell you...

758
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,060
- Musicals performers...
- I do not like her vibrato.

759
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:16,770
How many people came in here and
could do what she just did?

760
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:17,625
- Not many.
- No, no.

761
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,145
- Not many!
- I love that.

762
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,150
Do you wanna see me doing something
that's totally not show tune at all?

763
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,050
- No, no, no. I'm good.
- Yes!

764
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,890
I just want to shut you up.

765
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:28,070
- I'm good, dawg. I'm good.
- You wanna hear it?

766
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,850
<i>I'm coming back someday.</i>

767
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,730
<i>Come what may to blue by you.</i>

768
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,155
<i>Where the folks are fine.</i>

769
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,199
<i>And the world is mine
on blue by you.</i>

770
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,005
- I like it.
- I do too.

771
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,035
<i>Oh, that boy of mine by my side.</i>

772
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,530
<i>The silver moon and
the evening tide.</i>

773
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:01,110
<i>Oh, some sweet day gonna take away.</i>

774
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:04,035
<i>This hurting inside.</i>

775
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,000
- Ok. That really change my mind, actually.
- Ah, yeah?

776
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,520
- That was nice.
- Great little voice, girl.

777
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:12,090
I like it. You're in your own world.

778
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,740
- She doesn't have one wounds of nerves in her.
- I love her!

779
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,425
Jennifer?

780
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,725
- Yes.
- Steven?

781
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,670
- So yes!
- You're going to Hollywood!

782
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:20,980
Hollywood, baby!

783
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,605
- This is a little spit fire.
- Yeah, she spit fire.

784
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,325
I love her.
She is definetly on her own world.

785
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,060
In Hollywood you'll expect to see more
of this, and more of this...

786
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,300
She has such a strong
voice with a good tone.

787
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,765
To me, what turns me off about
all musical is that.

788
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,930
That vibrato. I just got, it turns me, it's like graving
in my nerves, like fingernails on the chalkboard.

789
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:48,107
- It's learned.
- It's learned, that's what...

790
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:50,215
- That kind of crap.
- But it's hard to get a...

791
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,110
- I like her, she's like interesting.
- No, she was cooler, yeah.

792
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,390
See you in Hollywood.

793
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,360
<i>Coming up, as we near the end of
our Aspen stage.</i>

794
00:35:08,395 --> 00:35:10,050
<i>We have one last question.</i>

795
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,530
<i>Do you...</i>

796
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,180
<i>Believe...</i>

797
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,350
<i>In magic?</i>

798
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,000
Scared the [Bleep] of mem

799
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,030
I don't know what happened!

800
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,710
<i>Welcome back to Aspen, we're near in the
end of our day here,</i>

801
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:39,370
<i>and, while it's still the picture
of peace and tranquility outside.</i>

802
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,100
<i>Back in the audition room, it's
turned in to party centrum.</i>

803
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,920
<i>But like they say, every party has
a trooper.</i>

804
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,340
My name is magic cyclops

805
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,485
I'm from Davenport, Iowa.

806
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,550
We have riverboat gambling.

807
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:01,545
I had to personally leave Davenport

808
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,460
because I owe'd a lot of
gambling debt.

809
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,305
We should be probably blurring
my face out of this point,

810
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,050
because there are
people looking for me.

811
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,475
No one to talk to me

812
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,440
because I'm frightening
and I look homeless.

813
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,270
How is it going?

814
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,270
I have eleven thousand air-guitars.

815
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:26,230
And I know there is a guy in Belgium
that has, I think, five more than me.

816
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,065
<i>A master at air guitar.</i>

817
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,160
<i>Magic has had years to prep for
thir audiction.</i>

818
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,695
Let's do this thing!

819
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,825
I'm not ready at all!

820
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,955
But that's when I did some
of my most dangerous work.

821
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,070
There is a storm brewing,
and it's called magic cyclops

822
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:51,410
and it's coming for them.

823
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,560
- Bring in the kraken!
- Isn't it "release the kraken"?

824
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,400
- It's "release".
- "Release the kraken"!

825
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:58,757
Dude, okay. So first of all.
Who are you?

826
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:01,045
I'm the thy magic cyclops.

827
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,300
How old are you magic cyclops?

828
00:37:03,335 --> 00:37:05,520
It's not polite to ask a lady
her age.

829
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,720
- A ladie?
- Yes.

830
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,710
- A ladie with the beard!?
- Bearded lady, yes.

831
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:12,880
What? What? What?!
Come on, Aspen!

832
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,395
It's a weird city.

833
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,390
- Where are you from?
- I'm originally from Davenport, Iowa.

834
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:21,770
- Davenport, Iowa!
- This isn't Iowa accent...

835
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,465
I grew up extremly poor...

836
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,860
And we only got the local pbs station,

837
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,735
which massively aired BBC programing.

838
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,410
So that's why you're speaking
with the accent?

839
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:30,815
- Yes.
- That's hilarious!

840
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,560
What are we doing here man!?

841
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,325
What, on earth, could you be singing today?

842
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,865
Well, it's judges choice day!

843
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,330
So you have the choice between
Neil diamond or James buffay.

844
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:44,420
- Who?
- James "buffay".

845
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,140
Jimmy buffet.

846
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,230
- So we gotta "margaritaville" or...
- Is it buffett?

847
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:52,740
What's the other song by Neil diamond?

848
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:54,290
"Cracklin 'rose"

849
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:54,905
let's hear it.

850
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,850
- This is really silly, I just want to tell you that.
- Yes.

851
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:57,835
All right.

852
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,285
<i>Cracklin 'Rosie get on board.</i>

853
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,450
<i>We're gonna ride till there
ain't no more to go.</i>

854
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:06,065
<i>Takin' it slow.</i>

855
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,810
<i>And oh lord don't you know.</i>

856
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,290
<i>I'll have me a time
with a poor man's lady.</i>

857
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:14,035
<i>Hitchin 'on a twilight train.</i>

858
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,900
<i>Ain't nothin' here that
I care to take along.</i>

859
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:19,697
<i>But maybe a song.</i>

860
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:21,425
<i>Sing when I won't.</i>

861
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,395
<i>Don't need to say please to a man.</i>

862
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,050
- Dear can you sing something else?
- Really?

863
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,430
- I can.
- Really, no Jennifer? Really?

864
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:27,385
- Yes.
- I can.

865
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,380
<i>Wastin 'away again
in margaritaville.</i>

866
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,550
<i>Searching for my lost
shaker of salt.</i>

867
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,315
<i>Some people say.</i>

868
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:41,495
<i>That there'sa woman to blame.</i>

869
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,080
<i>But I know it's my own damn fault.</i>

870
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,595
- I'll have to go to the bathroom.
- Ok.

871
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,480
- I'll let you guys do this, Jennifer, Steven.
- Actually I also have to go to the bathroom.

872
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:56,480
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom. This is a joke!
- Wait! Hold on!
