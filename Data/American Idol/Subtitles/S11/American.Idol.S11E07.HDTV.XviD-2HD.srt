1
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:07,528
Every time American Idol
comes on, me and my parents

2
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:11,601
sit down in the living room and
watch it on television together.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,103
We always decide who should win
and who shouldn't.

4
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:35,062
I'm all done here.

5
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,964
Wish me luck.

6
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:44,272
We are going to St. Louis to try
out for American Idol.

7
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:54,348
There's the arch.

8
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,956
The winner is...
Carrie Underwood!

9
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:09,162
Thank you.

10
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:16,734
Now a new crop of talent
will take that same trip...

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,268
Bye!

12
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:20,203
There's the arch!

13
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:23,605
Hoping to create the magic
all over again.

14
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,073
St. Louis, here we come.

15
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:28,110
Can they do it?
We're about to find out.

16
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:33,482
This is St. Louis and...
This is American Idol.

17
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,124
It's a beautiful day here in the

18
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,993
gateway to the west...
Good old St. Louis.

19
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:22,801
Welcome to St. Louis!

20
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:30,475
The crowd of 10,000 has shown
up for the chance of a lifetime.

21
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:32,476
<i>Louie, Louie,

22
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,578
<i>aye-yi-yi-yi,

23
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,281
Let's get the auditions started.
Let's go.

24
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,951
Everybody, come on!
Let me hear you!

25
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:48,691
It's too bad that not everyone
shares that same enthusiasm

26
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:51,428
We gotta blame somebody for
all this congestion that your

27
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,463
people are gonna create.

28
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,665
I read about this a while back,

29
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,834
that this was gonna occur.

30
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:00,603
They says there are 20,000
people here, gonna be here,

31
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:03,273
all trying to get
their day in the sun.

32
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,242
Beats the hell out of working,
right?

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,545
Say that to the judges, who
have thousands of hopefuls

34
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:10,681
waiting to get their Idol on.

35
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,082
Last time they were here in St. Louis,

36
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:16,820
they found Carrie Underwood,
so we should be so lucky.

37
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,389
While Jennifer is all business,

38
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,190
Steven and Randy arrive
in rock star fashion.

39
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,692
Where the hell are we?

40
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,062
Where's the arch, man?
Where's the arch?

41
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:29,098
Other than the arch and the music,
what do you know about this town?

42
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,767
Um, a couple girlfriends from here.

43
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,702
Actually, their old addresses.

44
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:36,706
All kidding aside, the Steven
Tyler fan club was on hand

45
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,409
as usual and putting us behind
schedule.

46
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:40,777
All right, guys, they gotta
go up.

47
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,745
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,580
Hello, St. Lou.
Are you ready?

49
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,315
Yeah, let's go, St. Louis!

50
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:47,316
Are you ready?

51
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:51,987
So the city that produced one of our
biggest stars is center stage once more.

52
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:53,989
Come on, bring it on.

53
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:57,125
And the pressure is on for
our first contestant.

54
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,360
My name is Johnny Keeser.

55
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:01,029
I'm 22 years old, and I'm from
Pompano Beach, Florida.

56
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:04,532
When I was three years old, my
parents divorced, and my father

57
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,701
and I, it's just been us two
since I was little.

58
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,203
He's-he's a pretty good mom and
a dad.

59
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:11,271
I would pack his lunches.

60
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,506
I loved packing his lunches.

61
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:14,341
I can make a mean peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

62
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,043
Like, really-

63
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,444
Meanest

64
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,645
I love him.

65
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:19,379
I really do.

66
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:20,480
And he's... He's great.

67
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:24,783
We always took the boat out.

68
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:25,917
We're just boys.

69
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:28,086
He's like my brother more than
my dad.

70
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:29,421
We've got each other's back.

71
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:37,294
I knew as soon as I was in the
air, I was like, nah, I'm going down.

72
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,229
Hey.

73
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,263
How's it going?

74
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:40,164
What's your name, man?

75
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:40,931
Johnny.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,233
Johnny, what's going down?
How old are you?

77
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:44,000
22 years old.

78
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:44,835
Where you from, dog?

79
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,169
From Pompano Beach, Florida.

80
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:47,637
And what do you do in
Pompano?

81
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:49,706
I'm a server at an Italian
restaurant and I'm going to

82
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,341
school at the university of
central Florida.

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,711
But your dream is to be...?

84
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,645
The next American Idol.

85
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:55,479
Aha!

86
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:59,784
Outside, Johnny's family are treated
to a firsthand glimpse of all the action.

87
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,085
So what are you gonna sing?

88
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:03,154
I'm gonna sing "Change is
Gonna Come" by Sam Cooke.

89
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:05,157
Beautiful song.
One of my favorites. Do it.

90
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:05,824
Knock it out of the park.

91
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:11,297
<i>I was born by the river,

92
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:16,269
<i>In a little tent,

93
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,572
<i>Oh, and just like the river,

94
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,975
<i>I've been running,

95
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:24,446
<i>Ever since,

96
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:26,281
<i>It's been a long,

97
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,616
Should we just vote now?

98
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:30,518
No, keep singing.

99
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,053
<i>A long time coming,

100
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,455
<i>But I know,

101
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:37,157
<i>A change is gonna come,

102
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,559
<i>Whoa, yes it will,

103
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:40,593
How old are you?

104
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:41,494
22.

105
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:42,329
<i>It's been,

106
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:44,931
<i>It's been too hard living,

107
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,031
Ooh, yes.

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,003
<i>But I'm afraid to die,

109
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,537
What do you do right now?

110
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:54,072
I work at an Italian
restaurant.

111
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,106
Keep singing.

112
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:56,173
Keep singing.

113
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,241
<i>'Cause I don't know,

114
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:00,177
<i>What's out there, yeah,

00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,812
<i>Beyond the sky,

116
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,713
You know you're gonna be a
star, right?

117
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:06,650
Keep singing.

118
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:07,551
Keep singing, keep singing.

119
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,554
<i>It's been a long,

120
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:11,421
Oh, my God.

121
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,192
<i>A long time coming,

122
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,896

Oh, man.

127
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:24,336
Oh!

128
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,605
<i>Oh, yes it will,

129
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:27,372
Just stop.

130
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,574
Whoo!

131
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,576
Dog, that was crazy!

132
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,645
So what do you think when
you watch the show and you see

133
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:34,580
these Idols come out, year after year?

134
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:35,515
I could do that.

135
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,416
Yeah.

136
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,483
In your spare time, right?

137
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:38,718
Johnny's in the house.

138
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:39,852
Johnny in the house, man.

139
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:40,520
That was great.

140
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:41,421
Oh, my God, man.

141
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,088
I can't take it.

142
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:44,290
Uh, where's this boy going,
Jennifer, Steven, Randy?

143
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,792
Oh, my God,
You're going to Hollywood!

144
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes! Yes!

145
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,434
I let them watch.

146
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,168
Oh.

147
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:55,968
We let 'em watch.

148
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:59,506
Randy's doing this, and Jennifer, you know,
they're all singing along and enjoying it.

149
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:00,506
They're awesome.

150
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:01,174
Yeah.

151
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,241
I figured you'd think that.

152
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,909
I like them.

153
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,343
I think they thought the same
of you.

154
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:05,078
He is sexy.

155
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:06,612
Are you [Bleep] kidding?

156
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:08,413
Yes! Yes!

157
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:11,182
It's been a whole waiting
game, and it's over now because

158
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,416
now this is in my hand.

159
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:15,419
It's a great start for Johnny
and the judges.

160
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:16,687
Exciting!

161
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:18,355
Dude, that was good right
there.

162
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:19,323
All right, St. Lou!

163
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:20,057
So good.

164
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:20,925
St. Lou.

165
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:26,330
Get ready, America, 'cause
I'm coming to Hollywood.

166
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,667
Over the next hour, St. Louis

167
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,270
proves why it's a gateway to
Idol success.

168
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,305
You're one of the best female
voices we've heard.

169
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,374
You wanna chase your dream,
You chase it.

170
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:39,842
Wow.

171
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:40,943
But for some...

172
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:44,180
Terrible.

173
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:45,414
It's the end of the road.

174
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,016
Don't quit your day job.

175
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,130
<i>She bangs, she bangs,

176
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,432
<i>oh, baby,

177
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,568
<i>when she moves, she moves,

178
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:59,773
Over the past 11 years, we've
come across every kind of singer.

179
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,640
Yeah!

180
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,709
<i>I feel the earth move,

181
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:03,911

<i>any way the wind blows,

183
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,551
<i>doesn't really matter to me,

184
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,457
The one thing we've learned is
some auditions are best seen and not heard.

185
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:53,027
What the-?

186
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:00,634
Welcome back to St. Louis,
Missouri, where inside the

187
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:03,469
audition room, dreams are on the
line.

188
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:04,437
I'm gonna say no, not yet.

189
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,805
Oh, man.

190
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,373
But outside, the crowd is

191
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:10,810
still optimistic as they get to
know one another.

192
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,714
It's very-the coolest thing
about it is that, like, the fact

193
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:16,450
that we are all from so many
different places and that we all

194
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,921
came here for this one reason,
to sing, and we're all friends now.

195
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,956
Yeah, but whci one of you
is the next American Idol?

196
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:23,258
I am, right here.

197
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,995
After all, American Idol is

198
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:29,565
where this generation comes
together...

199
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,532
Everyone's singing,

200
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,600
everyone's having a good time.

201
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,504
One experience shared by
thousands whose paths would

202
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:37,272
otherwise never have crossed.

203
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,408
We just-this is, like, how
we do.

204
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:41,110
This is like our new family
here.

205
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,643
Each of them has a story to
tell.

206
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:48,112
My parents auditioned for
American Idol during season four.

207
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,915
They just told me I wouldn't
be able to do nothing...

208
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:54,218
And I do everything they said I couldn't
do.

209
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,352
Maybe you know one of them...

210
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:59,088
One day I got the courage to
sing in front of somebody, and

211
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,756
they said, "hey, that's pretty
good."

212
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:03,424
Or maybe you are one of them.

213
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:04,859
My name is Jarrod Salmon.

214
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,797
I'm from St. Louis...

215
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:10,665
I'm Justin Thiel.

216
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:11,366
I'm 26 years old.

217
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:12,467
My name is Rachelle Lamb.

218
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:16,471
I'm 26 years old, and I am from
Mountain view, Missouri.

219
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,443
I am doing American Idol for my
daughter and I.

220
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,078
Aren't you the next American
Idol?

221
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:23,912
No, you are.

222
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:24,813
Aah!

223
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,781
So tell me how you ended up
here today.

224
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,418
Well, I am actually going
through a divorce, and one of my

225
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:36,022
big dreams has been to chase my dream
of singing and actually accomplish it.

226
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,357
He held me back from it.

227
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:44,896
Doing American Idol is something
that I've always wanted to do,

228
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:50,601
and I know it's something that
can give us a better life and

229
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,205
show her, you know, don't let
anybody hold you back.

230
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,673
You want to chase your dream...

231
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:03,981
You want to chase your dream,

232
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,551
you chase it, and mommy will
always be behind you.

233
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:11,921
Good luck, mommy.

234
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,189
Aw, thank you.

235
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:22,963
Hey, now, who-who's her?

236
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,231
Hi, how are you?

237
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,766
This is Madison.

238
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:26,733
You are-?

239
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:27,467
And I'm Rachelle.

240
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:28,568
Hi, Rachelle.

241
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,170
Tell me a little bit about
yourself.

242
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,772
Um, I used to be a

243
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:37,611
professional singer, and then I
went off and fell in love and

244
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,880
got married, and he took all
them dreams away from me.

245
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,950
And then we decided-

246
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,452
we do things for love
sometimes.

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,119
Yeah.

248
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:50,623
Then we decided to split up, and
my girlfriend said, "let's go

249
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:51,757
try out for American Idol," and

250
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:55,194
I said, "I've got just the song,"
and it was one he didn't like.

251
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:56,596
Perfect.

252
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,997
That's the one we want to
hear.

253
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,399
That's the one we want to
hear.

254
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,000
And Madison was down with you
trying out, too, right?

255
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:03,303
Maddy wanted to come out here
and meet you guys and-

256
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,270
aw. Hi, maddy.

257
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:06,940
I saw you this morning,
Maddy.

258
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:07,841
Did you see me?

259
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:08,675
Mm-hmm.

260
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:09,543
So cute.

261
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,344
What are you gonna sing?

262
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:13,047
Um, "Find somebody New".
It's by Faith Hill.

263
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:13,781
Okay.

264
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,183
Wow.

265
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,150
Find somebody new.

266
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,354
Madison, you gonna dance
along with mom?

267
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,156
No.

268
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:21,824
Tap dance?

269
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,192
You gotta tap dance along with
her.

270
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,860
Maybe-maybe it'll dance it
up.

271
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:25,661
All right.

272
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,097
<i>Good morning, dearly beloved,

273
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,466
<i>We're gathered here today,

274
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:32,535
<i>To watch two people we know,

275
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:34,537
<i>Make a big mistake,

276
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:35,571
<i>They'll stand up,

277
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,006
<i>at the altar,

278
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,442
<i>and solemnly swear "I do",

279
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:41,278
<i>they'll be together forever,

280
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:44,281
<i>till they find somebody new,

281
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,549
<i>the bride is a flirt,

282
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:46,850
<i>and the groom is worse,

283
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,018
<i>as he's putting the ring,

284
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,119
<i>on her,

285
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,119
<i>he's checking out,

286
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:50,954
<i>the bridesmaids,

287
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,288
<i>thinkin' that he might make,

288
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:56,893
<i>the maid of honor honor,

289
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:59,562
I thought that one was pretty
fun.

290
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:00,430
It is pretty funny.

291
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:01,298
Oh!

292
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,000
...at everybody's wedding.

293
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,668
I think you sing great.

294
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:05,535
Thank you.

295
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:06,703
I think you've got a great

296
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:09,640
sense of melody and, you know, I
like your moxie.

297
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,774
Yes, yeah.

298
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:11,809
A lot of energy in your voice,

299
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,211
a lot of passion.

300
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,312
It sounded really, really great.

301
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,079
Thank you.

302
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,580
A lot of pure tone.
I love it.

303
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:17,248
Yep.

304
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,783
I mean, I'm-I'm impressed.

305
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:19,651
Thank you.

306
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,318
Wow.

307
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,453
Maddy, mommy's good.

308
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,120
Mm-hmm.

309
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:23,555
Hey, who taught me everything
I know?

310
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:24,222
You?

311
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:25,824
Let's take a vote.
Randy?

312
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:26,958
Yes. I'll say yes.

313
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:27,893
Oh, my gosh.

314
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,760
I'll say yes too.

315
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,128
And I will say yes, and

316
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,330
you're going to Hollywood.

317
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:34,932
Whoo!

318
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,967
Mom and maddy, going to
Hollywood.

319
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:37,768
Yeah.

320
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:38,969
Let's go tell everybody else.

321
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:39,770
Thank you.

322
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:40,437
Thank you.

323
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,105
Thank you.

324
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:41,940
Wow, a real cowgirl.

325
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:42,843
Yeah?

326
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:46,382
Cute little girl.

327
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,317
Wow.

328
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:54,524
Ah, I made it, I made it, I
made it, aah!

329
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:55,492
You let Maddy go back.

330
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,426
Thank you so much.

331
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:57,227
Congratulations.

332
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:57,894
Thank you.

333
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,163
How'd you feel when you were
singing up there in front of the judges?

334
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:00,831
You know what?

335
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,832
I actually felt totally at home

336
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,367
at something that I want to do

337
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:04,568
and that I had my little girl

338
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,671
there beside me, and it was just

339
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,273
the biggest dream I think I've
ever done in my life.

340
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:16,879
Coming up, we meet more of St.
Louis' finest...

341
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:18,981
Hmm.

342
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,283
I will [Bleep] hit you.

343
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,051
Or maybe not.

344
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,486
Plus, two incredible stories of

345
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:27,454
courage in the face of
adversity.

346
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:30,624
My dad had to go to drug and
alcohol rehabilitation.

347
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:32,727
I kind of got pushed around
and bullied.

348
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:33,628
I'll tell you what, man.

349
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,764
That was so beautiful, you made
me cry.

350
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,100
That's how good that was just
now.

351
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:45,945
Welcome back to St. Louis,

352
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:47,446
where the "show me" state has

353
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:51,183
shown us some pretty sweet
sounds.

354
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:52,984
That's what all this is.

355
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:56,721
People with a good set of pipes.

356
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,789
Okay.

357
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,657
-Correct?
-Yeah.

358
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,559
I don't know if 20,000 of 'em

359
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,394
all have a good set of pipes.

360
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:05,596
I wouldn't want to listen to
that many people.

361
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,564
<i>There used to be,

362
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,066
<i>a graying tower,

363
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:11,502
<i>alone on the sea,

364
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:13,938
<i>you became the light,

365
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,641
<i>on the dark side of me,

366
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,843
<i>love remains,

367
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:21,646
It says here, "music is my
wife," right?

368
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:22,480
Yeah.

369
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:23,281
Your wife's gonna be looking for

370
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:25,116
a divorce, dog, you keep singing
like that.

371
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,751
So the good streak appears to

372
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,486
be over, and as midday

373
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,655
approaches, St. Louis is turning

374
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,923
into the gateway to the worst.

375
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:35,826
<i>You just gotta ignite,

376
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,327
<i>the light,

377
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,096
<i>Here now,

378
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:45,071
<i>between the other side,

379
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:48,742
<i>it's a crime,

380
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:52,480
<i>we could have had it all,

381
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,250
<i>rolling in the deep,

382
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:59,687
<i>The thunder rolls,

383
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,790
<i>the thunder rolls,

384
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,024
<i>and the lightning strikes,

385
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:03,992
Whoa, whoa, man, hold on.

386
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,393
This is not candy store, rock

387
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,428
'n' roll, corporation jellyroll,

388
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:08,830
play the singles, it ain't me,

389
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,198
it's programmed insanity,

390
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,967
you ascap, if bmi could ever

391
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:13,468
make a Mountain fly, if Japanese

392
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,736
can boil teas, then where the

393
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,204
[bleep] Are my royalties?

394
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:17,639
Hmm.

395
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,677
Okay, so we hit a little snag
here.

396
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,179
Maybe the judges need to channel

397
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,048
some good energy back into the
room.

398
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,382
Okay, let's do it.

399
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,516
Wonder powers.

400
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:29,551
Wonder powers, let's go.

401
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,352
That's right.

402
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,953
Yes, we give each other good
energy.

403
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:32,721
We can, yes, we can.

404
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:33,889
In the form of...

405
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,157
Superstars.

406
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:35,858
That's right.

407
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,126
Will our next contestant have

408
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:39,461
the power it takes to get that
golden ticket?

409
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,329
Hello.

410
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:40,996
Hi.

411
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:41,664
How are you guys doing?

412
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:42,331
Good, how are you?

413
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,032
Good.

414
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,866
What's your name?

415
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:45,067
My name is Reese Glockner.

416
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:46,135
Where from?

417
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,169
St. Louis, Missouri.

418
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,204
Hometown boy.

419
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:48,938
Yes, sir.

420
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:49,605
Nice.

421
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,440
So, now, tell me about you
growing up.

422
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,243
Um, it was kind of difficult.

423
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:57,813
In High School, I got pushed
around and bullied.

424
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:02,517
I came from a 152-student
lutheran school.

425
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:07,422
I was swooped into this massive
public High School.

426
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:11,525
I was so young and so small, I
guess, kids thought they could

427
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:12,826
take advantage of me.

428
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,429
I debated dropping out of high

429
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:18,132
school, and so it was kind of
tough.

430
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:20,468
It was my senior year.

431
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:21,502
I was just singing down the

432
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:22,537
hall, and one of the choir

433
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:24,772
teachers said, "hey, you should
try choir.

434
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:25,440
You sound really good."

435
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:29,044
Once I joined choir, it was a
major turning point.

436
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:30,379
I found a couple friends who

437
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,281
were really supportive, and so

438
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,516
they helped pull me through.

439
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:37,486
I definitely gained a lot of
confidence, and I think it's

440
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:41,657
made me who I am today, and I'm
a lot tougher because of it.

441
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,992
It gives you a lot of stuff

442
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,960
to sing about if you write your
own songs, though, right?

443
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,362
Yeah, exactly.

444
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,529
What are you singing today?

445
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,164
I'm gonna sing "Lean On Me"

446
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,165
Do it.

447
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:54,569
<i>Sometimes in our lives,

448
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,371
<i>we all have pain,

449
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,339
Mmm.

450
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:01,477
<i>We all have sorrow,

451
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:02,678
Mmm, mmm.

452
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,981
<i>But if we are wise,

453
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,484
<i>we know that there's,

454
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:10,954
<i>always tomorrow,

455
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,756
<i>lean on me,

456
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,493
<i>when you're not strong,

457
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,995
<i>and I'll be your friend,

458
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,232
<i>I'll help you carry on,

459
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:26,004
<i>oh, for it won't be long,

460
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,539
<i>till I'm gonna need,

461
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,975
<i>somebody,

462
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,077
<i>to lean on,

463
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:34,745
Mmm.

464
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,946
I'll tell you what, man, that

465
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,881
was so beautiful, you made me
cry.

466
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:38,715
Wow, dude, that's-

467
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,616
that's just how good-that's

468
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,717
how good that was just now.

469
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,153
Wow, that's crazy.

470
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,589
You made me tear up and get
all crazy inside.

471
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,624
Don't even say that to me
right now.

472
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,425
I think.

473
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,394
I haven't heard anything like
that.

474
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,595
Oh, my God.

475
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,063
So, that-is that a yes for
you?

476
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:52,897
It's a-yeah.

477
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:53,731
Yeah.

478
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,532
That's a yes for me too.

479
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,833
Oh, my God.

480
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,104
Dude, it's a definitely yes
for me too.

481
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,006
Welcome to Hollywood!

482
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,174
Hollywood!

483
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:03,342
Hollywood, baby!

484
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,042
You made it!

485
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,677
Thank you so much, you guys.

486
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:06,912
Whoo!

487
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:12,718
Sweet!

488
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:13,986
Hollywood!

489
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:15,587
Yes!

490
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:22,294
That-that's phenomenal,
that was.

491
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,330
Congratulations, Reese.

492
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:25,498
Now, you want to tell them?

493
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,565
How did it go?

494
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:27,533
It went awesome.

495
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,603
They, uh, said that I was one of
the best singers they've heard.

496
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:31,604
How'd that make you feel?

497
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,040
Um, pretty amazing.

498
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,442
Wow.

499
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,769
Looks like Reese will fit
right in when he gets to Hollywood

500
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:45,584
After the break, the day-two
talent comes on strong.

501
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:46,552
Holy crumb cake.

502
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,421
But first, a father/son
story...

503
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,155
Unreal.

504
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,723
With a surprising outcome.

505
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,593
You look nothing like the way
you sound.

506
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,394
Well, you're not really gonna
use this, are you?

507
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,061
Oh, yeah, they will.

508
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,364
They absolutely will not use
that.

509
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,332
They will use it.

510
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,310
Back with you here in St. Louis.

511
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:11,845
Look at this crowd.

512
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:13,480
Look at these people.

513
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,115
With this group, faces like

514
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:16,516
that, there has got to be some

515
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,919
good talent for our judges.

516
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:21,722
However, Steven wasn't quite
ready.

517
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,223
He was backstage, giving our

518
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,792
next contestants a little pep
talk.

519
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,494
Listen, you know why you're
here.

520
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,629
Whatever you've got, you know
you've got it.

521
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:30,397
Yeah.

522
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:31,064
Right?

523
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:31,831
You watch Idol.

524
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,534
So just come out and go,
"boo-yah."

525
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:38,605
I know it's easier said than
done, but I know you can do it.

526
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:41,942
The pep talk we just had
helped me a lot.

527
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,909
It kind of brought me back down

528
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:46,680
to earth a little bit and, I
don't know, I feel completely,

529
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,417
completely different than I did
about three minutes ago.

530
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:51,751
Come on, now.

531
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,585
Let's do this.

532
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,187
Come on, now.

533
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:54,854
There he is.

534
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:55,521
Hey.

535
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,189
How are we?

536
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:56,855
Good.

537
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:57,523
Great, man.

538
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:58,190
What's your name?

539
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,091
My name is Ethan Jones.

540
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,292
And how old are you?

541
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,193
I'm 22 years old.

542
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,427
What is up here, man?

543
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:03,328
What's going on?

544
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,330
I had a cut on my forehead,

545
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,598
and in nervousness, I just went

546
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,768
like that, and I scratched it,
and it got open.

547
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:10,736
Wow.

548
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,403
Hmm.

549
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:12,204
You're gonna be okay, right?

550
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:12,871
I'll be fine.

551
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,240
Wow.

552
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:15,674
Tell me a little bit about
yourself.

553
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:18,110
Well, I, uh, dropped out of
school...

554
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:18,777
Yeah?

555
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:19,745
To be a full-time musician,

556
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,246
and it's with my dad and

557
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,149
basically my extended family.

558
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:24,651
Now you're in a band with
your dad?

559
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,087
Yeah, he's-he's not, uh, in
the band anymore.

560
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:27,821
Mm-hmm.

561
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,691
Decided to take a hiatus and
left it to me.

562
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Tell us more about your dad.

563
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,662
My dad helped found one of

564
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:36,564
the biggest bands in the St.
Louis area.

565
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,000
When you're out all the time

566
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:43,105
and you're around alcohol and
you're around drugs, it's tough.

567
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:47,209
My dad had to go to drug and
alcohol rehabilitation.

568
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:50,980
We had all decided that he

569
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,282
needed to go away and get

570
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:55,151
counseling for it.

571
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:57,920
It's been-it's been hard to
talk to him.

572
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:59,722
I'm not mad at him for

573
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,724
everything that's happened in
the past.

574
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,292
I just want to move forward and

575
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,060
I want that positive synergy to

576
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,196
bring us closer together.

577
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,264
-I can relate to that.
-I like it.

578
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,132
Wow, it's so good that he can

579
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,867
be a power of example to you and

580
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,003
everybody else around him.

581
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:16,172
I know I work hard to do that as
well.

582
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:17,107
He's a great man.

583
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:17,874
Good for you.

584
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:18,875
You tell him I said hello.

585
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:19,676
I will. Thank you.

586
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:20,343
Nice, man.

587
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:21,311
What are you gonna sing for us?

588
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,413
I'm gonna sing "I'll Be" by
Edwin Mccain.

589
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:24,247
Oh, let's have it.

590
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:25,448
Mmm.

591
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,916
<i>The strands in your eyes,

592
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:30,385
<i>that color them wonderful,

593
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:34,488
<i>stop me and steal my breath,

594
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,024
<i>and emeralds from mountains,

595
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:39,760
<i>that thrust towards the sky,

596
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,531
<i>never revealing their depth,

597
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,700
<i>and I'll be,

598
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:48,636
<i>your crying shoulder,

599
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:52,841
<i>I'll be love's suicide,

600
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,978

601
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:57,913
<i>when I'm older,

602
00:22:57,982 --> 00:23:01,317
<i>I'll be the greatest fan,

<i>of your life,

604
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:06,355
-Nice.
-I love the way you sing, man.

605
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:07,156
Thank you so much.

606
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,724
I just really love the way
you sing.

607
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,993
I like the kind of whole
unassuming thing.

608
00:23:11,062 --> 00:23:14,731
You walk in, you look nothing
like the way you sound.

609
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:16,700
And when he was sing-when

610
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:17,367
you were singing-

611
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:18,135
I hope that's good.

612
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:19,603
The "I'll be" at the end of
it-

613
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:20,270
yeah.

614
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,004
And you were kind of smiling

615
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:22,473
there, I could almost see you,

616
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,607
like, in a country video or

617
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:24,841
something, your face.

618
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,709
Well, I play in a country

619
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,378
band, so I guess that's a good
thing.

620
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:28,980
But you didn't sing a country
song.

621
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:29,747
No.

622
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:30,515
Unreal.

623
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,716
I play country music because

624
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,684
that's what I was born and

625
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:34,319
raised on, and I love to do it,

626
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:36,722
but my heart's in soul.

627
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,823
Well, listen, I mean, we all

628
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:39,291
love your voice, so-so let's

629
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,225
take a quick vote here.

630
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:40,959
Jennifer?

631
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:41,727
I say yes.

632
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:42,594
Randy?

633
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:43,328
I say yes.

634
00:23:43,397 --> 00:23:44,096
Steven?

635
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:45,130
I say yes, man.

636
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:45,797
Oh, God.

637
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:46,965
You're going to Hollywood!

638
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,466
Whoo!

639
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:49,167
And I want to meet your

640
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:50,635
father, man, when he gets out.

641
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:51,502
Sure thing.

642
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:52,403
I'll be setting that up.

643
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,371
Tell him God speed, work it
out, man.

644
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,139
Thank you very much.

645
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:55,939
Stay strong.

646
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:57,407
Thank you very much for your
time.

647
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,743
Yeah.

648
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,154
Congratulations, bro.

649
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,723
Yeah!

650
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:12,557
How does it feel?

651
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,358
Yeah!

652
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:14,125
Yeah!

653
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,261
How does it feel?

654
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,864
Hearing Steven Tyler say that he
loved my voice...

655
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:19,798
Yeah!

656
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:20,899
Oh, my God.

657
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:24,670
Boy, that was good.

658
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:25,470
Good, natural voice he's got.

659
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:26,238
Wow.

660
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,072
Yeah.

661
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,109
Thank you.

662
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,344
And I just wanted to call and

663
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:34,981
tell you that I love you.

664
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:40,321
And we need to get together
soon.

665
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:45,159
So proud.

666
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:48,129
Me too, so...

667
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:56,505
I'm so proud of you.

668
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:01,843
Coming up...

669
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:02,611
All right.

670
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,447
The busiest man on the planet
takes the stage...

671
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,483
And he's brought some backup.

672
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,686
You guys heard him sing while
he was on the job?

673
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:12,120
I think he's great.

674
00:25:12,189 --> 00:25:13,355
Go get 'em, baby.

675
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,022
Hmm.

676
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:15,924
Plus, an amazing voice...

677
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:16,591
Wow.

678
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,292
Ooh, wow.

679
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:18,260
You don't want to miss.

680
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:19,928
You're one of the best voices
we've heard.

681
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:20,996
Oh, my God.

682
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:23,031
And during this break...

683
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,333
<i>You, me, Madonna,

684
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:27,035
An exclusive first look at

685
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:31,206
Madonna's hot new video,
"Give Me All Your Lovin'".

686
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:41,417
Watch out, St. Louis, here we
come!

687
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:42,252
St. Louis or bust.

688
00:26:42,287 --> 00:26:42,920
Whoo!

689
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:44,455
Welcome back to the ultimate

690
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:46,056
road trip, where contestants

691
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,724
from all over have descended

692
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:50,794
upon St. Louis, chasing their
dreams.

693
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:51,562
We're gonna go on a journey

694
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,130
together, you and me, little
camera.

695
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,498
I'll be giving you a tour.

696
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,900
And lifelong memories are

697
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:58,069
made every step of the way.

698
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:00,605
This is Katie's first time
ever seeing the arch.

699
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:03,342
There it is, up there.

700
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,943
And just before kicking off

701
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:08,580
day two, Steven can't help hide
his enthusiasm.

702
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:09,514
And that's what it's like

703
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,584
backstage here at Idol, day
after day, night after night.

704
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:15,254
Jennifer arrives dressed for
the part.

705
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:17,857
I feel good, hopeful, looking
for stars.

706
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:19,526
Well, that should be easy.

707
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,795
And no pressure, right, St.
Louis?

708
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:23,897
As ac/dc put it, it's a long

709
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:27,900
way to the top to-if you want
to rock and roll.

710
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:29,568
I think what he means is,

711
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:31,637
you've got to start somewhere.

712
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,105
I'm a pharmacy tech.

713
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:33,973
Photographer.

714
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,241
Freelance audio engineer.

715
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:36,308
What do you do?

716
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:37,443
Nothing.

717
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:39,745
But for our next contestant,

718
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:43,549
his dreams of stardom began
right here.

719
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:45,750
No, literally right here.

720
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,252
I understand you work here.

721
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:47,919
I do.

722
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:48,687
Okay.

723
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:50,321
So, what's your job here at the
hotel?

724
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,191
I'm a hotel auditor here, so
I do a lot of stuff.

725
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,359
I'm always on the go.

726
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:55,761
I inspect the building, secure

727
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,528
each entrance, make sure

728
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:57,663
accounts are settled, guests are

729
00:27:57,731 --> 00:27:58,797
checked out, rooms should be set

730
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:00,834
up, our vips should be done,

731
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:01,968
compile reports, revenue

732
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,670
reports, outlet reports, look

733
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:05,005
for variances in our budget and

734
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,873
revenue, compile that into a
report.

735
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:07,608
Where's the staff?

736
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:08,375
What's everybody doing?

737
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:09,777
Let's get some of the staff
here.

738
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:10,444
Sure.

739
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:11,246
Okay, let's go.

740
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:11,913
Come on.

741
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:19,021
You're up.

742
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,688
It's your shot.

743
00:28:19,757 --> 00:28:20,456
Go.

744
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:21,123
It's my shot.

745
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,459
Service with a smile.

746
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:24,126
Good luck.

747
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,863
Okay, let's go.

748
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:27,797
Uh-oh.

749
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,231
Wow.

750
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,065
Hi.

751
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:33,035
What-uh, mark, who are all
these people?

752
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:34,237
These are my staff members.

753
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:35,238
They're here with me today.

754
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:36,539
Oh, you work in this hotel?

755
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,975
All right.

756
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:41,210
All right, so have you guys

757
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,911
heard him sing while he was on
the job?

758
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,679
Yeah.

759
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:44,913
Yes, every time, all day.

760
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:45,647
Yes, yes.

761
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:46,648
All the time.

762
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:48,116
He sings all the time.

763
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:48,784
I do.

764
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,651
But he sings good.

765
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,385
He sings good.

766
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:52,455
So did you guys all think he

767
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,556
should try out for Idol?

768
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:54,223
Yes.

769
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:54,890
Of course.

770
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:55,557
Yeah.

771
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:56,625
Yeah, we pushed him.

772
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,393
All right, so what you
singing today?

773
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:00,629
I'm going to sing "Overjoyed"
by Stevie Wonder today.

774
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,296
Love it.

775
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:01,964
Is he ready?

776
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:02,664
He ready.

777
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:03,932
I'm ready, bird.

778
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,768
Aw.

779
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,036
I like this.

780
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:09,171
Yeah.

781
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,339
All right, baby.

782
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:13,141
<i>I've come much too far,

783
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,344
<i>for you now to say,

784
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,813
<i>that I have to throw,

785
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,116
<i>my castle away,

786
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:21,450
<i>and though you don't believe,

787
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,586
<i>that they do,

788
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,321
<i>they do come true,

789
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,991
<i>for did my dreams come true,

790
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,726
<i>when I looked at you,

791
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:31,727
<i>and maybe too,

792
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:34,430
<i>if you would believe,

793
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:41,004
<i>you too like I,

794
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:44,474
<i>overjoyed,

795
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:46,943
<i>over loving,

796
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:51,748
<i>over you,

797
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:52,949
Hmm.

798
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:53,816
All right, baby.

799
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:55,485
Okay, uh, uh-

800
00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:56,486
i'm nervous.

801
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:58,488
Hotel staff, what did you
think?

802
00:29:58,557 --> 00:29:59,723
I think he's great.

803
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:00,790
Go get 'em baby.

804
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:01,925
Thank you.

805
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:04,061
You know what, man?

806
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,297
I love how much of life you're
all up into.

807
00:30:06,365 --> 00:30:08,199
But, man, your-your-your-your

808
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,035
voice, you know, and melody,

809
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:14,172
and keeping that tune, uh, was
lacking a little bit.

810
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:15,240
I can keep that tune.

811
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,175
Hmm.

812
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:16,842
A little nervous.

813
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:18,777
Your voice gives out on you and
everything.

814
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:19,445
You're like-

815
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:20,279
<i>and though you don't,

816
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:23,616
<i>believe that they do,

817
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:26,551
<i>they do come true,

818
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,619
What do you think, Steven?

819
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:28,320
You know, man, I love

820
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,822
everything about you except the
melody.

821
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,757
May I please sing a different
song?

822
00:30:32,826 --> 00:30:33,524
Oh.

823
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:35,325
I want to say yes to you so
bad.

824
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:35,993
Say it.

825
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:38,995
I really do, but-but I
can't.

826
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,196
I think I know something that

827
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:41,231
could change your mind.

828
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:42,298
What's that?

829
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:47,837
<i>We are undercover passion,

830
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:50,673
<i>on the run,

831
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:52,809
<i>chasing love,

832
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:56,879
<i>up against the sun,

833
00:30:56,949 --> 00:30:59,415
<i>we are strangers by day,

834
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,216
<i>lovers by night,

835
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:01,751
Okay, okay, okay.

836
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,219
Look, I'm gonna say no.

837
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,687
You're not quite ready for this.

838
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:05,855
Jennifer, what do you say?

839
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:06,589
Yeah, baby.

840
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,657
No, I'm sorry.

841
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:08,491
Steven?

842
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,126
Man, I'm gonna say no.

843
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:11,394
But we love you.

844
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:12,328
We love the staff.

845
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,930
We love all the-

846
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:14,731
thank you.

847
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,398
It's all right.

848
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,499
All the confidence.

849
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:17,300
You've got everything else.

850
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:18,734
Just one audition.
That's all it is.

851
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:19,769
Nice to meet all of you.

852
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:20,569
Thank you, guys.

853
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:21,737
See you later.

854
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:22,905
Wow.

855
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:23,739
Thank you, Ryan.

856
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:25,140
I needed that, 'cause it is hot.

857
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,643
Those stage lights are killing
me.

858
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:32,181
Oh, Fanny, you lost your
number.

859
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,383
I made it!

860
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:35,985
Even if they say no, my heart

861
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:37,887
says yes, so I'll continue to

862
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:39,221
grow and I'll continue to sing.

863
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,956
What'd you think of your
man's singing?

864
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,224
Uh, he definitely needs a

865
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,693
little work, but he'll try again

866
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:44,761
next year, though, for sure.

867
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:45,528
Right on.

868
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:47,997
If you're ever in St. Louis,

869
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,266
come on by, and I'll sing you a
song.

870
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,401
Well, I don't know about you,

871
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,904
but I, for one, cannot wait.

872
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:55,738
<i>And maybe too,

873
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,441
<i>if you would believe,

874
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:04,780
<i>you too like I,

875
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,048
Up next, a father's love

876
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:09,083
inspires one last audition.

877
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:10,785
I've always been daddy's
little girl.

878
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:12,419
I've always followed in his
footsteps.

879
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:15,155
And it strikes a chord with
one of our judges.

880
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,990
I didn't need to hear that
song right now.

881
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:18,992
Right, Jen, right?

882
00:32:27,743 --> 00:32:29,376
Welcome back to St. Louis,

883
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,144
where the Idol auditions for

884
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:34,147
season 11 are coming to an end.

885
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:35,849
There's one voice left to hear,

886
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:39,219
and that belongs to Lauren gray.

887
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,822
So you're, uh, in the family
business, huh?

888
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:42,556
Yeah, of course.

889
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:45,192
Everybody's in the family
business.

890
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,428
My family is very unique and

891
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:50,030
kind of, like, famous in this
little, small town.

892
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,166
My family owns and runs their

893
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:54,435
own one-stop wedding shop.

894
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:56,370
We work together.

895
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:59,707
One cooks and one sets up the
wedding stuff.

896
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:02,610
And I sing every weekend with my
father in a band.

897
00:33:02,678 --> 00:33:04,312
My father puts together weddings

898
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,913
by day and rock star at night.

899
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:08,348
My father and I are extremely,
extremely close.

900
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,050
I've always been daddy's little
girl.

901
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:11,818
I've always followed in his
footsteps.

902
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,458
American Idol has always been
a big deal to him.

903
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:22,496
He is a big part of why I'm here
today.

904
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:25,365
It would mean the world to me to
go to Hollywood.

905
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:26,233
It's been a dream of mine

906
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:29,370
always, but also my father's
dream as well.

907
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:34,610
I've worked my butt off getting
here already.

908
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,712
Today is make it or break it.

909
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,316
Ladies and gentlemen, miss
Lauren gray.

910
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,023
Bring it on.

911
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:45,690
Next.

912
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,491
Oh, hi.

913
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,291
Hi.

914
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,259
Hi.

915
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:48,993
Hello.

916
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:49,727
What's your name?

917
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:50,728
Lauren gray.

918
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:51,929
Lauren, how old are you?

919
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:52,997
22 years old.

920
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:53,831
And where are you from?

921
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,399
Hardy, Arkansas.

922
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,268
What do you do in Hardy,
Arkansas?

923
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:00,136
Uh, well, I perform in a band
with my father.

924
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,238
It's a Southern rock band.

925
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,005
Cool.

926
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:02,806
And we do it every weekend.

927
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,873
I've been doing it since I was,

928
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,008
uh, in the band since I was
about 18.

929
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,410
So you guys are her parents?

930
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,111
Mm-hmm.

931
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,811
What do you guys do?

932
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,847
We're florists, a bridal
shop.

933
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,183
Uh, have a band all my life.

934
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,052
The band I would have
guessed.

935
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,721
Floral shop I wouldn't have
guessed.

936
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:17,388
Me?

937
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:18,055
Yeah.

938
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:18,789
All right, so what are you

939
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:19,958
gonna sing today, because you're

940
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:21,192
in a Southern rock band like the

941
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,094
allman brothers or skynyrd or
something.

942
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:23,795
Well, I have more of a-a

943
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:25,163
bluesy type voice, but I will be

944
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,731
singing Adele, "One And Only", for
you.

945
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,399
Okay.

946
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:28,066
Do it.

947
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:28,733
New.

948
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,335
All right.

949
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:33,372
<i>Said you've been on my mind,

950
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:37,777
<i>I grow fonder every day,

951
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:40,413
<i>lose myself in time,

952
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:41,081
Wow.

953
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:41,748
Ooh, wow.

954
00:34:41,817 --> 00:34:43,584
<i>Just thinking,

955
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:44,985
<i>of your face,

956
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:47,921
<i>but God only knows,

957
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,691
<i>why it's taken me so long,

958
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,594
<i>to let my doubts go,

959
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:56,763
<i>'cause I'm the only one,

960
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:58,197
<i>that you want,

961
00:34:58,266 --> 00:34:59,198
<i>I don't know,

962
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,466
<i>why I'm scared,

963
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,067
<i>'cause I've been here before,

964
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:04,436

00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:30,663
Okay.

976
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:31,464
Wow.

977
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,366
I didn't need to hear that
song right now.

978
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:36,169
Right, Jen, right?

979
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:37,304
Okay.

980
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,105
All right, cool.

981
00:35:38,173 --> 00:35:39,940
You broke a little bit on the
top there.

982
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:40,774
I know, I know.

983
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:41,675
I cracked bad.

984
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:42,343
Lost some notes.

985
00:35:42,412 --> 00:35:43,110
Do you usually do that?

986
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,713
No, not at all, not at all.

987
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,181
I wouldn't imagine so.

988
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,683
All right, so what do we
think, Steven?

989
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:49,650
So I think I love the way you

990
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,685
break, and I love the way you go

991
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:51,919
up there and you're fearless

992
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:53,220
about it, and that's really

993
00:35:53,288 --> 00:35:55,255
important because when people

994
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:56,957
sing, and you deliver a chorus

995
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:58,225
line and you can break like

996
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,627
that and get up there and hit

997
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:02,129
the note and break, that's the

998
00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:03,697
sexiest thing on the planet.

999
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:05,165
And your delivery was great.

1000
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:06,166
Thank you.

1001
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,100
That's a great compliment.

1002
00:36:07,169 --> 00:36:09,069
But at least you're fearless
about it.

1003
00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:09,769
That's what I like.

1004
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:10,737
You know, I mean, you've gotta

1005
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:11,971
be willing to take chances and

1006
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,506
jump off that ledge as a singer

1007
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:14,440
if you're gonna be a great one.

1008
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:15,274
Yes.

1009
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:16,142
Well, hopefully there'll be a

1010
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,144
little ray of sunlight coming
your way here.

1011
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:20,747
She's a ray of sunlight
anyway, man.

1012
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,182
You're one of the best female
voices we've heard.

1013
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:23,217
Wow.

1014
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:23,850
Yeah, man.

1015
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:24,517
Oh, my God.

1016
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:27,053
And I'm gonna say absolutely,
100% yes.

1017
00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:28,254
Oh, wow. Wow.

1018
00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:29,856
I say yes too.

1019
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:31,157
I say yes too.

1020
00:36:31,226 --> 00:36:31,958
You're incredible.

1021
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:32,825
Love you.

1022
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,293
And you are going to
Hollywood.

1023
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:34,961
Oh, my God.

1024
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:35,895
Yeah, baby!

1025
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:37,430
It's going down in Hollywood!

1026
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:38,164
This is the biggest thing

1027
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:39,598
that has ever happened in my
life.

1028
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,166
It won't be the biggest thing
ever.

1029
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,801
Short of your daddy lovin'
you.

1030
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,568
This is great.

1031
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:44,235
Thank you, guys.

1032
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,003
Well, tell your dad to play

1033
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:46,504
"Whipping Post" and dedicate it
to me.

1034
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:47,972
Oh, that's one of my favorite
songs.

1035
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,474
That's one of my favorites,
too.

1036
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:50,308
All right, see you in Hollywood.

1037
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:50,976
Thank you, guys.

1038
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:51,643
Thank you.

1039
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:53,445
Thank you, guys, so much.

1040
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:55,314
Big thing gonna happen for
her.

1041
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:01,188
She's gonna make it.

1042
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:02,156
Uh, yeah.

1043
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:03,991
I mean, wow.

1044
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,760
I love it.

1045
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,399
Okay, I have two words for
today.

1046
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:12,066
Thank you.

1047
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:13,000
Lauren Gray.

1048
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:13,834
Yes.

1049
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:14,502
Yeah.

1050
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,770
And thank you.

1051
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,705
You can't be taught to sing
that way.

1052
00:37:17,774 --> 00:37:18,706
You can only learn it on your

1053
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:20,608
own and have some inside

1054
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:23,277
influence from-passed down from
generations.

1055
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:24,145
It's so amazing.

1056
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:24,812
Ooh!

1057
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:27,181
So amazing, so amazing.

1058
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,719
Eight years ago, Carrie Underwood
launched her career from St. Louis.

1059
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:33,387
Maybe this is the start for

1060
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:38,425
Lauren Gray, or one of the 46
hopefuls headed to Hollywood.

1061
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:39,559
Hey, God bless 'em.

1062
00:37:39,628 --> 00:37:42,062
I hope they all have great
success.

1063
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:43,564
I'm going to Hollywood.

1064
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:45,165
Ain't gonna happen.

1065
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:53,073
This is amazing!

1066
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:54,307
Whoo!

1067
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,313
Country girl's going to
Hollywood.

1068
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:00,347
See ya there.

1069
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:04,251
I said today, all I want is

1070
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,486
to hug an astro pop at the end
of my day.

1071
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:07,154
Astro pop.

1072
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:09,556
He's saying my shirt reminds him
of an astro pop.

1073
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,924
Like a what?

1074
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:12,292
Like a giant [Bleep].

1075
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:13,126
Good night, America.

1076
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:15,295
America.

1077
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:17,263
All right, that's it.

1078
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:18,998
And on that bombshell, we

1079
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:22,735
wrap up the road.

1080
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:25,604
People have traveled from all
over the country...

1081
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:27,339
Portland!

1082
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,841
And from all walks of life

1083
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,409
for a chance at their dream.

1084
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,711
I have a voice to speak with,

1085
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,112
you know, a voice to sing.

1086
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:39,984
Way out in the middle of the

1087
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,151
woods, I live in a tent.

1088
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,419
Yes, I do.

1089
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,320
Ooh.

1090
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,321
Wow.

1091
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,856
And we lived in a refugee

1092
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:47,390
camp, hoping there was a chance

1093
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,994
for us to come to the U.S. for a
better life.

1094
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,162
I know this is my chance and

1095
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,931
my opportunity to show the world

1096
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,566
what I have and I can't let it

1097
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,334
slip out of my hands.

1098
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:59,169
Together we shared the ups...

1099
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:00,438
Whoa!

1100
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,973
And the downs of this tour.

1101
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,541
<i>Ooh, baby,

1102
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,245
Terrible.

1103
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:08,446
But along the way, we've

1104
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:09,781
unveiled a new crop of

1105
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,316
incredibly talented fresh
faces...

1106
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:13,984
Somebody who was born to do
it.

1107
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:15,185
Thank you.

1108
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:16,286
Making this the most

1109
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,654
successful road auditions we've
ever had.

1110
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,588
Major talent, man.

1111
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,324
I'm gonna say yes, and you're
going to Hollywood.

1112
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,258
Whoo!

1113
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,896
I've never seen anything like
that.

1114
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,598
Whoo!

1115
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,434
It's a dream come true.

1116
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,402
I'm, like, shaking.

1117
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,304
I don't-
oh, my goodness.

1118
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,408
When you have dreams, you
make them happen.

1119
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,142
Oh!

1120
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,943
You know what's wrong with
this girl, Steven?

1121
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,478
Absolutely nothing.

1122
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,450
Very spiritual voice.

1123
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,318
It took me away.

1124
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,321
Take that kiss to Hollywood.

1125
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,389
Aah!

1126
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,257
<i>Aaaaaahhhh,

1127
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,859
You know you're gonna be a
star, right?

1128
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:57,160
Keep singing.

1129
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,866
But this is just the
beginning of their journey.

1130
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:03,201
Guess what, mommy?

1131
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,102
You're going to Hollywood.

1132
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,570
I'm going to Hollywood.

1133
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,806
Aah!

1134
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,075
Because next week...

1135
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:11,343
We hit Hollywood.

1136
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:13,778
<i>Feel good in Hollywood,

1137
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:17,215
With show-stopping performances
and breakout stars.

1138
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,616
More of that, more of that.

1139
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:20,217
But as the pressure builds...

1140
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,522
This is where everybody goes
wrong.

1141
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,457
It's about survival of the
fittest.

1142
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:31,128
You've got to have that one
word: Courage.

1143
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:33,097
Oh!

1144
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,666
Will your favorite survive
the cut?

1145
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:37,802
This is the make it or break
it time right now.

1146
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:39,469
Will they survive the night?

1147
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,680
Give one more chance
I can show you

1148
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:46,576
tune in to the most emocional
and exhausting Hollywood week ever.

1149
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,911
Baby I'm sorry, you're going home

1150
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,941
there's so many people out there
and I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving.
