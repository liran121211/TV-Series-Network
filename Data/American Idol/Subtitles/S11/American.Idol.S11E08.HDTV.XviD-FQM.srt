1
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:03,039
<i>Hundreds of thousands
auditioned...</i>

2
00:00:03,108 --> 00:00:04,757
American idol, here we come.

3
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:05,658
I'm ready to chase my dream.

4
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:09,090
<i>For most, the idol dream
came crashing down.</i>

5
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:11,573
Never stop
believing in yourself.

6
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:14,063
I didn't make it.
This was my last shot.

7
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:17,219
<i>But for a lucky few,
the journey has just begun.</i>

8
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:18,461
You're going to Hollywood!

9
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:23,297
<i>Tonight, we raise the stakes.</i>

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,818
Leave nothing to chance.
This is it.

11
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:27,325
<i>Unstoppable drama...</i>

12
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,545
-I'm so far from being done.
<i>-Incredible talent...</i>

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,092
I like that feeling.

14
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,739
<i>And unbelievable passion.</i>

15
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:34,979
Season 11 is my year.

16
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:41,485
<i>Get ready for the one,
the only Hollywood week.</i>

17
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:45,068
<i>This is American Idol.</i>

18
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:25,461
Sarah?

19
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:32,477
Rise and shine, baby.
You're going to hollywood.

20
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:35,209
Yeah.

21
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:36,379
Shannon.

22
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:38,721
Shannon.

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,274
-My god, is it time?
-It's the day, the big day.

24
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:46,990
<i>Across the country, 302 of
the nation's elite are packing</i>

25
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:50,773
<i>their bags and leaving home
for a chance at a new life.</i>

26
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:52,411
You've got a long journey.

27
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,522
Make us proud,
make us proud.

28
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:59,506
<i>This marks the departure from
everything they've ever known.</i>

29
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:01,444
I don't know
what to expect,

30
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,054
but I know
that hollywood

31
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,531
is the place
where dreams come true.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,637
<i>But that dream
is a long way off,</i>

33
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:12,081
<i>because this week
is no vacation.</i>

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,018
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time,</i>

35
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,928
<i>please discontinue use
of any portable electronics.</i>

36
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:19,606
<i>Make sure those are turned
completely off.</i>

37
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,642
Let's go!

38
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:24,088
<i>As they arrive in Los Angeles
the future looks bright.</i>

39
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:26,764
Say hi to Hollywood!

40
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,101
It kind of feels
like a dream.

41
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,575
It doesn't really seem
completely real right now.

42
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:32,414
It feels good to be out
of the pawn shop.

43
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:33,484
I'm so excited.

44
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,387
It's my first time
in California,

45
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:38,533
so I'm ready to perform.

46
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:42,815
<i>Today, half the contestants
will take the stage,</i>

47
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,155
<i>so for them, it's do or die.</i>

48
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,964
I'm so excited right now.
Actually, I'm really scared.

49
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,843
<i>As they arrive at the theater,
the anxiety is escalating.</i>

50
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,816
I'm come up this aisle.

51
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,168
It means a lot to be here,
so I really hope I do well.

52
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:05,171
<i>The judges arrive
and share some words of wisdom.</i>

53
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:08,005
What makes the dawn rise
with thunder?

54
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,273
What makes the sphinx
the seventh wonder?

55
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:11,508
Courage!

56
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,542
What makes the hottentot
so hot?

57
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,644
Who put the ape
in apricot?

58
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:17,877
What do they got
that I ain't got?

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,245
Courage!

60
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:22,312
Don't let the nerves
get to you.

61
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:24,013
I love you guys.
I hope you do great.

62
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:26,881
Season 11 is on!

63
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:31,450
So the judges have given
their pep talk.

64
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,851
They've settled in.

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Hollywood week, season 11.

66
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,023
Another chapter
begins right now.

67
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,661
This round will work just like
it has in the past.

68
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,330
Contestants will come out
in groups of ten.

69
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,732
They'll sing
a cappella a song

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,268
of their choosing
and receive no feedback.

71
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:53,669
Even though it's similar
to years past

72
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:57,605
nothing can prepare
them for sudden death.

73
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:00,707
Half of them
will go home today.

74
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,708
<i>And that harsh reality
sets in</i>

75
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,043
<i>for the first group
to take the stage,</i>

76
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:08,913
<i>including two guys with
two very memorable auditions.</i>

77
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,983
<i>Johnny keyser blew the judges
away back in st. Louis.</i>

78
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,083
<i>But I'm afraid to die</i>

79
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,484
<i>What do you do
right now?</i>

80
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,152
I work
at an italian restaurant.

81
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,020
Keep singing.

82
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,054
<i>I don't know</i>

83
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,289
<i>What's out there, yeah</i>

84
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:22,557
You know you're gonna
be a star, right?

85
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:23,892
Keep singing!

86
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,361
<i>While heejun got off to a
shakier start in Pittsburgh.</i>

87
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,064
That should be
the chorus.

88
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,466
<i>But jennifer fell hard
for his voice.</i>

89
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,101
I love you!

90
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,050
<i>Here in hollywood,</i>

91
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,769
<i>the two could not
be more different.</i>

92
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,173
Very, very, very nervous.

93
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,674
Nothing but confidence
right now.

94
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,710
I'm not nervous.
I'm excited.

95
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,245
I just want
to get it over with.

96
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:47,612
Hit those marks for me,
you guys.

97
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,346
Good luck.

98
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:49,647
<i>First up is johnny.</i>

99
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:52,082
I'm ready.

100
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,016
My name is Johnny Keyser.

101
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,817
I'm from ft. Lauderdale,
Florida.

102
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,453
I'm gonna be singing dreamin'
by Amos Lee.

103
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,254
<i>My soul</i>

104
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:03,023
<i>Is as open as the sky</i>

105
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:09,861
<i>Oftentimes it's just as blue</i>

106
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,365
<i>sometimes
it's full of glory</i>

107
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:18,400
<i>And but mostly, yeah</i>

108
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:25,272
<i>It's for the love
and it's the love</i>

109
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,375
Nice.

110
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:32,949
<i>It's the love</i>

111
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:35,752
-Johnny!
-Amen, amen, amen.

112
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:37,854
-It's the love.
-Amen.

113
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,558
<i>Johnny appears confident,</i>

114
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:45,660
<i>which only raises
the stakes for Heejun.</i>

115
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,361
I've never heard
anyone sing

116
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,996
Like that before,
and I realized

117
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,697
The person who's going
before me

118
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,766
was the guy Jennifer Lopez fell
in love with, so I'm like,

119
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:56,067
"what do I do now,"
you know?

120
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,202
Shake it out, shake it out.

121
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,037
Yes, shak out, puppy.

122
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:05,142
<i>For Heejun, confidence has
never been his strong suit.</i>

123
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,412
So my mom decided
to help me with packing.

124
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,548
Maybe I should just tell her
this is not gonna be that long.

125
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,186
Great, so I just checked in
in Hollywood,

126
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:22,856
and I feel nervous
because I got here

127
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,192
and everyone's so tall,
so pretty.

128
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,595
Season 11!

129
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,930
Even the guys are so pretty.
I don't know why.

130
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,797
I don't know
what they eat,

131
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,098
but they're so good
looking

132
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,433
and I just have
to figure out

133
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,468
how to overcome
the beauty.

134
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:39,837
Hi, my name is Heejun.

135
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:43,474
I'm 22 years old.
I'm from New York.

136
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,608
you got it, baby.

137
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,079
<i>Tell me how am I</i>

138
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:54,149
<i>Supposed to live
without you</i>

139
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:59,154
<i>Now that I've been
loving you so long?</i>

140
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:02,724
I love him.

141
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:09,430
<i>How am I supposed
to live without you?</i>

142
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:15,203
<i>How am I supposed
to carry on</i>

143
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,975
<i>When all that I've been
living for...</i>

144
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,845
<i>Is gone</i>

145
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:25,980
Yeah, okay, all right.

146
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:29,348
Yeah, you think?

147
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,382
Whoo!

148
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,018
Lord have mercy.

149
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,319
-Brought tears to my eyes.
-Yeah.

150
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,087
Now, once each group
has a chance to perform,

151
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,989
the judges will deliberate.

152
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:43,492
They'll go one by one,
talking about each contestant,

153
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,393
and then give them
the results right away.

154
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:49,129
Remember, half of all
the contestants performing today

155
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:50,396
have to go home.

156
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:53,666
<i>With 304 talented competitors
in Hollywood,</i>

157
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:57,370
<i>will Heejun
and Johnny make the cut?</i>

158
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,038
I have a "maybe," so,
we can go one more.

159
00:07:59,107 --> 00:07:59,772
Yeah.

160
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,606
I had no, man.

161
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,474
He has nos
on both of those.

162
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:03,774
He's a no for me.

163
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,508
I didn't even recognize
the song.

164
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,176
He has a yes,
and you have a yes.

165
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:07,843
I have a yes.

166
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:08,544
two yeses.

167
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:11,880
-Okay, we've got it.
-Okay.

168
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:15,584
Gabi, please step forward.

169
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:19,387
Johnny, please step forward.

170
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:24,091
Heejun, please step forward.

171
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:33,631
Front row, congratulations.
We'll see you tomorrow.

172
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:35,865
Congratulations.

173
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:36,632
Congratulations.

174
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:44,237
<i>So heejun and johnny live to
see another day in hollywood.</i>

175
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,943
I thought everyone's too
pretty for me,

176
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,676
but guess who's
really pretty now?

177
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:53,126
And as the morning progresses
in the theater,

178
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,580
it's the beautiful voices
that are wowing

179
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,350
the judges,
like charleston's Elise testone.

180
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,086
<i>Well, it's a crazy world</i>

181
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:03,286
<i>we're livin' in</i>

182
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,889
<i>and I just can't see
that half of us</i>

183
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,090
<i>immersed in sin</i>

184
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,694
<i>is all we have to give these
futures made of</i>

185
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,466
<i>Why else do I want you</i>

186
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:23,237
<i>Like I do texas native
baylie brown.</i>

187
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:25,872
<i>if I'm not in love</i>

188
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,574

190
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,014
<i>like a little baby</i>

191
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,783
Let her go.

192
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,420
<i>Pittsburgh audition Hallie Day
also delivered the goods.</i>

193
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:46,189
<i>Before the day I met you</i>

194
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,792
<i>My life was so unkind</i>

195
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,694
<i>But you're the key</i>

196
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:54,864
<i>to my peace of mind</i>

197
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,367
<i>'Cause you make me feel</i>

198
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:02,303
<i>You make me feel</i>

199
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,571
<i>you...</i>

200
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,505
Thank you.

201
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,373
-So, that's great.
-Congratulations.

202
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,376
You guys are all through.
Thank you.

203
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:11,745
You made it.

204
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:15,381
<i>it was an easy yes
for all three ladies...</i>

205
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:25,957
<i>So hollywood week
is looking golden.</i>

206
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:30,260
<i>After the break, the best
singers of season 11 stake</i>

207
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,597
<i>their claim to becoming
the next American idol...</i>

208
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,000
<i>As new stars rise...</i>

209
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,202
Wait, don't stop,
don't stop!

210
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,170
<i>And old favorites fall.</i>

211
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,805
Sorry, you've got
to stand out.

212
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:43,705
I didn't think about losing,

213
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:44,740
And it hurts.

214
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:45,941
They're dropping like flies.

215
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,176
<i>And as the tension mounts,</i>

216
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:50,411
<i>the results will be shocking.</i>

217
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,379
I want to see some yelling,
some freaking out.

218
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:54,081
They done kicked me off
the stage.

219
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,483
Holy.

220
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:05,705
Welcome back to Idol.

221
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,741
You know, this week is filled
with stress and anxiety...

222
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,704
A true roller coaster
of emotions,

223
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:15,245
And the nerve center
is right here in the wings,

224
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,080
Backstage,
as the contestants

225
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,648
wait to walk out
and make their mark

226
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:19,982
In front of the judges.

227
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,785
My hands are sweating,
heart's beating.

228
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,987
I'm just ready to go in
and go ahead and do it.

229
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:28,289
J.Lo, Steven Tyler, and
Randy are all out there.

230
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:29,590
My gosh.

231
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,258
<i>Anxiety didn't seem
to be an a issue</i>

232
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:33,894
<i>for 25-year-old Jen Hirsh,</i>

233
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:36,163
<i>Who first impressed
the judges Galveston.</i>

234
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,698
I think you have a really
nice sounding voice.

235
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:39,265
I like where you went
with it.

236
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,733
We've got a pro up
in here at 25.

237
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:41,601
Thank you.

238
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,270
<i>Now in hollywood,
she is feeling the pressure.</i>

239
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,539
I'm a little nervous,
doing this process.

240
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:47,606
Everybody hit your marks.

241
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:48,440
Important.

242
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,210
Today, my game plan is going
to be not to fidget,

243
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,112
Feel like I do
that all the time.

244
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,413
I've watched videos of myself.

245
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,648
I'm, like, touching my hair

246
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,882
and everyth...
I did it again.

247
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,784
Try not to fidget, guys.

248
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,985
I'm Jen Hirsh.

249
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,120
I'm from Agoura Hills,
California

250
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,422
and I'm gonna sing

251
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,091
"Up to the mountain"
by Patty Griffin.

252
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:22,299
<i>I went up to the mountain
because you asked me</i>

253
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:32,878
<i>to up over the clouds
to where the sky was blue</i>

254
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:37,881
<i>Sometimes I look down</i>

255
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,149
<i>Afraid</i>

256
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,587
<i>Afraid I will fall</i>

257
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:46,388
<i>Then I hear your sweet voice</i>

258
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:47,890
Come on.

259
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:48,691
All right now.

260
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,191
All right now.

261
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,693
-Wait, don't stop.
-All right, Agoura.

262
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:54,027
<i>Come and then go</i>

263
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,229
Just for you.
Thank you.

264
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:57,430
That was beautiful.

265
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,765
<i>Jen seems to have
conquered her nerves.</i>

266
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:03,835
<i>Now she must wait patiently
as her entire line performs</i>

267
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,269
<i>before Hearing the results.</i>

268
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:09,874
<i>But st. Louis stand-out
Lauren Gray is not quite ready</i>

269
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,375
<i>to give up the spotlight.</i>

270
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:15,211
<i>You'll never know
if you never try</i>

271
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,246
<i>to forget your past</i>

272
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:21,316
<i>and simply be mine</i>

273
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,718
<i>so I dare you to let me be</i>

274
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:27,922
<i>Your one and only</i>

275
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:29,457
<i>I promise I...</i>

276
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,858
-All right.
-Sorry.

277
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:32,326
Sorry.

278
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,728
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

279
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,594
No, thank you.

280
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,428
Yep.
Nice.

281
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:39,597
<i>Finally, the judges can take
a moment to deliberate.</i>

282
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,533
Okay, the first one
we have was a little yes.

283
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:44,234
No, no, two nos.

284
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,702
Three nos, yeah.

285
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,204
I had a maybe,
so that's a no.

286
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:51,173
I loved her tone,
and she totally screwed up.

287
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:57,693
Jen Hirsh and Lauren,
congratulations,

288
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:00,347
you guys are going through.
Thank you.

289
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:04,371
<i>So Lauren and Jen now
have reason to celebrate,</i>

290
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:08,620
<i>but for many other girls,
the first day of hollywood</i>

291
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:09,754
<i>is off to a rough start.</i>

292
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:15,092
<i>So let me go crazy on you</i>

293
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,496
<i>Let me go crazy on you</i>

294
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:24,034
<i>Should I give up
or should I just</i>

295
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:25,702
<i>Keep chasin' pavement</i>

296
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,169
Thank you.

297
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:30,539
<i>You have my heart
now I want it back</i>

298
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:34,442
<i>I'm starting to see
everything you lack</i>

299
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,310
I started that a key too high.

300
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,278
A little bit too high.

301
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:39,045
Is my mic on?

302
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:45,284
I have never had my heart
Beat this much for so long.

303
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,022
is there any way
I could stay...

304
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:50,953
Just do the chorus again,
Lower?

305
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,654
can I sing a little bit more?

306
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:54,421
Please?

307
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,390
There's a lot of dynamics to it.

308
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,060
I just don't feel like I've
Shown you everything.

309
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:01,228
Just a little bit, please?
A tiny, tiny bit?

310
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:02,095
Pretty please?

311
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:04,830
I think we're good,
though, I mean, you know.

312
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,400
Just a tiny, please?
I won't disappoint you.

313
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:08,601
Okay, one note.

314
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:13,772
There you go.

315
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:15,874
-That wasn't one, but okay.
-Thank you.

316
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:17,009
Thank you.

317
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,745
Is that... Are we sure
we're done with that?

318
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:23,947
<i>After the break, two of our
Most electric performers</i>

319
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,416
<i>from the auditions will fight</i>

320
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,050
<i>for their spot
in the next round.</i>

321
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,318
I've been on stage
since two years old.

322
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,352
It's like home.

323
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:32,254
I can't believe
I'm here at all.

324
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,288
I want this very badly.

325
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,923
<i>And as the competition
heats up,</i>

326
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,926
<i>only the best will survive.</i>

327
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,460
Sorry, it's the end of the line.

328
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:42,396
<i>My gosh.</i>

329
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,219
Welcome back to Idol.

330
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:53,547
<i>It's midday
in sunny Los Angeles,</i>

331
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:56,791
<i>where the brightest voices
in america have converged</i>

332
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,093
<i>For an audition of a lifetime.</i>

333
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:01,328
Hollywood week begins today.

334
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,156
<i>After a rough patch
of auditions,</i>

335
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:05,698
<i>Steven takes a trip
backstage to deliver</i>

336
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,265
<i>a much-needed pep talk.</i>

337
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,800
I want to see some snapping,

338
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,468
Some yelling, some freaking out.

339
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,703
I want to see some camaraderie
go astray here.

340
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,871
<i>But will steven's warning</i>

341
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,539
<i>Have an effect
on the next line</i>

342
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:21,872
<i>To take the stage,
including Phil phillips,</i>

343
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,147
<i>who's a fish out
of water here in LA.?</i>

344
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:28,416
I've never flown
before on a real plane.

345
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:30,184
I've flown on
a on a plane before,

346
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,551
but I jumped out,

347
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,154
So I've flown
but never landed.

348
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:35,588
We're getting ready
to take off,

349
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:40,292
So I'll see y'all
when we get there.

350
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:43,195
It's a completely different
world from where I live.

351
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,598
I can't believe
I'm here at all.

352
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,866
I can't even sleep
at night.

353
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:48,601
I want this very badly.

354
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,501
<i>Back in savannah,
it was phil's</i>

355
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,404
<i>Version of thriller that caught
the judges' eye.</i>

356
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:57,306
<i>'Cause this is thriller</i>

357
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,441
<i>Thriller night</i>

358
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,027
<i>But without his guitar
on the Hollywood stage,</i>

359
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,378
<i>would he shine as bright?</i>

360
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:08,146
<i>Come here, sister
<i>now, now, yeah</i>

361
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,280
<i>Papa's in the swing</i>

362
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:13,284
<i>Yes he is
He ain't too hip</i>

363
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:17,286
<i>No
<i>about that new breed, babe</i>

364
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:19,021
<i>he ain't no drag</i>

365
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,990
<i>no, no, no, no</i>

366
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,591
<i>papa's got a brand new bag</i>

367
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,926
-Okay, man.
-Thank you.

368
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,064
<i>As Phillip waits
to hear his fate,</i>

369
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,831
<i>up next is a familiar face
from Pittsburgh.</i>

370
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:35,268
<i>Unlike Phil, reed grimm has
had a lifetime of experience</i>

371
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:36,435
<i>in the spotlight.</i>

372
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:39,138
I've been onstage
since two years old.

373
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:42,005
It's like home, really.
It's just where I live.

374
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:43,948
I'm gonna be singing

375
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:45,941
"I got a golden ticket"
from Willy Wonka

376
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,442
and the chocolate factory.

377
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,710
Come on now.

378
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,580
<i>I've got a golden ticket</i>

379
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:01,587
<i>I've got a golden sun up
in the sky</i>

380
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:09,161
<i>Well, I never thought
I'd see the day</i>

381
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,963
<i>when I could face the world</i>

382
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,032
<i>and say good morning</i>

383
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,168
<i>hey, well, then look
at that sun</i>

384
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,472
<i>I got a golden ticket</i>

385
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,374
<i>and so does every one
of us what?</i>

386
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,412
<i>Reed gets an overwhelming</i>

387
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,012
<i>Response from the crowd,</i>

388
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,580
<i>with only puts more
pressure on</i>

389
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:34,116
<i>Travis orlando,
who's next in line.</i>

390
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,219
<i>Just last year,
travis missed the mark</i>

391
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,494
<i>and was sent home
from Hollywood</i>

392
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:40,053
<i>right after round one.</i>

393
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,988
<i>Tonight, travis not only has</i>

394
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,320
<i>More to prove to himself,</i>

395
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,922
<i> he has more at stake
if he goes home</i>

396
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,222
<i>Empty-handed.</i>

397
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,125
My mom walked out.

398
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,126
She found
another relationship

399
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:53,727
That she obviously loved more

400
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,529
Than her family
and my mom

401
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:56,897
Broke my dad's heart.

402
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,365
At the end of the day,
all we have is each other.

403
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:02,100
I love you, dad.

404
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:04,836
I've thought a lot about

405
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,271
the mistakes
I've made on the show

406
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,040
Last year and I know what to
look out for this year.

407
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:10,908
I know what the judges
are expecting out of me.

408
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:12,142
You know,
I've been practicing

409
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,843
Enough in here
and long enough.

410
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:16,446
I'm gonna prove the judges
wrong this time.

411
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,481
Season 11 is my year.

412
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,850
<i>You've made my soul</i>

413
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:23,152
<i>a burning fire</i>

414
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,621
<i>you're getting to be
my one desire</i>

415
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,825
<i>You're getting to be
all that matters to me</i>

416
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,594
<i>and let me tell you, girl</i>

417
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:39,264
<i>I hoped pray
each day I live</i>

418
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:44,101
<i>a little more love
I have to give</i>

419
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,504
<i>all I do</i>

420
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,372
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

421
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,610
Phillip, we're gonna
see you tomorrow.

422
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,112
Thank you.

423
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,647
And Reed, you're staying too.

424
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:07,553
Travis, I'm sorry, baby.

425
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:09,355
Not this year.

426
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:16,662
<i>Reed and Phillip move on to
the next round, but for travis,</i>

427
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:18,430
<i>Saying good-bye is more than</i>

428
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,732
<i>Just another year
of shattered dreams.</i>

429
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,034
<i>It's about starting over.</i>

430
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,408
I have to go back to nothing,

431
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,577
To nothing at all.

432
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:43,346
It's kind of hard to face
That now.

433
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:45,181
I didn't think
about losing,

434
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,484
and it hurts a lot, man.

435
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,587
<i>And as day one winds down,</i>

436
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:53,622
<i>It's not just travis that
we say Good-bye to.</i>

437
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:01,989
<i>Among those going home,
Ramiro Garcia,</i>

438
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,697
<i>whose story inspired
in Galveston.</i>

439
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,635
Tamiro, I'm sorry.
It's the end of the line.

440
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:08,136
I'm still going
after my dream.

441
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,838
It's not the end of the road
for me.

442
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,972
My best days
are still to come,

443
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,107
And and I'm good.

444
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,408
We got booted off!

445
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,477
<i>And mechanic Wolf Hamlin.</i>

446
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:18,146
You either go big or go home.
Today, I'm going home.

447
00:21:18,214 --> 00:21:21,212
<i>And even though jenni schick
got a whole lot of love back in</i>

448
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,080
<i>Aspen...</i>

449
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,982
I'm sorry, you're going home.

450
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:29,184
<i>It was the cold shoulder she
Received in hollywood.</i>

451
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,887
<i>All in all, 69 people departed</i>

452
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,556
<i>The Idol stage
by the end of day one.</i>

453
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:39,822
<i>Coming up, the daughter
of a living legend</i>

454
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:41,632
<i>gets her mom on the spotlight.</i>

455
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,123
I'm Jane Carrey.

456
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:46,402
<i>A young father chases
his own dream of stardom.</i>

457
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,604
It just kind of hit me
that I'm gonna be away

458
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,871
from my daughter
for the first time.

459
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,234
<i>Take nothing for granted...</i>

460
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:52,872
Front row, it's
the end of the line.

461
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:54,773
<i>Because this
is hollywood week.</i>

462
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,601
<i>It's day two here
in Hollywood,</i>

463
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:12,038
<i>which means the second half
of contestants get</i>

464
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:14,241
<i>To take their shot
at the ultimate dream job.</i>

465
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,375
it's gonna be a fun day.

466
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,043
I'm really excited.

467
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:21,048
A little nutrition, you know?
It's gonna be a long day.

468
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:23,517
<i>The judges arrive,
poised and positive.</i>

469
00:22:23,585 --> 00:22:26,052
-How are you?
-it's a beautiful day.

470
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:30,155
-Hollywood week.
-Another day, another dollar,

471
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,226
Another man to give out
a Holler.

472
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,495
<i>But that's a stark contrast
to the mood inside the holding Ro.</i>

473
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,897
Everybody is here,
waiting anxiously.

474
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:46,303
<i>But adam brock
is staying upbeat.</i>

475
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:49,539
They're dropping like flies,
but not me.

476
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:51,441
I'm flapping my wings still.

477
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:54,310
<i>Adam breezed through his
Audition in Pittsburgh</i>

478
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:55,411
<i>with his deep, soulful voice.</i>

479
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:58,580
<i>I have been told that there's
a large black woman trapped</i>

480
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:00,182
<i>inside of my body.</i>

481
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:06,022
<i>Everything I had
is gone stormy weather</i>

482
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,325
One of my favorite albums

483
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:10,659
is all times
is Walking In Memphis,

484
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,652
Marc Cohn,
and when you started singing,

485
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,364
it reminded me
of that a little bit.

486
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,268
<i>But adam's golden ticket
didn't come without a price.</i>

487
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:22,436
It just kind of hit me

488
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:23,437
That I'm gonna be away

489
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:24,805
from my daughter
for the first time

490
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,305
For multiple days

491
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:30,406
You're gonna be good
for mom, okay?

492
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,973
In one breath, it's hopeful that

493
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,474
I get to stay in Hollywood for

494
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:36,810
As long as possible, but there's

495
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:37,677
This little part of me that's

496
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:40,813
Gonna miss her every minute
that I'm gone.

497
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:44,883
Can he rise above the emotions
for today's performance?

498
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:48,819
I am singing my song...
I guess the catalyst was because

499
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:51,221
Jennifer asked me to sing this
song at the auditions.

500
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,689
-I did?
-You did.

501
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:53,390
Good.

502
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,124
So here's "Walking in Memphis".

503
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:56,726
Come on.

504
00:23:56,794 --> 00:24:01,263
<i>There'll be catfish
on the table</i>

505
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:05,866
<i>and gospel music in the air</i>

506
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:14,206
<i>And reverend Green
will be glad to see you</i>

507
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,645
<i>if you haven't
got a prayer</i>

508
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:23,981
<i>You've got a prayer

509
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:28,452
-Beautiful, baby.
-Thank you.

510
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:30,020
-Nice.
-Thank you.

511
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:34,056
<i>Next up is Jane Carrey,</i>

512
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,524
<i>who first met the judges</i>

513
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:38,093
<i> on the U.S.S. Midway
in san diego.</i>

514
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:39,361
Does father know
you're here?

515
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:40,695
Father does know
I'm here.

516
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:43,765
-Who's father?
-My dad is Jim Carrey.

517
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,534
Everyone growing up has kind
of their issue with identity

518
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:47,768
and trying
to find themselves.

519
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:50,103
It is difficult, kind of,
Growing up in the shadow

520
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,237
of something
and trying to find

521
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:54,707
Your place in the world
underneath this huge shadow.

522
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:56,582
And after making it
to Hollywood,

523
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,377
Jane Settled in
for a long stay.

524
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:03,080
Well, my expectations of this
week are that I'm going to stay

525
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:04,214
Here.

526
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,384
I will be here
the entire week.

527
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:09,719
So get used to me.

528
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:11,720

-Hi.
-Hi.

537
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:45,713
Now for the hard part,
as the jues make some crucial cuts.

538
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:47,415
I had a yes.

539
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:48,616
I had a no.

540
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:49,517
I had a no.

541
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,118
No.

542
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:51,952
It's too bad, too.

543
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,688
-Yes.
-Yes?

544
00:25:55,757 --> 00:26:01,059
Let me have, let me have
Joe step forward.

545
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:02,894
Let me have jane step forward.

546
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:17,405
Back row,
see you tomorrow.

547
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:18,206
You're on to the next round.

548
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:19,974
Front row, it's the end
of the line.

549
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:20,908
Thank you.

550
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:26,713
<i>So adam is in, but we say
good-bye to Jane Carrey.</i>

551
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:31,582
I freaked out when I was
There and so I was really,

552
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:35,352
Really shaky, and I know I can
Do way better than that,

553
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,721
and so I'm really disappointed
with myself.

554
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,112
<i>With the disappointment
hanging heavily,</i>

555
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:42,758
<i>Jane reaches out to
the one person who knows</i>

556
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:44,760
<i>Exactly what she's going
through.</i>

557
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:46,761
I talked to my dad,
and he was kind of comforting.

558
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,864
He said, "look, you know,
I've been said no to bunch

559
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:55,101
of times," and it worked
out well for him in the end,

560
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,569
so hopefully I have a shot.

561
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:01,645
<i>As Jane leaves
the competition,</i>

562
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:04,107

Gonna be coming

We knew it.

567
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:22,387
It's huge and it's cool
to think that one day, Whitney.

568
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,991
Will talk about the things
that I've done.

569
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,328
It's just cool.

570
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:35,945
<i>After this, three
captivating voices</i>

00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,678
<i>And as the competition
intensifies...</i>

573
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,780
None of you should
ever have to beg.

00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:48,614

<i>One simple misstep...</i>

578
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:52,250
Give me one more chance.

579

<i>Will cost someone...</i>

580
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:55,854

<i>Welcome back

<i>where over the past two
elimination days,</i>

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,039

-Whose vote is it?
-There's three votes.

591
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:30,222
I just don't think you

Hello.

-it wasn't as good today.
-I can sing my butt off.

598
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,603
None of you should ever have
to be on that stage and beg.

599
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:47,838
<i>Maybe what our judges can use</i>

600
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:49,921
<i>Is a new group
with a new attitude,</i>

601

<i>like the confidence displayed
by 17-year-old David Leathers.</i>

602

My journey has definitely
been a long one.

603
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,883
And I'm here for one reason.
That's to become american idol.

604
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:05,386
Hollywood,
are you ready for me?

605

<i>But before the night ends,</i>

703
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,367
<i>one of the most
shocking moments</i>

704
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:11,468
<i>in Idol history.</i>

705
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:15,738
She hit her head too.

706
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:29,151
<i>It's 1:00 p.M. in LA

707
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,883
<i>some early standouts
from the Pittsburgh auditions</i>

708
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:37,855
<i>Are stealing the show,
including mobile DJ Erika Van Pelt.</i>

709
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:43,059
It's only half past

710
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,461
<i>the tip of the iceberg</i>

711
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,629

<i>you called me sugar</i>

716
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:08,212
I like that feeling
right there.

717
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:09,947
Good way to start off
the afternoon.

718
00:35:10,015 --> 00:35:11,848
More of that, more of that.

719
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:15,885
And they got more of that
with New York's Creighton Fraker...

<i>Somebody to love</i>

Nice.

00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,373
Come on, give it up for him.

730
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:53,279
As well as music teacher
Aaron marcellus.

731
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:56,016
Ladies, jennifer,
I will be singing for you.

732
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:58,552
I know this is gonna be good.

733
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,088

Thank you.

737
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:17,767
I told you.

738
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:18,835
Thank you.

739
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:21,304
<i>And all three got an easy yes
to the next round.</i>

740
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:22,371
See you tomorrow.

741
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:34,249
<i>And those solid performances
only put more pressure on those</i>

742
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:35,950
<i>About to take the stage.</i>

743
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,084
Take your mark.

744
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:37,952
Good luck.

745
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,420
Here we go.

746
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:44,625
Hi, guys.
I'm Lauren Mink.

747
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:47,927
<i>Lauren shared her story back
in savannah.</i>

748
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:48,995
What do you do?

749
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:51,264
I'm the director
for a program for adults

750
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,132
with disabilities.

751
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,100
That's cool.

752
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,134
All the people
in our program,

753
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:57,302
they're really proud of me,
no matter what.

754
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:58,904
Obviously I would be missed,

755
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:00,139
you know,
if things were to go

756
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,874
really well today
and I was here

757
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:03,309
For a little bit longer,

758
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:04,643
but they're just excited

759
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:06,512
that I'm doing
what I love to do

760
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,546
and trying to make
my dream come true.

761
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:12,250
I'm going to sing
"Alone" by Heart.

762
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:17,087
<i>the night goes by
so very slow</i>

763
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,755

764
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:21,558
<i>that it won't end, though</i>

765
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:24,827
<i>Alone</i>

<i>until I met you</i>

770

772
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:45,378
Okay.

773
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,547
<i>Also making it to hollywood

00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:54,217
How are you guys
doing tonight?

776
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:55,018
What's up?

777
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,654
You are breathtaking.
My goodness.

778
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:58,121
-Thanks, man.
-You made my day.

779
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,789
Thank you.

780
00:37:58,857 --> 00:38:00,590
-Thanks, dude.
-Randy, be quiet.

781
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,327
My name is jeremy rosado,
Aka Dirty, as I was nicknamed

782
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:05,662
by my dog here,
Mr. Randy jackson.

783
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,762
Doity, doity.

784
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:11,233
<i>A unique profession helped
Jeremy earn his dirty nickname</i>

785
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:12,767
<i>When he first met the judges.</i>

786
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:14,468
What do you do?

787
00:38:14,537 --> 00:38:17,236
<i>I am actually a front desk Clerk

<i>Doctor's office.</i>

789
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,007
But I'm a complete
germaphobe.

790
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:22,741
So do you wash your hands
all day long?

791
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:25,776
And I sanitize, you Know,
the chair, the computer, the phone.

792
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:27,777
Dude, you are a sicko.

793
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,547
I came to hollywood all
germed up and ready to go.

794
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,049
I'm excited about tonight.

795

From my heart.

798
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm gonna be singing
Luther Vandross, "Superstar".

799

My favorite.

800
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:45,291

811
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,588
My name
is Symone Zaire Black.

812
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:21,589
I'm 16 years old.

813
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:22,956
I'm from Rancho Cucamonga,
California,

814
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,759
and I auditioned in San diego.

815
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:27,627
That girl right
there has got it.

816
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:29,030
That girl right there.

817
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:30,464
I could have listened
to the whole song.

818
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:33,795
My dad is with me
during Hollywood week,

819
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:37,471
and he is my mentor,
he's a critic,

820
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,272
he brings out
the best in me.

821
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,940
He tells me
what I need to work on.

822
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:40,607
Go ahead.

823
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,509
You don't have to sing
this loud, but just go.

824
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:45,162
My dad is definitely
a stage dad,

825
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:46,612
and he's so supportive.

826
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:47,981
I love him so much.

827
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:49,582
I want
to show the judges

828
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:50,650
that I have
a lot of confidence

829
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,485
and I'm not afraid
to be out there

830
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:53,952

So why'd you choose
that song?

847
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:35,869
I wanted to reach
out to a older crowd,

848
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,170
an older audience.

849
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,741
Are you saying
that we're older?

850
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:42,201
No. No.

-My god.
-She hit her head.
