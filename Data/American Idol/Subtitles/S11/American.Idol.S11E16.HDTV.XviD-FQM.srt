1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,372
-You're in the top 24.
-You made it.

2
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:07,276
-I'm in the Top 24.
-It was unanimous.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:08,462
You're going through!

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,354
-I say yes.
-I say yes.

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:14,831
Never stop
Believing in yourself.

6
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,500
Hold on.
It's going to be quite a ride.

7
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:23,028
I'm on American Idol right now.
Can you even believe it?

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,882
I'm just so grateful
for all of this.

9
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:30,448
I really want this.

10
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:33,817
This is actually my dream
coming true.

11
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:38,064
It's so crazy.

12
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:43,762
I'm just, like,
so overwhelmed,

13
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:46,036
by everything that's
happening.

14
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:51,152
How did I get here?

15
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,607
I don't even know.

16
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:03,097
Go from being a waitress
to a face everyone knows.

17
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,038
I want to be here for a long
Time.

18
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:11,763
I don't know what's gonna happen
From here.

19
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,479
There's a lot riding on it.

20
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:14,863
I'm not gonna stop now.

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,520
I'm about to go see the stage.

22
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:18,180
-Oh my God.
-For the first time.

23
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,508
Oh my gosh,
I'm really excited.

24
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:23,444
It's a competition,

25
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,121
And somebody's
got to go home.

26
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,787
We've got some amazing
Singers here.

27
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:29,215
Some of the best in the world.

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,482
That's what I was
Waiting for.

29
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,099
That girl can really
Sing.

30
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,757
Your voice is
Perfect, pitch is perfect.

31
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:37,596
Crazy, crazy.

32
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:39,341
America's got their work
cut out for them.

33
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:41,386
It was a bit of a nightmare
instead of a dream.

34
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:43,329
You have the voice
the world's been waiting to hear.

35
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,589
This is what singing
Is about.

36
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:51,467
-Can I get an amen up in here?
-Amen!

37
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:21,479
Ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,057
please welcome your judges,

39
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,333

and welcome to the
First results show of the Season.

45
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:25,701
It is a pivotal night in the
Competition

46
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,060
as we officially
Find out

47
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:29,561
who has made the top
13.

48
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:33,430
But getting to that point will
Involve a massive cut.

49
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:34,929
First, the good news.

50
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:38,249
Over 33 million votes came in
Over the last two nights.

51
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,176
Thank you very much for that.

52
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:44,999
It shows how talented this
Season's finalists truly are.

53
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:49,387
Let's say hello to the guys in
The competition.

54
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,656
And keep it going for the
Ladies.

55
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,331
These are your top 25, america,

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,611
But the harsh reality is half of
Those faces

57
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:09,110
will be leaving our Stage
before the end of the Evening.

58
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:11,130
Exactly.

59
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,703
It's not my fault.
It's gonna be dramatic.

60
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,276
Also, a lot of pressure on our
Judges

61
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,708
after we announce who
You've picked as your top ten.

62
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:22,522
The judges will also be selecting
one Contestant each

63
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,431
as wildcard Contenders.

64
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:28,273
These spots will complete the
Top 13 tonight.

65
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:29,845
Now, when we come back,

66
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,495
those Seats will be filled

67
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,067
with the Five most popular girls

68
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,629
and the Five most popular guys.

69
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:39,359
Drama about to go down live on

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,945

are going straight through
To the next round

74
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:00,142
based on over
33 million votes.

75
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,105
Then three remaining spots

76
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:05,093
will Be chosen by our judges as
Wildcards.

77
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:08,635
Let's start by building
America's top ten.

78
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,798
First, we are going to focus on
The guys.

79
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,618
Gentlemen.

80
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,534
Let's get serious now.

81
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:22,253
Can I have chase, phillip, and
Jeremy.

82
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:24,314
Come on down here center stage.

83
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,073
How you doing, gentlemen?

84
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:31,542
How you feeling tonight?
Phillip?

85
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,736
Feeling all right.

86
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:38,558
How nerve-racking is this?

87
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,721
it's just -- I don't know
How to explain it.

88
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:45,284
It's beyond belief how nervous
We all are right now.

89
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,588
You seem pretty calm,
Though.

90
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,996
I am. It's a hard way to keep
Composure

91
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:52,160
and be able to stand
Here at the same time but --

92
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,278
-You're doing a good Job.
-thank you.

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,027
Jeremy, what's going
Through your mind right now?

94
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,155
I'm not gonna lie.

95
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:03,535
My heart is beating outside of
My chest.

96
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,252
I'm excited.
I love you guys.

97
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,865
Thank you so much.

98
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,076
let's take a look at how
They did Tuesday night,

99
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,509
plus What our music mentor,

100
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,706
interscope chairman jimmy Ivene thought.

101
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,062
Take a look at this.
Here we go.

102
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:27,927
Some people are
Just blessed from god

103
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,315
with a Voice that when they open their
Mouth, they affect people.

104
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,077
That's you.

105
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,583
You're one of those people.

106
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:42,897
That was beautiful.

107
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,901
You couldn't have picked a
Better song.

108
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:50,405
America saw two faces melting

109
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,964
during that performance.

110
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,638
Those two.
Look at that.

111
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:56,003
I am not ashamed.
I am not ashamed.

112
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:58,026
jeremy has got a great voice

113
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,159
And gets the award
for the nightest person probably

114
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:01,723
I've Seen in a long time.

115
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:03,591
But that isn't going to cut it
On this show.

116
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:06,027
You have to have much more than
That these days to win this thing.

117
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:17,709
Well, well, well,

118
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:20,019
Welcome to "american idol,"
Cowboy.

119
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:24,446
You got a kind of brendan Fraser, "the mummy"
kind of look About you, man.

120
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:27,603
You're going to set
America's hearts on fire,

121
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,253
lot of mummies
At home.

122
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,080
You sounded great tonight
As well.

123
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,923
And you've grown so much through
The competition

124
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,647
and I look
Forward to seeing where you go.

125
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:43,278
I want this so bad.

126
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,098
I hope I've got what it takes.

127
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,651
chase is a good-looking guy

128
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,921
But there are plenty of those on
Tv right now.

129
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,650
To win this show you've got to
Bring something

130
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,094
fresh, original
And exciting.

131
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,636
And I saw none of that.

132
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:02,234
You hit your stride
With that, man.

133
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,256
You maude it beautiful.

134
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,823
There so no doubt
You are one of the most special Talents

135
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,179
we found this year on
The road.

136
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,159
I'm not sure I was
Jumping up and down

137
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,734
about the Reharm of the melody.

138
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,564
Stick with the Melody
I think is what he's Saying.

139
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,377
Some people may like it
and some people don't,

140
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:25,631
it's america's turn to vote

141
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:26,879
and not the judges to choose

142
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,374
so it's gonna be very intense.

143
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,549
we desperately need
Originality on this show.

144
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,093
Phil phillips has that.

145
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,899
A lot of people try to sing like him

146
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,597
but come off really
Affected.

147
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,901
I believed every word he sang.

148
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,287
I'd sign this guy on the spot.

149
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:49,828
So that's how it went
Down on stage.

150
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,512
Now we find out what america
Thought.

151
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:56,836
Dim the lights.
Here we go.

152
00:08:57,964 --> 00:08:59,419
First, randy.

153
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,429
Do you agree with jimmy about
Jeremy

154
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:03,678
and what he had to say
about him

155
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,271
not making the cut in
This competition?

156
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:09,573
I agree that it's Gonna take more
than just having Good looks.

157
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,146
But I think he's got a good
Voice as well

158
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,847
so half and half With jimmy.

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,693
What do you think,
Jennifer?

160
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:19,637
I think voices
Supersedes some things.

161
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:22,127
It's true we're looking for the
Full package,

162
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,533
but at the end of The day,

163
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,380
I believe jeremy has
That.

164
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:31,326
Phillip, what went
Through your mind

165
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,846
when you Watched jimmy
say that seconds Ago?

166
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,670
I don't know, I have a little...

167
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,229
I don't know.

168
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:40,701
It's crazy just to hear that
Kind of stuff. I don't know.

169
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,586
You're not humble
Enough.

170
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:48,842
Steven, what do you make of
Chase standing on this stage?

171
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,562
Do you think he has what it
Takes?

172
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:53,003
You know, I
Understand what jimmy's talking about

173
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,689
about the commercial side
Of it.

174
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:59,316
Sometimes a voice can come
Through like yours.

175
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,642
Climbing out from the inside.

176
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:04,988
Here we go.

177
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,635
After the nationwide vote,

178
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:11,883
Jeremy...

179
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,236
you have not made the
Top ten, my friend.

180
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:18,366
But take a seat.
Hang tight.

181
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,136
Still have a shot at the wildcard.

182
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,181
We're left with phillip and
Chase.

183
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:30,290
I can tell you one of you has
Made it into america's top ten.

184
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,859
After the nationwide vote,

185
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,099
Chase, you are not in the top
Ten.

186
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,343
Phillip, you're in the top ten.
Congratulations.

187
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,125
He's in the top ten, america!

188
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:10,711
You're going to be lonely for
Just a second.

189
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,148
I'll bring some other people
Over in a second.

190
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,514
Can I get you anything?

191
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:16,431
-you look like you need something.
-just keep going.

192
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:18,790
you got it.

193
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,996
Let's turn now to our ladies.

194
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,485
Can I have jessica, hollie,

195
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:32,289
Brielle, and haley center stage.

196
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,531
Making the slow crawl to the
center of the Stage.

197
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,395
How you doing, ladies?

198
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,440
You okay?

199
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:47,362
Come on in tight.

200
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,240
Let's take a look at last night

201
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:52,413
And what jimmy had to say about
The girls, watch this.

202
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:01,614
you hit the notes
so perfectly,

203
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,103
There was nothing left to that song
except Passion.

204
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,530
My hope is you'll let your hair
Down next time.

205
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,720
>> okay.

206
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,216
I told you last year
that I thought that you can win this

207
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:18,507
and I Still think that.

208
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:19,921
I look forward to america seeing

209
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,381
What you really do do when you
Do let your hair down.

210
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:25,472
Do do, that do do Thing.
I was like --

211
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,606
Wait a minute.
Ma kind of show is this, man?

212
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:30,562
Steven, did you Literally mean
let her hair Down?

213
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:31,913
-Yes.
-ok.

214
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,307
steven tyler told me to let my hair down

215
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,430
and I can do that.

216
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,663
there it goes.
please vote!

217
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,029
hollie, little girl, big
Voice.

218
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:41,160
Could have been a little more
Believable

219
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,272
given the right
Material.

220
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,563
She can do some real damage in
This game.

221
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,383
You got a great sent
Of blues.

222
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,776
Georgia!

223
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,497
It was beautiful.

224
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:10,230
You are a true
Performer.

225
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,866
You come out there and you eat
It up.

226
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,937
You understand what it is to
Entertain.

227
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:17,026
Brielle von hugel.

228
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,339
that's not a very
Staten island name, is it?

229
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,167
My nephew went to school there.

230
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,690
My sister lives there.

231
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,504
I spent many a thanksgiving
There.

232
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,967
Lot of chrisma in this girl.

233
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,912
I agree with jennifer, real
Entertainer.

234
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:31,032
But she got to pick her own song
This week.

235
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,617
Why pick "on the dock of the
Bay" by otis redding?

236
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,811
Why not pick something young and
Contemporary and hit it?

237
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,437
I think it's gonna hurt her.

238
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,168
you look like a star.

239
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:51,059
-a star!
-yes you do

240
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,619
You look beautiful.
You sounded beautiful.

241
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,645
Your voice is tiny
And old-fashioned.

242
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:03,703
I hope it's coming back
and Adele proved it will

243
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,375
and I think
You're going to be part of it.

244
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,114
-thank you.
-Nice going.

245
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:09,252
just a few weeks ago,

246
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:11,580
I was Waiting tables in baltimore,

247
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,529
and Now I'm on a stage in front of
All these people.

248
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:14,859
so I'm having a blast.

249
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:16,767
this is hollie's best show so
Far.

250
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,239
Really poised, restrained great
Tone in her voice.

251
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,540
Lot of blondes on this show.
Wow.

252
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,892
I'm not sure who the audience is
Going to vote for, though.

253
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,317
May not be her.

254
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,109
The whole thing is Just really,
really so beyond Your years.

255
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,750
-It's crazy.
-The growl.

256
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:44,036
The growl, the soft
Spots, the yelling, the all of It.

257
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:55,065
Let me just say this,
That girl can really sing.

258
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:03,267
I would say one of the best of
The last two nights right there,

259
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,282
Jessica sanchez.

260
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:09,966
jessica, she has talent from
A to z.

261
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,374
I'd sign her on the spot tonight.

262
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,329
If anybody has a pole position
In this race, it's jessica.

263
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,085
She's the one to beat.

264
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,787
All right.
Let's see what the nation Thought.

265
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,778
Dim the lights.
Here we go, the tough part.

266
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:38,506
Brielle, let me ask you, jimmy
Wasn't a fan of your song Choice.

267
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:40,455
You still stand by it?

268
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,693
yeah, I definitely stand by
My song choice.

269
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:45,348
I love putting a twist on old
Classics.

270
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,582
That's jusr Brielle
and that's what I love do.

271
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:49,661
So if jimmy were
Watching right now

272
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:50,960
and I have to
Guess he is,

273
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,776
what would you say
To him?

274
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,739
-what would I say to him?
-To jimmy.

275
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,985
I am so respectful of jimmy.

276
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,152
He's the best in this business,

277
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:00,806
And I love him.

278
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,963
Now, jennifer, you
Loved hallie when we met her.

279
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:07,388
Do you think she was a standout
This week?

280
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,387
You know, it's hard
To say.

281
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:10,449
There was so many

282
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,099
you could Really tell
who the standouts Were.

283
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,689
She had a good performance.
You sounded good.

284
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,674
I don't know.
I don't know if it was a standout

285
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,318
to the point that she's
In the top five girls.

286
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,801
I'm not sure.

287
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:22,761
Here we go.
Good luck, ladies.

288
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:25,625
After the nationwide vote,

289
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:29,254
Brielle, I'm sorry,

290
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,139
you're not
In the top ten, so hang tight.

291
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:34,336
You may get a wildcard shot,
Okay?

292
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:35,973
Head to the couches.

293
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,469
Girls, come on together.

00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:44,730

After the nationwide vote,

What's going on at the table
Here?

312
00:17:58,308 --> 00:17:59,940
During the break, you guys are
Bickering, arguing,

313
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:01,539
chatting
Back and forth.

314
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,945
We're just discussing
Life, ryan.

315
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,416
Sometimes life's little issues,
You know.

316
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06,968
Are you still debating
About the wildcards?

317
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:09,011
We started a bit of that.

318
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,061
Now that we're
Seeing how it pans out,

319
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:13,163
we're Like, uh-oh,
what are we doing?

320
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,580
I can hear them arguing
Up to the last second

321
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,117
and then
It's like, okay, we're back.

322
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:18,946
Let's get to more results.

323
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:23,782
Gentlemen, joshua, heejun and Adam.

324
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:25,557
Center stage, here we go.

325
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,129
What's up, man?

326
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,072
I brought my tissues.
Both pockets.

327
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:47,831
Adam, let me ask you,

328
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,410
just take
Us behind the scenes.

329
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,053
What's it like before a night
Like tonight

330
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,236
and these results
And the intensity of all of it?

331
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,546
it -- it -- it'sverything.
We're backstage.

332
00:18:57,641 --> 00:19:00,233
You're excited and you think,

333
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,061
Oh, I hope I did a good enough
Job.

334
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,687
And then you're thinking,

335
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,609
Everybody did a good job, and
You're back there

336
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:07,814
and now you're
Nervous and your feelings,

337
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:09,855
they keep
Neutralizing each other.

338
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,698
It's nerves.
It's excitement.

339
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:15,398
We all love each other so much.

340
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,207
It's so cheesy and corny to say,

341
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,468
But I mean, it's just -- it's a
Blast.

342
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,474
Whatever happens, it's a blast
So --

343
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:25,633
Let's take a look back
At how they did on Tuesday night

344
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:27,807
And what jimmy's thoughts were.
Here we go.

345
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,499
-Can I get an amen up In here?
-Amen!

346
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,990
You are the voice the
World's been waiting to hear.

347
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:53,050
I just don't even
Know what to say to you!

348
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,724
I just want to punch you.

349
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,291
I don't know what I want to do
To you.

350
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,184
Why you want to punch
Him?

351
00:19:58,562 --> 00:19:59,316
why punch him?

352
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:01,061
why you wanna punch, they guy's
working and you wanna hit him.

353
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:02,465
Because I love it.

354
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,100
Punches for jennifer,
Man.

355
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,841
this joshua is the real deal.

356
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:09,431
He sang great on the show.

357
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,124
And there's no question in my
Mind he's gonna get through.

358
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,807
And I'm looking forward to work
With him.

359
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,176
But if he does get through,

360
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:17,475
it's My job to make sure that we
Don't turn this

361
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,058
into sister act 3.

362
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,629
I love the throwback
Vibe you got going on.

363
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:34,268
You definitely
Delivered.

364
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,912
That's what I was waiting for.

365
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,758
I love that you got
Your own name,

366
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,696
white chocolate.
we love that.

367
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:45,186
Steven what kind of
Chocolate do you prefer?

368
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,906
I prefer dark Chocolate,
to be honest with You.

369
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:55,042
steven loves that I'm white
Chocolate.

370
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,978
Randy loves the throwback.
They get me.

371
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,645
They get me as an artist,

372
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:00,596
and I Hope that's what america wants
Right now.

373
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:02,905
supposedly adam has a large
Black woman

374
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:04,770
trapped in a white
Body.

375
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:06,383
So as of right now,

376
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,856
he's not Pulling them both off at the
Same time.

377
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,905
If america's not gonna be
Confused about him,

378
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:13,704
he's got to Merge them and come as one
Person.

379
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,584
You have a voice
That's smooth as silk.

380
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:29,340
Really. I'm not sure
that that song Showed off

381
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:32,691
all of how beautiful
Your voice is.

382
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,084
I don't think it was
The right song,

383
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:35,332
but I still love
Your voice, man.

384
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,040
-thank you.
-you're welcome.

385
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,035
<i>Heejun, you sure can sing</i>

386
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,497
the judges didn't like the
song choice, of course,

387
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,312
but I knew this was
gonna happen.

388
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,290
my dad's my only hope for this point,

389
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,877
cause he has 20 cell phones
and he knows how to dial.

390
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,261
hopefully.

391
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:53,650
let me tell you about heejun.

392
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,049
This guy completely confuses me.

393
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:59,033
I get the personality.
I get the -- schtick.

394
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:01,060
I get the whole thing.
sort of a good voice.

395
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,143
This isn't american comedian.

396
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:04,470
This is "american idol."

397
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:09,076
Back now live.

398
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:11,322
Let's get to the results.

399
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,141
Dim the lights.
here we go.

400
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,876
Booing?
Is there some booing?

401
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,632
Boo, jimmy.

402
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:17,810
Heejun, what do you think about

403
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,419
what jimmy had to say about
America's comedian?

404
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:21,744
who's that?

405
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:25,624
Touche.

406
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:30,405
But to pick up on his point,

407
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,324
are You taking it seriously,
this competition?

408
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:34,705
of course, I do know
it's a singing competition.

409
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:39,304
I have a lot to work with
Alongside with comedy.

410
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:41,540
I definately do.
Whatever.

411
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,929
You're the total
Package.

412
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,927
Joshua you grew up singing in
The church.

413
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:50,955
How has that platform helped you
For this one?

414
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:55,608
it just Taught me to sing from my soul
And from my heart.

415
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:58,154
I mean, whatever I've been
Through in life,

416
00:22:58,238 --> 00:23:00,341
I learned that
I could help through my music.

417
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,315
And you tap into that
When you're on the stage.

418
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:04,524
most definitely.

419
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,012
Now, adam, you were
clapping a little bit

420
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,024
when jimmy
Was giving you some feedback.

421
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,443
What was that about?

422
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:12,749
that was one of those
Things that as it came out,

423
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:15,003
Those sentences you just want to
Pull back.

424
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,205
But I understand what he's
Saying.

425
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:21,487
I mean, I do -- I hope that
America gets me as a person.

426
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,460
Here we go, guys.

427
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,376
After the nationwide vote,

428
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:30,688
Joshua...

429
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,160
top ten.

430
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,510

431
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:44,046

Heejun and adam, one of you is
Also in america's top ten.

433
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:17,695
After the nationwide vote,
Heejun...

00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,153

Congratulations.

435
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,863
Adam takes a seat.
waits for a spot, hopefully.

436
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,760
Now back to the ladies.

437
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:50,172
Baylie, chelsea, skylar

438
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,586
and Shannon, come on down here.

439
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:54,785
Let's hear it for them.

440
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:02,084
come on down here girls

441
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,656

There you go. Perfect.

442
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:07,434
How we doing, ladies?

443
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,967
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

444
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:14,021
Let's see how it all
Played out last night. Take a look at this.

445
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:26,624
I don't think we've Ever had
somebody with your Voice

446
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:29,011
that performs like this.
Dude, you were rockin' out.

447
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,897
You're like the rockin' country
Girl.

448
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:36,140
She's like reba mixed
With kelly clarkson

449
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:37,552
or something crazy Wild.

450
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:39,643
-Or tina.
-altogether.

451
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,258
-It's wild.
-I love your energy.

452
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:43,820
The audience brought that out of
You. I love that.

453
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:45,698
That means you're a natural-born
Performer.

454
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,755
this dress is really tight,
I can't even talk.

455
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,759
How did you have breath control

456
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:52,662
running around on stage in that dress
And jumping up and down

457
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,019
and doing Your tina turner thing?

458
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:55,169
thank you, lord.

459
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:59,144
skylar laine did herself a
Great turn this week

460
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:01,848
picking That great Faces song

461
00:26:01,956 --> 00:26:04,022
written by rod Stewart and ronny wood.

462
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:06,461
She blended soul with country

463
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:08,625
Which is a great formula for
Rock 'n' roll.

464
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:09,785
The judges loved her.

465
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,497
I think she brought a lot of
Charisma.

466
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:13,805
I agree with them.
A lot of stage presence.

467
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,148
I would have voted for her.

468
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,403
I think at lot of country is
Going to vote for her too.

469
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:29,807
It started off a
Little shaky for you,

470
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:31,248
a little Pitchy in spots.

471
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:34,947
I think you just never seized
Control of the song.

472
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,999
I'm not sure if it's
The best song you could have Picked.

473
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,876
But I enjoyed.
And you're very pretty.

474
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,185
>> thank you.

475
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:46,716
You're not pretty.
You're beautiful.

476
00:26:46,793 --> 00:26:47,807
But when come out here

477
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,674
and You're competing against the
Likes of what you're competing against

478
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:52,667
it's got to be solid.

479
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,258
I know what they're talking
About.

480
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,399
I can hear myself sing.

481
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,249
And I could just tell that it
Wasn't perfect.

482
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:01,418
But I'm singing live for the
First time on television.

483
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:03,427
So it's gonna be a little shaky.

484
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:05,959
baylie brown seem seams to
Have all the pieces

485
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,168
but they
Didn't come together tonight.

486
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,985
Beautiful girl, nice tone, but
She lost the plot.

487
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,117
Out of tune, I believe outta
Here.

488
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:24,217
You definitely can
Sing.

489
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:25,482
Gut huge big voice.

490
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:29,722
I just I was wondering if that
Was the best choice.

491
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:37,469
I feel like Everybody really got to hear the
Best part of you.

492
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,545
I can feel your heart
Pounding from here.

493
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,915
I thought you sound good
Tonight.

494
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,949
Watch your phrasing.
Watch your timing.

495
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,342
And when it's time to belt it
Out, belt it out good.

496
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:49,567
Because you're
Great singer.

497
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:53,320
chelsea's got a really nice
Voice.

498
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,625
But what I saw on the show just
Wasn't original enough.

499
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:00,588
Carrie underwood karaoke, it's
Just not gonna fly.

500
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:03,335
I think we need more from her.

501
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,150
I think she's gonna be in
Trouble this week.

502
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,651
What a way to come out
Swinging.

503
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:19,646
Now, that's what it's all about.

504
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:23,421
You sing with such
Passion for a 16-year-old.

505
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,148
Really, it's not something that
You see every day.

506
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,697
You gave me gooseys, my first
Gooseys.

507
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:32,992
You took it upstairs
And it went beautiful. It was just gorgeous.

508
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,046
That's taking it up a notch for Me.
Thank you so much.

509
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,582
So this is the first time
you've been in the same room

510
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:40,361
with steven tyler since the
Auditions.

511
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,536
yeah.
Do we have a wrestling mat here?

512
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:44,428
Stevie, do you remember
Him?

513
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:45,659
I didn't mean it!

514
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:49,294
shannon, I really like her.

515
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:52,170
Really good voice, great poise,

516
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:53,847
Sang beautifully.

517
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,882
Tonight she was dressed more for
the prom

518
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,734
than for a live
Performance.

519
00:28:57,856 --> 00:28:59,357
Can use some help in the styling
Area.

520
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:01,005
I say she does well tonight.

521
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,807
Back now live.

522
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:16,493
Shannon, what's behind those
Tears here?

523
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:20,236
right now I'm just so happy
And so excited to be here right now

524
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:23,457
and I can't help myself but cry

525
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,186
because I've gone through so much

526
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,970
and this has just been
Such amazing opportunity for me.

527
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,827
And I love to do this and I
Don't want to quit now.

528
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,691
I don't want to stop now.
I don't want it to end.

529
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,173
you're gonna feel really good
if it all works out.

530
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:41,759
Now, baylie, after
Seeing that

531
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,915
and thinking about
Your performance,

532
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:46,195
what would you
Have done differently in Hindsight?

533
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:50,104
sing on key, I guess.

534
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:54,233
Try not to be so shaky, but I
Don't know.

535
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:55,333
That's crazy.

536
00:29:57,073 --> 00:29:58,664
How's the heart now?

537
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,022
uh, good.

538
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:03,686
it's more the knees.
My whole body's shaking now.

539
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:05,353
All right.
Stand for a second.

540
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:07,960
Skylar, where does the
Confidence come from?

541
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,853
well, I think it comes from
Me just lovin'

542
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,116
well, I love That song
so that's where that Came from.

543
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,718
And I got to rock out on stage

544
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:18,541
And all the people here were
Getting into it with me,

545
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,154
and That was just amazing.

546
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,334
And I just am confident because

547
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:23,865
I know what kind of artist I
Want to be,

548
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:27,087
and I just -- that's
What I showed,

549
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,737
and that's what I
Always want to show in Everything that I do.

550
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:36,432
Ladies, good luck.
Here we go.

551
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:40,303
After the nationwide vote...

552
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:45,421
Let's start with you, shannon.

553
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,090
Congratulations.
You've made it to the top ten.

554
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,533
Come on over here.

555
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460

Competition

557
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,238
for more than one
Country girl?

558
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,860
There's definitely
Room for more than one.

559
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:32,105
One of these?

560
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,541
Definitely room for
Probably more than one of these,

561
00:31:34,604 --> 00:31:37,846
But one of these up there, ryan,
Really stood out last night.

Okay, girls.

Take a seat.

To the couches and hang out.

569
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,886

Plus find out who will sing for
A wildcard spot.

573

Anything can happen.

574
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:24,780
More "idol" live after the
Break.

575
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:34,574
Welcome back to "idol."

576
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,466
Over the past two nights, you've
Weighed in

577
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:39,888

You how the vote has panned out.

Plus, three wildcard picks.

580
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:51,539
Now let's get back to your
Results.

581
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:54,388
Gentlemen, we turn to you.

582
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,267
Can I have aaron, come on down,
Aaron.

583
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,782
Let's hear it for aaron.

584
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,244
Creighton.

585
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:13,063
And reed.

586
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:21,857
What's happening?
how are you doing?

587
00:33:22,778 --> 00:33:24,345
gentlemen, how are you feeling?

588
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:28,245
Is that confidence?

589
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,922
It may be confidence from you.
I don't know.

590
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,557
Let's take a look back at
Tuesday night's show

591
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:36,288
and also
What jimmy iovine had to say.

592
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,416
Watch this.

593
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:49,276
You're definitely a
Very musical guy.

594
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:51,378
this was kinda wild,
You were scatting.

595
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:54,105
You were like sheila e on the
Timbali.

596
00:33:56,687 --> 00:33:58,279
Everybody knows
That song so well.

597
00:33:58,425 --> 00:34:01,124
But this was great way to show
America

598
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:04,147
who they are dealing with
with reed grimm.

599
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,615
I hope I did enough to get
America's votes.

600
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,936
at this point it's up to them.

601
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,563
thanks a lot America, vote for me!

602
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,446
I watch reed.
Real talented.

603
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,365
Playing the drums, moving
Around.

604
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,399
All the such judges seemed to
Like him.

605
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,009
maybe he thought he was in a nightclub

606
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:21,403
Way too kitschy for me, way too
Cabaret.

607
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:23,351
Not gonna make it on the show
Like that.

608
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:33,400
I always believed
In you.

609
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,504
I don't know what it is about you.
Your voice just takes me there.

610
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,035
And you can sing anything.

611
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:41,608
That's how you sing
Some vocals, man.

612
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,361
that run that You did at the end was
Crazy.

613
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,776
You raised the bar for
Yourself.

614
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,387
You got to beat this next time.
Okay, man.

615
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:50,907
oh, man.

616
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:52,992
I feel amazing.

617
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,002
I feel absolutely amazing.

618
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:56,870
Aaron, now, this
Confused me,

619
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:58,470
because the judges
And the audience

620
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,665
gave him a standing ovation

621
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:01,988
and I'm
Watching it saying, this is Cheesy.

622
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,763
It's a bit don cheadle.

623
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:06,679
but everybody seemed to like it.
It did not work for me.

624
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,018
Dude, you can
Definitely sing.

625
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,274
You know, cyndi Lauper did a beautiful,
Beautiful job of that.

626
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:22,055
I know she's home crying along
With j.Lo.

627
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,864
That was stupendous.

628
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:31,082
It was a perfect
Song for you.

629
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,924
You are so individual.

630
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,438
That's what the song says.

631
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:36,859
You sang it from your heart.
That was so beautiful.

632
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:39,479
I mean, to think that half of
These guys are going home.

633
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,853
America's got their work cut out
For them.

634
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:43,748
I don't want to go home.
I have a lot more to do.

635
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,904
I have a lot more to say.
I have a lot more to sing.

636
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:47,171
I wanna stay.

637
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,621
Vote for me.

638
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,661
Creighton has an
Interesting voice.

639
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,315
top end It's screechy and annoys me.

640
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,956
Judges loved him.
I didn't.

641
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,399
All right, all right.

642
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,390
Let's hold for oo for a second.

643
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:04,552
I want to go to the judges and
Get their reaction

644
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:05,779
to some of
The things jimmy is saying.

645
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,287
Jennifer?

646
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,047
Maybe jimmy should
Come to the show.

647
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,746
maybe he should come here.

648
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,877
I respect jimmy and I respect
What he says,

649
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:16,790
and I see a last
Things that he's saying.

650
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,515
But I think what wee hear in
Here sometimes

651
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:19,588
could be a little Different

652
00:36:19,697 --> 00:36:21,053
than what people hear
At home

653
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,571
or even what he's
Hearing on a monitor

654
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,915
in that Little room that he's in.

655
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,259
But...

656
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:27,521
-Little, small room.

657
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:30,222
4 x 4.

658
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,928
No, no.
But, you know, I don't know.

659
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:35,378
There's some things I just want
To punch him,

660
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,278
but other things I
Agree with.

661
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:38,614
Here's the other
Thing.

662
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:40,899
I said Monday night it was our
First live show.

663
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,743
I came back Tuesday night and I
Looked at the boys and I said,

664
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,976
We were a little bit too lenient
On a lot of you tonight.

665
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:48,874
And jimmy's got some points.

666
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:51,434
It wasn't as good when I watched
It home as it was in the room.

667
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:54,102
So, jimmy, we give you a pass on
That one.

668
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,785
Jimmy iovine,
&#*$(%

669
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,019
Unfortunately he's been right on
With a lot of it.

670
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:06,973
I wasw gonna ask, He is being too
Critical, too tough, jennifer?

671
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,711
No, I don't think
He's being too critical,

672
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,958
but
Some of the ways he says things,

673
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,510
I wouldn't choose to say them
That way.

674
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:15,679
So, randy, aaron got a
Standing ovation

675
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,202
for his Performance.

676
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:18,773
Do you still stand by that?

677
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,508
Aaron had a very good
Performance.

678
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,459
After the girls, like, did their thing

679
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,846
and the guys did the rest
Of their thing,

680
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:27,166
I don't know if It was good enough
to be in that Top ten.

681
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,406
I'm not really sure.

682
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:31,151
But by the way, aaron, I love
Don cheadle. Dude, he's dope.

683
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:34,131
Let's talk about reed
For a second.

684
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:37,469
Why is reed a relevant artist
Today?

685
00:37:38,317 --> 00:37:39,280
I think reed is good

686
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:41,140
Because he shows off everything
He can do.

687
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:42,559
He can play the drums.
He can sing.

688
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:44,370
He can play the piano.
I think that's good.

689
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:46,203
I don't think that's a bad
Thing.

690
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:48,957
I think there's room
for all different types of artists

691
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:54,138
you know, and that's
Just something that is always going to be

692
00:37:54,169 --> 00:37:55,751
talent is always
Going to be relevant.

693
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:57,144
It's a tough night,
Ryan.

694
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,219
It's a tough night as I look at
Those who made it through.

695
00:37:59,314 --> 00:38:00,728
it's a tough night, It's hard.

696
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,752
let's get to it.
Dim the lights. here we go.

697
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,010
Good luck, gentlemen.

698
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:06,180
After the nationwide vote --

699
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:14,777
Aaron, you have not made the top
Ten.

700
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,427
I'm sorry, my friend.
Hang tight.

701
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:17,891
Maybe a wildcard shot.
Okay?

702
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:19,449
To the couch.

703
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:24,064
oh, boy.

704
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,951
Creighton and reed.

705
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,269
After the nationwide vote --

706
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,477
I can tell you that creighton,

707
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,630
Are you not in the top ten
Either.

708
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:48,172
And reed, unfortunately, neither
Are you, my friend.

709
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:51,381
So hang tight on the couches.
Maybe a wildcard shot.

710
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,336
Let's hear it for them.

711
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,324
Now back to the ladies.

712
00:39:03,392 --> 00:39:07,420
Can I have elise, come on,
Elise.

713
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:12,468
You look pretty.

714
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:13,891
thanks.

715
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,116
Erika.

716
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:16,616
Here's erika.

717
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:21,104
Let's have haley.

718
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,226
And jen.
Come on, jen.

719
00:39:30,363 --> 00:39:33,697
Here's how it went down last Night.
Take a look at this.

720
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:44,317
I thought it was
Beautiful.

721
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,304
I felt the feeling in the song.

722
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,196
I thought did you a really good
Job.

723
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:55,112
I think you're one of
The greatest singers in this Competition,

724
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,524
so good looking
Out.

725
00:39:57,673 --> 00:39:58,759
There's something
About confidence.

726
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:01,954
Makes a voice fly and yours is
Soaring.

727
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,750
You got to what it takes.
You got it.

728
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:07,788
oh, my god, that was amazing.

729
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,671
Jen has a really nice
Voice.

730
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:14,526
But if I were on this show, I'd
Stay miles away from adele.

731
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:17,868
Too many adele wannabes on tv
Right now.

732
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:21,692
Lot of vocal power techniques in
Place of soul.

733
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,088
It's not gonna work on this show

734
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:24,594
and it's not
Gonna get her through.

735
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,795
Be very, very careful in this
Area.

736
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,650
There's something magical

737
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,726
about the confidence you
Have.

738
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:42,245
It just breathes wings into a
Song and you just nailed it.

739
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,140
You are one of our
Power voices.

740
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:51,903
I think you could have gone even
Further knowing you.

741
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:54,653
Come on, erika.

742
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,748
We know you what you can do
Already.

743
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:01,742
I want to put it all out on
That stage.

744
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,595
Of course, I can push a little
More. And I will.

745
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:07,031
I like this girl.
She has music in her blood.

746
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:08,844
It's very, very natural to her.

747
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,710
She has great restraint,

748
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:13,412
Something to show needs more of,
Not less.

749
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:16,069
The judges asked her to push it.
I don't agree.

750
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,929
If she stays where she is, stay in pocket,
she Can go all the way.

751
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,709
Kind of pitchy all
Over the place,

752
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,231
so it kind of Left me like

753
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:34,563
I was like,
Where are we going?

754
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,687
I'm a little dizzy.

755
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:44,934
How do I say this?
I'm a little stuck.

756
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:48,256
It was a bit of a nightmare for
Me instead of a dream.

757
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:50,520
what randy said was kind of
Hurtful

758
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:52,038
because I felt like I
Put myhart and soul into it,

759
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,812
and Randy, I'm definitely going to
Prove you wrong next time

760
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,018
Because I can sing you a sweet dream.

761
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,821
Wow.
She sang out of tune the entire Song.

762
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:02,111
I can get around that,

763
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:05,179
but I Can't get around the robotic
Mimicking.

764
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,876
That's going to kill you with me
Every time.

765
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:10,028
I think that randy was right.

766
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:12,258
Her "sweet dreams" turned into
a nightmare tonight.

767
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:23,349
You blew it out of
The water.

768
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:24,820
That was beautiful.

769
00:42:33,142 --> 00:42:34,602
You're definitely a
Force it be reckoned

770
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:37,247
with inThis competition, boys, girls,
Whatever.

771
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,000
I felt real good about the
Performance.

772
00:42:39,104 --> 00:42:41,014
I felt the energy of the crowd.

773
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,078
It was amazing the judges said I
Was one of their standouts.

774
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:46,643
That makes me feel like they
Appreciate me.

775
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:49,833
The judges like her.
I agree with them on this one.

776
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:51,726
She has a lot of character.

777
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,326
I'd like to hear her sing some
Of her own material

778
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,151
or material Crafted just for her.

779
00:42:56,215 --> 00:43:00,708
Usually afraid of adele songs
But she brought something to it.

780
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:02,128
She sings a little high.

781
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,731
She's pushing a little much.
She has to be careful.

782
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:05,223
It's a long competition.

783
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:06,623
She has to hold on to that
Voice.

784
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:10,795
As you know, right now

785
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:13,935
There's only one spot left for
The ladies.

786
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,528
Before we get to the vote,
Jennifer,

787
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:18,504
what did you mean when
You said to erika,

788
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:19,959
you need her
To did a little bit more,

789
00:43:20,037 --> 00:43:20,849
push a Little harder?

790
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,085
I just know what
She can do.

791
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:23,900
We watched her over these last
Few months.

792
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:26,438
really do some amazing things with her voice.

793
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:28,121
I know how strong her voice is.

794
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,508
I know what her range is.

795
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:34,298
I just felt like I always want
Them do their best up there.

796
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:35,460
And I want them to have their

797
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,204
Best performance each time,

798
00:43:37,275 --> 00:43:40,186
Better than the last time, and
So that's what I wanted.

799
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:41,709
That's what I wanted america to
See.

800
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:43,708
And I -- you did great!

801
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,057
I'm just gonna push you.
I'm here to help you.

802
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,232
Elise, how's your
Confidence right now?

803
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:52,426
what is that?

804
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:54,096
I'm really distracted.

805
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:55,853
I'm just thinking about
everything so much.

806
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:57,389
What are you thinking
About?

807
00:43:57,577 --> 00:43:59,904
I'm really sad about some
People leaving.

808
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:01,705
I'm excited for people making
It.

809
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:02,887
I'm hoping I make it.

810
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:04,216
My heart's pounding.

811
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:05,572
-All natural.
-you know.

812
00:44:05,703 --> 00:44:08,300
Haley, let's talk about
Your you performance.

813
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:10,752
What regrets, if any, do you have with
Yours?

814
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:12,353
I don't have any regrets.

815
00:44:12,505 --> 00:44:15,044
I wanted to choose a song nobody
Else was doing.

816
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:17,857
I love annie lennox and I felt

817
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,982
That I performed to the best of
My ability.

818
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:20,943
And I wanted to prove to you guys

819
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:23,122
that I can perform and I
Believed in myself.

820
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:25,525
And I felt in that moment, I truly,
Truly did.

821
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:27,904
I know it wasn't perfect but I know

822
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:30,901
that I can really sing
Wonderfully for you guys.

823
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,078
Very sweet.
All right.

824
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:37,712
Dim the lights.
Here we go.

825
00:44:38,162 --> 00:44:39,777

00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:27,150
are in your top ten,
America.

864
00:47:28,925 --> 00:47:32,103
But the fate of deandre, eben,

865
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:33,954
Colton, and jermaine

866
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,290
is still Hanging in the balance.

867
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:37,338
Let me go to the judges.

868
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:39,787
What do you think about
America's top ten so far,

869
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:41,054
and What's going through your minds

870
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:43,705
In terms of possible wildcard
Picks?

871
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:44,614
Jennifer?

872
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:52,426
I hate seeing some
Of these people go home,

873
00:47:52,722 --> 00:47:55,395
but I
Have to say I agree with america

874
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:58,571
On every single one of the
People that they put in so far.

875
00:47:58,954 --> 00:48:00,188
Amazing.

876
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:07,026
We have a hell of a competition
Crazy brewing right now.

877
00:48:07,443 --> 00:48:10,452
There are amazing singers and
Artists over there right now.

878
00:48:11,185 --> 00:48:12,227
Agree with every single one.

879
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:13,502
Stevie, where's your
Head?

880
00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:16,236
I like to give
Everybody the confidence

881
00:48:16,317 --> 00:48:17,931
to see
What they'll do the next time,

882
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:19,632
Because so many people up here

883
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,105
Have just blown us away with the
Next one.

884
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:24,826
They weren't so good tonight but
The next time they were better.

885
00:48:24,953 --> 00:48:27,033
I have to agree with america and
Jimmy.

886
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,362
I look over here and it's
Everybody that just made my Heart stop.

887
00:48:32,837 --> 00:48:34,822
Randy, we've done this
For years and years.

888
00:48:34,897 --> 00:48:35,850
How we looking this season?

889
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:37,031
Dude, we're looking
Amazing.

890
00:48:37,098 --> 00:48:38,545
America, you're on fire,

891
00:48:38,573 --> 00:48:40,831
because This is an amazing top ten
Brewing.

892
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:44,188
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

893
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:46,421
Each one of these kids that are
Up here

894
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:48,083
could win the whole
Thing.

895
00:48:48,819 --> 00:48:51,290
Who will fill these
Stools is the question.

896
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:53,753
Let's take a look at Tuesday
Night.

897
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,945
roll the tape.
here we go.

898
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:06,456
The gentle giant
Returns!

899
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,245
Thank you for proving to us

900
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:10,660
why we asked you to come
Back.

901
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:11,442
thank you.

902
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:12,728
What a beautiful
Thing, man.

903
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:15,104
Somebody's gonna come
Out and give you a hug.

904
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:16,533
I knew she couldn't resist that.

905
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,173
Here comes gentle mom.

906
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:19,911
Maybe not so gentle.

907
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,706
I'm so grateful.

908
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:24,455
The way that the crowd received me,

909
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:26,200
it was just so warming,

910
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:28,311
like All my nerves that were there
Were gone.

911
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:30,687
I am the biggest competition
This year.

912
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:31,630
So look out.

913
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,928
I'm so glad the judges
Brought jermaine back.

914
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,751
What a beautiful voice.

915
00:49:35,864 --> 00:49:37,948
I can listen to an entire album
Of that voice

916
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:39,921
which is very few
People I can say that about

917
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:41,185
in today's business.

918
00:49:41,252 --> 00:49:43,008
We got to figure out how to get
Him through this show.

919
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,702
Could take a bit of variety,

920
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:47,673
a Bit of excitement and a little
Creativity.

921
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:49,021
But I'm rooting for him.

922
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:57,336
Deandre!

923
00:49:57,897 --> 00:49:59,006
Deandre!

924
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:03,061
Yo, this kid's got it
All.

925
00:50:03,062 --> 00:50:05,698
you're one of the most
commercial guys I've seen

926
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:09,661
Just out of the box, you ready
To go now.

927
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,279
I told you this was
Gonna happen

928
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:13,343
if you kept singing
Like that.

929
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:14,152
Good for you, man.

930
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:15,426
You picked a song to show off
Your voice

931
00:50:15,475 --> 00:50:16,965
as well as it did
Tonight.

932
00:50:24,214 --> 00:50:25,918
I'm where I'm supposed to be
Right now.

933
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:28,123
Deandre has an
Enormous amount of potential.

934
00:50:28,424 --> 00:50:30,950
What he needs is a coach.
we should start now.

935
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:32,979
When you take someone like
Phillip baylie

936
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:35,578
from earth wind And fire,
you have to crush That.

937
00:50:35,892 --> 00:50:37,760
He's just not ready for that
Yet.

938
00:50:44,122 --> 00:50:48,011
Eben, you got a
Really true, straight beautiful Voice.

939
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,559
The melody's a little
Pitchy.

940
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:53,924
It wasn't all perfect,

941
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:56,024
But you collected yourself
A pro

942
00:50:56,424 --> 00:50:58,320
and came back and nailed
The end.

943
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:02,869
What impressed me
Is you really, really held on.

944
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:05,065
You held on and you put the
Bravado on the end.

945
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:07,401
Good job.

946
00:51:08,093 --> 00:51:11,755
Eben's a talented kid
With a lot of great potential.

947
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:14,162
But in my opinion, not ready
For prime time.

948
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:15,420
Not yet.

949
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:17,744
He sang a song that was way too
Mature for him

950
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,338
for where he is
Right now.

951
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:22,017
If he doesn't make it, I'd like
To see him come back.

952
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:24,991
The way the rules work, he can't
Come back.

953
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:26,677
They've got to change the rules.

954
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,747
It's about time that We on "idol"

955
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:37,579
had all own little Indy alt rocker

956
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,475
singing like
Paramore, dude.

957
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:40,940
I didn't even know
you could perform like that.

958
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,395
You're a relevant
Artist.

959
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:44,315
I can hear you on the radio
Right now.

960
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:49,482
When you sing, you really sing
From your heart,

961
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:52,412
and it just
Gets me every single time.

962
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:54,084
I want to see more of that.

963
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:58,204
it's insane
seeing him up on that stage.

964
00:51:58,842 --> 00:52:00,806
We've been watching the show
Since season 1.

965
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:03,713
Just to see him up there is
Amazing.

966
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,848
Colton's really Talented,

967
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:07,896
probably one of the
Most talented kids on the show.

968
00:52:08,234 --> 00:52:09,877
But he can't do too much too
Soon,

969
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:11,288
jumping on the piano.

970
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:14,801
He's got it take it slow, pace
Himself

971
00:52:14,972 --> 00:52:16,271
and he can really win
This thing.

972
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,928
Colton, let me get your
Reaction to jimmy there.

973
00:52:26,003 --> 00:52:27,337
man, I appreciated jimmy.

974
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,597
Wow.
I don't have words.

975
00:52:29,745 --> 00:52:30,963
Just wow.
Just wow.

976
00:52:31,075 --> 00:52:32,487
Wow's a word.

977
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:36,538
Eben, do you want to defend your
Song choice

978
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:38,471
or what were your
Thoughts from watching that Back?

979
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:40,677
when I first heard the song
On the radio,

980
00:52:40,906 --> 00:52:43,608
I was like, oh my
Gosh, mom, I want to sing this Song so bad.

981
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:46,074
I love the song so much.

982
00:52:46,339 --> 00:52:48,317
I felt good about my
Performance.

983
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:50,241
And I think the judges have
Given me

984
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,245
real good advice on my
Melody and everything.

985
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:55,376
it was really great
and next time,

986
00:52:56,194 --> 00:52:57,144
if america lets me through,

987
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:58,663
I'll Definitely step it up a notch.

988
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:04,509
All right.
Dim the lights. Here we go.

989
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:08,399
After the nationwide vote --

990
00:53:10,026 --> 00:53:11,016
Deandre,

991
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:19,196
you unfortunately are
Not in america's top ten.

992
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,302
Take a seat.
Hang for the wildcard round.

993
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:38,536
Colton --

994
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,285
Are you not --

995
00:53:49,379 --> 00:53:50,852
-- Going to be disappointed
Tonight

996
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:53,162
because you made the top
Ten.

997
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,223
Congratulations.

998
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:12,563
Take a seat on the stools.

999
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:22,235
Oh, here we go.

1000
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:26,226
One stool remains in america's
Top ten.

1001
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:28,112
Eben and jermaine.

1002
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,507
Take a look at that shot.

1003
00:54:36,092 --> 00:54:37,278
I know the feeling, brotha.

1004
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:45,138
After the nationwide vote --

1005
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:52,844
The person in america's top ten
Is --

1006
00:54:55,103 --> 00:54:56,375
Jermaine.

1007
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:00,844
Eben, take a seat.

1008
00:55:01,063 --> 00:55:02,070
Hang for the wildcard, okay?

1009
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:04,595
Congratulations.

1010
00:55:09,075 --> 00:55:09,964
So here it is.

1011
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:12,758
These are the five guys and five
Girls

1012
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:16,313
you've chosen as america's
Top ten!

1013
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:21,157
But don't sweat if your favorite
Isn't one of these faces.

1014
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:23,312
The judges are going to reveal
The six contestants

1015
00:55:23,493 --> 00:55:25,293
who they Want to sing again

1016
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:27,580
for the three Wildcard spots.

1017
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:32,026
That's coming up live right here
On "american idol"!

1018
00:55:32,231 --> 00:55:33,273
Be right back.

1019
00:55:44,623 --> 00:55:46,394
Very exciting night
Here on "american idol."

1020
00:55:46,464 --> 00:55:48,948
Before the break, we officially
Named americas' top ten.

1021
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:50,986
A huge congratulations to them.

1022
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:52,540
Excellent.

1023
00:55:55,822 --> 00:56:00,462
Jen, are you pleased with how
This has all gone down?

1024
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:01,774
I am.
I am.

1025
00:56:01,822 --> 00:56:03,802
But it's also one of the most
Painful moments for us, too,

1026
00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:05,097
Because we have to look at that
Group

1027
00:56:05,151 --> 00:56:06,726
and we only get to choose
A certain amount

1028
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:08,690
to come out and
Sing for their life.

1029
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:12,013
And trust me, we're battling it
Out out here right now.

1030
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:13,599
Here's where we stand.

1031
00:56:13,886 --> 00:56:17,400
15 people are eligible for three
Coveted wildcard spots.

1032
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:19,514
Eight guys, seven girls.

1033
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,212
Randy, jennifer, and steven are

1034
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:22,578
Going to call upon six of them

1035
00:56:22,703 --> 00:56:23,825
To sing again.

1036
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:26,624
And after that, each judge will

As much,

Jen, we were just
Commenting.

1074
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,885
We like when you guys come out
And sing for your life.

1075
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:23,825
-It's crazy.
-You started pulling it All out.

1076
00:59:24,346 --> 00:59:26,500
You started kind of slow and you
Went for the gusto.

1077
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:28,787
I think it was a good
Performance.

1078
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:30,729
I think you showed the reason
That you're here

1079
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,875
with those big
Old pipes and everything.

1080
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:34,125
You know what I mean, with the
Big vocals.

1081
00:59:34,143 --> 00:59:35,033
I love that.

1082
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:38,771
I'm -- we'll have to see how we
Fare after this,

1083
00:59:39,252 --> 00:59:40,587
after the other
Singing.

1084
00:59:40,654 --> 00:59:41,891

1085
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,728
-you went for it.
-You went for it.

1086
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,049
Jennifer?

1087
00:59:47,615 --> 00:59:48,644
I feel the same as
Randy.

1088
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:49,780
We have five more people to go.

1089
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:51,638

Fair

1090
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:54,139

Everybody.

1091
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:56,112

You really did.

1093
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:00,464
You know, that was a
Little obvious at the beginning.

1094
01:00:00,611 --> 01:00:01,716
I thought, oh my god, here we
Go.

1095
01:00:02,108 --> 01:00:03,106
But then you took it home.

1096
01:00:03,339 --> 01:00:04,165
You really nailed it.

1097
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:05,536
There's somebody with a big
Voice.

1098
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:09,580
And I love it when it ends up
Like you just did.
