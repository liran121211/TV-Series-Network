1
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:10,734
Getting ready to depart for
American Idol auditions.

2
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:12,297
Wish me luck.

3
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:13,598
Good luck.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,951
It's sort of surreal, because I've
been waiting for it to happen,

5
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:19,430
For such a long time,
and it's finally here.

6
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,790
It's an indescribable feeling.

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,404
I just can't wait
to get in there.

8
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:24,705
I'm really anxious right now.

9
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,466
Okay, let's have it.

10
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:33,835
Take a deep breath.

11
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,337
This is our first trip to Oregon.

12
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:46,289
And with an eclectic
crowd like this,

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,051
There's no telling who
or what we may find.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,622
This is Portland, and...
This is American Idol.

15
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,900
<i>We've finally come to
Portland, Oregon.

16
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:41,135
<i>A jewel of the Northwest.

17
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:44,939
Welcome to Portland!

18
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,326
<i>And even though the city may,
be known for its cloudy skies...

19
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:51,939
<i>The thousands we met in line,
were colorful and bright.

20
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:01,172
<i>And our judges were definitely
feeling the love.

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,606
Today's the day.

22
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,141
We're gonna find the one.

23
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,510
<i>That remains to be seen.

24
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,045
<i>But we are set
to blaze a new trail,

25
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:11,300
<i>Hopefully making Oregon History.

26
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:15,179
<i>Seems nothing was
going to stand in our way.

27
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,629
Portland, Oregon, come on.

28
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,097
Who's going to get the first Ticket?

29
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,165
Me!

30
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:28,833
Let's go.

31
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,835
<i>Everyone in the crowd
has a story.

32
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:32,836
<i>Everyone in the crowd has a dream.

33
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:34,848
Whoo, doggie!

34
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,909
<i>But it might not be about
what you may think.

35
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,044
My name is Britney Zooka.

36
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:43,114
I'm 21 years old, and
I'm from Portland, Oregon.

37
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:44,448
So, I had a dream.

38
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:47,585
I was on the stage with
Sara Bareilles, who I love.

39
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:52,107
And, I was singing "Gravity" with her,
and it was this amazing duet.

40
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:57,200
So I wake up, and I'm really
bumped that it didn't happen,

41
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,501
It was just a dream.

42
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,531
Some dreams just slip away,
but not this one.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,999
And, so, it was my birthday, and

44
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:04,500
I got two tickets to a sold-out
Sara Bareilles concert,

45
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,645
My Mom somehow
managed to get.

46
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:09,607
And I just had this epiphany,

47
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,008
This moment of thinking:

48
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:13,077
"Hey, this is going to happen for me."

49
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,046
And I hold up a cardboard sign.

50
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:17,320
That I ripped from a box,
last-second, and it said:

51
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,617
"Will you sing gravity with me?"

52
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:22,053
She reads it, she winks at me,

53
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,823
She lets me up on stage
and we sing.

54
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,428
From that moment on, I said:

55
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,430
"Okay, I'm going to go for it."

56
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:34,450
I'm going to take this
as far as I can take it,

57
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,646
And nothing's going to stop me.

58
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:38,235
Whoa.

59
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:38,969
Oh, careful.

60
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,405
Did you fall for me?

61
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:43,641
God, I'm much too young to be
this old.

62
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:44,875
What?

63
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,043
What's your name?

64
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:48,145
They call me,
"Tripster the Hipster"...

65
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,780
"Tripster the hipster", okay.

66
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:50,448
Yes.

67
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,116
What are you going to sing
for us today?

68
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:55,399
Today I'm going to be singing
"The Story" by Brandi Carlile.

69
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:56,754
Wow.

70
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:58,556

Just the tone of it's so pretty.

84
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:45,035
Yeah, dude, I really like
you, and what's crazy to me,

85
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:46,504
What I love...

86
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:50,374
You come in here, you look
nothing like what you sound.

87
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:51,675
I should take off my glasses.

88
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:52,877
I'm not as nerdy as sometimes...

89
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:55,546
Okay, take off the hat too.

90
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:56,447
That's it.

91
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,517
Uh, okay, take the boots off!

92
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,485
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm only kidding!

93
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:02,486
No, no, no, no, no.

94
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:05,676
Leave the hat and the glasses off,
see the sass comes out now.

95
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,450
This, the edge
comes out, I like it!

96
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,826
She gets wild with the
hat and glasses off.

97
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,194
I loved the end of that,
it was so good.

98
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,562
Thank you.

99
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,564
-Shall we take a little "votey"?
-Yes.

100
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,699
Yes, yes, I'm gonna say yes.

101
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,067
-Yes, yes.
-No way!

102
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:18,569
-Yes, please yes!
-For real though?

103
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,904
Yes, for real.

104
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,906
Okay, this isn't like "Play a
joke on the girl who trips.",

105
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,574
-You know, this is for real?
-No, no, no, no, no.

106
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,209
Yeah! Okay, awesome.

107
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:26,677
See you in Hollywood.

108
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:28,712

Great voice, great voice.

111
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,059
She's funny, dude.

112
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:45,732

a little bit crazy.

I'm-I'm not feeling that great
today.

139
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:13,889
I've been sick since like
Tuesday pretty much.

140
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,726
My throat usually sounds a lot.
more clear than this.

141
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,529
It's just a little, um, "cloggy"
in the throat.

142
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:22,931
What do you do?

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,267
I-I sell-I sell cable TV on
the street pretty much.

144
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:25,934
On the street?

145
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:26,802
Yeah, we just sit behind the.

146
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,238
Table and just yell at people,
like, "sign up today!" And...

147
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:30,939
What's your pitch?

148
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:36,378
Like, "225 channels is $34.99 a month, get three
free months of-", and all these channels.

149
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,381
And, you know, I don't want to say, like,
the company names, obviously, because-advertising.

150
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,883
Yeah, well-no, I get the pitch.

151
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:46,822
But if your singing is as good as your pitch,
anywhere near the pitch...

152
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,258
-Let's just get in there.
-All right.

153
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:49,925
Good luck.

And how did you happen here,
onto our little stage?

167
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:11,647
Uh, well, I went into work
one day, and I sang for my co-workers,

168
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,850
And he's like, "I know talent when I see it,
so I Want you to go audition."

-Really?
-And so I did, yes.

358

361
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:01,322

Why was this, personally,
something that you wanted to do?

Mm.

420
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:18,910
Two beautiful little boys.

421
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:24,526
And I was married, and he held me
back from doing what I wanted to do, 

422
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,351
And this is what I want to do.

423
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,655
And he's a basketball player,
and I pursued his dreams with him.

424
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:34,472
Then he decided to go and pursue
other women instead of basketball, so...

425
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:35,061
Here I am.

426
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,128
Wow, that's, uh...

427
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:38,997
Sorry.

428
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,365
Well, you have your two little boys.

429
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,166

430
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,267
And here you are.

431
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:43,268
And here I am.

432
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:44,269
So let's make it happen.

433
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:45,103
What are you going to sing?

434
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,438
I'm going to sing
"You're No Good".

435
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,106
You think?

436
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,073
Wonder that, yeah, really.

437
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,275
Perfect, right?

438
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:50,975
Are you sure, are you sure?

439
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,812
You have a beautiful
sense of humor.

440
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,512
Yeah, this is great.

441
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:55,647

Sure, baby.

How is it being a mom?

477

'Cause there's so many people
that say, "you can't do this.

She's jewish.

569
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:47,678
It's a little too "Broadway" for what
this Idol has been pulling out of people.

570
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:49,180
That's who you are, that's okay.

571

Your personality is so Bubbly,
you obviously belong on a stage.

this," you know what I mean?

to do this, specifically.

What's your name?

698
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:19,370
My name is Romeo Dionne.

I'm 22 years old.

700
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,240
I'm from Liberia.

701
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:25,443
Tell us your story, baby.

702
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:29,147
In 1990, there was a civil
War in Liberia.

703
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:32,333
My father was an immigration
Commander, and he heard about

704
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:37,689
The war, so he sent us to Ghana.
And we lived in a refugee camp,

705
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:43,261
hoping there was a chance for us
to come to the U.S for a better life.

706
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,787
Waited so long, and never
thought we'd make it, 'cause I

707
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:59,293
Saw so many people just, like,
perish.

708
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:02,864
And we finally got that chance

Okay, that did it.

890

Well, uh...

891
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,538
No ticket?

892
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:34,472
Didn't make it.

893
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:38,142
Why? Why? Why? Why?

894
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:39,310
What happened, man?

895
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,278
Uh...

896

Come on, come on.

899
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:46,217
So glad my family was here to
support me.

900
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,986
We're going to have some pizza.

901
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:49,420
What was that audition?

902
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,055
What was that?

903
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:52,790
I didn't puke or pee my pants.

904
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:57,495
Or any of the stuff that I was scared
about, so it wasn't that bad.

905
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,864
No one has more fun than me.

906
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,835
Take it easy, man.

907
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:13,644
<i>When we return, one more audition
that leaves the judges stunned.

908
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:17,815
When he did wake up, he
didn't know who I was.

909
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,817
Wow.

910
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:38,427
<i>The sun is setting on our
Portland auditions.

911
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,764
<i>For many, the journey to create a better
life has unfortunately come to an end.

912
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,466
I'm going to say not yet.

913
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:45,400
No for me too.

914
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:46,668
It's a no for me. Not yet.

915
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:50,172
I'm sorry, baby.

916
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,506
Aww.

917
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:53,041
We love you, Nicky.

918
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,943
It's very emotional.

919
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:59,981
I'm just glad I did it.

920
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,416
But for Jessica Philips,

921
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:04,352
this is more than
a single fream.

922
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:08,523
It's another step
towards a miracle.

923
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:09,257
Hello.

924
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:09,958
Hey, hey.

925
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:10,726
How are you guys today?

926
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,460
Great.

927
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:12,194
Good.

928
00:36:12,262 --> 00:36:12,994
What's your name?

929
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:13,762
My name is Jessica.

930
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:14,563
Jessica, where you from?

931
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:15,797
I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

932
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:17,299
Tell me about your boyfriend.

933
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:21,036
Well, his name is Angelo and
we've been together five years.

934
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:24,139
We fell in love, it was like we
were meant to be together.

935
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:30,445
But last Easter Sunday, he actually
had a stroke, a massive stroke.

936
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:33,381
We were out, celebrating a
Friend's birthday.

937
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,954
And I turned around and his
entire face was just washed.

938
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:42,224
I shook him and he didn't
respond to me.

939
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:45,393
He stayed in the hospital for
about a month and a half.

940
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:51,867
When he did wake up, he didn't
know who I was.

941
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:54,536
The entire relationship itself
has changed.

942
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:57,806
Now, I'm really a caretaker.

943
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:02,210
And there's a different type of
love that I feel now and,

944
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:06,414
A different type of responsibility
that I have now to him and just,

945
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:07,649
To life in general.

946
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:09,818
Let's start with these words.

947
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:13,054
Speech therapy is an everyday
thing for us.

948
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:18,160
Every day is just a struggle,
but every day is
also a blessing.

949
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:26,201
Because we still have life and
we still have another chance to keep going.

950
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:46,221
It's the hardest thing I've ever
done in my life, still going through it.

951
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:52,027
And I just pray every day that
I'll be able to continue.

952
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:55,764
I love you, I do.

953
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:56,698
I love you too.

954
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,900
I know, I know.

955
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,068
Wow.

956
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:02,037
So this is the dream right, now?

957
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,705
You're going to be good, I feel.

958
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:06,474
-I hope you like it.
-Well, let's see.

959
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:07,943
-What are you singing?
-We got our fingers crossed.

960
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,845

You did that really well.

988
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,673
I know you ran out of breath a
little bit at the end there.

989
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:13,141
-But...
-I love it.

990
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,009
Shall we vote?

991
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:14,776
Yeah.

992
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:15,610
Go ahead, baby.

993
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,478
I'm going to say yes.

994
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:17,612
I'm going to say yes too.

995
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:22,717
I'm going to say yes too.
You're through to Hollywood, baby, yes!

996
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:23,785
Thank you, guys.

997
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:28,690
Thank you so much.

998
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:30,692
Yeah.

999
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:41,269
American Idol will change my life
in that I'll be able to get back into music.

1000
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:43,071
That's how we met, doing music.

1001
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,774
And with all the health things
that have been going on,

1002
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,509
We haven't been able
to do anything really.

1003
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:54,883
So this will really kick the
music back into gear for us.

1004
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:55,617
You all right?

1005
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:57,018
Yeah.

1006
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:02,290
