00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:10,062
Greetings from
the International Space Station,

2
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,371
the world's largest
orbiting research laboratory.

3
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:15,615
We're currently flying
250 Miles above the earth.

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,992
Below us is the great state of
Texas where over 10,000 people.

5
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:21,325
Are in line for their
chance at stardom.

6
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:22,928
So good luck to the auditioners.

7
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,974
Take it away, Ryan.

8
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:30,037
Thank you very much,
International Space Station.

9
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,386
Right now, we're conducting our
own search for superstars here.

10
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:35,752
And we have got
high hopes for Houston.

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,760
This is <i>American Idol.</i>

12
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:23,138
Welcome to Texas, everybody.

13
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:24,608
Houston!

14
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,023
<i>It's our ninth visit here to
the grand old state of Texas,</i>

15
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,763
<i>a place where
stars are discovered,</i>

16
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:34,188
<i>including our very
first idol, Kelly clarkson.</i>

17
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:37,516
<i>And when we roll into town,
everybody knows it.</i>

18
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:41,332
<i>American Idol</i> auditions
are here in the bayou city.

19
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,200
This is the day.

20
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:48,523
<i>This Texas-sized
crowd is ready to go.</i>

21
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:51,049
You know, it takes one day
to change the rest of your life.

22
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:53,518
Pick me!

23
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,323
- <i>And so am I.</i>
- Come on in.

24
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,007
Here we go, Houston.

25
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,947
I just took a picture
with Ryan seacrest.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
<i>While Houston
is our headquarters,</i>

27
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,785
<i>just down
the road in galveston,</i>

28
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:05,468
<i>the judges set up shop.</i>

29
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,631
I am excited,
I'm really excited.

30
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,621
The bar is always raising.

31
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:13,040
We've been saying, you know,
season 11, a new beginning.

32
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,687
It's still hard for me to
tell somebody they suck.

33
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:19,512
<i>And our first contestant
of the day is starstruck.</i>

34
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:20,957
- Yes.
- Who's that?

35
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,293
Steven Tyler.

36
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:23,850
Right, Steven Tyler?

37
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,951
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

38
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,613
See, I know
the judges right away.

39
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,043
Steven Tyler, baby.

40
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,115
- What's your name?
- Phong vu.

41
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:35,251
- Phong vu.
- Yeah, fong vu!

42
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:40,812
So, what's the best part
about today so far?

43
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,871
Um, all the camera
action in my face.

44
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:46,271
I can see myself.

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,940
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

46
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,983
Can you hear me?
I want to look perfect, I'm...

47
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:55,626
My name is phong vu,
I'm 25 years old

48
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,724
and I was born and raised
from Houston, Texas.

49
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,227
Today, my spirit
will come alive.

50
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:05,391
I will make you shock
and wow and, ooh!

51
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,011
Just look like a superstar.

52
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:14,176
I want to be
the next American Idol.

53
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:20,123
It feels so good inside to have
something big achievement.

54
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,081
And being born
and raised in America.

55
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:31,202
And being an American Idol,
it's just so phenomenon.

56
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,691
It's amazing.

57
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,974
God is on my side, I know it.

58
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:49,188
- Hello, hello.
- Good evening.

59
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,489
- Hey, man, what's your name?
- My name is phong vu.

60
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,912
- Yeah, what are you all about?
- All right, your stance.

61
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:55,213
I am 25 years old.

62
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:56,882
What's with the hand here,
phong?

63
00:03:56,883 --> 00:04:00,538
And I'm from Houston, Texas.
This is my powerful movement.

64
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,279
- Right now, for right now.
- That's right.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,807
Yeah.

66
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:05,601
And I love you, Steven Tyler.

67
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,907
I love you so much,
Jennifer Lopez.

68
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,370
And, Randy Jackson,
I watch your dance show,

69
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,750
I love it so much.

70
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,939
- Thank you, thank you, man.
- Thank you, baby.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,460
So tell us about your voice,

72
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,093
about yourself, where you're
from, all kinds of things.

73
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:21,007
I love to sing, like,
female pop artist music.

74
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:23,412
Especially Celine Dion

75
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:26,313
and yours as well
from Jenny from the block.

76
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,983
- It's in my soul.
- Cool.

77
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,076
That's why I want to bring it.

78
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:33,521
- Okay, baby, bring it.
- Bring it on. Come on, phong.

79
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,347
<i>Un-break my heart.</i>

80
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,182
Okay.

81
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:40,538
<i>Don't leave me
in all this pain.</i>

82
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:43,788
<i>Don't leave me out in the rain.</i>

83
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:45,874
<i>Bring back those nights.</i>

84
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,127
<i>When I held you "besize" me.</i>

85
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:52,564
<i>Un-break my heart,</i>

86
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,934
<i>say you'll love me again.</i>

87
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:59,394
<i>Undo this hurt you caused.</i>

88
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,134
<i>When you walk out the door,</i>

89
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,649
<i>and walked out of my life.</i>

90
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,813
<i>Un-cry these tears.</i>

91
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,182
Dramatic pause.

92
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:14,333
<i>That I cried so many nights.</i>

93
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:19,858
<i>Un-break my heart...</i>

94
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:24,029
<i>Un-break my heart.</i>

95
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:29,501
<i>My heart.</i>

96
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,883
Thank you, baby.

97
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:33,172
- You're welcome.
- When you sing,

98
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,643
you hear her, don't you?

99
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:35,944
Yes, I do.

100
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,531
The energy, the emotion,
the sympathy.

101
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:39,931
I feel the pain.

102
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,246
It's coming through me.

103
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:43,162
I want to channel it
back to you.

104
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,749
Toni Braxton,
<i>un-break my heart.</i>

105
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,799
- What is this show?
- Thank you. Thank you, baby.

106
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,540
- Who are we talking about?
- He's sharing.

107
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,554
- You're welcome so much.
- Is this an audition?

108
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:53,571
It all depends on
how you get it out.

109
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:55,699
- Look, he's crying.
- Yeah, you know what, listen,

110
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,551
you know, you got the passion.

111
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,771
- Yes.
- But your voice, man.

112
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,734
Your voice is not interpreting
what she's sang.

113
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:06,335
- Okay.
- You brought Toni here today,

114
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:08,019
but there wasn't
enough of you in it.

115
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,308
And the melody was missing.

116
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,589
- So for Idol...
- I definitely had more songs

117
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,299
- coming.
- That's okay, sweetie.

118
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,840
- I think we can make a judgment.
- And I want to show you my

119
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,416
iconic moves.

120
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:20,194
Okay.

121
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,357
That's me. Phong vu.

122
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,891
Thank you, phong vu.

123
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,751
It's not gonna
work this time, but...

124
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:30,061
Okay. I appreciate it.

125
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,519
Thank you, sweetie.

126
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,238
- What up, brother?
- I didn't make it.

127
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,608
- No?
- No.

128
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:42,006
- What...
- I performed with all my heart,

129
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,575
all my energy.

130
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,643
He felt it. He felt it.
He had a tear.

131
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:46,944
God bless him, dude.

132
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,929
- I mean, wow.
- I mean, I was like, oh, my God.

133
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,517
I really thought this is
my year, this is my time.

134
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,380
Your hands are sweaty.

135
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,474
- Sorry.
- I will tell you that.

136
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:58,739
But thanks.
Nice to meet you, Ryan.

137
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,083
Good luck.

138
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:02,434
Mama, dad, I tried.

139
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,850
You're a fun person
to be around.

140
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,317
Thank you. I appreciate it.

141
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:09,237
America, you will
see me next year.

142
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:14,092
I promise you that.

143
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:17,001
<i>So it just wasn't
phong vu's time.</i>

144
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:21,036
<i>But, over the next hour, the
exceptional talent in Houston</i>

145
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:23,375
<i>proves why
everything is bigger...</i>

146
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,104
<i>And better in Texas.</i>

147
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:27,775
<i>You're going to Hollywood!</i>

148
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:32,437
<i>Leading to a whole different
Texas revolution</i>

149
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:33,847
<i>in the lone star state.</i>

150
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,481
Revolution! Revolution!

151
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,900
- I don't want to fight.
- Then say you're sorry.

152
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:41,079
- For what?
- She wasn't that good yet.

153
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,568
Are you guys crazy?

154
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,900
Welcome back to Texas, y'all.

155
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,834
Yes, Texas.
The state you don't mess with.

156
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:02,449
Where the land is rugged,
where the cattle stand tall...

157
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:07,030
And a man is a man.

158
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,666
<i>They say I'm crazy,</i>

159
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,269
<i>i really don't care,</i>

160
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:15,172
<i>that's my prerogative.</i>

161
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:18,008
<i>They say I'm nasty.</i>

162
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:19,426
Oh, my God.

163
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:22,045
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

164
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:25,048
<i>And I just can't hide it.</i>

165
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:27,150
<i>I know, I know, I know.</i>

166
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,419
<i>I know, I know, I kn-n-now.</i>

167
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,289
<i>I know I want you.</i>

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,733
<i>Come on, this is Texas.</i>

169
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,166
<i>Where are the cowboys?</i>

170
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,650
<i>Baby, lock them doors.</i>

171
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,760
<i>And turn the lights down low.</i>

172
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,835
<i>Put some music on.</i>

173
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,241
<i>That's soft and slow.</i>

174
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,643
<i>Baby, we ain't got.</i>

175
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,278
<i>No place to go.</i>

176
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,814
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

177
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,923
You rode that into the sunset.

178
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:56,453
<i>Let's face it.</i>

179
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,950
We were not going
to find the next Scotty here.

180
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,251
<i>Baby, lock them doors.</i>

181
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,523
<i>And turn the lights down low.</i>

182
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,292
<i>Put some music on.</i>

183
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,361
<i>That's soft and slow.</i>

184
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,937
Okay, this is when things

185
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,110
start happening, and I'm like,
"what's happening?"

186
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,367
<i>The galveston guys
were striking out.</i>

187
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,668
I'm lost.

188
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,653
<i>Maybe a girl would
have a better shot.</i>

189
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:21,256
<i>Meet 17-year-old skylar
Lane from Brandon, Mississippi.</i>

190
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:22,743
<i>I love to go mud riding.</i>

191
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,299
So now it's time
to get changed...

192
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:31,514
And go kill a deer.

193
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,566
This is the deer that
I shot when I was 15.

194
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,033
Ain't it pretty?

195
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,718
So you're a very girly girl?

196
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,456
I don't think the average

197
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:42,190
teenage girl around America
has a deer in her room.

198
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,363
My family owns a restaurant in.

199
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,003
Downtown Jackson
called beatty street groceries.

200
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:49,458
And it's been in our
family for 71 years.

201
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,404
- Hey, papa.
- Hey, baby.

202
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:53,199
Oh, man, I love you.

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,500
Love you too.

204
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,754
My mom describes it as
a little hole in the wall.

205
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:58,424
It's really fun to work here.

206
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,046
I love cause my whole family's
here and my papa and my mama.

207
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,468
- There you go, sir.
- Oh, she sings like a little.

208
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,446
Meadowlark. I tell you.

209
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,670
Our store has had
a rough ten years.

210
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,426
It was really, really tough.

211
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:14,216
We lost maybe 25%
of our business.

212
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:15,907
My mom doesn't like
to talk about

213
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,285
the hard times at the store,

214
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:20,315
because she doesn't really
want us to worry about it.

215
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,889
If anything ever came from

216
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,448
singing for me, I'd really want
to help out my family with the.

217
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,298
Store so we can keep
it in our family forever.

218
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,589
How much longer
will we be open, papa?

219
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,057
As long as the customers
keep coming.

220
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,880
What are you gonna sing for us?

221
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,381
Pistol Annies' <i>hell on heels.</i>

222
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,682
Nice.

223
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:39,134
<i>I'm hell on heels,</i>

224
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:40,637
<i>say what you will.</i>

225
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,640
<i>I done made the devil a deal,</i>

226
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,393
<i>he made me pretty,</i>

227
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,861
<i>he made me smart.</i>

228
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,496
<i>I'm gonna break me.</i>

229
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,156
<i>A million hearts.</i>

230
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:51,866
<i>I'm hell on heels.</i>

231
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,475
<i>Sugar daddy.</i>

232
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:56,567
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

233
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,187
- I love it.
- Ooh, I like that.

234
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,549
I love it.

235
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,393
- I love that song.
- Well, we know exactly

236
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,848
who she is, and that's
part of what I love about her.

237
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,447
I'm ready to vote.

238
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,713
- Thank you. Oh, my gosh.
- Steven, yes or no?

239
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,101
Positively.

240
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,031
- Steven, yes or no?
- Yes, positively.

241
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,564
- Steven, yes or no?
- Positively yes.

242
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,720
- Jennifer?
- Yes.

243
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,862
Randy?

244
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:21,263
Yes!

245
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,564
Welcome to Hollywood.

246
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,065
Oh, my gosh,
my friend loves you.

247
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,371
She has a poster on your wall.

248
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,025
She would love to give you a
hug but I don't know if she can.

249
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,679
- She would, like, faint.
- Where is she?

250
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,787
- She's right out the door.
- She would faint?

251
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,173
She's obsessed with him.

252
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:34,793
Tell you what,
why don't you go in?

253
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,674
- I'm gonna die.
- I'm scared of you.

254
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,753
- No, don't be scared of me.
- I am scared of you.

255
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:44,059
- Don't be scared of her, Steven.
- Where's my security?

256
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:46,831
- How old are you?
- Wait. Stay right up there.

257
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,595
- I'm 19.
- I need a hug from you.

258
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,423
Oh, I need a hug from you.

259
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,935
I love that. Dude, I love that.

260
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,720
Nice.

261
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,467
That was easy.

262
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,168
We liked that.

263
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,737
Hollywood, here I come.

264
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,405
See you there, baby.

265
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,274
<i>Up next...</i>

266
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,643
I'm about to pee myself.

267
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,535
- Go right ahead.
- We get the juices flowing.

268
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,910
Sweet.

269
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,919
<i>Because boys will be boys...</i>

270
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,483
Uh, uh, hello.

271
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,838
<i>And Jennifer's
all fired up about it.</i>

272
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,217
Are you guys crazy?

273
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,606
I didn't get it.

274
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,253
Somebody help me.

275
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,064
<i>Welcome back to American Idol</i>,

276
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,630
<i>as our Texas-sized
auditions continue.</i>

277
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,163
It don't get
no better than this.

278
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:39,263
<i>Contestants from all over
are hoping to strike it big</i>

279
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,853
<i>with a ticket to Hollywood.</i>

280
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:43,247
<i>And when facing the biggest
moment of your life,</i>

281
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:45,436
<i>you can never be too prepared.</i>

282
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,511
<i>Some practice
with a vocal coach.</i>

283
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,808
<i>Others at karaoke night.</i>

284
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,727
<i>Some in their car.</i>

285
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,322
<i>Or even in front of
their neighbors.</i>

286
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,557
Then it comes down
to the final touches.

287
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,011
Is that what shirt
you're wearing?

288
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,424
- Can you at least iron it? Dang.
- I ain't got time.

289
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,725
- I got to go.
- I think I know

290
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,963
what I want to wear.
It's this white little dress.

291
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:10,879
<i>And while preparation
is vital...</i>

292
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,309
Where are my shoes?

293
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,291
<i>It takes serious determination.</i>

294
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,996
This is what I want. I want
to be the next American Idol.

295
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,297
I know that it's gonna happen.

296
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,834
<i>Especially if you've been</i>

297
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,879
<i>turned down once before.</i>

298
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:26,360
- What's your name?
- I'm baylie brown.

299
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,761
- Hi, baylie.
- Baylie's back.

300
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:29,251
- I'm back.
- Back?

301
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,605
It's been five years.

302
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:32,130
It's been...
Has it been that long?

303
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:34,202
I was 16. I'm 21 now.

304
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,602
It's been a long,
long, long time.

305
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,198
Ooh, I want to see that tape.

306
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:45,103
Back in season six, I auditioned
in San Antonio, Texas.

307
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,468
I actually made it to Hollywood.

308
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:52,742
Group round was definitely
my least favorite moment.

309
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,455
I was paired with two
best friends from Jersey.

310
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:59,844
Our personalities
didn't really mesh well.

311
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,033
<i>Each time, I te...</i>

312
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,210
And then, of course,
I forgot the words.

313
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:08,994
Those Jersey girls actually
made it, and I went home.

314
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,677
It was a really
tough experience.

315
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,909
I was just a baby at the time.
I was 16.

316
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,413
Definitely grown and matured.

317
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,761
And I'm ready.

318
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:22,553
<i>I want to lay you down.</i>

319
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:27,091
<i>In a bed of roses.</i>

320
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,761
<i>For tonight I sleep.</i>

321
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,198
<i>On a bed of nails.</i>

322
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:37,735
<i>Ooh, I want to be.</i>

323
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:40,404
<i>Just as close as.</i>

324
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:44,175
<i>Your holy ghost is.</i>

325
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:47,611
<i>So lay you down.</i>

326
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,682
<i>On a bed of roses.</i>

327
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:53,718
I'm ready to vote. Are y'all?

328
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,539
- Yeah, I'm ready to vote.
- Baylie's back.

329
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,188
Baylie is back.

330
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,589
- I know.
- Steven, what you think?

331
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,282
I say yes.

332
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,070
- Mm, no-brainer.
- I say yes.

333
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:04,922
I wonder what you were like when
you were 16, but at 21...

334
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,617
- I was a little baby.
- You're great,

335
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:09,341
I hope you hold it together
for Hollywood this time.

336
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:11,569
She was a little baby, but
she was almost there, but

337
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,068
I'll tell you what, you've got
significantly better.

338
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:16,059
Three yeses.
You're through to Hollywood!

339
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,541
Baylie brown is back!

340
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,790
That's a...
That's a movie star name.

341
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,191
Baylie, I like it.

342
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,978
- Baylie brown.
- Baylie brown.

343
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,254
I like it. Well, it's a
country singer star name.

344
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,627
Yeah, right, it is.

345
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,359
<i>So baylie's persistence</i>

346
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,043
<i>has earned her
a second chance in Hollywood.</i>

347
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,408
<i>But for our next contestant,</i>

348
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,220
<i>today's audition is her one</i>

349
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,143
<i>and only shot
to change her life.</i>

350
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,332
Hello.

351
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,824
- Hello.
- What's your name?

352
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,668
My name is Kristina sorio.

353
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,868
- And how old are you?
- 28.

354
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,208
So this is it.
This is your last time.

355
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,646
This is it.
Yup, first and last.

356
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:55,946
I've always done music.

357
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,895
I did little bar gigs
and cafe gigs,

358
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:00,751
and then I met my husband.

359
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,789
We had a band together
for a couple years.

360
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:08,421
And then I got pregnant, so that
all kind of got put on pause.

361
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,859
I have three kids.
I have a seven-year-old boy.

362
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,336
His name is Diego.

363
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:22,038
I have a five-year-old girl.
Her name is Isabella.

364
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,864
And a two-year-old
girl named Sophia.

365
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,567
I am currently
going through a divorce.

366
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:31,549
I've never been a single mom.

367
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,581
It's gonna be hard, but it's
definitely gonna be a journey.

368
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:43,364
It's been hard
for me to find work.

369
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,409
So I try to do stuff
out of my house

370
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,275
and simple little things
just to get some extra cash.

371
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,201
Took out a loan. And that was
supposed to pay for my lawyer.

372
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:57,473
And instead of paying my divorce
lawyer, I got a plane ticket.

373
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,348
To come to <i>American Idol.</i>

374
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,046
Sing like mommy.

375
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,767
A new beginning.

376
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,237
Yes.

377
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:10,014
Okay, let's hear it.

378
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,072
Come on, mama.

379
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,675
<i>You've been on my mind,</i>

380
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,444
- <i>i grow fonder.</i>
- Thank you, God.

381
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:20,247
<i>Every day.</i>

382
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:21,744
<i>Lose myself.</i>

383
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:23,284
<i>In time.</i>

384
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:28,022
<i>Just thinking of your face.</i>

385
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,525
<i>God only knows.</i>

386
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:34,261
<i>Why it's taken me.</i>

387
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,930
<i>So long.</i>

388
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:39,500
<i>To let myself go.</i>

389
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,569
<i>You're the only one.</i>

390
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:44,872
<i>That I want.</i>

391
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,295
- I heard enough.
- I heard enough too.

392
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,098
Well, I happen
to love your high warble.

393
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,961
And I love when you go upstairs.

394
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,337
Your tenderness is beautiful.

395
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,381
Uh, I'm just gonna say yes.

396
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,370
- Jennifer?
- I'm gonna say yes too.

397
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:57,719
- Steven?
- I'm gonna say yes.

398
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,394
- You're going to Hollywood.
- Welcome to Hollywood.

399
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,062
That's how you
do it right there.

400
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:04,429
<i>That's how you do it.</i>

401
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,046
- Nice.
- Beautiful voice.

402
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,248
- Beautiful, natural.
- That break in her voice.

403
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:17,571
- Oh, I love it.
- So the sea of Texas talent.

404
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:18,872
<i>Is on the rise,</i>

405
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,823
I'm thinking I want
to go jump in the ocean.

406
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,709
<i>As another Hollywood
dream becomes reality.</i>

407
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,896
<i>Coming up...</i>

408
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,909
- I'm gonna say no.
- Are you guys crazy?

409
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,842
- I didn't get it.
- The judges can't see

410
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,576
- <i>eye to eye.</i>
- She wasn't that good yet.

411
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,323
- Oh, my God.
- <i>As Houston becomes</i>

412
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:34,688
<i>a battle of the sexes.</i>

413
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,057
I'm gonna say yes.

414
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,458
Oh, my God.

415
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,118
Welcome back to <i>American Idol</i>

416
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,662
from the international
space station.

417
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,669
Good luck, contestants.

418
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,249
Thank you, commander Burbank.

419
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,720
Back down in the state of Texas,

420
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:05,105
remaining contestants are ready
to rocket to the big time.

421
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:08,124
But behind the judges table,

422
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,922
our own stars weren't
exactly aligned.

423
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:12,843
We are halfway through
the day here in Texas,

424
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:15,194
and there seems to be a little
dissention in the ranks.

425
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,557
It is Jennifer versus
the boys' club.

426
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,789
<i>And I want to, uh-uh-uh.</i>

427
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,817
- <i>Do it.</i>
- I'm gonna say yes.

428
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,550
I'm gonna say no.

429
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,310
Me too. No, not yet, dude.

430
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:31,802
<i>For you are mine.</i>

431
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:38,140
<i>At last.</i>

432
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,263
Okay. I don't think you're quite
ready yet, so it's a no for me.

433
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,730
- Are you guys crazy?
- I didn't get it.

434
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,196
She wasn't that good yet.
She can get there.

435
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,199
Oh, my God.

436
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:51,253
<i>And I'm misery,</i>

437
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:54,623
<i>now I'm misery.</i>

438
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:58,127
<i>Tell me why does this heart.</i>

439
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,797
<i>Make a fool out of me.</i>

440
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,811
Steven, what'd you
think of Cheyenne?

441
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,768
You know, I'm not sure if
you got it for this year's Idol.

442
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,248
- You're joking, right?
- No.

443
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,025
I'm not.

444
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,609
I thought you were amazing.

445
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:16,078
Soulful... soulful, rich.

446
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,747
I just loved it.

447
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:19,448
I just don't think it's
quite ready yet.

448
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:21,764
- You guys are crazy.
- I think there's something there

449
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,386
I don't think you're
quite ready yet.

450
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,318
- Are you crazy?
- I didn't feel it.

451
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:30,162
Anybody else in here think that
they're freakin crazy right now?

452
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,560
Oh, my God.

453
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,126
I say not yet, baby.

454
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,416
- I say not yet.
- I would have said yes,

455
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,917
if I had two people who were
hearing correctly right now.

456
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,218
They would have said yes.

457
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,524
And then we would be putting
you through to Hollywood.

458
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,225
- We agree to disagree.
- And you might make it very far.

459
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,326
We agree to disagree.
Steven and I didn't get it.

460
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:47,627
But sorry. I'm sorry.

461
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,548
But you'll be even better
when you come back.

462
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,158
You guys are gonna look at it
and be like, "what the heck was"

463
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,467
I thinking?
What was I thinking?"

464
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,100
Really?

465
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,131
Some of the people
you put through today?

466
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:02,678
- No. No.
- Against her?

467
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,396
I won't lose any sleep
over that one.

468
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:05,927
Okay.

469
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:11,300
<i>Oh, oh, I...</i>

470
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:14,503
<i>Never felt this way.</i>

471
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:19,742
<i>I start falling.</i>

472
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,654
Baby, you can sing.
I love your voice.

473
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,379
I'm about to pee myself.

474
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,031
- Go right ahead,
- you guys...

475
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,863
'Cause you were that good.

476
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:30,518
I feel like I'm in
the twilight zone.

477
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:32,996
What do you think, Randy?

478
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:35,254
- You know, I like...
- Well, I know what I thought.

479
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:37,204
Okay, Jennifer,
what did you think?

480
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:39,291
There was something in your
voice that, really,

481
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,661
I couldn't connect with.

482
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:42,433
I think you got something there.

483
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,018
I want this more than anything.

484
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,470
Wake up. Honestly.

485
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,482
I feel like somebody
slipped you something.

486
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,792
Let me just say this.

487
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,509
That was some
beautiful singing, girl.

488
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,222
- Thank you.
- Jennifer, which way

489
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,013
are you voting?
Which way are you leaning?

490
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:59,714
I think you need a little more
experience. Maybe next year.

491
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:02,458
I think you're worth
one more shot.

492
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,759
I'm gonna say yes.

493
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,052
And I'm gonna say yes,
so guess where you're going?

494
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,745
- Hollywood!
- Thank you.

495
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:09,091
Thank you so much.

496
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:16,465
That was awful.

497
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,526
- It's a big voice.
- That was awful.

498
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,370
<i>So Linda is through.</i>

499
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,281
<i>But back inside the room,</i>

500
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:26,608
<i>Jennifer is just
getting started.</i>

501
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,288
- That was awful.
- Why was it?

502
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,229
Were you guys watching
her walk or something?

503
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,981
- It wasn't... it wasn't...
- Yes, it was.

504
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,852
- That was so not awful.
- It wasn't that bad.

505
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,253
Baby,
you're gonna watch it back.

506
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,233
I promise you, you're
gonna say it's awful.

507
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,346
The one girl who came in here
and blew you away,

508
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:42,062
she was sounding like Janis
joplin, you sent her home.

509
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,672
That was a different
type of singing.

510
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,935
It was a different
type of singing.

511
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,473
- This is the kind of singing...
- Somebody help me!

512
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,067
Jennifer says
we've got a roofie.

513
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,731
What is happening right now?
They're sending the good singers.

514
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,884
Home, and they're letting
the bad singers through.

515
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,706
J-lo, even though I was a

516
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,675
little crushed
'cause I idolize you,

517
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,778
I'm gonna prove
you wrong in Hollywood.

518
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:04,800
I literally... I was so angry,
I almost had an anxiety attack.

519
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:08,392
I was like, I cannot hold it in.

520
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:10,014
- <i>Coming up...</i>
- Grant me the power

521
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:11,474
to bring revolution
to the world.

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,941
<i>Is this the man to restore
peace on the panel?</i>

523
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:16,692
No, no, no, no.

524
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,901
<i>Or has the real
battle just begun?</i>

525
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:20,395
The revolution is here.

526
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:24,469
And if they're not down with
that, they can all just @?$&£!

527
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,227
<i>Welcome back to the Idol
smackdown in Texas.</i>

528
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:42,098
<i>As the day winds down,
Jennifer is all wound up.</i>

529
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,354
I don't think you're
quite ready yet.

530
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,078
- Are you crazy?
- I'm gonna say yes.

531
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:47,718
Oh, my God.

532
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:49,086
That was awful.

533
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,234
I literally... I was so angry,
I almost had an anxiety attack.

534
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:56,226
I was like, I cannot hold it in!

535
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,761
<i>Meanwhile, I scoured the</i>

536
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,363
<i>holding room to find someone to</i>

537
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:01,929
<i>return a sense of peace
to the auditions.</i>

538
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,365
<i>It has to be a good pick.</i>

539
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:06,415
<i>Ooh, I think I found him.</i>

540
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,076
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good today.

541
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:09,658
Good to see you.
You just hanging?

542
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,174
Yeah, just waiting around.

543
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,176
Just doing what
needs to be done.

544
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:14,518
And what is that?

545
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,120
Well, apparently take a lot

546
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,522
of orders, follow them to a tee,
stay on top of timing.

547
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:21,729
- Right.
- But what I'd really like to

548
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,673
be doing is be in front
of those judges,

549
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,334
blowing their minds.

550
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,692
My name is Alejandro cazares.

551
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:32,368
I'm 26 years old,
and I am from Houston, Texas.

552
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:34,914
Today is the first day
of the revolution.

553
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:37,009
And anybody
that just happens to be around,

554
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,650
they're gonna feel that heat.

555
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,590
Oh, my God. This is it.

556
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,305
I want to be standing
in front of America

557
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,362
and I can finally
tell everybody,

558
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:54,796
in front of the entire world,
I made it.

559
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,887
The revolution is here.

560
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,795
I am the revolution.

561
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:02,813
Every single one of you
has got to bring it on.

562
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,695
The revolution is here.

563
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:06,438
And if they're not
down with that,

564
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:10,124
like my good friends say,
they can all just @?$&£!

565
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,819
Revolution.

566
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,089
Revolution. Revolution.

567
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:17,557
I don't want to fight.

568
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,457
Then say you're sorry.

569
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,158
- For what?
- See?

570
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,681
So you want to keep
the fight going.

571
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:24,032
- I haven't done anything.
- Okay.

572
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,970
- Hey, man.
- Randy.

573
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,168
- What's going on?
- Jennifer. Steven.

574
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:29,945
- Hi.
- Grant me the power

575
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,443
to bring revolution
to the world.

576
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:34,162
What kind of revolution?

577
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:36,630
Revolution where the underdog.

578
00:25:36,631 --> 00:25:38,280
Can actually win
once in a while.

579
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,788
A world where unique people like.

580
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,178
Lady gaga become
platinum sellers.

581
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,566
A world where a man like Barack
Obama can become president.

582
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,958
That kind of world.

583
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:49,544
Aren't those two things
truths in the world today?

584
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:50,949
Isn't that the world we live in?

585
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:54,951
I've been on the
sidelines all my life.

586
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:57,024
And you have a lot of
support in your dreams?

587
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,974
I have a girlfriend. I shouldn't
even call her a girlfriend.

588
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,585
I told her, you know,
"wish me luck",

589
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,672
and she said, "I can't wish
you luck."

590
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:05,294
It's something
I don't believe in."

591
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:07,972
There's a lot of people
that are rooting against me.

592
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,651
What do you say
we maybe sing now?

593
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,088
That sounds like a plan.

594
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:13,715
<i>>> What are you singing?</i>

595
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:15,630
It's called <i>looking up</i>
by paramore.

596
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,018
Great band.

597
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,120
<i>Things are looking up,</i>

598
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:22,089
<i>oh, finally.</i>

599
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:24,112
<i>I thought I'd never see.</i>

600
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:26,929
<i>The day you smiled at me,</i>

601
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,797
<i>and it's not a dream any more,</i>

602
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:31,432
<i>no.</i>

603
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,068
<i>It's not a dream any more,</i>

604
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,537
<i>it's worth fighting for.</i>

605
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:39,248
<i>I can't believe
I almost gave it up.</i>

606
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,783
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

607
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:42,153
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

608
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,877
<i>It's all I've ever wanted.</i>

609
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:45,246
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

610
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,247
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

611
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:50,384
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

612
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,834
Your voice is not, you know,

613
00:26:52,835 --> 00:26:54,548
good enough for <i>American Idol.</i>

614
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,190
I know what I can do.

615
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:59,577
I know that I can prove to you
that, if you let me through,

616
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,129
if you give me that chance,

617
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:04,851
I can go out there and I can do
something most people never do.

618
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:07,012
I want to be your
age one day, Steven.

619
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:08,803
- Easy, easy.
- You may never get there. No.

620
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,516
I just want to be even on the
cusp of where you got to.

621
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:15,751
You wrote <i>dream on</i> before
aerosmith even formed.

622
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:17,106
I never thought I'd be...

623
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,475
You got to love him, I mean...

624
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:20,714
And if you just...

625
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,883
I'll fight for it harder
than anybody.

626
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:25,235
I'm gonna say this to you.

627
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:27,617
The voice is terrible.
Honestly your voice is terrible.

628
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:29,418
Never a career
in singing for you.

629
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,579
- It's not gonna happen.
- And I wrote dream on back.

630
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,074
When the dead
sea was still sick.

631
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:36,993
I know I can do this.

632
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,020
- Please.
- We have to take a quick vote,

633
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,537
okay? Steven?

634
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,704
Not yet, man.

635
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,646
- Randy?
- Never.

636
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:47,199
- I'm begging you.
- Vocally never.

637
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,585
- I'm begging you. One shot.
- No, don't beg us.

638
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,640
Sweetie, you have too much
integrity for that,

639
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:53,054
too much dignity.

640
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:55,281
- So, listen...
- Can I sing in Spanish at least?

641
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,652
Please?

642
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:00,362
What can I do?

643
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:02,190
- Nothing.
- This is, this is... I've heard.

644
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,747
Other singers that I honestly
know aren't better than me.

645
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:06,841
I've heard worse.
There is worse.

646
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:10,054
Truth is, if you think you're
good and you're here,

647
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,801
you shouldn't even listen
to anyone else

648
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:13,835
or have any comment cause
you won't even know.

649
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:15,473
- I'll be back next year.
- Here we go.

650
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,871
Okay, baby.

651
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:20,677
Ouch.

652
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,300
Our forefathers fought,
you know, months, years,

653
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:27,177
to get to where
this country got.

654
00:28:27,616 --> 00:28:30,476
And life's not about
how hard you can hit,

655
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:34,054
but how hard you can get hit
and keep pushing forward.

656
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:40,093
The revolution is not over.

657
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:42,929
Not till I say it's over.

658
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,604
<i>After the break,
Steven's at it again.</i>

659
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,905
Look at those legs...

660
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:54,167
You show a little belly,
and it goes crazy around here.

661
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,283
<i>Plus day two
delivers more talent.</i>

662
00:28:57,284 --> 00:28:58,817
You are what
we've been looking for.

663
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,815
<i>But can the judges
keep it together?</i>

664
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:04,277
How are you gonna stop him?
He wasn't even warmed up.

665
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:06,379
No, no, no, I know.
So what else you got?

666
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,043
What do you mean?

667
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,846
Welcome to Texas!

668
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,309
<i>We're at it again
here in Houston,</i>

669
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,706
<i>as another day of
auditions is set to begin.</i>

670
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:29,128
<i>A stellar start on day one</i>

671
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:31,629
<i>leaves Texas
with a lot to live up to.</i>

672
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:34,784
<i>The day two contestants
have their eye on the prize.</i>

673
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:37,026
<i>But Randy and Steven
are eying something else.</i>

674
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,575
What can you say
about Jennifer Lopez?

675
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:41,974
That's what I was saying.
Oh, my God, today.

676
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,275
Look at those legs...

677
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:46,256
You show a little belly,
and it goes crazy around here.

678
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:48,151
- For real, though.
- Next time, long shirt.

679
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:50,549
<i>It could be
a long day for Jennifer.</i>

680
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,951
I got it.

681
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,302
Here we go. Come on.

682
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:55,202
<i>And as the guys settle down...</i>

683
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:56,605
Do it.

684
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:59,618
<i>Our first contestant
is ready to shake things up.</i>

685
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,396
- Cortez, where you from, bud?
- From garland, Texas.

686
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:03,888
Now tell me,
what do you do there?

687
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,803
I'm a warehouse worker
and a college student.

688
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,407
Yeah, and what do you envision?

689
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,439
- Being the next American Idol.
- That's good.

690
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:11,908
That's a good goal.

691
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,807
Hey.

692
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:16,774
Wake up. It's a big day.

693
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,784
I grew up in a single
parent household.

694
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,191
My mom was the breadwinner
for the household.

695
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,721
Me and my brother.
And my mom was so strong.

696
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,384
We were homeless at times,
like, for two years.

697
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:28,220
I got made fun of at school,

698
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,333
'cause we had to live
with friends at that time.

699
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,616
Just had a really hard
childhood, struggled a lot,

700
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:37,448
but no one can put
a definition on your life.

701
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,771
Only you can determine
what happens in your future.

702
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,427
I really want
to show people that,

703
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,859
through hard work
and determination and passion

704
00:30:43,894 --> 00:30:46,101
in what you believe for,
you can really do it.

705
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:47,733
It can be done.

706
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,653
There is hope.
No matter what happens in life,

707
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:52,389
you can still
achieve your dream.

708
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,476
<i>American Idol</i>
is opportunity at its greatest.

709
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,552
- Hi.
- Hello.

710
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:03,307
What you singing, baby?

711
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,313
I'm gonna sing Adele,
<i>someone like you.</i>

712
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,708
- Okay.
- Wow, do it.

713
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,062
All right. Here we go.

714
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:09,528
<i>I hate to turn up.</i>

715
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:10,930
<i>Out of the blue uninvited,</i>

716
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:12,932
<i>but I couldn't stay away.</i>

717
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,300
<i>I couldn't fight it.</i>

718
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,601
<i>I hoped you'd see my face.</i>

719
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:16,902
<i>And that you'd be reminded.</i>

720
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:21,840
<i>That for me. It isn't over.</i>

721
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:23,610
<i>Never mind, I'll find.</i>

722
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:26,598
<i>Someone like you.</i>

723
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,980
<i>I wish nothing.</i>

724
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,715
<i>But the best.</i>

725
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,685
<i>For you two.</i>

726
00:31:32,753 --> 00:31:34,320
<i>Don't forget me.</i>

727
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,788
<i>I'll beg.</i>

728
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:38,557
<i>I remember you said.</i>

729
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:40,626
<i>Sometimes it lasts in love,</i>

730
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:43,413
<i>but sometimes it hurts instead.</i>

731
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:46,715
That's what
that song sounds like.

732
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,316
Nice.
No, no, I like it. I like it.

733
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,293
A lot of people have
tried to sing that song.

734
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:51,782
I'm like, oh, God.

735
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,897
Thank you.
How are you gonna stop him?

736
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:56,342
He wasn't even warmed up.

737
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:58,143
No, no, no, I know.
So what else you got?

738
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:00,284
- What do you mean?
- I want to hear something else.

739
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,895
Ah, come on, Randy.
Give me some love.

740
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:04,288
- No, it was good enough.
- You're my favorite judge, man.

741
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,947
- Come on now. I love all you.
- Swear?

742
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:07,620
He's not your favorite judge.

743
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:09,343
Swear. Swear, don't lie.

744
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,475
Don't lie
on national television.

745
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:12,776
I love all of you.

746
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:14,299
I mean, I love all
of you of course.

747
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,735
You're beautiful, talented,
but you're my favorite judge.

748
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:19,086
- You've been here the longest.
- I really like this guy.

749
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,399
This guy has a certain...

750
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,389
Charm, a special...
What do they say?

751
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,335
- Je ne sais quoi.
- Je ne sais quoi.

752
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:27,815
Yeah, you have
a special something.

753
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:30,548
Listen, you're good-looking.

754
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:32,357
- Thank you.
- You're sweet.

755
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:34,183
- Thank you.
- You have a great voice.

756
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:35,709
- Thank you.
- Yes.

757
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,756
- Leg up.
- Steven?

758
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,428
I say yes.

759
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:42,717
I think you're
a good-looking guy,

760
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,560
not like me and Steven,
but you're a good-looking guy.

761
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,871
I think that you have
a really good voice.

762
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,183
Thank you.

763
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
- Yes.
- Thank you.

764
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,175
What does that mean,
Jennifer, what does that mean?

765
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:56,592
Hollywood.

766
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,809
Oh, my God.

767
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,900
See, he was middle
of the road for me until he...

768
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,385
- No.
- No, but actually, that was...

769
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,053
No, I was like, are you crazy?

770
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,072
- Don't stop him.
- To get this golden ticket

771
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,868
is like everything
I've ever wanted.

772
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:15,089
I'm this much closer
to winning <i>American Idol.</i>

773
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,558
I'm gonna win <i>American Idol.</i>

774
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,092
Oh, my God!

775
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:19,527
Cortez Shaw.

776
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:21,081
What a name, huh?

777
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:24,215
<i>When we come back...</i>

778
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,071
<i>We're on the final stretch to</i>

779
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:28,235
<i>the finish line with more words</i>

780
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:29,626
<i>of wisdom from Mr. Tyler...</i>

781
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:34,562
<i>As our galveston auditions end</i>

782
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:37,093
<i>with a story
of incredible odds.</i>

783
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:39,249
I wasn't born normal.

784
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,715
I came out a bit different.

785
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:43,789
<i>It's an audition that wasn't
supposed to happen.</i>

786
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,281
I guess we're taking
a leap of faith with you today.

787
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:00,351
<i>It's late afternoon
in galveston,</i>

788
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,365
<i>and, like the hot Texas sun,</i>

789
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:05,178
<i>the Idol dream
is still burning brightly.</i>

790
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,331
I have what it takes
to be the next American Idol.

791
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,832
And I'm ready to be big.

792
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:11,769
I'm here to be
the next American Idol.

793
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,357
Fact.

794
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:16,496
<i>But for some that golden ticket</i>

795
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:18,659
<i>is gonna be a bit of a stretch.</i>

796
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:22,701
<i>We could have had it all.</i>

797
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:24,049
<i>Yeah.</i>

798
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,693
<i>We're rolling in that deep.</i>

799
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:32,792
<i>You had my heart
inside of your hands.</i>

800
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:34,134
<i>But you played it.</i>

801
00:34:34,203 --> 00:34:36,603
<i>You played it, you played it,</i>

802
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,797
<i>you played it to that beat.</i>

803
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:44,847
I bet you're crazy in...
On the dance floor.

804
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:47,189
Oh, what, Steven?
What, Steven Tyler?

805
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,267
I bet you are crazy
on the dance floor.

806
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:50,840
Yeah.

807
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,352
I didn't like any of it.

808
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:56,295
I thought it was all terrible
and screaming and screechy.

809
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:57,773
<i>Don't you know it?</i>

810
00:34:57,774 --> 00:35:00,313
<i>I heard it through
the grapevine.</i>

811
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,162
<i>Not much longer.</i>

812
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:03,997
<i>Would you be mine.</i>

813
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:06,099
<i>Baby, I heard it.</i>

814
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:07,767
<i>Through the grapevine.</i>

815
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,870
<i>Oh, I'm just about.</i>

816
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:11,338
<i>To lose my mind.</i>

817
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,806
- Me too.
- Honey, honey, yeah.

818
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,885
Oh, my God.

819
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:17,310
Well, then.

820
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:21,145
<i>Undo this hurt you caused.</i>

821
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:23,150
<i>When you walked out the door.</i>

822
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,752
<i>And walked out of my life.</i>

823
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:29,756
<i>Uncry these tears.</i>

824
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:33,852
- Stop it.
- I cried so many nights.

825
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:35,719
Yeah. Sorry, baby.

826
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,035
It's okay. I...

827
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,766
I'm sorry, sweetie.

828
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:41,185
I'm so sorry.

829
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:42,544
Thank you, baby.

830
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,139
What in the hell?

831
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,205
<i>Looks like someone's
getting a little slap happy,</i>

832
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:51,883
<i>so I head in the room
to assess the damage.</i>

833
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,558
What do you think about how
it's gone so far today, Steven?

834
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:58,567
Which is...

835
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:00,992
You know what I'm saying?

836
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,543
What do you think about the
kids that are coming through?

837
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:04,863
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

838
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:10,564
It was down to the last

839
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:14,352
contestant of the day to redeem
the sound of the South.

840
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:15,653
- Hi.
- How you all doing?

841
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:17,239
- Good. How are you?
- Good, good.

842
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,621
- Okay, what's your name?
- Ramiro Garcia.

843
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,551
- Yeah, where are you from?
- Houston, Texas.

844
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:24,623
- And what do you do?
- I'm a worship leader

845
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:25,938
here at a church.

846
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:27,412
- Church...
- Big church?

847
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:29,371
- Yeah. Lakewood church.
- Tell me a little bit

848
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:31,679
- about yourself.
- Growing up, it was really

849
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,227
tough, man,
to be honest with you.

850
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:34,988
I wasn't born normal.

851
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:38,092
I came out a bit different.
I came out with no ears.

852
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:41,885
I had nothing
on my left ear and

853
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:43,788
on the right I just had,
like, an earlobe.

854
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:46,592
Doctors gave
my parents the worst news.

855
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,343
"Your son's not
gonna be able to hear."

856
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:49,870
He's not gonna be able to speak.

857
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,404
"You know, he's gonna be mute."

858
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:53,857
At age four,
I started to have surgeries.

859
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:56,342
They actually had
to create a ear canal.

860
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:59,043
Through there, they were able
to discover that I had, like,

861
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:00,380
an ear drum and there would be.

862
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:02,373
Possibilities that
I would be able to hear.

863
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,407
I remember every year having

864
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:09,732
to go back for another surgery
and for another surgery.

865
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:11,691
It was pretty intense.

866
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,653
It would be surprising
to someone

867
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:17,325
that have known you forever
to hear about this audition,

868
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,984
- really, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

869
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:20,967
Not many people know about that.

870
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:23,255
Luckily, through time
and through faith,

871
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:26,791
I have a voice to speak with,
even a voice to sing.

872
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,183
I can't wait to hear you sing.

873
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:29,513
That's great. That's great.

874
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,944
Nice.

875
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,147
<i>Amazing grace.</i>

876
00:37:34,216 --> 00:37:36,950
<i>How sweet the sound.</i>

877
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:40,186
<i>That saved a wretch.</i>

878
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:42,722
<i>Like me.</i>

879
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,991
He sing in another level.

880
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,894
Different to this world...

881
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:50,546
- For us, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

882
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:52,265
It's a big deal for us.

883
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:54,045
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- Yeah.

884
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:55,802
<i>I see.</i>

885
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,905
<i>My chains are gone.</i>

886
00:37:58,974 --> 00:38:01,875
<i>I've been set free.</i>

887
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:05,312
<i>My God, my savior.</i>

888
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,948
<i>Has ransomed me.</i>

889
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:11,685
<i>And like a flood.</i>

890
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:14,154
<i>His mercy rains.</i>

891
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:17,457
<i>Unending love.</i>

892
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:20,527
<i>Amazing grace.</i>

893
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:22,771
Nice. Glad you sang that verse.

894
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:24,279
- Thank you.
- You know what,

895
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,765
I like what I'm hearing.

896
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,578
I like your insides
as well, man.

897
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,722
- Thank you.
- Let's hope he's got a ticket

898
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:32,339
when he comes out there.

899
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,683
Wwell, I know he's
the best for me.

900
00:38:35,377 --> 00:38:36,677
Good.

901
00:38:36,678 --> 00:38:39,531
You're a power of example,
to say the least.

902
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:41,057
- Yeah.
- And you can sing so,

903
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:42,997
I'm happy with you, man.

904
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:44,298
So you say yes?

905
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:46,402
- I say yes.
- What do you say, Randy?

906
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:49,747
I love what you said, "that
I'm used to being the underdog",

907
00:38:49,748 --> 00:38:51,048
because I'm hopeful, man.

908
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:52,789
- I'm just hopeful.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

909
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,270
- You know what I'm saying?
- I guess

910
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:56,763
we're taking a leap
of faith with you today.

911
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:09,350
It's all right.

912
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:11,267
You can get emotional.
It's okay.

913
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,197
Don't you worry about it.

914
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:24,911
This golden ticket is for
my family, for my mom.

915
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:30,220
Here's the proof now that I can.

916
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:31,749
Make it and I can fight through

917
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,292
and I can be
a part of this thing.

918
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:35,847
Your father is very
proud back there.

919
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:37,871
As he should be.

920
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:41,401
I remember when
the doctors say...

921
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:44,085
He no speak.

922
00:39:44,086 --> 00:39:45,386
He's not well.

923
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:46,687
He no hear.

924
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,988
Guess what?

925
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,790
- I'm happy now.
- We're grateful.

926
00:39:49,985 --> 00:39:51,893
Congratulations.
Thank you, guys.

927
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:53,878
Good job, my man.

928
00:39:58,092 --> 00:39:59,849
Bye-bye. Thank you.

929
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,023
<i>With his family by his side,</i>

930
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,356
<i>it's an emotional
victory for ramiro...</i>

931
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:08,813
<i>And it was shared by 24
other hopefuls in Houston.</i>

932
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:10,247
You are going to Hollywood!

933
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,133
Welcome to Hollywood!

934
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:13,640
Hollywood!

935
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,708
We're going to Hollywood!

936
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:19,935
And with that the curtain closes
on our auditions in Texas.

937
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:21,236
I believe it's a wrap.

938
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:22,827
Good thing going,
for real, today.

939
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:24,795
Better than I expected,
actually.

940
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:26,233
Go cool off and celebrate.

941
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:27,679
Go for it.

942
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,591
I actually was kidding.

943
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,117
I didn't think they'd do it.

944
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:41,835
Oh! God!

945
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:45,438
You know what they say.

946
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:49,614
Don't sweat the petty things
and don't pet the sweaty things.

947
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:52,269
I can't see.

948
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:56,382
<i>Next week, we head
to the pacific northwest.</i>

949
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:58,084
Welcome to Portland!

950
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,352
<i>It's a shocking
night of auditions...</i>

951
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,361
Man, I'm feeling you right now.

952
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:05,859
<i>In the city of roses.</i>

953
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:07,302
I loved that.

954
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:10,377
<i>And for some, it's been
a journey against all odds.</i>

955
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:11,848
I saw so many people perish.

956
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:13,316
You're gonna be good, I feel.

957
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:16,393
There's a different type
of love that I feel now.

958
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:17,727
You've got that gift.

959
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:21,011
<i>It's an inspirational evening
you won't wanna miss.</i>

960
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,317
Nothing is gonna stop me.

961
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:25,875
They call me
tripster the hipster.
