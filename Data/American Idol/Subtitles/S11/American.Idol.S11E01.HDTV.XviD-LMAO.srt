Kelly Clarkson.

7
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,213
-Hi.
-Come on in here.

8
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:41,916
American idol has been in my life
since I was about six years old.

9
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:43,518
Hello. How are you?

10
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,512
I've been watching it since the
first season, and I've been

11
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:58,883
dreaming about being on the
show ever since Kelly Clarkson.

12
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:00,385
When I was six years old, I used
to stand in front of the TV

13
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:02,654
and act like I was the next
American idol.

14
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,226
We've been watching <i>American
idol since the very</i>

15
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:10,028
first season, and it's just
always been a dream.

16
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:11,629
Yeah.

17
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:15,667
I've been looking forward to
this moment for so long.

18
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:19,604
It's what I've been waiting
my whole life to do.

19
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:31,900
You get one shot at fame,
and that shot starts today.

20
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:37,572
And after 10 years, the phenomenon
continues with another incredible journey.

21
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:39,540
This could change my life.

22
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,441
Forever.

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,543
As new voices prepare for

24
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:46,147
the biggest musical platform
the country has ever seen.

25
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,249
This is the singing show.

26
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:49,450
This is the one that started it.

27
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,021
There is only one place where
you can make your dreams come true.

28
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:57,592
<i> American idol's like the icon
of American society.</i>

29
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,896
This is... <i> All: American idol.</i>

30
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:03,865
<i> There you go.</i>

31
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:05,833
<i>Time to start the process.</i>

32
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:08,202
<i>Who's fired up?</i>

33
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:10,471
<i>We'll be sharing this adventure
<i>together.</i>

34
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,458
<i> American idol, here we come.</i>

35
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:16,961
I'm just ready to get out
there and, like, chase my dream.

36
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,347
And, this year, the
contestants are going to help us

37
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,750
tell their story
through their own eyes.

38
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:28,189
Wish me the best of luck as I document
my journey to <i>American idol.</i>

39
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:29,257
<i> It's gonna be a great year.</i>

40
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,426
<i> I loved that idol last year
took it over the top.</i>

41
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,761
After going through last season

42
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,465
and looking at the talent this
year, I'm beside myself.

43
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,866
I loved it.

44
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,202
I'm so happy to be back
with Randy and Steven.

45
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,804
They're like my family now.

46
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,639
It's a new beginning, baby.

47
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,840
Season 1-1.

48
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,775
Freshest, hottest show ever.

49
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:48,876
Let's go.

50
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,511
Let's make some history.

51
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,815
Jennifer, Randy, and Steven
are back to find

52
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,800
the best of
America's undiscovered talent,

53
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:59,737
and the decade of preparation
has really paid off.

54
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,972
Hey, hold on.

55
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,974
It's gonna be quite a ride.

56
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,313
Do this.

57
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,215
My God, I think I just had
an ear-gasm.

58
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:13,651
Dude, I love you.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
There's nobody singing like
her out there.

60
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,455
Ooh, I love that.
Yes!

61
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:18,990
Yes!
Yes.

62
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:20,992
You're going to Hollywood.

63
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,601
That is hot.
Yes!

64
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,438
You know you're gonna be
a star, right?

65
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:38,876
I think America's gonna so
fall in love with you.

66
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:41,546
I'm scared, but, at the same
time I know this is what I want.

67
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:44,148
This is my saving grace.

68
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,851
This just-this is everything
to me.

69
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,120
But you know what?
You don't give up.

70
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:50,488
I know I can do this.

71
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,824
Please. I'm begging you.

72
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:56,861
I fell on my face a lot of times
and completely gave up on music.

73
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,932
No matter what happens, neve3r
stop believing in yourself.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,604
'Cause we'll never stop
believing in you.

75
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:45,376
It's our very first time in
Savannah, Georgia.

76
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:49,047
Across the country, thousands
of hopefuls are waking up to

77
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,316
what could be the biggest day
of their life.

78
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,951
<i> It's American idol time.</i>

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,387
This marks the start of
their epic journey.

80
00:04:57,123 --> 00:05:02,260
We're Savannah-bound.

81
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:03,427
Here we go.

82
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,530
I'm 26 miles from my dream.

83
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,865
Hello, Savannah.

84
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,268
6:00 in the morning sucks.

85
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,470
Are you ready for today?
Today's a big day.

86
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,604
Absolutely.

87
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:17,041
Because today is the day that
dreams are realized.

88
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:25,650
However, 12,000 others are
chasing that same goal.

89
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:29,253
Auditions begin right now.
Let's go.

90
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:33,991
This town is known for its
laid-back attitude.

91
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,127
And Randy definitely got
the memo.

92
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:37,428
Savannah, Georgia.

93
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:39,430
This is the jump-off right here.

94
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,898
Season 1-1.

95
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:41,999
Hi, guys.

96
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:46,671
I always have high hopes that today
is the day that we find the one.

97
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:48,306
You never know.

98
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:49,006
Good morning.

99
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:50,474
How's Savannah treating you?

100
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:55,847
Oh, Savannah's treating me great
but I didn't know you knew her.

101
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:57,849
What's up, everybody?

102
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,651
The crowd was pumped and ready
for its shot.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,788
Come on. Let's go.

104
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,256
Let's hit it.
First day of school.

105
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,792
Savannah, Georgia.
First day.

106
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:10,261
We're back.
I can't stand the heat.

107
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,329
A new beginning.

108
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:14,131
<i>Season 1-1, idol, a new
beginning.</i>

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,070
If a 16-year-old from north Carolina
<i>can win American idol...</i>

110
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,838
<i>I could do that.</i>

111
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:23,741
<i>So we are officially ready to
<i>write another chapter.</i>

112
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,577
<i>And Scotty has left some pretty
<i>big shoes to fill.</i>

113
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,412
<i>But our first contestant might</i>

114
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:31,048
<i>be able to walk all over the
<i>competition.</i>

115
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,083
<i> My name's David leathers Jr.,</i>

116
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,653
<i>and I'm 17 years old, from
<i>fayetteville, north Carolina.</i>

117
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:37,622
<i>My friends call me
<i>Mr. steal your girl."</i>

118
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,227
<i> People say I'm somewhat of
<i>a ladies' man.</i>

119
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,330
<i>That's cool, because I'm always
<i>talking to the girls.</i>

120
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,598
<i>And girls love me.</i>

121
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,566
<i>What's your name?</i>

122
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:50,234
<i> My name? Fatia.
<i>What's yours?</i>

123
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:52,069
<i> I'm David.</i>

124
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,371
<i>How old are you?</i>

125
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,505
<i> Doesn't matter.</i>

126
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:59,310
<i> Oh, age ain't nothing but
<i>a number, but...</i>

127
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:10,021
<i> I don't really have an
<i>exclusive girlfriend right now.</i>

128
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,756
<i>Couple of years ago, I just so
happened to be</i>

129
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:15,660
in a local
<i>contest with Scotty mccreery.</i>

130
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,428
<i>And we both placed first and
<i>second.</i>

131
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,330
<i> Well, who was better, you or
<i>Scotty?</i>

132
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,200
<i> Well, it was a tough
<i>competition, but I came out on top.</i>

133
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,969
<i> You beat Scotty?</i>

134
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,337
<i>Dave?</i>

135
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:29,874
<i>Did you beat Scotty?</i>

136
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:31,375
<i> I guess you could say that.
<i>You could say that.</i>

137
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,377
<i> Oh, this is gonna be good.</i>

138
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:34,979
<i>No pressure going in there, my
<i>man.</i>

139
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:36,914
<i>Now are you gonna...</i>

140
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,083
<i>Wait, that's the sound of the
<i>audition bell.</i>

141
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,718
<i>I was gonna ask you if you were
<i>gonna leave the glasses on, but</i>

142
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:45,723
<i>we're out of time.
<i>Get in there.<i>Good luck.</i>

143
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:46,891
<i> Who's going first?</i>

144
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,093
<i>Hey!
<i> Dude, David, what's up, man?</i>

145
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,428
<i> Look at this.
<i> Oh, here he is.</i>

146
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:51,929
<i> I'm good. I'm doing good.
<i>How about yourself?</i>

147
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,431
<i> How old are you, bro?
<i> I'm 17.</i>

148
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:56,033
<i> Where you from?
<i> Fayetteville, north Carolina.</i>

149
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,368
<i> Fayetteville, 17.</i>

150
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:59,337
<i>So I assume you're in high
school.</i>

151
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:00,171
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

152
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,039
<i>I know it may not look like it,
<i>but it's my senior year.</i>

153
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,841
<i> You do look very young.
<i>You look like you're 12.</i>

154
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,509
<i> Yeah, I know, right?</i>

155
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,378
<i>Well, you have any nicknames
<i>they call you?</i>

156
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:11,182
<i> Uh, some of my friends call

157
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,217
<i> What? You steal girls?</i>

158
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,286
<i> Just like, when I sing, all</i>

159
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:17,321
<i>the girls just like, "David,

Well, yo, listen, I mean, should
we make this, like, really simple?

197
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:53,717
Both: Yes.

198
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,252
Like, I mean, really easy?

199
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,822
One, two, three.

200
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,290
All: Yes!

201
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,225
Yes.

202
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,426
Let's go, David leathers.

203
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,428
Dude.

204
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:06,430
We love you, man.
You're going to Hollywood.

205
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,599
You're going to Hollywood,
dawg. You made it.

206
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:12,169
You're gonna go where
Scotty mccreery went, dude.

207
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,371
We'll see you in Hollywood.

208
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,741
Wow. Wow.
Yay! Good start.

209
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,144
Thank you for a decent
breakfast.

210
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:23,514
That was nice.
Very impressive.

211
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,685
A ticket to Hollywood would
be a dream come true.

212
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,624
Wow, he sings super high.
That was beautiful.

213
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:35,693
Yes.
All right.

214
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,894
All right, yes.

215
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,334
Are we having fun yet?

216
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,086
Come on now.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's keep it going.

217
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,905
Over the next two hours...

218
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,542
Savannah sizzles with fresh,
hot talent.

219
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,444
I'm gonna blow you away.
Wow.

220
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:55,813
I've never seen anything like
that.

221
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:58,115
That is hot.
That's crazy right there.

222
00:10:58,184 --> 00:10:59,216
Thank you, God.

223
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,318
Stop it.

224
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:02,987
But later... what?

225
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:05,656
Everything goes South.

226
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,357
Awful.

227
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:10,861
No!

228
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,529
What's going on?

229
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,215
It's 10:30 A.M. in Savannah.

230
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:26,949
Big day.

231
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:27,650
Big day.

232
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:29,018
<i> Idol's in town today.</i>

233
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,754
Season 11 auditions starting
at the coliseum today.

234
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,891
Over 9,000 people in line.

235
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,060
It's really awesome out
there.

236
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:43,198
And so far season 11 is off
to a sweet start.

237
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,000
God, that makes me feel good.

238
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,838
Backstage, Connecticut native gabi
carrubba hopes to keep the spirits high.

239
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:53,943
Oh, my God. I...
Shaking I'm so nervous.

240
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,713
But this 16-year-old is more than
used to soaking up the spotlight.

241
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:03,519
Besides singing, I'm a champion
tap dancer.

242
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,321
I'm always moving, I'm always
dancing.

243
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,972
I have so much energy.

244
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,776
I've been dancing since I was one
years old in the diaper dancers.

245
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,811
And I haven't been stopping
since.

246
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,046
I've danced every day.

247
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,051
I've been waiting to audition
my whole life.

248
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,204
I've been watching the show since I
was a little kid, since season one.

249
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,922
I'm excited to meet
Ryan seacrest.

250
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,824
Standing by.

251
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,393
That's who I'm really excited
to meet.

252
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:31,563
What's the reaction that you dream
of getting from the judges?

253
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:34,967
Okay, well, Steven Tyler, he
does this thing where, when

254
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,169
he listens to somebody
good, he goes like this.

255
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:43,108
He, like, makes this face.

256
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:52,117
What do you think he sees in his
head when he makes that face?

257
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:53,452
Well, good luck.
Nice to meet you, gabi.

258
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:54,453
Thank you so much.

259
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:55,788
Hello. How are you?

260
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,723
Can I give Nigel a hug really
quick?

261
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,958
You-wait a minute, guys.
Hang on, hang.

262
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:03,595
This girl walks in and she wants
to hug Nigel.

263
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:05,531
What is this about?

264
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,032
I love Nigel.

265
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:08,534
I watch him on
<i>so you think you can dance,</i>

266
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,269

<i> Wait a minute. Hang on.</i>

Thank you so much.

298
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,034
She had one of those natural
voices.

299
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,570

Welcome to Hollywood.

Oh, my goodness.

323
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,042
I'm gonna say yes.
Guess what?

324
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,677
You're going to Hollywood.

325
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,050
You're going to Hollywood.

326
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,652
Hello, Hollywood.

327
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,189
This is a great day for
talent.

328
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:18,690
Amazing, amazing.
What's going on?

329
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,025
Amazing first day in
Savannah, dude.

330
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:20,692
I'm saying.

331
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,694
A lot of young kids too.
15, 16, 17.

332
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:24,463
This is better than you
expected it to be.

333
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:25,864
Way better.
Day one?

334
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,065
First city? Forget about it.

335
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,069
That's right. Hollywood.

336
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:32,537
On a hot streak this morning.

337
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:36,174
Every single person that's come in has
gotten a yes and a golden ticket.

338
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:38,877
One of the best starts we've
ever had on th show.

339
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:41,413
And our next contestant might
just have the credentials to

340
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,248
keep the momentum going.

341
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:47,486
I'm Jessica whiteley, and I'm 19 years
old, and I'm from cuyahoga falls, Ohio.

342
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,922
I started singing around,
like, maybe ten years old.

343
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,658
I sing the national anthem a lot
in a lot of basketball games,

344
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,894
football games, and, you know,
the talent show every year.

345
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:57,763
Singing's just everything
I want.

346
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,731
It's all I think about.

347
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,233
Hello.
Hi.

348
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:02,668
How are you?
This is awesome.

349
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:04,169
It looks like I'm looking at
a magazine.

350
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:06,905
I love your hat, by the way,
Steven.

351
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,307
Beautiful. Thanks.

352
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,675
What's your name?
Give us your whole name.

353
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:10,375
I'm Jessica whiteley.

354
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:11,043
Whiteley.

355
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:11,843
And you are how old?

356
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:12,678
I'm 19.

357
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:13,478
And you're from?

358
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,580
Cuyahoga falls, Ohio.
Okay.

359
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:16,448
12 hours away.

360
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:19,017
Well, we've had a really good
run this morning.

361
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:20,619
You ready?
I am ready.

362
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:21,453
What are you gonna sing?

363
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:23,121

381
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,284
<i>I don't even know if I would

382
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:29,554
<i>It's just not...
<i>Baby, this is not your vibe.</i>

383
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:30,922
<i>This is not your groove right

00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:31,790

387
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:38,830
<i> Can I sing you another song?</i>

388
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,499
<i> No!</i>

389
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,135
<i> Do people say that you can

390
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,202
<i>I mean, what happened?</i>

391
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,971
<i> Yeah, I think I'm just
<i>a little dehydrated.</i>

392
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,205
<i>I'm not gonna complain.</i>

393
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:48,907

<i> Okay, so we're sorry.</i>

397
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:53,378
<i> It was not remotely good
<i>today.</i>

398
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:54,980
<i> It's a no, sweetie.
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

399
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:55,680
<i> Okay.</i>

400
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,049
<i>We'll see you in Texas then.</i>

401
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:57,716
<i> Both: Okay.</i>

402
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,918
<i> All right, nice to meet you.</i>

403
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:01,686
<i> Did she say see you in Texas?</i>

404
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:04,523
<i>Is she coming to audition in Texas too?</i>

405
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,592
<i> Oh, no. Oh, no!</i>

406
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:10,862
<i>Can we say no?</i>

407
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:11,663
<i>Don't come to Texas, please.</i>

408
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:13,732
<i> We should tell her not to

409
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,300
<i> Steven's going, "oh, no!"</i>

410
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,070
<i> You guys are gonna see me
<i>in Texas, so get ready.</i>

411
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,037
<i>'Cause I'm coming back.</i>

412
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:21,006
<i> We'll look forward to that.</i>

413
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,875
<i>But before Jessica leaves us
in Savannah, let's hear how</i>

414
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:26,878

<i>the competition heats up.</i>

421
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:45,764
<i> Fire.</i>

422
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,232
<i> And Savannah explodes...</i>

423
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:50,735
<i> With more incredible voices.</i>

424
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,105
<i> You're going to Hollywood!</i>

425
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,343
All: Welcome back to
American idol!

426
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:11,313
<i> Nowadays, it's hard to
keep the same gig forever.</i>

427
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:12,047
<i>All right.</i>

428
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:12,981
<i>And after 11 seasons of</i>

429
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,818
<i>practice, it seemed many were
<i>gunning for my job.</i>

430
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:21,289
My name is Ryan seacrest,
and this is American idol!

431
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:22,124
<i> Knock, knock.</i>

432
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:22,824
<i> Who's there?</i>

433
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:23,625
<i> Next.</i>

434
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:24,526
<i> Next?</i>

435
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:26,027
<i> Next who?</i>

436
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:28,430
<i> I know.</i>

437
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:29,998
<i> Next who?</i>

438
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:33,101
<i> Next on American idol.</i>

439
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,136
<i> Ready? Big.</i>

440
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,937
<i>Big right to that camera.</i>

441
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:38,540
<i> This is American idol.</i>

442
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,942
<i> Nice job.</i>

443
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,079
<i>But one contestant who showed
<i>up in Savannah</i>

444
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,514
<i>was taking it
to the next level.</i>

445
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:46,348
<i>What's your name?</i>

446
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,949
<i> I'm Sean.</i>

447
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:48,717
<i> Hey, Sean.</i>

448
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:49,584
<i> Nice to meet you, Ryan.</i>

449
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:50,986
<i> Nice to meet you, buddy.</i>

450
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:54,256
<i>People tell me all the time
I look like Ryan seacrest.</i>

451
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:57,592
<i>And they ask me if I try to look
like him, and I don't have</i>

452
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:58,727
<i>a great answer for it.</i>

453
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:01,062
<i>I do my hair like this every
<i>single day.</i>

454
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:03,365
<i> Well, you dressed like a
<i>host.</i>

455
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:07,636
<i> Yes, I dress like my
<i>inspiration Mr. Ryan seacrest.</i>

456
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:09,704
<i>Hi, how you doing? Hi.</i>

457
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:11,306
<i>You may actually be better than
<i>the original.</i>

458
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,073
<i> No, no.</i>

459
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:13,775
<i>No one's better than
<i>the original.</i>

460
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:16,711
<i>If you wanna text the word vote
<i>to 866-idol-05.</i>

461
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,712
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

462
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:18,380
<i> Well, thank you so much.</i>

463
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:19,147
<i> We'll be here on the other</i>

464
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,749
<i>side, hoping to see that golden
<i>ticket.</i>

465
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:22,818
<i>The results are in.
<i>Dim the lights.</i>

466
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:23,952
<i>Here we go.</i>

467
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:28,390
<i>This... this... this... this...
This...Is American idol!</i>

468
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,758
<i>Let's go!</i>

469
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:31,092
<i> Okay, buddy.</i>

470
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:31,893
<i>How old are you?</i>

471
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:32,627
<i> 26.</i>

472
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:33,528
<i> Exactly.</i>

473
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:35,597
<i>Twins.</i>

474
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,832
<i> Hi.</i>

475
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,767
<i>How are you?</i>

476
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:39,568
<i>What's your name?</i>

477
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:40,335
<i> Sean.</i>

478
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:42,370
<i> Sean?
<i> Yes.</i>

479
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,672
<i> Sean what? What?</i>

480
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,674
<i> Who do people say you look
<i>like?</i>

481
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:48,043
<i> Sometimes I get
<i>Ryan seacrest.</i>

482
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,211
<i> Say it again. Say it again.</i>

483
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,378
<i> Ryan seacrest.</i>

484
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:52,080
<i> Very-you sound just like
<i>him.</i>

485
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:53,415
<i> Thank you.
<i> Wow.</i>

486
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:54,316
<i> Thank you, it's a compliment.</i>

487
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:55,650
<i>Definitely a compliment.
<i> I guess.</i>

488
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,486
<i> Ryan's an inspiration for me.</i>

489
00:21:57,554 --> 00:21:59,754
<i> Do you-oh.</i>

490
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:02,257
<i> Keep going.</i>

491
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:03,258
<i> This is weird!</i>

492
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:04,459
<i> This completes the look.</i>

493
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:06,528
<i> Wait a minute, Ryan.</i>

494
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:07,762
<i>Wait a minute, stay right there.</i>

495
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:09,464
<i>Stay right there.</i>

496
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:12,133
<i>When I say who do you look
like, what do you say?</i>

497
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,502
<i> Ryan seacrest.</i>

498
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,336
<i> I say Sean.</i>

499
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:15,804
<i>Sean crissman.</i>

500
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,339
<i> Ryan seacrest.</i>

501
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,607
<i> Do it again.</i>

502
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,442
<i> Here, why don't you go-
go through the whole-</i>

503
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:21,109
<i>no, no, take the cards.</i>

504
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:22,878
<i> You guys look weird together,
<i>Ryan.</i>

505
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:24,246
<i> You're dressed for the
<i>finale, so here we are.</i>

506
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:25,947
<i>It's the moment you're about to
<i>announce the winner.</i>

507
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:26,615
<i> Okay.</i>

508
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:28,149
<i> I like "the votes are in,
<i>dim the lights."</i>

509
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,118
<i>Go for that one-3, 2, 1.</i>

510
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,019
<i> We're taking requests.</i>

511
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:33,622
<i> The results are in.
<i>Dim the lights.<i>Here we go.</i>

512
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,790
<i>This is American idol!</i>

513
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:36,458
<i>Let's go!</i>

514
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,026
<i> Oh! Nice job!</i>

515
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,694
<i>Yo, listen, you know what?</i>

516
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:41,263
<i> You're making it look too

519
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,769

520
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:49,070
<i> Oh! Got the job!</i>

521
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:50,438
<i> All right, back to

522
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,239
<i>Back to the singing.</i>

523
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:53,308
<i> Hire this man.</i>

524
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:56,144
<i> And what are you gonna sing

525
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,179
<i> I'd like to do oh girl

526
00:22:58,248 --> 00:22:58,847

Okay.

536
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:33,081
I would've liked it better if you sung
it like Ryan seacrest, though, actually.

537
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,549
I wonder what Ryan sounds like
singing.

538
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:35,417
I always wondered.

539
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,252
I always wondered if he sang
too.

540
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:39,821
He's very comfortable in
front of the camera.

541
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,025
He gets that from you.
Well- as a singer, no, man.

542
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:49,664
But personality you brought in
here is over the top.

543
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,935
No.

544
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,470
Brother.

545
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:56,871
But you know what they did
say?

546
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,740
They said yes to Ryan.

547
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,609
They did give me the yes for
that, but not singing.

548
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:03,411
I don't know if that's a good thing
or- oh, I'm gonna take it as

549
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,114
good, 'cause the other news
wasn't any good.

550
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:07,949
He looks just like Ryan.

551
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:09,517
Nice to meet you, buddy.
Good luck!

552
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:13,388
See you next time
on American idol

553
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:17,592
it turns out discovering the next American
idol is turning into a tall order.

554
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,696
Something 15-year-old
Shannon magrane knows all about.

555
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:22,497
How are you?

556
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:23,632
Good, how are you?

557
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,966
Good, what's your name?

558
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,135
My name's Shannon.
Shannon magrane.

559
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:27,936
How old are you?

560
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:29,070
I'm 15 years old.

561
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,839
You're 15?
You're 15?

562
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:34,376
6 foot tall, size 11 shoe.

563
00:24:34,444 --> 00:24:35,543
Wow.

564
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:37,545
Okay, tell us about yourself
a little bit.

565
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:39,381
Well, actually I am
a volleyball player.

566
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:41,783
I'm a middle hitter.

567
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:42,684
How'd you get into sports?

568
00:24:42,753 --> 00:24:44,085
I mean, is your family into
sports?

569
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:48,356
Yes, my dad is actually- he was a
pitcher in the world series, 1987.

570
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:49,691
Wow!

571
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,626
What's his name?
Joe magrane.

572
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:54,429
Wow. Get down, dude.
For what team?

573
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:55,797
Um, cardinals.

574
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,065
St. Louis cardinals. Nice.

575
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,533
We're gonna have to meet them
in a minute.

576
00:24:58,602 --> 00:24:59,200
Yeah, man.

577
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:00,769
Yes, can I bring them in to you?

578
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,003
Okay. Go get 'em.

579
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:02,904
You know.

580
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:04,205
Oh, my God, can I really?

581
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:05,674
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:09,878
Sister?

583
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:11,780
This is my sister.

584
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:13,281
Rest of my family.

585
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:14,716
Mommy?

586
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:15,450
This is my mama.

587
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,217
Mom, hi.

588
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:17,752
This looks like my family.

589
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:19,087
All girls and the dad.

590
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,890
One guy.

591
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,024
Dude, world series!

592
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:24,726
World series!

593
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:25,493
World series!

594
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,595
No, still the world series at
all.

595
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:29,297
Aren't you lucky with
all these girls, huh?

596
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,031
That's right.

597
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,732
Yeah.

598
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:31,466
How's things in b-town?

599
00:25:31,535 --> 00:25:32,834
Oh, great. Beautiful.

600
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,569
Hot, humid, and happenin'.

601
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:35,603
Absolutely.

602
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:37,205
Yeah, just like your
daughter.

603
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:42,610
Ri-ight.

604
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,079
What a beautiful family.

605
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:45,447
All righty, what are you gonna
sing?

606
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:47,682
All right, I have
<i>something's got a hold on me by etta James.</i>

607
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:48,616

We were, like, vibing and
rolling with that one.

630
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,481
Um, so, mom, you were singing
every word.

631
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,382
Are you a singer?

632
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,150
I'm not.

633
00:26:55,218 --> 00:27:00,088
But I hear it, and I have to turn it
down-it ricochets throughout the house.

634
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:03,324
Dude, you were cool with your
family-no nerves.

635
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:04,559
And you were ready to go.

636
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:07,729
Nerves of steel at 15 with your
mom and dad and all your friends.

637
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:08,429
That is hot.

638
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:09,764
That's crazy right there.

639
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:11,800
Nerves of steel this girl.

640
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:12,467
Yeah.

641
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:15,503
To not care enough where your voice
has to come out, that's the secret.

642
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:16,971
And that's what you did.

643
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,007
Shall we vote?
I say yes.

644
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:19,841
I say yes too.

645
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,476
I say yes too-three yeses!

646
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:24,479
You're going to Hollywood!

647
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:32,654
Dad, you gotta come and
help out the Dodgers, dude.

648
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:36,090
Can't happen soon enough.

649
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:36,958
Thank you!

650
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:38,459
Great meeting you.
It was so nice to meet you.

651
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:39,127
Good luck, Shannon.

652
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:39,794
Thank you.

653
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:40,461
Bye-bye.

654
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,830
Wow, to have such a family like that.

655
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:42,931
That's a great family.

656
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:44,999
That's a good family right
there.

657
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:59,514
Coming up, Savannah wows us
with their talent... ♪ so far ♪

658
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,015
And one inspiring story.

659
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:02,116
I live in a tent.

660
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,451
Wow.

661
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,489
Expectations continue to be shattered
as it's midday in the garden of good...

662
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:09,991
Nice, beautiful.

663
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,792
And evil.

664
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:25,025
It's high noon in the heart
of Savannah.

665
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:29,096
In the South, we don't sing.
We sang!

666
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,531
That's right!

667
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,498
I love this day.

668
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:32,833
Good one, Savannah.

669
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:33,734
Next person, please.

670
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:36,804
But even though Georgia appears
to be on a hot streak,

671
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:39,106
looks can sometimes be
deceiving.

672
00:28:42,044 --> 00:28:44,678
I hope you can sing.

673
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:46,814
Today I'll be singing <i>i

695
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:35,462
<i> Gatlinburg, Tennessee.</i>

696
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,298
<i> Tell us a little bit about
<i>yourself.</i>

697
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,434
<i> I live in a tent in
<i>the woods.</i>

698
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,436
<i> Yes.
<i> You do?</i>

699
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,238
<i> Way out in the middle of
<i>the woods, I live in a tent.</i>

700
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:45,706
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

701
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:47,925
<i> Wow.
<i> Really?</i>

702
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,843
<i> Well, we're kinda struggling.</i>

703
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:50,994
<i>Major struggling.</i>

704
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:54,882
<i>Can't afford like a $100-a-week
hotel room, you know?</i>

705
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:03,290
<i>The only thing we can do is
live in a tent in the woods.</i>

706
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:05,792
<i>Welcome...To our humble home.</i>

707
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,745
<i>Come on, we'll show you around.</i>

708
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:09,413
<i>This is where the magic happens,
<i>guys.</i>

709
00:30:09,498 --> 00:30:12,666
<i>Right there, you know.</i>

710
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:16,253
<i>We cook our soup over the fire
<i>pit...Yes.</i>

711
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:17,404
<i>And we enjoy it.</i>

712
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:18,856
<i>This is the closet.</i>

713
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,258
<i>Emergency tarp.</i>

714
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:22,276
<i>And this is our bathroom.</i>

715
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:23,277
<i> Bathroom area.</i>

716
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:24,311
<i>All this way-bathroom.</i>

717
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:26,296
<i> All this way.</i>

718
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,187
<i> Blake is awesome.</i>

719
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:36,774
<i>I've never been treated so good
by anybody in my entire life.</i>

720
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,076
<i>I didn't think I could ever
<i>be treated good.</i>

721
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:41,011
<i>Then he came along.</i>

722
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,848
<i>He is working every single day,
and even on the weekends he does</i>

723
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,734
<i>side jobs and stuff like that
just to try to come up with</i>

724
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:49,586
<i>enough money for food, gas.</i>

725
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:52,456
<i>The necessities.</i>

726
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,573
<i>That's it.</i>

727
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:57,110
<i>And just work hard to try to
<i>get out of it.</i>

728
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:03,500
<i>Try to get out of the tent.</i>

729
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:05,252
<i> And times are tough out
there, so it's been-</i>

730
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,787
<i> extremely tough.
<i>That's why I live in a tent.</i>

731
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,255
<i> That's why you live in the
<i>tent?</i>

732
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:08,989
<i> Yeah.</i>

733
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:10,224
<i>I would rather be outdoors and</i>

734
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:13,527
<i>happy than indoors and
<i>miserable.</i>

735
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:14,461
<i> Good.</i>

736
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,931
<i> My boyfriend's mother- she
fixed up this little dress</i>

737
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,735
<i>and earrings and necklace and
shoes and the whole nine.</i>

738
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:26,373
<i>I've never been dressed this
<i>nice before in my entire life.</i>

739
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:29,009
<i>I have had a lot of blessings
that I had to learn in life</i>

740
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:32,579
<i>to get to where I'm at mentally.</i>

741
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:33,580
<i>I mean, if there's any perfect</i>

742
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:36,216
<i>time for me to be doing this,
<i>it's now.</i>

743
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,518
<i> Should we do some singing?</i>

744
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:38,919
<i> We should.
<i> What song?</i>

745
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:41,155
<i> I'm gonna sing superwoman

<i>The roughness.
<i> Raspy.</i>

762
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:33,807
<i> It gets pretty there...
<i> I like that.</i>

763
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:35,742
<i> When you open up like that.</i>

764
00:32:35,811 --> 00:32:37,077

<i> Hell yeah.

768
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:46,353
<i> You're hipsy.</i>

769
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,121
<i> A hipsy-I like that hipsy.</i>

770
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,291
<i> I'm a hipsy.</i>

771
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,059
<i> All right, let's vote.</i>

772
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:52,860
<i>What do you think, Steven?</i>

773
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:56,296
<i> I think so positively yes.</i>

774

<i> What a story!
<i>What a story!</i>

00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:06,573
<i> Hey, can I pitch a tent

780
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:08,709
<i> If that's where you feel

781
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:10,244

<i> That is wonderful.
<i> Special voice.</i>

788
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:28,095
<i> I like that word hipsy,

789
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:28,762
<i> She is a hipsy.</i>

<i> Up next, can this 15-year-old</i>

<i> I've never done something

806
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:06,366
<i> I'm gonna say no, not yet.</i>

807
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:09,603
<i> And with a trip to Hollywood
on the line, which contestants</i>

808
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,005
<i>will be ready to seize their

809
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:15,309
<i> Let's do this!</i>

00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,556
<i> All: Welcome back to idol,

811
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:31,127
<i> Nice work, fellas.</i>

812
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,996
<i>Hanging out in Georgia, we
thought we'd met every brand</i>

813
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:35,665
<i>of good ol' country boy.</i>

814
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,033
<i> We like our shrimp and grits,</i>

815

816
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,939

00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,007
<i> I'm here to audition today

Wow.

Okay, then.

877
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,546
Um, should we hear one more,
Steven?

878
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:06,682
What are we thinking?

879
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:09,118
You have -you ran out of
breath?

880
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,820
Yeah, no, it's all good.

881
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:13,689
You know what, you're sweet
and you're cute and-

882
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:15,624
oh, my God, Jennifer Lopez
just told me I'm cute.

883
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,361
I don't know that
the voice is really up to par

884
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:21,397
with what we're doing this year.

885
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:25,134
But you know, you have all those
other things going for you.

886
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,503
I'm gonna sing-
let me sing something else.

887
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:29,505
No, no, no, no.
Please. No, no.

888
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:30,306
Steven, what do you think?

889
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,474
What do you think, Steven?

890
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:32,274
I agree with her.

891
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:36,245
The voice just ain't there, man.

892
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:37,413

I'm just gonna help you out.
I'm gonna help you out.

896
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,258
I mean, really? Right.
Me and you, right.

897
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:50,960
Terrible.

898
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:53,229
Nice to sing at birthday
parties, weddings, friends.

899
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:54,530
I wouldn't.

900
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,664
The bar's so high this year.

901
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,134
I mean, dude.
Singing-no, dude.

902
00:37:58,202 --> 00:38:01,670
No, no, no, no.

903
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:02,938
But good luck to you.

904
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:03,706
Thank you.

905
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:08,110
Good luck, man, thank you.

906
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:16,752
Please don't cry.

907
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:19,588
It's all right, Josh.

908
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:20,923
Don't worry about it, man.

909
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:23,359
Please don't cry.

910
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,027
Don't cry.

911
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:25,761
I always get worried when they say

912
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,030
"I sound like
Brad paisley or Chris Daughtry."

913
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:29,365
I'm like...Eek!

914
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,367
That's when you know they
sound nothing like them.

915
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:32,635
Exactly.

916
00:38:32,703 --> 00:38:36,639
That's a clear sign.

917
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:37,440
Get out of my face.

918
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:38,974
I just wanna be alone.

919
00:38:39,043 --> 00:38:40,042
Seriously, get out of my face.

920
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,444
I don't wanna talk to y'all.

921
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:45,047
Don't get mad now.

922
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:48,551
I didn't make it.

923
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,120
I didn't make it, it sucks.

924
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:52,922
Would you stop following me?

925
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,225
Get your [Bleep] back in there
and do your [Bleep] job!

926
00:38:56,294 --> 00:39:00,096
I just had a little hissy fit
outside.

927
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:05,034
While Joshua heads home to finish his
hissy fit, backstage the pressure has

928
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:08,070
pushed the contestants' nerves
to the edge.

929
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:12,775
None more so than the 15-year-old
about to step into the room.

930
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:14,176
Oh, my gosh.

931
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:18,647
I've never done something
this big before.

932
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:20,749
Stephanie Renee.

933
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,017
I got it.

934
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:22,885
Bring it on!

935
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:26,989
For Stephanie, this moment has been
nearly a decade in the making.

936
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:31,560
When I was eight, I watched
<i>American idol all the time.</i>

937
00:39:31,629 --> 00:39:33,462
My favorite one was
Carrie Underwood.

938
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,364
I loved her.

939
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,266
She's inspired me so much.

940
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:41,103
My mom has pictures of me next
to a TV with a shirt that

941
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,972
says I'm the next American idol.

942
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,106
Hey! Where are we going?

943
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:45,441
<i> American idol!</i>

944
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,876
<i>It's what every girl dreams of.</i>

945
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,712
<i>Just to be on American idol.</i>

946
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,648
<i>I want a golden ticket so bad.</i>

947
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,416
<i>This means so much to me.</i>

948
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,485
<i> Be calm. Don't freak out.</i>

949
00:39:56,554 --> 00:39:57,486
<i> Have fun.</i>

950
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:59,755
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

951
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:01,090
<i> I'm just shocked right now</i>

952
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:05,427
<i>'cause I'm actually living
<i>what's really on TV.</i>

953
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:07,229
<i> Hey, get in here, girl.</i>

954
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:08,564
<i> Hi.
<i> Hi.</i>

955
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:09,565
<i> Hey, sparkly baby.</i>

956
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:10,766
<i> Sparkly.</i>

957
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,268
<i> What's your name, sparkles?</i>

958
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:14,003
<i> My name is Stephanie Renee.</i>

959
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:15,037
<i> Yeah?</i>

960
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:17,773
<i> It's just amazing to be here
<i>right now.</i>

961
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:20,042
<i> Aww, bless you.</i>

962
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:21,610
<i> Oh, bless you.</i>

963
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,378
<i> And how old are you?</i>

964
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:25,314
<i> I'm 15.
<i>I just turned 15 actually.</i>

965
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:26,115
<i> Yeah?</i>

966
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:27,683
<i> So I just slid right in
<i>there.</i>

967
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:28,417
<i> Nice.</i>

968
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:29,518
<i> What are you gonna sing us?</i>

969
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:31,187
<i> I'm gonna sing you, um,</i>

996
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:33,582

00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,316

<i> All right, cool.</i>

1000
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:39,054
<i> And lay on a couple of words

1001
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:40,456
<i>So you get the inflections out.</i>

00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:41,123
<i> All right.</i>

1003
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:41,857
<i> You know what I mean?</i>

1004
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:42,825
<i> Let's take a vote.</i>

1005
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:43,592
<i>Steven, yes or no?</i>

1006
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:44,727
<i> Oh, positively yes.</i>

1007
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,696
<i> Uh, I'm gonna say no, not

1008
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:48,464
<i> Okay.</i>

00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:53,202
<i> It's all on Jennifer.</i>

1010
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:54,570
<i> I'm saying yes too.</i>

1011
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,938
<i> You're going to Hollywood!</i>

1012
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,573
<i> You're going to Hollywood
<i>anyway.</i>

1013
00:41:57,642 --> 00:41:58,774
<i>Two yeses and one no.</i>

1014
00:41:58,843 --> 00:42:00,409
<i>Welcome to Hollywood!</i>

1015
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:08,984
<i> I think she needs some lessons, a
little bit more <i>experience.</i>

1016
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:11,487
<i> No, it was so natural.</i>

1017
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:12,688
<i>She has one bad habit.</i>

1018
00:42:12,757 --> 00:42:13,455
<i> Yeah.</i>

1019
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:14,256
<i> One bad habit.</i>

1020
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:15,224
<i> We'll see-listen, we'll see.</i>

1021
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:17,092
<i>That's why, you know, there's
<i>three of us.</i>

1022
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,327
<i>You guys said yes, I said no.</i>

1023
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:19,895
<i>So you know, she proved me
<i>wrong.</i>

1024
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:21,730
<i> Just to make sure that, you
<i>know, you weren't crazy.</i>

1025
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,699
<i>I'm still
<i>a little crazy.</i>

1026
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:24,366
<i>Come on. A little, man.</i>

1027
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:25,734
<i> That's right, what am I
<i>thinking?</i>

1028
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:27,503
<i> A little bit, come on.
<i>Right, Stevie?</i>

1029
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:29,638
<i> Right, right, right, right.
<i>Next.</i>

1030
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:34,943
<i>I won.</i>

1031
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:36,278
<i>Well, I didn't win!</i>

1032
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,946
<i>But I-I don't know!</i>

1033
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:38,681
<i> Where are you going?</i>

1034
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:41,450
<i> I'm going to Hollywood!</i>

1035
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:51,560
<i> When we come back,</i>

1036
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:55,564
<i>a brother/sister rivalry plays
<i>out on center stage.</i>

1037
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:58,233
<i> You auditioned for us last
<i>year with your brother.</i>

1038
00:42:58,302 --> 00:42:59,702
<i> He's not auditioning this
<i>year.</i>

1039
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,569
<i> What?</i>

1040
00:43:00,638 --> 00:43:02,971
<i>You don't give up.</i>

1041
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:14,151
It's 4:00 P.M. in Savannah, and,
as the day pushes o so do

1042
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,922
the dreams of the thousands who
have come here to audition.

1043
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:21,759
My big sis is the next
American idol!

1044
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:24,662
It always helps when your
siblings are cheering you on.

1045
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,765
But our next contestant,
schyler Dixon, is hoping to

1046
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:31,235
redefine herself, this time
on her own terms.

1047
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:34,138
Colton, my brother, auditioned
with me last year.

1048
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:36,507
You know, I kinda leaned on him
for everything, and, this year,

1049
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,943
I'm just branching off and doing
my own thing.

1050
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,045
She's the one that got me
to audition last year.

1051
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:44,315
I've kind of taken a backseat this
year and let her kinda do her thing.

1052
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:45,983
I'm excited to see what she
does.

1053
00:43:46,052 --> 00:43:47,184
So you are not auditioning?

1054
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:47,985
I am not auditioning.

1055
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:50,788
I'm a little nervous without him,
but I'm definitely excited

1056
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:53,657
to be able to break off and do
my own thing.

1057
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:55,759
I definitely feel like this is
my year.

1058
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,127
I'm in it to win it.

1059
00:43:57,196 --> 00:43:58,729
Both: Hey!

1060
00:43:58,798 --> 00:43:59,396
Hi!

1061
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:00,564
What's going on, man?

1062
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:01,465
How are you?

1063
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:02,566
I've been pretty good.

1064
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:03,367
Yeah?

1065
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:04,735
You auditioned for us last year.

1066
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:06,737
I did, I did with my brother.

1067
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:07,771
With your brother.

1068
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:09,173
Where is he?

1069
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,240
[Whispering] He's out there.

1070
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:12,443
Is he auditioning next?

1071
00:44:12,511 --> 00:44:14,345
No, he's not auditioning
this year.

1072
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:15,012
Yeah, he's out there.

1073
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:16,680
What!
He almost made it.

1074
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:18,482
He could've made it into
the top 12.

1075
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:19,950
We're gonna make you bring him
in here.

1076
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:20,617
Go get him.

1077
00:44:20,686 --> 00:44:21,285
Yeah, go get him.

1078
00:44:21,354 --> 00:44:22,419
Go get him.

1079
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:24,922
I have to go get Colton.

1080
00:44:24,991 --> 00:44:27,257
Come on.

1081
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:28,625
Oh, no.

1082
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:31,628
Having been put on the spot,
you have to wonder if schyler

1083
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:33,464
is willing to share her
spotlight.

1084
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:35,766
Colton!
Dude, come on!

1085
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:37,534
What's up?
What's up, guys?

1086
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:39,870
Dude, come on!
What?

1087
00:44:39,939 --> 00:44:40,704
You're not auditioning?

1088
00:44:40,773 --> 00:44:42,439
You almost made it last year.

1089
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:44,475
I was close, I don't know.

1090
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:46,643
It was hard to go through.

1091
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:48,345
You guys experienced it
first-hand, didn't you?

1092
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:50,347
It was awful for me.

1093
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,016
It was really hard.
It was terrible.

1094
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:54,385
But you know what?
You don't give up.

1095
00:44:54,453 --> 00:44:55,119
Dude, you can't give up.

1096
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:55,819
Oh, no way giving up.

1097
00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:57,021
You were so close.

1098
00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:57,855
You gotta audition again.

1099
00:44:57,923 --> 00:44:58,722
Both of you.

1100
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,224
I remember how good you were
too.

1101
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,992
Come on.

1102
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:03,694
Ah, I don't know.

1103
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:04,595
You're gonna sing.

1104
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:05,696
First your sister's gonna sing.

1105
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:06,630
Ladies first.

1106
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:07,898
Stand over there.

1107
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,866
Come on, Colton.

1108
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:10,734
We're gonna let you get away
that easy, come on.

1109
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:12,569

Come on over here, schyler.

1154
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:05,516
The brother, sister.

1155
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:06,650
Both of you.

1156
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:10,053
You know how I feel about your
voice.

1157
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,823
But you've come up a couple
notches.

1158
00:47:12,892 --> 00:47:14,091
I think you have grown.

1159
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,859
I think you still need to work
hard.

1160
00:47:15,928 --> 00:47:17,861
Again, you're 16, right?

1161
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:18,562
Yeah.

1162
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:19,696
Colton, you're amazing.

1163
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:20,430
Thank you.

1164
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:22,633
I think you both have grown.
It's really funny.

1165
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:23,300
Yeah, he has too.

1166
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:27,304
I think you've grown more, Colton,
into who you really, really wanna be.

1167
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:29,173
You know what makes you
better too?

1168
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:30,440
Pain.

1169
00:47:30,509 --> 00:47:31,909
Exactly.
I agree.

1170
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,044
All right, let's take a vote
here, Steven-yes or no?

1171
00:47:34,113 --> 00:47:36,113
For chutzpah alone, you both
get a yes.

1172
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:37,948
I want you both too.

1173
00:47:38,017 --> 00:47:39,650
And guess what I want.

1174
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:41,451
I'm having both of them!

1175
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,787
They're both going to Hollywood!

1176
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:45,088
Come on!

1177
00:47:45,157 --> 00:47:48,258
Oh, my God.
Yay!

1178
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,428
Did you really think you were
gonna come here- no, he didn't.

1179
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:52,129
Come on, man.

1180
00:47:52,198 --> 00:47:55,532
Did you really think that, man?

1181
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:56,266
He knew.

1182
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,001
I'll hug you when you win.

1183
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:58,769
Okay.

1184
00:47:58,837 --> 00:47:59,703
Come on, man.

1185
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:00,704
Family Dixon.

1186
00:48:00,773 --> 00:48:02,673
Pack a bag!

1187
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:09,079
I- really?

1188
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:15,886
Why are you shaking?

1189
00:48:15,955 --> 00:48:18,522
I have no idea what happened
in there.

1190
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:19,489
We did it!

1191
00:48:19,558 --> 00:48:20,224
We're going to Hollywood!

1192
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,658
Look at this!

1193
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:23,193
She sucked me in again.

1194
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:24,061
Look what she did.

1195
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:27,965
Like it or not, schyler shares
her big moment with Colton.

1196
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:32,302
We'll see how this sibling
rivalry pans out in Hollywood.

1197
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:37,441
After the break... the Savannah auditions
continue to impress the judges

1198
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:39,243
with overwhelming talent.

1199
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:40,477
That was beautiful!

1200
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:41,945
Goosies!

1201
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:45,482
But this journey isn't going
to be easy.

1202
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:48,552
I tried so hard.

1203
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:50,554
Oh, God!

1204
00:48:57,544 --> 00:49:02,213
Day one auditions in Savannah
are coming to a close.

1205
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:07,452
And, while there are many high points,
for some it's been more of a downer.

1206
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,453
I can't sing.

1207
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:17,462
What happened?

1208
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,897
They said I was emotionless.

1209
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:21,866
This ain't the end.

1210
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:24,268
I will continue.

1211
00:49:25,738 --> 00:49:27,738
Stop crying.

1212
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,873
I don't wanna talk.

1213
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:31,476
Oh, baby, I'm gonna say no.

1214
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:35,546
No, no, no.

1215
00:49:35,615 --> 00:49:37,849
♪ I fall to pieces ♪

1216
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:46,157
It's a good thing the next contestant
is in the business of spreading joy.

1217
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:46,991
Hi!

1218
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,859
How are you?

1219
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:49,927
I'm doing good.
How are you all doing?

1220
00:49:49,996 --> 00:49:51,095
Very well. What's your name?

1221
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:52,497
My name is Lauren mink.

1222
00:49:52,565 --> 00:49:53,898
Lauren mink.
Ooh, I like it.

1223
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:55,299
25, and where you from?

1224
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,734
I'm from Winchester,
Kentucky.

1225
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:58,236
Okay, cool.

1226
00:49:58,304 --> 00:49:59,203
And what do you do?

1227
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:02,440
I'm the director for a program
for adults with disabilities.

1228
00:50:02,509 --> 00:50:04,575
That's cool.

1229
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:08,196
My job is pretty much, I think, the
best job imaginable other than singing.

1230
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:09,146
You ready?

1231
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:12,283
I get to work with people with
intellectual disabilities.

1232
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:14,936
They have down syndrome,
autism, and things like that.

1233
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:19,290
And I get to play every day
for a job.

1234
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:24,195
All the people in our program, they are
ages 16- and we have some that are as

1235
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:26,330
old as about 65 years old.

1236
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,716
Are we gonna dance tonight?

1237
00:50:28,801 --> 00:50:30,268
We sure can if you feel like
it.

1238
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:32,019
Are we gonna have hors
d'oeuvres and stuff?

1239
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:33,170
We're gonna have lasagna.

1240
00:50:33,223 --> 00:50:35,873
I've tried to incorporate
some music into it.

1241
00:50:35,942 --> 00:50:38,409
<i>American idol... all: Rocks!</i>

1242

1245
00:50:44,651 --> 00:50:45,983

<i> Coming up, it's a new dawn

1312
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:23,574
<i>And a new day of auditions.</i>

1313
00:53:23,643 --> 00:53:24,809
<i> Next American idol!</i>

1314
00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:28,279
<i> But will the day two contestants
be able to stand <i>the heat?</i>

1315
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:30,648
<i> I'm telling you, dude, you're
gonna get eaten alive.</i>

1316
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:32,349
<i> I promise I'll make you
proud.</i>

1317
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:35,853
<i> Plus, an audition you'll have
<i>to see to believe.</i>

1318
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,689
<i> That's so good.
<i> Super special.</i>

1319
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:51,232
As the sun rises on day two
in Savannah, we have just one

1320
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:53,968
question for this massive crowd.

1321
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:57,305
What is up with this heat?

1322
00:53:57,307 --> 00:53:59,840
All: Everything's hotter
in the South!

1323
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,219
It's blazin' hot down here in
the South.

1324
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,531
Each of our judges arrive...

1325
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,199
In their own time.

1326
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:27,702
Did they lie to me and
get me here early again?

1327
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,704
Here we are once again.

1328
00:54:29,772 --> 00:54:31,806
This is the earliest I've
ever been late.

1329
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:33,841
One just a little more tardy
for the party.

1330
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:34,675
Wow.

1331
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:36,611
Where's Randy?

1332
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:41,315
I feel like we're gonna find some
really hot contestants here today.

1333
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:42,617
I'm still always first.

1334
00:54:42,685 --> 00:54:46,287
I'm waiting for these guys to
put on their makeup.

1335
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:52,326
Do their hair and make out
before they come to set.

1336
00:54:52,395 --> 00:54:54,028
Isn't that crazy?

1337
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:57,031
Laughing, giggling, tickling
each other.

1338
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,268
With all hands on deck,
it's time to set sail.

1339
00:55:00,336 --> 00:55:02,236
Steven, is this your yacht
out here?

1340
00:55:02,305 --> 00:55:03,137
This is my yacht.

1341
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:03,804
Really?

1342
00:55:03,873 --> 00:55:04,572
Yup.

1343
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:06,274
I brought it all the way from
Maui.

1344
00:55:07,377 --> 00:55:08,309
Yes, I did.

1345
00:55:08,378 --> 00:55:11,712
And, as it turns out, our first
contestant, mawena cujo,

1346
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:14,615
has traveled a great distance
himself.

1347
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:15,416
Where are you from, mawena?

1348
00:55:15,485 --> 00:55:16,651
I'm from Togo, west Africa.

1349
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:17,318
Really.

1350
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:18,653
Well, this doesn't seem
convenient.

1351
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:19,320
Yes.

1352
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:20,788
What are you planning on
singing today?

1353
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:23,190
Um, trying to sing
rascal flatts.

1354
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:23,991
Rascal flatts.

1355
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,692
Yes.

1356
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:25,493
So you're a country guy.

1357
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:27,528
Yes, I'm a country guy.

1358
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:33,080
I've been singing since I was a
little boy my voice is low and high

1359
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:34,975
I can do any kind of
voice I want to.

1360
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,632
I can go...

1361
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:40,297
Any kind of voice I want.

1362
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:45,770
Last year I watched American idol
and I really loved "skatti macrri"

1363
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:48,415
and I told my family
he should be the winner.

1364
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,947
And he won it.

1365
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:55,334
There's no doubt about it
I'm the next American idol.

1366
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:00,661
Well, have fun.

1367
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,433
Is this our next country
superstar right here?

1368
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:07,068
Hello.

1369
00:56:07,136 --> 00:56:07,835

My name is mawena cujo.

1376
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:16,277
Oh, okay.

1377
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:17,611
Tell us a little bit about
yourself.

1378
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,379
What do you want to do?

1379
00:56:18,448 --> 00:56:20,281
I just want to get my ticket,

1380
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,649
You just want to get

1549
01:02:36,525 --> 01:02:37,458
<i> I'm gonna say yes too.</i>

1550
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,761
<i> You're going to Hollywood!</i>

1551
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,330
<i> Both: Joy-hop! Joy-hop!
<i> To Hollywood.</i>

1552
01:02:43,399 --> 01:02:45,332
<i> Joy-hop!</i>

1553
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:51,071
<i>Did you get all that?</i>

1554
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,342
<i> Joy-hopping all the way out
<i>of here.</i>

1555
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:59,546
<i> It's a dance that the world's
<i>gonna soon figure out about.</i>

1556
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:01,715
<i> But this joy wasn't gonna
<i>last forever.</i>

1557
01:03:01,784 --> 01:03:05,586
<i>When we come back...
Get that camera out of my <i>face.</i>

1558
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:08,155
<i> The hunt for the golden
<i>tickets is off target.</i>

1559
01:03:08,224 --> 01:03:09,156
<i> It's just [Bleep].</i>

1560
01:03:09,225 --> 01:03:09,823
<i> What?</i>

1561
01:03:09,892 --> 01:03:13,360
<i> But Savannah declares open
<i>season on Mr. Tyler.</i>

1562
01:03:13,429 --> 01:03:14,828
<i> Both: Steven! Steven!</i>

1563
01:03:14,897 --> 01:03:17,865
<i> It'll probably be very hard
<i>for me to control myself.</i>

1564
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:20,367
<i>It's an audition you don't want
to miss.</i>

1565
01:03:20,436 --> 01:03:21,201
<i> What's going on?</i>

1566
01:03:30,123 --> 01:03:33,324
Day two auditions are in
full swing deep in the South.

1567
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,527
And, while many contestants
continue making memories to last

1568
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:41,232
a lifetime, most of the talent this
morning has been more underdeveloped.

1569
01:03:41,301 --> 01:03:43,101
That was a rough audition,
baby.

1570
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,707
You didn't nail it this time.
No.

1571
01:03:49,776 --> 01:03:51,776
It needs to cook in the oven
a little bit longer.

1572
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:55,980
It's a tough room today.

1573
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:56,647
Nope.

1574
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:59,650
It was everything I wanted,
but I'll come back next year.

1575
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:00,685
Not this time.

1576
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,755
Are you... no, I'm not hiding-
yeah, no, we're serious.

1577
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:09,093
They said that it wasn't even
really singing.

1578
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:15,933
I'm telling you, dude, you're
gonna get eaten alive.

1579
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:17,168
I hear your voice, man,

1580
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:21,305
but I'm not sure if you're ready
to be an American idol.

1581
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:24,976
Sorry, buddy, you still got a lot
of good news here with the family.

1582
01:04:25,045 --> 01:04:32,617
That's right, I got a baby
on the way.

1583
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,152
I'm w.T. Thompson.

1584
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,119
I'm currently unemployed.

1585
01:04:35,188 --> 01:04:37,488
I'm from appomattox.
I'm 25 years old.

1586
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:40,575
Appomattox is one of those
towns, if you drive too fast

1587
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:47,081
and you blink, you might just
pass it.

1588
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,201
I worked for a federal prison,

1589
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:54,021
and I had to quit my job for
<i>a chance at American idol.</i>

1590
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:54,922
<i>They were gonna give me the time</i>

1591
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,408
<i>originally, and then they
<i>couldn't do it.</i>

1592
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:58,109
<i>I had to make the decision</i>

1593
01:04:58,178 --> 01:05:02,447
<i>either a job or a dream, and I
<i>chose the dream.</i>

1594
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:09,203
<i>Laura, my wife, is pregnant right
now, and she's <i>61/2 months.</i>

1595
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,155
<i> It's a dream, you know.</i>

1596
01:05:11,224 --> 01:05:15,943

01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,195
<i> Um, he's just never gonna get

1608
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,131

1609
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,233
<i>He's got a short amount of time

1610
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,601

1611
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,502

01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:58,152
<i> You know what, I hear your voice,
man, but I'm not sure if</i>

1619
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:00,621
<i>you're ready to be an American
idol.</i>

1620
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,556
<i>Just gonna tell you Frank.</i>

1621
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,390
<i> I think I got it, man.</i>

1622
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,724
<i> You do?
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

1623
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,260
<i> I don't know.
<i>He got a little twinkle in his eye.</i>

1624
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:06,928
<i>Voice is good.</i>

1625
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,763
<i>It could use a little-a little
<i>work, but it's there.</i>

1626
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:10,264
<i> I'll do it.
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1627
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,033
<i> And I think it's there to be
<i>worked with.</i>

1628
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:12,800
<i>I don't know.</i>

1629
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,469
<i>I think-I'm gonna take a chance
on him.</i>

1630
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,369
<i>I'm gonna give him a yes.</i>

1631
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,805
<i> So, Steven, you say no?</i>

1632
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:19,073
<i> And he got a baby coming.</i>

1633
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,809
<i> Jennifer says yes.</i>

1634
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:22,477
<i>Right, Stevie?</i>

1635
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,211
<i> Yes.</i>

1636
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:27,982
<i> That's the score thus far.</i>

1637
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:30,651
<i>But I'm telling you, dude,
you're gonna get eaten alive.</i>

1638
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,522
<i> I promise I'll make you
<i>proud.</i>

1639
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,062
<i> Sorry, brother.</i>

1640
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,763
<i>You still got a lot of good news
here with the family, you know.</i>

1641
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:47,268
<i> That's right.
<i>I got a baby on the way.</i>

1642
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,409
<i> So w.T.'S dream survives
<i>the cut.</i>

1643
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,579
<i>We'll catch up with him again
<i>in Hollywood.</i>

1644
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:01,749
<i> He had a good voice.</i>

1645
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:02,783
<i>And the things that weren't</i>

1646
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,287
<i>right about his voice can be
<i>fixed.</i>

1647
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,855
<i> You know, singing the song
in front of the judges is</i>

1648
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:09,457
<i>tougher than anybody thinks.</i>

1649
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,325
<i>It's a whole lot different when
you're standing in front of 'em</i>

1650
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,628
<i>and actually looking at 'em eye
<i>to eye, you know.</i>

1651
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,999
<i>But, you know what, I did it, and
now I'm going to Hollywood.</i>

1652
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:21,936
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1653
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:25,239
<i> More from Savannah coming
<i>up after the break.</i>

1654
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:26,774
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

1655
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:28,776
<i>I like it here.</i>

1656
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,745
<i>Coming up... calm down, mama.</i>

1657
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,713
<i>The girls go gaga for Steven.</i>

1658
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,616
<i> And one takes it to a new
level.</i>

1659
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,985
<i> Steven Tyler is my future
ex-husband.</i>

1660
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,488
<i> Plus our last contestants of</i>

1661
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,924
<i>the day send sparks through
<i>the judging room.</i>

1662
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,493
<i> It's like you have
<i>electricity going through your body.</i>

1663
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:58,063
You know, each year our
contestants show up with one

1664
01:07:58,132 --> 01:08:00,699
thing in mind, and that is to
get a golden ticket.

1665
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:01,800
This year in Savannah, it seems

1666
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,236
like they want to get a little
Steven Tyler too.

1667
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:08,507
Calm down, mama.

1668
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,911
I am so excited to meet
Steven Tyler.

1669
01:08:15,016 --> 01:08:15,814
All: We love you!

1670
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,249
I love you more.

1671
01:08:17,318 --> 01:08:18,817
He's kind of cute for
an older guy.

1672
01:08:22,123 --> 01:08:23,188
He is a hottie.

1673
01:08:23,257 --> 01:08:25,524
Does my [Bleep] look good?

1674
01:08:25,593 --> 01:08:26,725
Call me.

1675
01:08:26,794 --> 01:08:27,960
I'm on fire, right, baby?

1676
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:32,264
Fire.
Fire.

1677
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:38,101
He's hot, he's sensitive...
I'm here to tell you that I am...Moist.

1678
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:44,443
What is going on with this
program again, dude?

1679
01:08:44,512 --> 01:08:50,249
And his... go ahead. Ten-inch record.

1680
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:52,651
What was her name?

1681
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,654
There's no doubt Steven is
loved by all the ladies.

1682
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:58,791
I got to kiss Steven Tyler.

1683
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:01,827
No matter what age.

1684
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:03,729
Grandma.

1685
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:06,532
Grandma, she's going to
Hollywood.

1686
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,935
But perhaps nobody was as fully
committed as Erica novak

1687
01:09:10,004 --> 01:09:12,104
from buffalo, New York.

1688
01:09:12,173 --> 01:09:17,810
Steven Tyler is my future
ex-husband.

1689
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,889
He just doesn't know it yet.

1690
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,892
I think he's smoking hot.

1691
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,463
When I walk in the room and see
Steven Tyler, it'll probably

1692
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:40,365
be very hard for me to control
myself.

1693
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:45,838
But, if allowed, I would kiss his feet
or anything else for that matter.

1694
01:09:45,906 --> 01:09:48,941
I mean, I might go out when
security comes, but who cares?

1695
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:51,043
I'll get to say I kissed
Steven Tyler.

1696
01:09:51,112 --> 01:09:51,810
Ha.

1697
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:54,279
I want to cry before I even
audition.

1698
01:09:54,348 --> 01:09:55,581
No, baby.

1699
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:56,615
My future ex-husband.

1700
01:09:57,384 --> 01:09:57,983
Mr. Steven Tyler.

1701
01:09:58,052 --> 01:09:58,650
Ex-husband.

1702
01:09:59,386 --> 01:10:02,221
You know what, I think you guys
should have a hug before you sing.

1703
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:03,222
Oh, my God.

1704
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,756
Yeah, just-just have a hug.

1705
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:07,593
Hell with the golden ticket,
just give me a [Bleep] hug.

1706
01:10:09,697 --> 01:10:10,295
Come on.

1707
01:10:10,364 --> 01:10:11,763
No, I like their little
rapport.

1708
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,031
I like that she stays there.

1709
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,833
Hands will remain at my
sides, I swear.

1710
01:10:14,902 --> 01:10:15,501
Okay.

1711
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:16,168
Really?

1712
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,340
If I get any closer, I'll be

<i>Brittany kerr.</i>

1808

<i> I actually thought she had
<i>a pretty voice.</i>

1809
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:21,380
<i>It just wasn't strong enough.</i>

1810
01:14:21,448 --> 01:14:23,415
<i>I think she's not gonna survive

1811
01:14:23,484 --> 01:14:29,121
<i> She might if someone shows
<i>her what to sing.</i>

1812
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:31,723
<i> We'll see whose prediction

Hollywood.</i>

1814
01:14:34,328 --> 01:14:36,895
<i>Coming up, one last contestant.</i>

1815
01:14:36,964 --> 01:14:38,597

Holy crap, I'm going to
Hollywood.

1843
01:15:59,129 --> 01:16:00,462
But before we close up shop,

1844
01:16:00,531 --> 01:16:04,700
let's meet a guy with a name
you won't soon forget.

1845
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:05,767
I'm Phillip Phillips.

1846
01:16:05,836 --> 01:16:08,337
I'm 20 years old, and I'm from
leesburg, Georgia.

1847
01:16:08,405 --> 01:16:10,205
Yes, that is my real name.

1848
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:16,712
I work at my father's pawn shop.

1849
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,264
It's really exciting, and
sometimes it's scary.

1850
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,317
But you never know what'll come
through the door.

1851
01:16:25,105 --> 01:16:28,724
My dad is really proud of me
for doing what I do in music,

1852
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,692
and he supports me 110%.

1853
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:35,747
To see him succeed, you can't
even put words on it.

1854
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:39,668
Because it makes especially a
parent feel so proud, I mean,

1855
01:16:39,736 --> 01:16:41,403
you swell up as a man.

1856
01:16:41,455 --> 01:16:45,373
You just swell up and you so
proud that, ooh, it just makes

1857
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,192
you want to just bust.

1858
01:16:47,278 --> 01:16:51,263
<i>American idol will change his</i>
life, because this is what he loves.

1859
01:16:51,348 --> 01:16:54,516
I know this is my chance and my
opportunity to show the world

1860
01:16:54,585 --> 01:16:57,386
what I have, and I can't let it
slip out of my hands.

1861
01:16:57,454 --> 01:16:58,353
I think you're ready.

1862
01:16:58,422 --> 01:16:59,855
Born naked and ready.

1863
01:16:59,923 --> 01:17:01,623
They just put clothes on me is
all.

1864
01:17:03,193 --> 01:17:04,860
And, in this moment, I'm glad
you did.

1865
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,329
Come on, Phillip.

1866
01:17:07,398 --> 01:17:08,130
Phillip Phillips.

1867
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:09,331
Last one of the day.

1868
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,632
Representing.

1869
01:17:10,701 --> 01:17:12,234
I got a funny feeling about
this.

1870
01:17:12,303 --> 01:17:14,202
Hey.

1871
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:14,870
How are ya?

1872
01:17:14,938 --> 01:17:16,204
Doing good.
How about y'all?

1873
01:17:16,273 --> 01:17:18,540
So you're here with your family,
or you came up by yourself?

1874
01:17:18,609 --> 01:17:21,310
I'm here with my parents.

1875
01:17:21,378 --> 01:17:22,411
They're excited about it.

1876
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:23,478
My mom's so excited.

1877
01:17:23,547 --> 01:17:26,014
She wants-she's been waiting to
meet Ryan seacrest.

1878
01:17:26,083 --> 01:17:28,183
Oh, no! Really?

1879
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:30,552
I've got to tell you, I've
watched it every year since

1880
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:33,522
you've been on, and you are
more handsome every year.

1881
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:37,392
Not as handsome as my husband,

<i> Thank you very much.</i>

1986
01:21:05,836 --> 01:21:09,204
<i>Phillip Phillips, season 11,
American idol right here, baby.</i>

1987
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,974
I just want people to see
what I seen all his life and

1988
01:21:13,043 --> 01:21:16,311
what kind of man and what kind
of musician and singer he is

1989
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,280
and just share with the world.

1990
01:21:19,316 --> 01:21:22,350
Phillip Phillips caps off a
successful first visit here

1991
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:27,289
in Savannah with 42 singers getting that
coveted golden ticket to Hollywood.

1992
01:21:27,357 --> 01:21:28,924
Welcome to Hollywood!

1993
01:21:28,992 --> 01:21:30,058
I'm gonna say yes.

1994
01:21:30,127 --> 01:21:31,126

Yes!

1999
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,769
Hello Hollywood, baby.

2000
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,652
A good day in Savannah, guys.

2001
01:21:57,721 --> 01:21:58,453
Yup.

2002
01:21:58,522 --> 01:22:02,424
We came, we won, we saw, we
are.

2003
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:03,458
What?

2004
01:22:08,832 --> 01:22:09,831
Yeah!

2005
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,300

01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:13,001
Hollywood!

2007
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:17,439
See you in the next city.

2008
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:24,479
That is...
Wraps up.

2009
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:25,280
Both: A wrap.

2010
01:22:25,349 --> 01:22:28,817
Savannah, end, over, done.
Out.

2011
01:22:28,885 --> 01:22:30,485
Crispy, fried.

2012
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:31,753
It's a wrap.

2013
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,822
Bric-a-bric-a, firecracker,
siss-boom-ba.

2014
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:35,957
Good night, America.

2015
01:22:36,026 --> 01:22:39,060
Ryan seacrest, Ryan seacrest,
ra-ra-ra.

2016
01:22:39,129 --> 01:22:42,864
Tomorrow night, we head for...
Pittsburgh!

2017
01:22:45,402 --> 01:22:48,470
As the city of champions
share their true colors.

2018
01:22:50,273 --> 01:22:52,407
I love it.

2019
01:22:52,476 --> 01:22:53,541
So did you make it?

2020
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,709
All: Yes!

2021
01:22:54,778 --> 01:22:55,644
We dig deep.

2022
01:22:55,712 --> 01:22:57,712
Got to be a singer.
It's my dream.

2023
01:22:57,781 --> 01:22:58,380
And shake it up...

2024
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,382
I love it.

2025
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:04,619
As more outstanding talent...
You're going to Hollywood!

2026
01:23:06,123 --> 01:23:07,856
Yes, Hollywood! Hollywood!

2027
01:23:07,924 --> 01:23:09,824
Takes us all by surprise.

2028
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:12,661
Yay!

2029
01:23:12,729 --> 01:23:15,697
He is the next American idol.

2030
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:17,565
But it's a rough ride getting
there.

2031
01:23:17,634 --> 01:23:19,434
This is a national disaster.

2032
01:23:19,503 --> 01:23:21,670
Would steel town bend under
the pressure?

2033
01:23:21,738 --> 01:23:23,872
Scared makes you do things
that you wouldn't normally do.
