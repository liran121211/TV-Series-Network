1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:03,536
They call this place the city
of champions, so it is the

2
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:07,106
perfect spot to find our next
superstar.

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,142
It's our first time here in
Pittsburgh.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,209
You ready?

5
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>This is American idol.</i>

6
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,984
<i>In our 11 seasons...</i>

7
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,687
<i>This is the first time we've
held auditions in Pittsburgh.</i>

8
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:56,055
<i>Pittsburgh!</i>

9
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:05,815
<i>Everything we do, we do it big.</i>

10
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>A city that has its
own unique language...</i>

11
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,752
<i>Goin' downtown for that.</i>

12
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,788
<i>American idol now, down there
by the crick.</i>

13
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:13,089
Younse guys.

14
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:16,742
Its black and yellow sports
legacies, and, well...

15
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,828
Pittsburgh all day, baby.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,298
On its hometown pride.

17
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,817
And with the nickname "the city
of champions"...

18
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,786
We need to be entertained.

19
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:30,890
The judges have high
expectations for the 'burgh.

20
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,126
You get one shot at fame,
and that shot starts today.

21
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,165
And as they settle in for the
first day of auditions,

22
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,301
22-year-old heejun han can

23
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:44,770
hardly contain his excitement.

24
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,207
Why are you here today?

25
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:51,911
Uh...I don't know.

26
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:54,580
Do you think you have what it

27
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,349
takes to be the next American
idol?

28
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,416
I don't know.

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,953
After I saw all these crazy
people...

30
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,488
They're good, first of all.

31
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,023
And then I thought I was a

32
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:07,093
little good, but then...They're
just crazy good.

33
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,829
And I'm thinking, "I'm not that
good."

34
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:12,632
And now I'm thinking, "I'm not
good at all."

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,866
Your face is this small.

36
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:14,867
My face is that size?

37
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:15,535
Yeah.

38
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,202
Really?

39
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:16,969
It's good-looking.

40
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:17,637
Oh, thanks.

41
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,372
I've never been compared to a
fist.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,173
Yeah, I mean, it was just so
small.

43
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,308
Mine's really big, so...

44
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:23,009
Your head's big?

45
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,310
Yeah. Just...

46
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,711
All right, well, I think
we look the same size.

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,379
I don't think so.

48
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,046
Really?

49
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,581
No, it's just, comparison's
too much.

50
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,248
All right.

51
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,150
I was nervous before, but...

52
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,818
I think I drank plenty of teas

53
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,253
and stuff, so I'm okay.

54
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,488
So what's your name?

55
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,489
Heejun.

56
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:37,256
And where you from?

57
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,091
Oh...Originally from Korea,

58
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,060
but now I'm-I live in New York.

59
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:41,727
Yeah.

60
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:43,029
You guys are so unreal, ohh.

61
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:44,931
You look like one of those,

62
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,866
like, wax museum dolls.

63
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:48,734
You know, you're just unreal for
me right now.

64
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,337
Like three supermodels, right?

65
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:52,605
One, actually.

66
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,241
Thank you!

67
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,075
Steven!

68
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:56,876
Thank you, baby.

69
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:57,543
We just got dissed.

70
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:58,344
I'm sorry, I was just

71
00:02:58,413 --> 00:02:59,445
kidding, you guys are all...

72
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,513
oh, yeah. Oh!

73
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,315
Oh, don't take it back now.

74
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:02,982
I like this.

75
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:03,849
Don't take it back now.

76
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:04,584
Don't take it back now.

77
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:05,918
You're crazy!

78
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,620
All right, heejun.

79
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,022
Does he sing to you guys?

80
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,756
Around you guys?

81
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,224
We've actually never heard
him sing.

82
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,225
You've never heard him sing,

83
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,493
and you call yourself a friend.

84
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:17,430
What do you like to sing the
most?

85
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,599
I love when you do that.

86
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,366
What do you like to sing?

87
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,335
Um, soul, R&B.

88
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,704
And what are you gonna sing

Oh, thank you!

120
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,741
You have a beautiful voice.

121
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,809
Surprisingly.

122
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:37,576
Yes, really!

123
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,477
I was shocked.

124
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,147
Look at-I love you!

125
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,749
Randy, you look better in,
uh, person, I'm sorry.

126
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,885
Thank you, I knew I loved
this guy.

127
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,320
This guy...Thank you so much.

128
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,122
This guy's full of compliments.

129
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,190
But, listen, seriously.

130
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,458
On the serious note, right.

131
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:53,259
Seriously.

132
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,395
I am really impressed and
shocked.

133
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,464
You have a beautiful tone to
your voice.

134
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,632
Really, really good voice.

135
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,399
I'm very impressed.

136

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,869
Yeah, good understanding of

138
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:04,870
where notes should go.

139
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,572
Oh, nobody told me that...

140
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,606
those kind of stuff.

141
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,109
But you guys are telling me,
so this is just...

142
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,944
yup, I think you're really
great.

143
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,447
I think you could be an American
idol.

144
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,382
So let's all vote here.

145
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,583
What do you say, Stevie?

146
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:18,918
I say yes.

have a ticket in your hand?

162
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:44,977

delivers some unpredictable...

167

Welcome back to steel
city!

172
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,576
Pittsburgh pride has arrived
to the auditions.

173
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,746
And inside the holding room,

174
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:32,917
it's a battle to conquer those
first-day jitters.

175
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,552
You gotta have guts for this.

176
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:38,856
Guts, I'm telling you.

177
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:39,957
When inside the audition

room, our panel of judges are

179
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,961
nothing but seasoned
professionals.

180
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,363
Does my ass look good?

181
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,430
So good.

182
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:48,599
Time for a limerick.

183
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:49,934
Oh, yes, please, please.

184
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:52,470
There was a young man
from St. Paul's...

185
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,404
Uh-oh.

186
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:54,972
No, never mind, we won't do
this one.

187
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,975
Uh, maybe not so professional.

188
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,244
And it's time for the next
auditioner.

189
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,914
Send in the next person!

190
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:03,981
My name's reid grimm.

191
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,185
I'm 26 years old, and I'm from
ellsworth, Wisconsin.

192
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,786
My mom and dad met in a band,

193
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:10,721
fell in love, got married,

194
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,890
had kids, and as they had kids,

195
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,625
they just added them to the
show.

196
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,228
So I've been on stage since two
years old.

197
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:21,132
It's like home, really.
It's just where I live.

198
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,066
What are you singing, man?

199
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:23,901

00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:26,704

224
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:15,987
<i>The mark of a great performer</i>

225
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,688
<i>is that you never know what</i>

226
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:18,356
<i>they're gonna do.</i>

227
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:19,357
<i>Yeah.</i>

228
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>So you can't take your eyes</i>

229
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:20,825
<i>off of them, you just follow</i>

230
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:21,659
<i>them back and forth on the</i>

231
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,761
<i>stage, like, "what's he gonna do
next?"</i>

232
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,428
<i>And you have that.</i>

233
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:25,997

<i>The way the golden tickets</i>

275
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:42,873
<i>were flying out the door in.</i>

276
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:44,508
<i>Pittsburgh made us wonder why</i>

277
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>we waited so long to come here.</i>

278
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:51,882
<i>So did you make it?</i>

279
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:53,884
<i>Wow.</i>

280
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:54,752
<i>So cute.</i>

281
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:55,886
<i>All right, Pittsburgh.</i>

282
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:59,724
<i>It's fair to say the judges
are loving this city.</i>

283
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,393
<i>But you never know what lies on
the horizon.</i>

284
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,128
<i>Are you the same in terms of</i>

285
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,596
<i>singing styles?</i>

286
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,631
<i>I'm not a singer.
I'm a planker.</i>

287
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,366
<i>Okay.</i>

288
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:12,470
<i>And, um, I'm just planking
her to Hollywood.</i>

289
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:14,038
<i>I'm Patricia bell, also known</i>

290
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,173
<i>as, famously, Patti the
Pittsburgh planker.</i>

291
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:20,010
<i>And this is my younger sister,
Samantha.</i>

292
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,513
<i>Originally, planking is a
yoga position.</i>

293
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:26,217
<i>You lay on your belly and you
lift your feet up.</i>

294
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,485
<i>Yep, yep.</i>

295
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,086
<i>Look at that.</i>

296
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:30,121
<i>Whoa.</i>

297
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,156
<i>Planking has been a hobby,</i>

298
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:33,391
<i>but now it turned into something</i>

299
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:34,759
<i>that I can do for my sister.</i>

300
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:35,426
<i>Hi!</i>

301
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:37,461
<i>She sings better when I
plank, that's it.</i>

302
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,562
<i>It's true.</i>

303
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:39,330
<i>What are you gonna sing?</i>

304
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,767
<i>I'm gonna sing like we never
loved at all by faith hill.</i>

305
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,870
While your sister's there...
Planking?

306
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,972
How long can you hold that?

307
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,840
She can't talk while she's
planking, Steven.

308
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:50,674
That's hilarious.

309
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:52,176
Yeah, this is serious business.

310
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,344

Yeah, Patti, what's goin' on
down there, man?

327
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,591
Jennifer.

328
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,525
I really loved it.

329
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,561
I felt like there was some guts
behind the voice.

330
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,996
And it made me very pleased.
Very happy.

331
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,098
I agree.

332
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:48,933
I liked you as well.

333
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,935
I liked your tone, I like your

334
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,103
Sweet, clever, great notes.

335
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,305
Thank you so much.

336
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,940
I like the vibe, I mean, very

337
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,842
pure kind of sounding that you

338
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,477
got going on, reminds me...

339
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:00,845
Like, oh, faith hill.

340
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,947
Yeah, a little faith hill,
a little carpenterish.

341
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,748
I'm gonna say yes.

342
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:05,716
I'm gonna say yes.

343
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:08,419
I'm gonna say yes, and you're
going to Hollywood!

344
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:16,994
I'm proud that she would come

345
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:20,030
out and plank while her
girlfriend sang.

346
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,499
It was her sister.

347
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,067
I get it, but still...

348
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,069
It's a family thing.

349
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,073
So it's another golden ticket

350
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,308
for Pittsburgh, and an entire

351
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,245
family lying face down on the
floor.

352
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:37,214
Season 11, everybody.

353
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:41,285
Coming up, Randy and Jennifer
adore the talent.

354
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:42,186
I love it!

355
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:43,687
Love it.

356
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,789
And Steven brings the noise.

357
00:12:58,342 --> 00:12:59,976
Say hi. Hello!

358
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,344
What's your name?

359
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,813
Uh, I'm creighton, and this

360
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:08,217
is, uh, my little hometown,
New York City.

361
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:09,719
Right now, I don't really have a
job.

362
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,655
I'm a starving artist, I guess
you could say.

363
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,791
New York is rough.
It's-it's a crazy place.

364
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:15,925
There's a lot of people trying

365
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:17,560
to do what I'm trying too
there.

366
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,563
I'm just singing and writing

367
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:21,831
music and hoping that

368
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,232
something's gonna happen to get

369
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,535
me to the next level.

370
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,875
This is the long line to get...

371
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:33,710
For the bus.

372
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:34,377
Bus.

373
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,012
From New York City to
Pittsburgh, it's like a

374
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,114
nine-hour bus ride.

375
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,716
So I have some time to come up

376
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,918
with a little something to sing
for the judges.

377
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:44,253
I'm sure something will come
out.

378
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:45,755
Let's hope.

379
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,023
What are you singing, man?

380
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,891
I'm gonna sing, uh...

381
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,193
I had a bunch of options, and I

382
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,627
couldn't decide, so I just wrote

383
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:53,296
a song on the way here.
And so I'm...

384
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,431
Okay. Sing that.

385
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,767
Really? I love this.

386
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,501
All right.

387
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,803

587

<i>Let's take a vote. 
Yes.</i>

588
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:10,590
<i>Jennifer, what say you?</i>

589
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,258
<i>100% yes.</i>

590
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,393
<i>You're going to Hollywood!</i>

591
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,263
<i>Thank you, guys, so much.</i>

592
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,164
<i>Oh, thank you, man.</i>

593
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,133

00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:30,877

598
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,513

<i>Who remembers Travis?</i>

00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:06,813
<i>Travis.</i>

619
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,014

00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,449

00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,698
<i>I really want you to do it,</i>

00:21:58,767 --> 00:21:59,799
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

639
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:00,733
<i>You're singing the passion,</i>

640
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:01,901
<i>but you're not showing it.</i>

641
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,569
<i>I've got to show it.</i>

642
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:03,369
<i>Yeah, and you're singing it,</i>

643
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,638
<i>so it's like, "come on, come
on."</i>

644
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:06,539
<i>So you're in High School?</i>

645
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:08,308
<i>What's your story now?</i>

646
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:09,642
<i>I dropped out of High School.</i>

647
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:16,015
<i>This is a all or nothing thing.</i>

648
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:26,126
<i>This means a lot to me.</i>

649
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,927
<i>Last year, after idol aired and</i>

650
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,197
everything, my mom walked out.

651
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,433
She found another relationship

652
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,101
that she obviously loved more

653
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,374
than her family, and that really
hurt me.

654
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,109
We got evicted from our

655
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:46,012
apartment and I moved into a

656
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:49,983
shelter with my dad and my twin
brother.

657
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,184
My mom could have prevented this

658
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,552
from just sticking with my dad,

659
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,622
and my dad was just getting even
sicker and sicker.

660
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,691
My mom broke my dad's heart.

661
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,726
Even though we went through

662
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:01,794
all those trials and
tribulations, we're

663
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,663
inseparable, we're very tight,

664
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:05,498
because we know that the

665
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:06,833
bottom line, at the end of the

666
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:10,403
day, all we have is each other.

667
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,139
I love you, dad.

668
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,943
I'm doing this not only to

669
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:18,912
show myself, but to show my mom

670
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,113
that, you know, I am worth

671
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:22,081
something, I can do this, I'm

672
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,783
not a good-for-nothing lowlife.

673
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,351
I can do something with my life

674
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,620
and something positively.

675
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,622
Is your family here
supporting you or...?

676
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:30,857
My dad's in dialysis, my

677
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:31,658
brother started college.

678
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,159
I got my best friend Aaron,

679
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,162
like, right outside waiting.

680
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,096
I'm scared, but at the same

681
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,499
time, I know this is what I
want.

682
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:43,269
Scared is good.
Let's take a vote.

683
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,437
Scared makes you do things that

684
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,706
you wouldn't normally do.

685
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:47,740
I'm going to say yes, man.

686
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,375
I think you're worth another
shot.

687
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:50,510
I think you've gotten stronger.

688
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,512
I think you've got a ways to
grow, though.

689
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,447
He's only 17.

690
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,848
There's a lot more growing to

691
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,651
do, and I think that, from what

692
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,221
you've shown us, that definitely

693
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:02,889
you're going to keep growing, so

694
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,791
I'm going to say yes, too.

695
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:05,692
I think you got something

696
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,726
there, too, but you've got to

697
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:07,994
jump out of your shell, man.

698
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:08,661
I will.

699
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,196
All right, so guess what?

700
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:11,297
You're going to Hollywood!

701
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,166
Yes!

702
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:17,870
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.

703
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,472
Thank you, thank you.

704
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,306
Yeah, go tell your dad.

705
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,140
I'm going to tell everyone.

706
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,342
Yeah, go tell your dad, man.

707
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,176
Yeah, you've got to tell your

708
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:23,910
family, man.

709
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:24,677
Thank you so much, thank you.

710
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:27,013
Okay.

711
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:27,680
Way to go.

712
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:34,954
That's awesome, man.

713
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:35,822
That is awesome.

714
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,823
I guess I'll see you there.

715
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,624
Yes, you will.

716
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:38,992
Congratulations, buddy.

717
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,959
Thank you, thank you.

718
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,027
He got better.

719
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:42,228
He definitely got better.

720
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:43,930
Hey, dad?

721
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:44,597
Yeah?

722
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,432
I'm going to Hollywood, dad.

723
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:47,900
Man, everything that we

724
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,069
prayed for is just this closer.

725
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:53,606
I know this is the year.

726
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:55,975
Coming up...Day two begins.

727
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,911
And Pittsburgh's got some
surprises.

728
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:13,382
It's day two of auditions
here in Pittsburgh.

729
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:15,184
Welcome to Pittsburgh!

730
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:17,986
Yesterday's great talent,
but...

731
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:19,288
We forgot the map.

732
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:20,656
Which is something Jennifer

733
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:22,124
could well have used, because

734
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:23,392
she was running late.

735
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:24,927
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

736
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,328
Steven and Randy are taking

737
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,063
this opportunity to put on their

738
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:31,133
own two-man show.

739
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:32,868
<i>Idol season 11, the greatest</i>

740
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,403

With the crowd riled up...

749
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:01,196
I'm ready.

750
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:03,031
And the team now reunited,

751
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,167
day two has got big shoes to
fill.

752
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:06,201
Come on, Pittsburgh.

753
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,003
What a slammin' day yesterday
was.

754
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,706
Let's hope that we can find
that same level today.

755
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,207
Dude, it was crazy yesterday.

756
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:14,576
Let's get it on, Pittsburgh,
let's get it on.

757
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:15,644
My name's Erica van pelt.

758
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:16,645
I'm from South kingstown, Rhode

759
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:20,182
island, and I'm a mobile dj and
a wedding singer.

760
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:24,553
A mobile dj is a dj that moves

761
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:25,988
around from place to place.

762
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,723
I move in and move out of a club

763
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:34,897
or a bar or a venue six nights a
week.

764
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:36,498
In addition to owning the dj

765
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:40,002
business, I also am a wedding
singer.

766
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,253
Here we go.

767
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:42,387
For a lot of people, when they

768
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,488
hear "wedding singer," they

769
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:45,524
automatically see Adam sandier

770
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:48,160
and they see mullets and sort of

771
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:52,598
goofy, goofy singing.

772
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,066
Wedding singing, for me,

773
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,468
honestly is just another outlet

774
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,637
to be able to share my love of

775
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:00,405
music and my love of singing

776
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:01,306
with people.

777
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,242
This could possibly be the

778
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,678
biggest, most important day of
my entire life.

779
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:09,081
My time to shine. Let's rock.

780
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,649
Hello.

781
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:11,783
What's going down?

782
00:27:11,852 --> 00:27:12,551
Hi.

783
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,385
What's your name?

784
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:14,720
Erica van pelt.

785
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:15,921
Erica, where are you from?

786
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,655
Rhode island.

787
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:19,291
My neck of the woods.
I'm liking that.

788
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,392
What-what do you do?

789
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,227
I'm a mobile dj and I, uh,

790
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:23,295
and I sing weddings.

791
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:24,930
Great, so what are you going
to sing for us, yeah?

792
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:28,300
Um, I'm going to do Carole king,
will you still love me tomorrow?

793
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:29,401

<i>This is how you do it.</i>

<i>I love that you got this low
alto, this low tone.</i>

816
00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:31,630
<i>Oh, my God, all the turns, the

817
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:32,431
<i>Thank you.</i>

818
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:34,132
<i>You turn sexy, very sure of
yourself.</i>

819
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:34,800
<i>That was great.</i>

820
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:35,467
<i>Thank you.</i>

822
00:28:38,138 --> 00:28:39,471
<i>It kind of all works together.</i>

823
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,206
<i>I did-must say, I had a</i>

824
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:42,674
<i>feeling when you walked in,</i>

825
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:44,843
<i>like, "you know, this could be
good, Pittsburgh."</i>

826
00:28:45,746 --> 00:28:46,678
<i>It's in the water up there.</i>

827
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:47,479
<i>Should we just vote?</i>

828
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:48,146
<i>Yes.</i>

829
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:49,548
<i>Some kind of magic.</i>

830
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:50,282
<i>So that means vote?</i>

831
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:51,249
<i>Yes.</i>

832
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:52,150
<i>Yes.</i>

833
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:52,818
<i>Yes, you're going to.</i>

834
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:53,485
<i>Hollywood.</i>

835
00:28:53,554 --> 00:28:55,153
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

836
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:56,488
<i>That's how you put it down,</i>

837
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:57,456
<i>that's how you do it.</i>

838
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:58,223
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

839
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,191
<i>Thank you.</i>

840
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,559
<i>Thank you.</i>

841
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,596
<i>Congratulations.</i>

842
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:06,999
<i>I got my golden ticket, I'm
so excited.</i>

843
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,266
<i>Pelt can belt.</i>

844
00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:10,535
<i>I am going to Hollywood.</i>

845
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:13,372
<i>I will see you guys there.</i>

846
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,641
<i>Next up, this coal miner digs
for gold.</i>

847
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,909
<i>I just gotta be a singer.</i>

848
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:18,877
<i>It's my dream.</i>

849
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:21,279
<i>And a girl saved by love.</i>

850
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:22,414
<i>If it wasn't for my husband.</i>

851
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:24,316
<i>Ryan, I would not be sitting
here right now.</i>

852
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:27,552
<i>He loves me like I've never been
loved before.</i>

853
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:38,512
It's 3:00 in Pittsburgh.

854
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:42,850
And the good times are rolling.

855
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:44,418
No one is enjoying the auditions

856
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:45,819
more than Steven Tyler.

857
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:48,822
I've got the secret
weapon-my red box.

858
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,891
Thanks to his colleague's
sound machine.

859
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,665
"This is a national disaster."

860
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:02,102
Yes, exactly, exactly.

861
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,670
Wait, what? Cut.

862
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:07,207
Anybody remember that...

863
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:08,042
that would be him.

864
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,579
"You've got to be kidding me."

865
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:14,081
Maybe so, but a serious

866
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,582
number of yellow tickets flew

867
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:16,517
out of those doors.

868
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:17,618
Yes.

869
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:18,919
Yes.

870
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:19,586
Yes.

871
00:30:20,322 --> 00:30:21,588
You're going to Hollywood!

872
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:24,691
As more and more futures
looked golden.

873
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,729
Hoping to alter his path was
Shane Bruce.

874
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:30,731
I'm 19 years old and I'm from

875
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,299
moundsville, west Virginia.

876
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:35,069
Well, about a year ago, I
graduated from High School.

877
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,036
I decided to follow in the

878
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:39,923
family trade and go to the coal
mines.

879
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:44,294
To go into the mine, you go
straight into an elevator.

880
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:48,766
The elevator takes you down
about 400 feet.

881
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:55,189
One of my jobs underground, we
build crib.

882
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,573
Keeps the roof up, man.

883
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:58,208
My pap, he was a coal miner.

884
00:30:58,277 --> 00:31:00,210
My Uncle, he was a coal miner.

885
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,445
My entire family does it.

886
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:06,233
It must be something we're good
at.

887
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,785
I'm proud to be a coal miner.

888
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:09,736
Yeah, definitely.

889
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,672
But...if I had to choose

890
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,906
something to be for the rest of

891
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:17,628
my life, it's got to be a
singer, man.

892
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:19,496
I just-it's my dream.

906
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:45,856
Hi, Shane.

907
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:47,057
Yeah, I'm 19, I'm a coal

Really, a coal miner?

910
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:52,129
What made you want to do that?

911
00:31:52,198 --> 00:31:52,796
You're kind of young.

912
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:53,697
What, be a coal miner?

913
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:54,364
Yeah.

914
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,100
My pap, he's a coal miner.
He's stable.

915
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:57,935
You know, he's got a stable

916
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,304
income, stable everything, so

917
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:01,238
that's what I want, you know.

918
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,640
I want to have a stable life.

919
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,943
But nothing's stopping me from

920
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,711
chasing a dream, you know what I
mean?

921
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,378
Right.

922
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:09,046
Nice, nice.

923
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:10,013
And that's why I'm here, so.

924
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:11,381
Okay, baby, what are you
going to sing?

925
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,649

Yeah.
I usually hit that better.

950
00:33:11,677 --> 00:33:13,443
Well, I gave you all I had, you
know.

951
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:16,213
Mm-hm, that's all you can do.

952
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:17,481
Sometimes routine is the secret

953
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:19,116
of life, you know?

954
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:20,050
Not always about running all

955
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,352
over the world, singing a song.

956
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:23,020
Yeah.

957
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:23,887
Even though I know that's a

958
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:25,289
dream, certainly was mine,

959
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:26,423
and...You know, you singing to

960
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:30,127
them down there, maybe that's
your forte.

961
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:31,328
I hate to say that, but...

962
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:32,462
Yeah, no, man.

963
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:34,865
Yeah, got to have the truth, you

964
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,033
know, something to build on, but

965
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:37,601
but you know, look, man,

966
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,902
listen, you got a great start.

967
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:41,471
I don't think it was the best
audition I've ever seen.

968
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,372
I think you definitely have a

969
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:43,640
voice there, but you need

970
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,342
clearly a lot of work on it for

971
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:47,010
something at this level.

972
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,811
But, I mean, you know what I'm

973
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,947
really impressed with is that
you knew that.

974
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:50,614
Oh, yeah.

975
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,282
You know, that's something to
really build on.

976
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:54,051
Plus you're just a young'un,
aren't you?

977
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,653
Well, 19, you know, but...

978
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:57,754
Well, let's take a vote here.

979
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:58,689
Steven, what are you saying?

980
00:33:58,757 --> 00:33:59,856
I'm gonna say not yet, man,

981
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:02,426
but that don't mean to stop.

982
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,160
I think you have a real

983
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:04,094
pretty voice, but I think you

984
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:05,128
can work on it a little bit and,

985
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:07,230
maybe next year, come back.

986
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,799
Yeah, definitely come back.

987
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,334
Okay, guys, I really
appreciate it.

988
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:11,001
Hey, man, I love it.

989
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,069
Thanks for giving me the

990
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,003
time-oh, thanks, man.

991
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:13,670
Thank you.

992
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,338
See you guys next year.

993
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:15,005
All right, man.

994
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:16,006
Good luck.

995
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:18,208
Wow.

996
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:20,077
He's disappointed.

997
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:24,181
He didn't do as good as he
wanted to do.

999
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,395
It's all right, you're still

Yeah.

1001
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:42,966
Yes, you'll always be our idol.

1002
00:34:43,035 --> 00:34:46,703
Just got nervous.

1003
00:34:46,772 --> 00:34:49,806
Didn't do as good as I know I
can.

1004
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,708
You went for it.

1005
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:52,743
Got to chase the dream.

1006
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:53,877
Gotta chase it.

1007
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:54,878
Get bruises, scrapes, and

1008
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,346
cuts along the way, but can't
stop it, you know?

1009
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:57,681
That's right.

1010
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,715
That is my dream and I

1011
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:00,217
just...I kind of watched it

1012
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:03,186
float away, but...What are you
going to do about it?

1013
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,923
It slipped from my fingers.

1014
00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:09,926
Slipped right through 'em.

1015
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:12,929
Up next...The Pittsburgh

1016
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:14,731
auditions come to a dramatic

1017
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,502
end with a story and a voice you

1018
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,569
don't want to miss.

1019
00:35:19,638 --> 00:35:21,571
She could win.

1020
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:29,568
So what happened?

1021
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,737
Um...They just told me I need

1022
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:34,340
to work harder and...My voice is

1023
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:35,641
strong, but they want it a

1024
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,012
little bit stronger, so...I'll
come back.

<i>At the idol auditions, the</i>

1026
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:43,615
last thing anyone wants to hear
is...

1027
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:44,583
I'm gonna say no.

1028
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:45,551
I say no, not yet.

1029
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,719
Not yet for me either.

1030
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:48,620
Just keep practicing.

1031
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:49,755
But after two days in
Pittsburgh,

1032
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:53,325
we learned the steel
city never gives up.

1033
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:55,027
I'll be back.

1034
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:56,328
Everybody better be watching for

1035
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:59,298
me, too, 'cause I'm coming
strong.

1036
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,132
Just-you're going to see me.

1037
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,967
I'm telling you, it's not the
last.

1038
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,335
I am definitely going to get

1039
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:04,370
the golden ticket today.

1040
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:06,438
I'm going to say no, not for
this.

1041
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:08,140
I think I'll be okay.

1042
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,541
And after all the tears have

1043
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,611
fallen...And the promises
made...

1044
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,812
I promise you I can do it.

1045
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,548
I'm sorry, baby, not today.

1046
00:36:16,617 --> 00:36:18,083
The Pittsburgh auditions have

1047
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:20,319
come down to one final name.

1048
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,054
Is that her name, hallie day?

1049
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:22,955
Did someone just say my name?

1050
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:24,356
Wow. Yeah.

1051
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,090
How are you?

1052
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:25,758
Good.

1053
00:36:26,861 --> 00:36:27,493
Steven was announcing you.

1054
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,560
Well, hey, everybody.

1055
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:30,028
Wow, hallie day.

1056
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:30,963
Yes, Steven Tyler.

1057
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:31,730
What a great name.

1058
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:32,431
That is a great name.

1059
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,098
Hallie day.

1060
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:33,966
You're so beautiful.

1061
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:34,700
Thank you.

1062
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:35,934
Hallie, how old are you?

1063
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:37,136
I'm 24 years old.

1064
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,070
Where you from, baby?

1065
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:39,571
I'm from Baltimore, Maryland.

1066
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,907
B-more, Maryland.
What do you there?

1067
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,475
I'm a waitress right now.

1068
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:44,143
Yeah.

1069
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:46,078
And-yeah, and I just got
married six months ago.

1070
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:46,745
Nice.

1071
00:36:46,814 --> 00:36:48,080
Is he a nice guy?

1072
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:49,248
He's a great guy.

1073
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:52,317
He's the reason I'm here.

1074
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:55,387
Music and my husband saved my
life.

1075
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,256
At 15 years old, I dropped out

1076
00:36:57,324 --> 00:36:58,323
of High School.

1077
00:36:58,392 --> 00:37:00,692
I moved to New York and joined a

1078
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,728
girl group called plum crazy.

1079
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:05,531
I was determined to be a
superstar.

1080
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,566
But I became very lonely, I felt

1081
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:09,735
very disconnected, I was in

1082
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:11,670
debt, I wasn't able to pay my

1083
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:15,674
rent, I was...An addict.

1084
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:19,511
I decided to leave New York.

1085
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,763
Moving back home was really
rough.

1086
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:24,383
My mom wasn't really around at
the time.

1087
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:25,717
Neither was my father.

1088
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,754
There was definitely a lack of
structure in my life.

1089
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:30,405
I was very insecure and I had

1090
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,524
very little confidence in
myself.

1091
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,393
I didn't want to...Sing.

1092
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:35,661
I didn't want to perform.

1093
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:37,563
I just wanted to kill the pain,

1094
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,865
so I went into the bathroom and

1095
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:43,535
I shut the door and...Just drank

1096
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:47,139
a bottle of pills.

1097
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,241
And laid down on the floor and

1098
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,578
felt myself starting to...Um,

1099
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,681
drift off and, um...

1100
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:56,949
You know, I ended up in the

1101
00:37:57,017 --> 00:38:00,752
emergency room that night.

1102
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,221
After hitting that bottom, I

1103
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:05,624
came up a little bit, and I met

1104
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:12,047
a man who, years later, became
my husband.

1105
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:15,350
He loves me like I've never been
loved before.

1106
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,269
I did encourage hallie to go

1107
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,171
<i>audition for American idol,</i>

1108
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,155
<i>'cause I just believe in her.</i>

1109
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:22,207
<i>She has the ability to inspire a</i>

1110
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,092
<i>lot of people with what she
does.</i>

1111
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:26,028
<i>Whether I come out of that</i>

1112
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,346
<i>room with the judges with tears</i>

1113
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:28,547
<i>in my eyes 'cause I didn't make</i>

1114
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:29,915
<i>it or I'm jumping up and down</i>

1115
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,283
<i>'cause I did, he'll be there and</i>

1116
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,784
<i>we'll go through it together.</i>

1117
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,889
<i>We'll just take it on, whatever
it is.</i>

1118
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,461
<i>No matter what happens here</i>

1119
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,462
<i>or with this competition or</i>

1120
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:46,732
<i>whatever, never stop believing
in yourself.</i>

1121
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,033
<i>Thank you so much, Jennifer.</i>

1122
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:48,700
<i>Nice.</i>

1123
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:50,068
<i>What are you going to sing for
us today?</i>

1124
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:52,104
<i>I'm singing I will survive
by Gloria gaynor.</i>

1125
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:52,771

00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:47,292

1154
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,894

1155
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:50,262
<i>You like watching her when
she sings?</i>

1156
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:51,663
<i>How about listening to her when
she sings?</i>

1157
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:53,198
<i>Steven asked me to sing
something else.</i>

1158
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,100
<i>I can-I just-I can see you.</i>

1159
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:56,602

00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:02,874
<i>You do have a gift, your husband
is right.</i>

1163
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:03,542
<i>Thank you.</i>

1164
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,577
<i>And you know what's wrong
with this girl, Steven?</i>

1165
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:06,979
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

1166
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:08,847
<i>That's correct!</i>

1167
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,215
<i>You guys are awesome, thank
you so much.</i>

1168
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:11,249
<i>You're going to Hollywood.</i>

1169
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:11,917
<i>Yes, say yes.</i>

1170
00:40:11,986 --> 00:40:14,319
<i>Yes, yes, yes, thank you.</i>

1171
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:15,153
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1172
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:15,821
<i>Thank you.</i>

1173
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:18,056
<i>When you got it, you got it, and
you got it, baby.</i>

1174
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:22,894
<i>I know this is obvious, but
blondie?</i>

1175
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,096
<i>Going to Hollywood!</i>

1176
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,801
<i>That was a good way to close
out Pittsburgh.</i>

1177
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,936
<i>I'm telling you, a good one...</i>

1178
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:31,703
<i>that's outrageous.</i>

1179
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,105
<i>That was a good one right
there, right, Stevie?</i>

1180
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:35,173
<i>She could win.</i>

1181
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:35,907
<i>Great.</i>

1182
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,209
<i>And it's good feelings all</i>

1183
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:39,344
<i>around as idol's first ever trip</i>

1184
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:41,863
to the steel city comes to a
close.

1185
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:44,866
Oh, my God, Ryan, it's
Jennifer Lopez.

1186
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:45,934
Oh, my God.

1187
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,103
We love you!

1188
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:49,471
I am glad we came to
Pittsburgh.

1189
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,305
I feel like we got one more

1190
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:53,909
today that was super, super
special.

1191
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:54,843
Blonde girl.

1192
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:57,412
Going to Hollywood.

1193
00:40:57,481 --> 00:40:58,146
Very exciting.

1194
00:40:58,215 --> 00:40:59,915
You know what, the plot
thickens.

1195
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:00,582
Oh, my God.

1196
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:04,519
Well, it wasn't just the

1197
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,356
bloodies that got a call to
Hollywood.

1198
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:09,157
In all, 38 left with golden

1199
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:11,093
tickets in hand and the dream of

1200
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:14,896
becoming the next American idol.

1201
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,164
All right, America, that is

1202
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:17,833
it for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1203
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,267
Next stop is...

1204
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:22,337
Effect in.

1205
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,608
We're actually back this

1206
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:28,893
Sunday night after the big game,

1207
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:32,160
as we roll in to San Diego

1208
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:36,058
for our most adventurous
audition ever.

1209
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,145
Did you not think there'd be
jets flying over top?

1210
00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:42,083
And there's plenty of gold
in the California sun.

1211
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:45,977
Mad, mad good.

1212
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:46,921
You're gonna be big.

1213
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:50,364
A special Sunday night idol
after the game.

1214
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,300
My God.

1215
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:54,360
Did I mention it's on Sunday night?

1216
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:56,302
Yes!
