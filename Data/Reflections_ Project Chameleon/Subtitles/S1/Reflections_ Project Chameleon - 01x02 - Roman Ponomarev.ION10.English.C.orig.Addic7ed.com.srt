2
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,790
Andy time for your first injection.

3
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:47,455
Motherfuckers, you put me out.

4
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:50,140
Andy you are given instructions
and they must be followed.

5
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:53,478
I want to see Vladimir
right now, right fucking now.

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,809
Of course, just relax.

7
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,499
We need to check your vitals
and take some more blood.

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,290
Then I'd be happy to call Vladimir.

9
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,337
Fine, but you won't put me out,
and you won't put me under again.

10
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:08,456
Do you understand me?

11
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,279
It is our house rules to do
what's best for the treatment.

12
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
So I can't promise you that.

13
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,430
Dr. Vladimir, we need
you in Andy's room now.

14
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,186
Andy what's going on?

15
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,337
Are you okay?

16
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,610
Andy, when my team gives
instruction and you do not comply,

17
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,340
that is a problem.

18
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,510
We do not want to see you get hurt.

19
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,620
I just, I guess control of my body.

20
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,030
Yes, I understand that.

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,819
It may seem their tactics are unorthodox

22
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,229
but I can promise you, your time is

23
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,350
of great importance and value.

24
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,539
Allow me them to share a story

25
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,139
of my son and the importance

26
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,830
of spending time with someone.

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,780
Just like in this lab...
you are a family here, Andy.

28
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,099
We value your time as we
sacrifice our own time to ensure

29
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,450
that you can lead a much better life.

30
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,240
Well, what'd you learn from the story?

31
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,700
Sometimes we forget family
is more important than work.

32
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,080
One evening; I was coming
home from work late tired...

33
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,045
I found my five-year-old son
waiting for me at the door.

34
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:52,417
My son said, "Daddy,
may I ask you a question?

35
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,723
I replied "Yes, son, what is it?"

36
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,780
My son said, how much do
I make an hour at work?

37
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,380
I replied, "None of your business, son."

38
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,460
He continued and continued and said,

39
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,657
"Daddy, please, tell me how
much do you make an hour?"

40
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,620
I replied, "If you really must know

41
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:20,289
I make 100 dollars an hour."

42
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,770
He then looked up at me
and asked to borrow $50.

43
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,139
I replied, if you want the
only reason you asked me

44
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,659
was to buy some silly little
toy then march yourself

45
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,910
to your room and go to bed right now."

46
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,969
My son rushed to his room.

47
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,070
I was confused at first
and started to think

48
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,850
maybe he needed to
buy something important

49
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:52,538
as he never asks for money.

50
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,599
So I had rushed upstairs
to his room, open the door.

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,789
And asked if he was still awake.

52
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,889
He replied, "Yes,
Daddy, I'm still awake."

53
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,709
I said, "I had a very long day at work

54
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,570
and I took my aggravation on you

55
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,520
here is the $50 you asked for."

56
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,990
My son was excited at first
and thanked me for the money.

57
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,950
It's what he said and
did next that reminded me

58
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:33,914
of that time and importance of family.

59
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:42,527
So what was it that
he said and did next?

60
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:43,918
Uhmm...

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,439
In that moment he
reached under his pillow

62
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,579
and started peeling apart
some crumbled up bills.

63
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,580
He had saved for quite some time.

64
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,479
He then started to
count the money he had.

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,269
I was confused at first

66
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,539
and asked him why he needed more money,

67
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,140
if he already had some.

68
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,550
He said, "I didn't have
enough, but I do now."

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,020
I replied, "Enough, enough for what?"

70
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,340
He said, "I have a 100 dollars.

71
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,920
Can I buy an hour of your time?"

72
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,429
So you see, Andy, just like this story,

73
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,640
we must learn to trust each other.

74
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,040
As we all have a common goal.

75
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,130
I see... I definitely
appreciate everyone here.

76
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,549
We're glad to help, come
back next week during the week

77
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,550
on Monday after 5:00 p.m.,
we will do another injection.

78
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,570
Okay.

79
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,604
Can I help you, missy?

80
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,572
Hey yeah, I can just get
a small cheese pizza to go.

81
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:57,640
- Small cheese pizza?
- Yeah.

82
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:58,823
Sure, do you wanna wait for
it? Or do you wanna come back?

83
00:06:58,823 --> 00:06:59,950
- I'll wait.
- Okay. Have a seat.

84
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,020
- Okay great thank you.
- It's on its way.

85
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,109
Great, thanks.

86
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,105
- Yes.
- Mr. Gaines...

87
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:15,599
I have Veronica on line one for you...

88
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Thank you.

89
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,959
Hunter Gaines Investigation,
how can I help you?

90
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,669
Hi my name is Veronica and I work with

91
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,909
Rebecca Haines at Channel Four News.

92
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,518
I need some help with some
surveillance, can you help?

93
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,829
Sure, let's meet and discuss further.

94
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,380
When it's good for you, Veronica?

95
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,439
How is so one o'clock tomorrow?

96
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,077
1:00 p.m. is good.

97
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,259
Let's meet at Baki's at
1250 North Main street

98
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,369
in West Hartford, Connecticut.

99
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,089
It's just down the road from my office.

100
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,560
I'll meet you inside.

101
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,670
Again you're late.

102
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,610
What's going on?

103
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,330
I gotta tell you guys something.

104
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,760
I've been keeping this
secret for a very long time.

105
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,580
I'm sorry you have to hear this but.

106
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,756
Whatever it is... it will be okay...

107
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,203
We're here for you.

108
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:21,310
Dad, are you okay?

109
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,170
You're crying.

110
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,137
I went to the doctor
and it didn't go so well.

111
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,800
The doctor said I have
stage four brain cancer.

112
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,191
- You'll be okay, come on guys.
- And I don't know

113
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,420
how much longer I'm gonna be here.

114
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,171
Oh babe, you'll be okay.

115
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,735
All right guys, don't
worry, your dad's strong.

116
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,350
He's a fighter...

117
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,537
You know what? The game is coming on...

118
00:09:58,538 --> 00:09:59,871
why don't you invite
some friends from work,

119
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:01,530
you can invite the neighbors,

120
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,161
you can invite some friends.

121
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:06,150
Just to get your mind off this okay?

122
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,673
All right, can I talk to him?

123
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,998
Why don't you go to your room, okay?

124
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,396
Why don't you sit down?

125
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,397
I love you.

126
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,119
Sergeant, what's the news for today?

127
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,929
I've heard from Sergey...
our loyal mercenary.

128
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,449
He's the one who's been
keeping tabs on Andy.

129
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,450
And?

130
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,707
You see the man in these photos.

131
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,529
He's been following
Andy, just as we have.

132
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,639
Who is he?

133
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,140
He's a private investigator.

134
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,119
Do we know who hired him?

135
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,399
Yes.

136
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,609
Who?

137
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,720
A Rebecca Haines, a news reporter.

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I see.

139
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,542
Call Sergey... eliminate both targets.

140
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:07,769
Call me when it's done.

141
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,720
And another thing notify
Vladimir of this situation.

142
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:13,563
Right away, understood.

143
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,954
Hey babe, are you okay?

144
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,527
Babe, are you okay?

145
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,727
What's going on?

146
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,541
What's going on, man?

147
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:38,574
What's going on?

148
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:45,459
No.

149
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,986
- Snap out of it.
- Yes.

150
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,120
- You're all right?
- What's going on?

151
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,921
- Jesus Christ, Andy.
- What happened?

152
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,518
I think it's just better
everybody leave, I'm sorry.

153
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,306
- It's okay.
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.

154
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:58,335
- Everybody leave.
- You all right?

155
00:11:58,341 --> 00:11:59,341
Get up.

156
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:01,924
What?

157
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,083
Kids you should go upstairs.

158
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,840
Guys, I'm really sorry,
you need to leave.

159
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:17,752
Jesus Christ, Andy, you've
realized what you just did?

160
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,864
No. What happened?

161
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,477
It's like you were out of it.

162
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,019
The national Anthem came on,

163
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,129
it's like you were in a different world.

164
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,330
You don't remember that.

165
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,630
I must have had an injection
from one of the doctors.

166
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,579
I... did I black out?

167
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,689
Andy my friend was sitting next to you,

168
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,809
you grabbed a knife and attacked him.

169
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,719
You don't remember that?

170
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Oh my God.

171
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,743
I'll tell the doctors
about this tomorrow.

172
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,920
Okay, Andy, oh my God.

173
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:51,623
What is going on?

174
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,350
We'll get through this babe, I promise.

175
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,479
Hello.

176
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,489
- Andy.
- Yes, that's me.

177
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,089
My name is Veronica and I work

178
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,999
for Rebecca Haines, we're
with Channel Four News.

179
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,510
Red Star Telecommunications
is not what you think it is.

180
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,590
And what do you know?

181
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,119
You're in danger.

182
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,559
This phone is likely being
tapped and you're being watched.

183
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,039
So I've left a note in your mailbox

184
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,799
with instructions on where
to meet me, come alone

185
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,449
and leave now.

186
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,160
Okay, I'll see you soon...

187
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:39,915
Okay.

188
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:46,424
- Andy.
- Yes.

189
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,736
Hey, so I'm Veronica with
Channel Four News, we spoke.

190
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:49,825
Yup.

191
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:50,906
We're probably being watched right now

192
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,409
so I'm gonna make this very brief.

193
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:55,503
Everything you're being told is a lie.

194
00:13:58,222 --> 00:13:59,627
How do you know you me?

195
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:03,236
It's not what's important, just
read what's in the envelope.

196
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,366
Do you think Andy was convinced?

197
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,917
Of course Andy believed the doctor

198
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,862
he was very convincing, delivering
the fake news of brain cancer.

199
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:54,133
Brain cancer...

200
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,649
Damn it. If I didn't have cancer,

201
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,550
what the fuck were
they injecting me with?

202
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,319
Any other pressing matters?

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,970
Yes, sir we have an issue, sir.

204
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,041
What now?

205
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,319
Somebody has been stealing money

206
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,458
from our international accounts.

207
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,131
- Stealing?
- Yes, sir.

208
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:21,131
In my house?

209
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,769
Who has got the fucking
balls to steal from me?

210
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,109
Somebody has been stealing
from the online portal.

211
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,469
How much?

212
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,299
2.5 million U.S. dollars.

213
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,549
Get Boris in here now.

214
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,550
Yes, sir.

215
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,729
2.5 million bucks. How do
you steal 2.5 million bucks?

216
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,560
- How's that... ?
- We're gonna find this guy.

217
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:46,885
And break his legs...
he will never walk again.

218
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,279
I hope so.

219
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,629
While we're waiting on Boris.

220
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,780
Are there any other
pressing matters today?

221
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:58,030
Yes... the news
reporter... Rebecca Haines.

222
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,930
She's digging into us, sir.

223
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,660
Who's in the picture?

224
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,899
This car appears to belong
to a private investigator.

225
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,569
Some type of contact we
think is working for the CIA.

226
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,239
Yeah I know, I've put
Sergey on this earlier today.

227
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,489
Excellent I will follow it up, sir.

228
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,889
Very good, Vladimir.

229
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,559
Keep me posted, all right?

230
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,829
Yes.

231
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,719
What account got hacked?

232
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,910
The Hygate fund, Hygate.

233
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:42,369
Okay, I'm gonna get a list of all
clients who've paid into Hygate fund.

234
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,530
And I'm also gonna need to know
how they paid into the account.

235
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,910
Okay, so we have some clients

236
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,369
that pay through the online platform.

237
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,647
Right. That you secured for us...

238
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,678
Is that the only source for you?

239
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,939
Do you remember?

240
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,630
I sure do yeah, I'm gonna need
a list of all dates and times

241
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,573
from the funds went missing.

242
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,879
I'll then cross reference the
list with IP hits on the website.

243
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,820
If he stole once it's
bound to happen again.

244
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,769
I'll also insert a Trojan
to trick the hackers.

245
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,980
The next time he tries to
steal, I'll know his location.

246
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,335
As a matter of fact, he's
trying to steal right now.

247
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:33,136
Okay, I'll have his location soon...

248
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,007
Okay, the IP is tracing back to 4598

249
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,349
South Crenshaw Circle Boston, MA.

250
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,860
Name on the apartment
lease is Roman Ponomarev.

251
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,869
Vladimir send Sergey with
his federal credentials

252
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,829
and bring this person to me ASAP.

253
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,710
Yes, sir, I will call Sergei now.

254
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,340
Sergei 4598 South Crenshaw Circle...

255
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:27,122
Boston, MA...

256
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:29,899
He's a hacker named Roman.

257
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,370
Use your federal
badge, bring him here...

258
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:37,057
Go now...

259
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:38,368
Understood.

260
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,113
Hello, you Roman?

261
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:04,594
Yes, can I help you?

262
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:08,215
I'm Jack Collins... I'm with the FBI

263
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,850
I'm here to escort you to our
field office for a few questions.

264
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,982
I'm not going anywhere...
You have warrant?

265
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,619
I know the law I need a lawyer.

266
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,759
You're coming with me.

267
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,574
I'm not going anywhere.

268
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,905
I thought you were a hacker...

269
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,221
No. I got out of that business.

270
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:22,822
You are coming with me.

271
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:25,113
I'm not going anywhere... Fuck you!

272
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,029
You, I said you're coming with me.

273
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,450
I told you, you're coming with me.

274
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:36,452
Fuck you.

275
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:40,184
- Let's fucking go.
- Motherfucker.

276
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,849
So you're the guy who thinks he can hack

277
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,979
into my systems and steal from my boss?

278
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,119
Wait, wait.

279
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,949
I thought this was government building.

280
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,760
Why does it say Red Star
Communications outside?

281
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,199
You know... I'm a lawyer, right?

282
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,659
Why?

283
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,769
Because I own this place

284
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,250
and I control the
Russian Federation army.

285
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,390
Mr. Jack Collins here,

286
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,779
he's obviously not with
the FBI, he's my mercenary.

287
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,459
I send him out to kill
people, but in your case,

288
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,659
I wanted to chat with the little piece

289
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,769
of shit that stole from me.

290
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,529
Guys, I do not want any trouble.

291
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,879
I will give back what I take.

292
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,029
Wrong, Roman Ponomarev...

293
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,279
Let's see, you were born in Moscow,

294
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,339
arrived in the United States.

295
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,579
What, nine years ago?

296
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,329
See, I take these crimes personally.

297
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,339
Do you know anything about the
Japanese history and culture Roman?

298
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,080
No, I do not know this history.

299
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,009
Well, I do. Vladimir would be so kind

300
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,379
to tell him the story of
Lord Nishiki from the 1800s?

301
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Yes.

302
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,769
There is something in which each

303
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,790
and every young samurai
should pay attention...

304
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,869
During times of peace
while listening to stories

305
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,540
of battle ... one should never say

306
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,639
when facing such a situation.

307
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,310
What should the person do?

308
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,420
Just like our little situation today.

309
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,450
You see such words are out the question.

310
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,479
How does a man who has doubts be

311
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,090
in his own room ... achieve
anything on the battlefield?

312
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,440
There is a saying that goes no matter

313
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:10,886
what the circumstances might be
one should be of the mind to win.

314
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:14,707
One should be holding the
first spear to strike...

315
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,150
Even though you put your
own life on the line.

316
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:23,139
There is nothing to be done.

317
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,170
When the situation
doesn't go as planned.

318
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,982
Do you feel any different
from your injections?

319
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,160
Well, besides your eyes.

320
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:41,215
I feel like a mutant now.

321
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,816
I have a red eye.

322
00:22:42,824 --> 00:22:45,589
Let's get something to eat.

323
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,850
What is it, Andy?

324
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,700
Nothing I had thought I saw something...

325
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,799
It's nothing, I'm just hungry.

326
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,150
Let's get something to eat.

327
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,904
Welcome to Whitney Donut,

328
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,004
we'll be right with you.

329
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,460
Yes. We are ready... I'd like
to have a blueberry muffin

330
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,100
chicken sandwich,
chicken cutlet sandwich,

331
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,790
apple fritter, Roast Beef
sandwich and a root beer...

332
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:34,364
That's 17.42, please pull up...

333
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:36,765
Okay, thank you.

334
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,350
That'll be 17.42.

335
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,510
Die Andy die.

336
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,740
Don't worry Dawn, I'll
get us out of this mess.

337
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,889
Andy what is going on?

338
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,890
I can't tell you.

339
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:15,008
None is supposed to know0

340
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,788
I don't know how they, no
God damn Russians know...

341
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,520
They know my secret.

342
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:20,995
What's your secret?

343
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:24,470
I can't tell you, I can't tell anybody.

344
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,961
It's okay whatever this
is, I'm here for you.

345
00:24:26,962 --> 00:24:29,978
You're gonna be okay.

346
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:32,079
Fucking Russians.

347
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,242
What's happening?

348
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:56,986
Dawn!! Dawn... Dawn where are you?

349
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,191
Answer me.

350
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,478
Dawn!!

351
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,649
Time to die for mother Russia.

352
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,140
No, no, no, Nora no.

353
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,469
No baby, I wouldn't hurt you.

354
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,219
I love you, no.

355
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,669
Hello, hello?

356
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,669
It is 17.42.

357
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,670
Snap out of it.

358
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:39,575
- You're all right?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

359
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,230
Are you okay?

360
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:50,817
There you go.

361
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:54,338
Thank you.

362
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:56,746
Thank you.

363
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,929
So you got the spear, are you gonna
draw first blood, and strike me?

364
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,139
No, I will not.

365
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,209
I'll give you your money back.

366
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,250
This is where you lose.

367
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,750
Looks like I've got the
first spear to strike.

368
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,660
You motherfucker, I will destroy you.

369
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,759
Don't make threats you cannot keep

370
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,180
say another word and
I'll cut out your tongue.

371
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:41,083
You were given a chance you've failed.

372
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,938
Look at his face.

373
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,550
Roman, seeing I am a
businessman and not a killer,

374
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,159
I'm gonna forget your failures

375
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,229
and I'm gonna give you two other
chances to walk out of here.

376
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,910
But this time when I tell
you something, you do it.

377
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,299
Dimitri would you be so kind

378
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,429
as to tell Roman the story
of the 10 blind masseuse?

379
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,510
My pleasure.

380
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,709
Once in the 1800s there was a group

381
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,669
of 10 blind masseuses
traveling along the mountains

382
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,269
and they began to pass
by the top of a precipice.

383
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,179
They became very cautious.

384
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,770
Their legs shook and in general
they were struck with terror.

385
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,479
But then the leading man stumbled

386
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,099
he fall off the top of the cliff.

387
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,280
Those that remain wailed...

388
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,618
Ahhh...

389
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,470
How piteous?

390
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,659
Don't be afraid...

391
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,819
Although I fall, it was for nothing.

392
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,489
I am now much rather
at ease before I fall

393
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,659
I think to myself, what
will I do if I fall?

394
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,490
And there was no end to my anxiety

395
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,729
but now I am much more settled.

396
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,912
What the fuck? Why are these lights off?

397
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:08,609
Vladimir, grab Roman
before he runs for it.

398
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,389
Is this the work of
the federal government?

399
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,779
Are they fucking with me?

400
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,599
Or did I forget to
pay the electric bill?

401
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,510
Duncan shall we use the room
upstairs off the power grid?

402
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,389
Dimitri, stay here with
the Sergeant and Sergey

403
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,109
and find out why these lights are off

404
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,909
call or text me when it's fixed.

405
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,139
Everyone else Let's bring
this piece of shit upstairs.

406
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,290
Vladmir take him
upstairs will follow you.

407
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,619
Let's go, Roman, try anything funny,

408
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,110
and I'll carve you like an
American Thanksgiving turkey.

409
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,690
Don't test me, move.

410
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,460
Ladies follow us up the stairs...

411
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,870
Do you mind?

412
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,909
Okay, Boris, Roman,
here's the challenge.

413
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,230
The closed circuit TV is
fixed on Leonard and Walker.

414
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,329
We're gonna fix on
yesterday at 4:03 p.m.

415
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,189
The first one that can show
me that footage at 4:03 p.m.

416
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,289
within 10 minutes wins.

417
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,290
Fair enough?

418
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:35,966
A piece of cake.

419
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,970
No problem.

420
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,959
But it's not gonna be that easy

421
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,349
while this is going my two
beautiful Russian ladies

422
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,089
Ivankov and Valeryie...

423
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,739
will be throwing Ninja
stars across your line

424
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,429
of vision at the pieces of wood

425
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,660
where they're being held by
Vladimir and Claude there.

426
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,890
And five, four, three, ...

427
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:12,797
two, one go.

428
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
It's done.

429
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,656
Let me see, he's right.

430
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:32,927
Boris has accomplished the task.

431
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,190
Well done, Boris.

432
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Looser.

433
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,300
All right let's see these boards...

434
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:49,245
- Yes, sir.
- Claude, bring it over here.

435
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:52,876
Wow I can't tell the difference.

436
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,509
They're both excellent.

437
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,940
Bunch of center shots, I guess
it's gonna pay both 10 grand.

438
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,440
- Valeryie, great job.
- Thank you.

439
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,330
Ivankov... for you.

440
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,529
Well, the power should be back up again.

441
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,219
Let's move back downstairs.

442
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,069
Vladimir, grab this piece of
shit and bring him downstairs.

443
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,120
Yes, sir.

444
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,180
Don't mess with Dimitri.

445
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,020
Damn the game really is over
now for you, right, Roman?

446
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,689
Boris can you get this
piece of shit accounts,

447
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,999
and get my money now?

448
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,699
Sure, consider it done.

449
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,789
Dmitri, you and Vladimir get the bats

450
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,279
and break this fucking guy's legs

451
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,439
and then throw him
in a taxi and send him

452
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,749
to the nearest hospital.

453
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,750
No please, please...
I get you your money.

454
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,090
Orders are orders.

455
00:31:56,091 --> 00:32:01,091
No, stop that, please stop, I beg.

456
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,170
Orders are orders.

457
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,580
No.

458
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,110
Welcome, Andy.

459
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,741
I think you're kind of early.

460
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:21,459
- Why don't you have a... ?
- Fuck off.

461
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,890
Andy, Andy, what's the matter?

462
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,909
Andy what are you doing here?

463
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,370
- Where's Vladmir?
- Help us get outta here.

464
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:40,154
Natayli, Natayli, get him out now...

465
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,745
What are you doing to these people?

466
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:45,595
Hey, hey.

467
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:49,066
Stop resisting us, you're ours.

468
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,769
Andy I told you not to come down here.

469
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,489
Now you'll have to deal with Valkov.

470
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,459
She's gonna kick your ass.

471
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,110
Andy put your hands in the air.

472
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,953
Fuck off. I am going to the press
and blowing this whole thing open...

473
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,090
Security, can I get
some security down here?

474
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:34,136
So, one of these kids said
she can kill with a spoon...

475
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,797
Yeah, I've heard that.

476
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,739
They're all watching us now,

477
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,749
we must be ready and
prepared for any raid...

478
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,911
I need a volunteer.

479
00:33:44,912 --> 00:33:46,870
- No fucking way.
- I'm up.

480
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:57,950
- Anybody else?
- No fucking way.

481
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:03,327
Duncan why are you shaking your head?

482
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,489
I know you can kick my ass

483
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,993
- but I've got a challenge for you.
- I'm listening.

484
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:18,409
I'll bet you that I can
knock down your Ninja star

485
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,170
before it hits it's target.

486
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,419
Okay, on a count of three we go.

487
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:24,422
Okay.

488
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:32,031
Three, two.

489
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:38,544
There's a lesson to be learned here.

490
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:40,065
Huh?

491
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,230
The element of a surprise is a must.

492
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,598
Real classy, Duncan...

493
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,345
Always one step ahead...

494
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,179
- Hey, enjoy your training.
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,710
Here's the increased dosage.

496
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,289
Andy will soon become disoriented

497
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,590
and think today was all in
his head an hallucination.

498
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:45,761
Good, good.

499
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:26,566
Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy.

500
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:46,630
Andy, Andy...

501
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,262
... Andy?
