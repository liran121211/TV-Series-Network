00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,039
We're down to the wire on fuel cells.

184
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,833
We run hot, we might not even make it.

185
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,376
Okay, play it as close as you can.

186
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,587
This catch is burning a hole in my hull.

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,714
Think that cruiser might've ID'd us?

188
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,632
Let's hope not.

189
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,925
Contact Badger,
tell him the job's done.

190
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,304
Don't go to mentioning
the cruiser, though.

191
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,430
Keep it simple.

192
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,765
Sir, we're sure
there's nothing wrong...

193
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,349
It's fine.

194
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,560
I just want to get paid.

195
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,315
All right, let's get
these crates stowed.

196
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,192
I don't want any tourists
stumbling over them.

197
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,611
We're taking on passengers
at Persephone?

198
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,862
Yeah, t\hat's the notion.

199
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,031
We could use a little respectability
on the way to Boros.

200
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,367
Not to mention
the money.

201
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,494
Pain in the ass.

202
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,870
No, it's shiny.

203
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,288
I like to meet
new people.

204
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,706
They've all got stories.

205
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,292
Captain, can you stop her
from being cheerful, please?

206
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,835
I don't believe that there's
a power in the 'verse

207
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,129
that can stop Kaylee from being cheerful.

208
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,507
Sometimes you just want to duct tape
her mouth and...

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,966
dump her in the hold for a month.

210
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,512
I love my captain.

211
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,641
I know something ain't right.

212
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,100
Sweetie, we're crooks.

213
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,228
If everything were
right we'd be in jail.

214
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,647
It's just that
the captain's so tense.

215
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,191
The man needs a break.

216
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,778
In fact, we could all
use a couple days' leave.

217
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,155
We still got to drop the goods.

218
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,115
And when we do

219
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,451
we'll fly off to Boros,
rich and prosperous.

220
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,161
Well, less poor,

221
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,580
but with enough to find
some sweet little getaway.

222
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,250
Oh, wouldn't mind
a real bath.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,419
Yeah, and a meal that
included some form of food.

224
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,672
Just a couple of days,
lying around.

225
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,423
You with the bathing,

226
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,176
me with the watching
you bathe.

227
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,512
If the captain says
it's all right...

228
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,141
What if we just told Mal
we need a couple of days

229
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,518
instead of asking him?

230
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
He's the captain, Wash.

231
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,939
Right.
I'm just the husband.

232
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,108
Look, I'll ask him.

233
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,486
Don't forget to call him "sir."
He likes that.

234
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,405
MAL:
Who likes what?

235
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,490
It's nothing, sir.

236
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
Has the Ambassador
checked in yet?

237
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,994
WASH: No.

238
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,787
I think she had
a pretty full docket.

239
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,039
Well, after you talk to Badger,
let her know

240
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,416
we may be leaving
Persephone in a hurry.

241
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,459
Inara has our timetable.
She should be checking in.

242
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,879
I can tell her to cut it short,
meet us at the docks.

243
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,007
No, no. Don't want to get
in her way if we don't have to.

244
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,886
Somebody on this boat
has to make an honest living.

245
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,265
(panting)

246
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,310
Oh, my God.

247
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,699
INARA: Sihnon isn't that different
from this planet.

248
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,618
More crowded, obviously

249
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,786
and I guess more complicated.

250
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,788
The great city itself is...

251
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,460
Pictures can't capture it.

252
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,962
It's like an ocean of light.

253
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,256
Is that where you studied...

254
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,508
to be a Companion?

255
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,927
I was born there.

256
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,512
I can't imagine ever leaving.

257
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,223
INARA:
Well, I wanted to see the universe.

258
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,437
Do you really have to leave?

259
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,690
I mean...

260
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,694
I... my father is very influential.

261
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,030
We could... I could arrange

262
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,657
for you to be...

263
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,493
...experience has been more than...

264
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,662
it was very good.
Thank you.

265
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,622
The time went too quickly.

266
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,916
Well, your clock's probably
rigged to speed up

267
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,668
and cheat us out of our fun.

268
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,615
Serenity, this is Shuttle One.
What's your ETA?

269
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,575
Inara, hey.

270
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,578
We're touching down
at the Eavesdown docks

271
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,372
in about ten minutes.

272
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,915
I'll join you there. Thanks.

273
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,084
Looking forward to it.
We missed you out here.

274
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,461
Yeah, me, too.

275
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,476
(indistinct chatter)

276
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,159
♪ ♪

277
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,678
This shouldn't take too long.

278
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,930
Put us down for departure
in about three hours.

279
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,767
Grab any supplies
we're low on, fuel her up.

280
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,560
I'd sure love to find a brand-new

281
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,936
compression coil for the steamer.

282
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,396
Yes, and I'd like to be
the king of all Londinium

283
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,690
and wear a shiny hat.
Just get us some passengers.

284
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,567
Them as can pay, all right?

285
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,527
Compression coil busts were drifting...

286
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,030
Best not bust, then.

287
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,492
Zoe.

288
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,826
(Chinese) Zhu tamin
ya min.

289
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,787
Zhu yi.

290
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,830
We will.

291
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,002
(indistinct conversations)

292
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,650
Going on a trip, grandpa?

293
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,568
Need safe passage?
We're cheap.

294
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,320
We're cheap, we're
clean. The Brutus--

295
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,947
best ship in the 'verse.

296
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,657
What's your des, grandpa? Come on.

297
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,367
We're hitting the outer rings.

298
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,743
I never married.

299
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,412
What?

300
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,249
I'm not a grandpa.

301
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,480
Let me see your teeth.

302
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,068
Yes.

303
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,196
You're late.

304
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
You're lying.

305
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,368
What did you just say to me?

306
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,413
You're well aware we landed
two hours 'fore we planned to,

307
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,332
with all the goods you sent us after,
intact, ready to roll.

308
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,709
So your decision to get tetchy

309
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,877
and say we're late

310
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,004
means you're looking to put us
on the defensive right up front.

311
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,715
Which means something's gone wrong.

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,633
It didn't go wrong on our end,
so why don't we start again

313
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,218
with you telling us what's up?

314
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,762
You're later than I'd like.

315
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,764
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

316
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,684
If you'd gotten here sooner

317
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,686
you might've beaten the bulletin
that came up saying

318
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,856
rogue vessel, classification "Firefly"

319
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,651
was spotted pulling illegal
salvage on a derelict transport.

320
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,487
Didn't ID us.
Doesn't lead to you.

321
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,281
No, it doesn't.

322
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,075
But a government stamp
on every molecule of the cargo

323
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,869
just maybe might.

324
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,289
Oh, you noticed that.

325
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,249
You were gonna hand over
imprinted goods

326
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,626
and just let me twist,
is that the case?

327
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,919
We didn't pick the cargo.

328
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,297
And I didn't flash my ass
at the gorram law.

329
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,924
There's no deal.

330
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,176
That ain't fair.

331
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,345
Crime and politics, little girl.

332
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,473
The situation is always fluid.

333
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,183
Only fluid I see here

334
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,311
is the puddle of piss
refusing to pay us our wage.

335
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,687
(weapons cocking)

336
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,077
It doesn't have to go this way.

337
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,037
You know you can still
unload those goods,

338
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,289
so I can't help thinking there's
something else at work here.

339
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,291
What were you in the war?

340
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,960
That big war you failed to win?

341
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,295
You were a sergeant, yeah?

342
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,881
Sergeant Malcolm Reynolds.

343
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,716
Balls and Bayonets Brigade.

344
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,135
Big, tough veteran.

345
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,973
Now you got yourself a ship
and you're a captain.

346
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,477
Only I think you're
still a sergeant, see?

347
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,729
Still a soldier.

348
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,524
Man of honor in a den of thieves.

349
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,652
Well, this is my gorram den

350
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,197
and I don't like the way
you look down on me.

351
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm above you. Better than.

352
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,577
Businessman, see?

353
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,413
Roots in the community.

354
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,123
You're just a scavenger.

355
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,837
Well, maybe I'm not
a fancy gentleman

356
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,547
like you, with your...

357
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,091
very fine hat,

358
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,927
but I do business.

359
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,847
We're here for business.

360
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,640
Try one of the border planets.

361
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,100
They're a lot more
desperate there.

362
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,810
Of course

363
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,563
they might kill you,
but you stay here

364
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,024
and I just know the Alliance
will track you down.

365
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,068
I have that feeling.

366
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,281
Wheel never
stops turning, Badger.

367
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,533
That only matters
to the people on the rim.

368
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,591
You're gonna come with us.

369
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,634
Excuse me?

370
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,553
You like ships.

371
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,139
You don't seem to be looking
at the destinations.

372
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,600
What you care about is the ships and

373
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,435
mine's the nicest.

374
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,271
She don't look like much.

375
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,939
Well, she'll fool you.

376
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,693
You ever sail in a Firefly?

377
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,653
Long before you were crawling.

378
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,324
Not a nought-three, though.
Didn't have the extenders,

379
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,658
tended to shake.

380
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,621
So, uh,

381
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,248
how come you don't
care where you're going?

382
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,293
'Cause how you get there
is the worthier part.

383
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,546
Are you a missionary?

384
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,341
I guess.

385
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,052
I'm a Shepherd
from the Southdown Abbey.

386
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,345
Book.

387
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,430
I'm called Book.

388
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,891
Been out of the world for a spell.

389
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,351
Like to walk it a while,

390
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,269
maybe bring the Word
to them as need it told.

391
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,897
Well, I'm Kaylee.

392
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,482
And this here's Serenity.

393
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,692
And she's the smoothest ride
from here to Boros

394
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,944
for anyone can pay.

395
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,405
Can you pay, or...

396
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,409
Well, I got a little cash and, uh...

397
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,125
Ooh, grandpa.

398
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,711
I never married.

399
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,674
I don't understand why we didn't
leave that son of a bitch

400
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,758
in a pool of his own blood.

401
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,344
We'd be dead.
Can't get paid if you're dead.

402
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,055
Can't get paid if you crawl away
like a bitty little bug, neither.

403
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,432
I got a share in this job.

404
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,766
Ten percent of nothing is--

405
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,268
let me do the math here--

406
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,894
nothing into nothing,

407
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,813
carry the nothing...
So we find a buyer on Boros.

408
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,064
There's got to be...
Boros is too big.

409
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,275
It's crawling with Alliance.
They could just be waiting for us.

410
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,569
You really think Badger'll
sell us out to the Feds?

411
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,736
If he hasn't already.

412
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,615
Alliance catches us
with government goods,

413
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,700
we'll lose the ship.

414
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,034
That's never gonna happen.

415
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,287
Sir, we could just dump the cargo.

416
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,371
JAYNE:
No rutting way.

417
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,789
We ain't had a job in weeks.

418
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,417
I didn't sign on with this crew
to take in the sights.

419
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,626
We need coin.
Jayne.

420
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,462
Your mouth is talking.
You might want to look to that.

421
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,838
I'm ready to stop talking...

422
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,047
You're right, though.

423
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,258
Last two jobs we
had were weak tea.

424
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,635
We got nothing saved
and taking on passengers

425
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,803
won't help near enough.

426
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,514
We don't get paid for this cargo,

427
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,183
we don't have enough money
to fuel the ship,

428
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,894
let alone keep her in repair.

429
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,353
She'll be dead in the water.

430
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,065
So we do like Badger said--
the border planets?

431
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,026
I'm thinking Whitefall,
maybe talk to Patience.

432
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,944
Sir, we don't want to deal
with Patience again.

433
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,571
Why not?
She shot you.

434
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,156
Well, yeah, she did a bit.
Still...

435
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,241
So we find somebody else.
Horowitz.

436
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,702
He can't afford it.
Holden boys.

437
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,787
They wouldn't touch it.
You want me to go through the list?

438
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,956
Capshaws are brain-blown.
Gruviek's dead.

439
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,708
He's dead?

440
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,959
Town got hit by Reavers.

441
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,127
Burned it right down.

442
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,087
I ain't going anywhere
near Reaver territory.

443
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,590
Them people ain't human.
Whitefall is the safest

444
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,966
and the closest.

445
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,344
Been a long time
since Patience shot me

446
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,721
and that was due to a perfectly
legitimate conflict of interest.

447
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,139
I got no grudge.

448
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,016
She owns half
that damn moon now.

449
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,851
She can afford what we got
and she might just need it.

450
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,062
I still don't think
the old lady's the way.

451
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,314
MAL:
I'm not saying it won't be tricky,

452
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,274
but we got no kind of choice.

453
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,611
Welcome aboard,
Mr...

454
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,737
Dobson.
Dobson.

455
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,490
Got to keep our heads down,
do the job,

456
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,325
pray there ain't no more surprises.

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,961
Please be careful with that.

458
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,296
Mal, this is Simon.

459
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,923
Simon, this is our captain.

460
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,634
Captain Reynolds.

461
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,928
Welcome aboard.

462
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,764
That's all we got?

463
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,154
Now we have a boatload of citizens

464
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,491
right on top of our stolen cargo.

465
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,910
That's a fun mix.

466
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,413
Ain't no way in the 'verse they
could find that compartment.

467
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,956
Even if...

468
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,667
Even if they were looking for it.

469
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,669
Why not?

470
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,007
'Cause.

471
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,968
Ah, yeah.
This is gonna go great.

472
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,553
If anyone gets nosy, you know,

473
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,763
just... shoot 'em.

474
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,889
Shoot 'em?

475
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,975
Politely.

476
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,525
WASH:
Inara, just in time.

477
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,360
Let me guess.
We're in a hurry?

478
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,778
Looks like.

479
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,655
Starboard hatch green
for docking.

480
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,868
Locked in five, four...

481
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,627
WASH:
The Ambassador has returned.

482
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,467
We got a full house, Captain.

483
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,219
Kaylee, I'm locking it up.

484
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,099
All aboard.

485
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,992
♪ ♪

486
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,706
MAL: Meals are taken up here
in the dining area.

487
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,750
Kitchen's pretty much
self-explanatory.

488
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,210
You're welcome to eat
what there is anytime.

489
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,295
What there is is
pretty standard fare, I guess.

490
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,922
Protein in all the colors of the rainbow.

491
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,757
We do have sit-down meals

492
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,258
next one being at about 1800.

493
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,887
I think Shepherd Book has offered
to help me prepare something.

494
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,806
You're a shepherd?

495
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,432
Thought the outfit gave it away.

496
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,060
Is it a problem?

497
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,520
Of course not.

498
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,021
It's no problem

499
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,606
'cause it's not.

500
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
No.

501
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,652
As I said,

502
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,654
you're welcome to visit
the dining area anytime.

503
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,823
Apart from that I have to ask you
to stay in the passenger dorm

504
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,074
while we're in the air.

505
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,077
The bridge, engine room, cargo bay

506
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,578
they're all off-limits without an escort.

507
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,164
Some of my personal effects
are in the cargo bay.

508
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,625
I figure you all got luggage
you're gonna need to get into.

509
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,460
As soon as we're done here
we'll be happy to fetch them with you.

510
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,423
Now I have to tell you all one other thing

511
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,550
and I apologize in advance
for the inconvenience.

512
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,885
Unfortunately, we've been
ordered by the Alliance

513
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,263
to drop some medical supplies
off on Whitefall.

514
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,014
It's the fourth moon on Athens.

515
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,433
It's a little out of our way

516
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,352
but we should have you on Boros
no more than a day off schedule.

517
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,104
What medical supplies?

518
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,065
I honestly didn't ask.

519
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,901
Probably plasma, insulin.

520
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,738
Whatever they ain't got enough of
on the border moons.

521
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,573
Alliance says jump.

522
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,408
All right.

523
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,659
Zoe, you want to take them
to the cargo bay?

524
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,119
Yes, sir.

525
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,080
Anything else you need, just ask.

526
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,207
We, uh, live to serve.

527
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,586
Did you send word to Patience?

528
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,795
Ain't heard back yet.

529
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,589
Didn't she shoot you one time?

530
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,175
Everybody's making a fuss.

531
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,681
Oops, I'm sorry.

532
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,034
Thank you.

533
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,161
(gasps)

534
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,711
Ah, the Ambassador graces us
with her presence.

535
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,922
Hello, Mal.

536
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,882

Not gonna happen.

Stay with me.
Can you move your feet?

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,299
Are you asking me to dance?

Yeah, we got it stocked.

Captain, we've been hailed by a Cruiser.

Run.
Hell with you.

737
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,455
You brought this down on us.
I'm dumping you with the law.

She's dying.

739
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,292
You're not gonna let her.
Yes, I am.

740
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,335
No, you can't.

741
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,545
No way the Feds'll let us walk.

742
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,380
Then we dump him in the shuttle

It's okay, baby.

wound does to a person?

745
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,677
I surely do.
Then you know how crucial

the next few minutes are.

747
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,096
You let her die,

748
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,305
you'll never make it to the Feds.

749
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,641

835
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,541
I mean, she used to...

836
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,842
There was, uh, a school--

837
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,553
a, uh... a government-
sponsored academy.

838
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,929
We had never even heard of it,

839
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,015
but it had
the most exciting program.

840
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,100
The most
challenging.

841
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,727
We could have
sent her anywhere.

842
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,978

money, but...

843
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,397
she wanted to go.

844
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,609
She wanted to learn.

845
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,986
She was 14.

00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,160
I...

847
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,204

848
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,415
and then I didn't
hear for months.

849
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,543
Finally, I got a letter
that made no sense.

850
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,379
She... she talked about things
that never happened--

851
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,340
jokes that-that we never...

852
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,926

00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,534
For two years, I
couldn't get near her.

860
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,662
Then I was contacted
by some men--

861
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,913
some underground movement.

862
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,499
They-they said
that she was in danger, that...

863
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,460
that the government was...

864
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,380
playing with her brain.

865
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,092
If I funded them
they could sneak her out in cryo,

866
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,218
get her to Persephone,

867
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,886
and from there,
I could take her...

868
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:29,930
wherever.

869
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,807
Will she be all right?

870
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,600
I don't know if she'll be all right.

871
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,018
I don't know
what they did to her.

872
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,938
Or why.

873
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,731
I...

874
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,234
<i>I just have to keep her safe.</i>

875
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,906
That's... quite a story, son.

876
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,242
Yeah, it's a tale of woe.
Very stirring,

877
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,368
but in the meantime,

878
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,078
you've heaped a world of trouble
on me and mine.

879
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,330
I never thought...
No, I don't imagine you thought.

880
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,042
In consequence of which we got a
kidnapped Federal officer on board,

881
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,711
we got the Alliance
hard on our trail,

882
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,920
and Kaylee...

883
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,255
How much does the Alliance know?

884
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,382
I can't say.
I killed the message pretty quick,

885
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,050
so they may
just have had our position.

886
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,468
Or they might have
personal profiles

887
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,761
on each and
every one of us.

888
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,430
Till that Fed wakes up,
we won't know.

889
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,223
So what do we do?

890
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,854
The job.

891
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,647
We finish the job.
I got word from Patience,

892
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,815

893
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,150
We circle round to
Whitefall,

00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,152
make the deal, get out.

895
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,195
Keep flying.

896
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,282
What about us?

897
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,329
Kaylee comes through,
you and your sister get off at Whitefall.

898
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,332
And if she doesn't come through?

899
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,792
Then you're getting off
a mite sooner.

900
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,086
That'd be murder.
Boy made a decision.

901
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,797
He didn't shoot her.
No, but somebody else on this boat did

902
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,133
and I'm scratching my head as to
why we ain't dealt with him.

903
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,301
ZOE:
Kill a Fed?

904
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,969
Can you think of a stupider thing to do?
He can ID us all.

905
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,846
You want to throw me
out the airlock, fine,

906
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,222
but River is not a part of this.

907
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,600
Can we maybe vote on the whole
murdering people issue?

908
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,101
We don't vote on my ship,

909
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,561
because my ship is not
the rutting town hall.

910
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,229
This is insanity.
I happen to think we're a ways

911
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,315
beyond that now,<i> sir.</i>

912
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,858
Come on, we're gonna
talk this through, yeah?

913
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,943
I'll not sit by while
there's killing here.

914
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,069
JAYNE: Captain's got a mean streak

915
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,154
you best watch yourself...
(speaking Chinese): <i> Nimen de bizui!</i>

916
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,450
The way it is is the way it is.

917
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,578
We got to deal
with what's in front of us.

918
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,291
Mal, you know those two wouldn't survive
a day in Whitefall anyway.

919
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,048
You throw them out,
I'm leaving, too.

920
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,263
It might be best you do.

921
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,683
You ain't a part
of this business.

922
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,318
What business
is that, exactly?

923
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,447
I'm a dead man.
I can't know?

924
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,574
Is it gold?

925
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,535
Drugs?

926
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,245
Pirate treasure?

927
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,915
What is it that makes you
so afraid of the Alliance?

928
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,418
You don't want to go
down this road with me, boy.

929
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,337
Oh, you're not afraid
of them?

930
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,924
Well, I already know you'd sell me out
to them for a pat on the head.

931
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,175
Hell, you should probably
be working for them--

932
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,343
you certainly fit
the prof...

933
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,895
Saw that coming.

934
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,408
Now, I'm in a tricky position.

935
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,744
I guess you know.

936
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,663
Got me a boatload
of terribly strange folk

937
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,540
making my life
a little more interesting

938
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,958
than I generally like.

939
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,003
Chief among them,
an Alliance mole.

940
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,213
Likes to shoot at girls
when he's nervous.

941
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,176
Now, I got to know
how close the Alliance is--

942
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,469
exactly how much

943
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,555
you told them before
Wash scrambled your call.

944
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,517
So, I've given Jayne here

945
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,227
the job of finding out.

946
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,481
He was not
specific as to how.

947
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,692
(whispers): Now, you're only
gonna scare him.

948
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,779
Pain is scary.
Just do it right.

949
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,870
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

950
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,039
Gee, I never been in trouble
with the law before.

951
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,415
No, not like this, you haven't.

952
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,375
You think this
is just a smuggling rap?

953
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,753
The package
that boy is carrying...

954
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,255
It's a girl.
She's cute, too.

955
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,508
'Cept I don't think
she's all there, you know?

956
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,260
Course, not all
of her has to be.

957
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,887
That girl
is a precious commodity.

958
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,889
They'll come
after her.

959
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,558
Long after you bury me,
they'll be coming.

960
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,893
Oh...
(chuckles)

961
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,978
I'm not gonna
kill you, Dobson.

962
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,856
What's your first name?

963
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,568
Laurence.

964
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,738
Laurence. No, I'm just
gonna cut on you

965
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,989
till you tell me
how much they know.

966
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,200
They know everything. They know
every name, every record.

967
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,036
They know how many...
nose hairs you've got.

968
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,333
Ah, see, now, they don't
know a damn thing.

969
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,920
It's all over your face,
I ain't even...

970
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,673
I was gonna get me a ear, too.

971
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,383
Aren't you an
officer of the law?

972
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,885
Well, don't they teach you
how to withstand interrogation?

973
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,971
You can't even
tell a damn lie.

974
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,349
Okay. I can see
you're not an idiot.

975
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,309
Wish I could say the same,
Laurence, but...

976
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,311
this is disappointing as hell.

977
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,272
Let me speak a language
you<i> will </i>understand.

978
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,732
Money.

979
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,652
This girl is worth a lot of money.
I mean, a lot.

980
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,113
Now, you kill me,
there's nothing.

981
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,031
But...

982
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,825
if you help me out...

983
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,078
you'll have enough
to buy your own ship.

984
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,248
A better one
than this piece of crap.

985
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,297
Does helping you out
mean turning on the Captain?

986
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,050
Yes, it does.

987
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,386
How the hell'd they find us?

988
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,512
I thought you said
we could get around them.

989
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,097
It's not Alliance.
You sure?

990
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,724
Yeah, it's a
smaller vessel.

991
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,185
Commercial?
Uh, yeah.

992
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,646
I read it
as an older model Trans-U.

993
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,023
I didn't think
Trans-U's still operated.

994
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,357
They don't.

995
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,817
Give me a visual.

996
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,694
They're still too far out to...
Get me something.

997
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,241
I'm picking up
a lot of radiation.

998
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,204
They're operating without
core containment.

999
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,664
That's... (speaks Chinese)

1000
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,625
That's suicide.

1001
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,344
Reavers.

1002
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,817
Oh, my God.

1003
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,321
Oh, God, oh, God.

1004
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,161
MAL (over intercom):
<i>This is the captain.</i>

1005
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,164
<i>We're passing another ship.</i>

1006
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,292
<i>Looks to be Reavers.</i>

1007
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,670
<i>From the size,</i>
<i>probably a raiding party.</i>

1008
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,756
It could be they're headed
somewhere particular.

1009
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,884
<i>Could be they already hit</i>
<i>someone and they're full up,</i>

1010
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,470
<i>so everyone stay calm.</i>

1011
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,766
<i>We try to run, they'll have</i>
<i>to chase us-- it's their way.</i>

1012
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,060
We're holding course.

1013
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,479
We should be passing
them in a minute.

1014
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,564
So we'll see
what they do.

1015
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,404
Zoe, you come on up
to the bridge.

1016
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,241
Wait, I-I don't
understand.

1017
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,034
You never
heard of Reavers?

1018
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,828
Well, campfire stories of

1019
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,580
men gone savage on the edge
of space, killing...

1020
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,957
They're not stories.

1021
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,335
What happens if they board us?

1022
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,838
If they take the ship,

1023
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,840
they'll rape us to death,
eat our flesh,

1024
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,675
and sew our skins
into their clothing.

1025
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,470
And if we're very, very lucky,
they'll do it in that order.

1026
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,062
(exhales heavily)

1027
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,162
There's a magnetic grappler.
They get ahold of us

1028
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,081
with that...
Just tell me if they alter course.

1029
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,811
They're holding course.

1030
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,729
(sighs)

1031
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,564
I guess
they weren't hungry.

1032
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,442
Didn't expect to see them here.

1033
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,653
They're pushing out
further every year, too.

1034
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,738
Getting awful crowded in my sky.

1035
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,872
KAYLEE:
Hey, Captain.

1036
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,166
Hey.

1037
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,211
Hey, little Kaylee,
what's the news?

1038
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,506
I'm... shiny... Captain.

1039
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,924
A-okay.

1040
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:14,139
And I can't feel much
below my belly, though.

1041
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,601
It's getting cold.

1042
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,063
Well, you just got to rest.

1043
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,609
Something's gonna break down
on this boat real soon.

1044
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,611
Who else I got to fix it?

1045
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,655
Well, don't you
worry none.

1046
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,575
Doc fixed me up pretty.

1047
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,953
He's nice.

1048
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,706
Don't go working too hard

1049
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,708
(mixed Chinese/English):
on that crush,<i> xiao meimei.</i>

1050
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,169
Doc won't be with us for long.

1051
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,714
You're nice, too.

1052
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,591
No, I'm not.

1053
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,843
I'm a mean old man.

1054
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,972
He wasn't gonna let me die.

1055
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,392
He was just trying...

1056
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,149
It's nobody's fault.

1057
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,693
Okay? Just
promise me

1058
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,361
you'll remember that.

1059
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,283
I'll keep it in mind.

1060
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:19,245
You are a nice man, Captain.

1061
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,458
You always looking after us.

1062
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,836
You just
got to have

1063
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,130
faith in people.

1064
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:41,309
Ah, she is a real

01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,004
MAL:
Then east half a mile,

1237
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,548
bottom of the first hill,
you'll see where it's been dug.

1238
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,135
I reckon I will.

1239
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,972
Well, then.

1240
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,766
Yup.

1241
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,358
I'd appreciate it

1242
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,152
if y'all turn around and ride out first.

1243
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,364
Well, you see, there's
a kind of hitch.

1244
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,577
We both made out on this deal.
Don't complicate things.

1245
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,912
I got a rule:

1246
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,165
I never let go of money
I don't have to.

1247
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,210
Which is maybe why I'm
running this little world

1248
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,253
and you're still
on that dinky old boat,

1249
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,047
sniffing for scraps.

1250
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,225
Got the money back.

1251
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,726
There's no need
for killing.

1252
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:32,186
We're just gonna
walk away, sir?

1253
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,771
Guess that's up
to Patience here.

1254
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,606
Could be messy.

1255
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:36,899
Not terribly.

1256
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,444
(chuckling): Mal, you just
ain't very bright, are you?

1257
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,072
That's quite a rifle.

1258
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,699
Boy must be your best shot
to carry that.

1259
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,159
PATIENCE:
He's called Two-Fry.

1260
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,787
Always makes it
quick and clean.

1261
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,705
Two-Fry.

1262
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,791
Nice hat.

1263
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,462
(men shouting)

1264
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,218
You should think
about asking the captain

1265
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,594
to drop you somewhere else.

1266
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,805
Whitefall ain't exactly
civilization,

1267
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,181
in the strictest sense.

1268
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,892
You don't have to
worry about me.

1269
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,646
Oh, Zoe's out on a deal,
I always worry.

1270
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,024
So, it's not out of my way.

1271
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,193
KAYLEE:<i> He took her.</i>

1272
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,362
He took River.

1273
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,199
(beeping)

1274
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,578
Oh, don't.

1275
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,080
Don't you dare.

1276
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,918
MAN:
Watch behind you!

1277
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,545
(grunts)

1278
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,546
(shouting)

1279
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,473
(whirring)

1280
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,104
(grunts)

1281
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:05,779
(speaking Chinese):
<i>Hun dan!</i>

1282
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:07,740
(shouting)

1283
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,494
Watch yourself! Go!

1284
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:13,662
Hyah!

1285
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,997
(grunts)

1286
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,710
(grunts)

1287
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:23,589
(screams)

1288
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,924
Zoe?
(groans)

1289
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,218
Armor's dented.

1290
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,928
Well, you were right
about this being a bad idea.

1291
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,055
Thanks for saying, sir.

1292
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,765
Mal, don't you take another step!

1293
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,769
(neighs)

1294
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,027
Now, I did a job.

1295
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,653
I got nothing but trouble
since I did it,

1296
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,489
not to mention
more than a few unkind words

1297
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:51,575
as regard to my character,
so let me make this abundantly clear.

1298
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,078
I do the job...

1299
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,123
and then I get paid.

1300
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,753
Go run your little world.

1301
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,547
JAYNE:
Mal!

1302
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:06,840
It's Wash!

1303
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,300
We got a ship coming in!

1304
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,676
They followed us!

1305
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,637
The gorram Reavers followed us!

1306
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,609
(grunting)

1307
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,706
No, don't!

1308
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,083
Don't move.

1309
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,251
WASH:
<i>Reavers!</i>

1310
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:43,502
<i>Reavers incoming</i>

1311
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,170
and headed straight for us.

1312
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:47,798
<i>We are in the air</i>
<i>in one minute.</i>

1313
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,843
I guess they got hungry again.

1314
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,596
You gonna do that?

1315
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,974
You gonna kill a lawman
in cold blood?

1316
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,059
I know what you did
for your sister.

1317
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,769
I understand-- it doesn't
make you a killer.

1318
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,773
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

1319
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,484
I have a job
to do.

1320
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,570
To uphold the law-- that's
what we're talking about here.

1321
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,290
Come on, come on.

1322
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,125
Where the hell are you guys?!

1323
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,603
There's nowhere you can take her
the law won't find.

1324
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,106
Nobody is going
to hurt her.

1325
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,234
Unless you hurt me.
No, I said!

1326
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,278
I said don't-don't move.

1327
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,492
It's your call.

1328
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,219
I'm not playing anymore.

1329
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,721
Anybody makes so much...
(gunshot)

1330
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,316
MAL:
Jayne.

1331
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:37,866
Wash, we're on.

1332
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,952
(whimpering)

1333
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,513
How close are they?

1334
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,140
About 20 seconds
from spitting distance.

1335
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,767
Well, lose 'em.
Give me rear vid.

1336
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,521
ZOE:
(Chinese):<i> Ai ya.</i>

1337
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:08,897
<i>(chinese): Women wanle.</i>

1338
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:10,524
How close they need to be
to fire those grapples?

1339
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:11,984
JAYNE: Come on, Wash,
you dumbass, dodge 'em.

1340
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,069
If everyone could just
be quiet a moment...

1341
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,826
I need Kaylee
in the engine room, please.

1342
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,119
ZOE: Can she even---
Get her in there now.

1343
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,750
I want you to get
in your shuttle.

1344
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:29,918
Get the civilians
and be ready to go.

1345
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,295
We can't just
leave you here.

1346
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:32,504
I thought
that was the plan.

1347
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,922
Mal, don't do this.
We get boarded,

1348
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,591
you take off,
head for town.

1349
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,175
We might be able to stop them
from following you.

1350
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,011
They'll kill you.
Inara...

1351
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,391
go.

1352
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,856
How we doing?

1353
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,608
I don't mean to alarm anybody...

1354
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:54,860
but I think...

1355
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,653
we're being followed.

1356
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:07,539
You three
come with me.

1357
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,499
I think I can
help Kaylee out.

1358
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,792
Should I...
Take her.

1359
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,294
Keep her safe.

1360
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,391
Can't keep this up.
They get a bead,

1361
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,559
they're gonna
lock us down.

1362
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,770
Kaylee, how we doing?

1363
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,355
We're gonna need
a little push here.

1364
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,774
You want me to go for full burn?

1365
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,275
Not just yet.

1366
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,401
But set it up.

1367
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,570
You know where
the press regulator is?

1368
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,494
Head of the class.

1369
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,746
(coughing)

1370
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,084
<i>We're ready for full burn</i>
<i>on your mark.</i>

1371
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,503
Full burn in atmo? That won't
cause a blowback, burn us out?

1372
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,630
Even if it doesn't they can push
just as hard, keep right on us.

1373
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:00,467
Wash...

1374
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,719
you got to give me an Ivan.

1375
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,554
I'll see what I can do.

1376
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,139
Kaylee,

1377
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,600
how would you feel about
pulling a crazy Ivan?

1378
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,644
Always wanted to try one.

1379
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,814
Jayne, open the port
jet control.

1380
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,315
Cut the hydraulics.

1381
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,776
Where the hell is---
Look, look,

1382
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,152
Look where I'm pointing.

1383
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,240
Okay.

1384
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,909
Now, it's real simple.

1385
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,670
They're on us.
Kaylee.

1386
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:43,343
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1387
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,888
KAYLEE:
<i>Okay.</i>

1388
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,348
Everybody hold on to something.

1389
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,893
Here's something you can't do.

1390
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:02,571
Now!

1391
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:03,697
(grunting)

1392
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,595
I knew I hired you
for something.

1393
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:29,681
(whoops)

1394
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,143
(whooping continuing)

1395
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:37,355
Ain't no way they can
come around in time to follow us now.

1396
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,111
We're good, people.

1397
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,198
<i>We're out of the woods.</i>

1398
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,701
(whoops)
Yeah!

1399
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,412
That's my girl.

1400
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,873
That's my good girl.

1401
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:01,171
We should have just enough left
in us to hit a fuel station.

1402
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,507
We'll need to do
some patching up.

1403
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,092
I hope we got paid today.

1404
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,219
We did.

1405
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,180
ZOE: Sir?
I'd like you to take the helm, please.

1406
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,933
I need this man
to tear all my clothes off.

1407
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,312
Work, work, work...

1408
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,649
(sighs)

1409
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,211
You should really have the
young doctor look at this.

1410
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,046
It's not so bad.

1411
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:44,965
Well, I'm sure
you'll be fine.

1412
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,467
I didn't say that.

1413
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,391
Is this what life is...

1414
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,017
out here?

1415
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:59,187
Sometimes.

1416
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,315
I've been out
of the abbey two days.

1417
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,236
I've beaten a lawman senseless,

1418
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,989
fallen in with criminals.

1419
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,660
I've watched the captain shoot
the man I swore to protect.

1420
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:19,457
And I'm not even sure
if I think he was wrong.

1421
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,251
Shepherd...

1422
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:22,919
I believe I just...

1423
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,844
I think I'm on the wrong ship.

1424
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:34,723
Maybe.

1425
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,854
Or maybe
you're exactly where you ought to be.

1426
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:05,128
The shot I gave you
will help you sleep.

1427
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,297
I slept for so long.

1428
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,883
Just a little while.

1429
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,010
And then we'll find a place.

1430
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,221
We'll find a safe place.

1431
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:29,235
I didn't think
you'd come for me.

1432
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,825
Well, you're a dummy.

1433
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,878
JAYNE:
<i>The girl's a problem.</i>

1434
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,382
The lawman said they'd
keep looking for her.

1435
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,134
Something about her brain
being all special.

1436
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,303
Important to the
Alliance brass.

1437
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:57,931
Sooner we dump them two,
the better.

1438
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:00,058
I suppose so.

1439
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,936
Funny how the lawman
got out of his room.

1440
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:04,688
You having tied him
up so well and all.

1441
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,816
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

1442
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:10,735
Anyhow, it all
turned out just fine.

1443
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,655
Buzzards are the only ones
that are gonna find him.

1444
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,658
But he did try
to make a deal with you, right?

1445
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,832
How come you didn't
turn on me, Jayne?

1446
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,252
Money wasn't good enough.

1447
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:29,713
What happens when it is?

1448
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:32,632
Well...

1449
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,676
that'll be an interesting day.

1450
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,305
Imagine it will.

1451
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,112
You need me
to look at that?

1452
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,073
Just a graze.

1453
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:05,081
So, where do you plan
on dumping us?

1454
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:07,667
There's places
you might be safe.

1455
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,462
You want the truth, though,
you're probably safer on the move.

1456
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,256
And we never stop moving.

1457
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:16,134
I'm confused.

1458
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,263
No, wait. I...
I think maybe<i> you're </i>confused.

1459
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,433
It may have become
apparent to you that

1460
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:24,851
the ship could use a medic.

1461
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,312
You ain't weak.

1462
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:29,647
Don't know how bright you are
top three percent, but...

1463
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,067
you ain't weak,
and that's not nothing.

1464
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,319
You live by my rule,

1465
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,904
you keep your sister
from doing anything crazy,

1466
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,199
you could maybe
find a place here.

1467
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,701
Till you find a better.

1468
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:48,041
Uh... I'm trying to put this
as delicately as I can.

1469
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:53,713
How do I know you won't
kill me in my sleep?

1470
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,300
You don't know me, son, so

1471
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:59,010
let me explain this
to you once.

1472
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,055
If I ever kill you,
you'll be awake,

1473
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:03,932
you'll be facing me

1474
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,100
and you'll be armed.

1475
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,020
Are you always this sentimental?

1476
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,982
Had a good day.

1477
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:15,401
You had
the Alliance on you--

1478
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,987
criminals and savages.

1479
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,783
Half the people on the ship
have been shot or wounded,

1480
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,284
including yourself.

1481
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,912
And you're harboring
known fugitives.

1482
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,164
We're still flying.

1483
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:30,458
That's not much.

1484
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,836
It's enough.

1485
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:36,065
Grr. Argh.

1486
